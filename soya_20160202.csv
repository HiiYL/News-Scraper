Rory Lee,The iPad Pro outsold Microsoft’s entire Surface lineup in Q4 of 2015,,"Android Tablet,apple,apple ipad pro,IDC,International data corporation,iOS tablet,iPad,iPad Pro,microsoft,Microsoft Surface,Microsoft Surface Pro,Surface,Surface Pro,Tablet,tablet sales,Windows tablet","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-02-02,"Ah, tablets. If a tablet was one of the characters in my sappy rom-com, it’d be the ‘one that got away’. To me, it was a novel idea where you could have your smartphone with you for the serious business stuff while your tablet showed you a good time between working hours — literally, with videos and movies or a good book — but when you actually think about it, the tablet simply isn’t practical.If you take a look at the International Data Corporation’s (IDC) latest report on their preliminary data from the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker, you’ll find the truth in my words as tablet sales are on a downward trajectory. That’s not to say it’s all doom and gloom though as their report also says that detachable tablet sales have reached an all-time high — lead by the sales of none other than the .Spearheading the detachable (or convertible/2-in-1) pack to finish at 8.1 million devices sold in Q4 of 2015 is Apple’s biggest iPad, the Pro, raking in just over 2 million units sold — more than Microsoft’s entire  lineup put together. That’s quite surprising if you ask me because we think that the Surface, especially the  is a  that can easily replace your laptop, at least for productivity anyway.On the other hand, if you look at reviews online, the iPad Pro is nothing more than a ginormous  with a flimsy looking rubber keyboard that has the word “Smart” in its name. Uh oh, am I “bashing” Apple again? Oops.I guess I was wrong then if we’re going off sales figures because Microsoft only sold about 1.6 million Surface devices in the same quarter. That’s a gigantic gap especially if you consider how many Surface devices there are on the market versus the lone iPad Pro. Quite a feat then but it’s worth noting that this is only one quarter and we’ll have to see if the iPad Pro can keep this up over the coming quarters.We can definitely see the appeal of a 2-in-1 because it brings the power of the laptop into the form-factor of a tablet. The emphasis is on power though as IDC’s findings reveal that of the Surface devices sold, more of them are of the pricier and more powerful Surface Pro line, as opposed to a more affordable Surface 3.That said, Microsoft wasn’t the biggest loser in the last quarter because that title belongs to Google. According to the IDC, Google’s recent stab at staking a claim in the convertible market was rather lackluster and that it “will require a lot more refinement to achieve any measurable success”.Oh dear. Google better get cracking on that  if they want to carve a slice out of this market.Rounding up the report though is the sad news of the “slate” tablet’s slow demise as the entire tablet sales dropped 10.1%, from 230.1 million to 206.8 million devices. The way we see it, the problem with the slate tablet is that they’re neither here nor there.Unless you’re picking up one of Apple’s iPads (they’re leading the sales by the way at 16.1 million units shipped — 7.1 million more than the second-placed Samsung) which do offer some tablet optimisations, you’re usually stuck with either an unoptimised Android tablet or a buggy Windows tablet.Amazon’s USD50 (around RM210) Fire tablet, which runs on their own Fire OS, did come in at a surprising third place — accounting for 7.9% of the market share, beating out the likes of Lenovo and Huawei. Though IDC does note that Amazon’s success is purely based on the price of its tablet.Trying times for the tablet industry it seems, though, there is some hope in the convertible market, it looks like the slate tablet is slowly dying off.[, ]"

There are 2 variants available, with the base model getting 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Meanwhile, the higher spec model offers 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The front gets the same 5.5″ Full HD display and it also runs on a MediaTek Helio X10 processor. For photography, the cameras are carried over from its predecessor with a 13MP main camera and a front-facing 5MP unit. The battery isn’t removable but it gets a generous 4,000mAh capacity built-in. Like most Xiaomi smartphones, this is a dual-SIM device with 4G LTE but unfortunately, it lacks a microSD expansion slot. In China, the Redmi Note 3 is priced from 899 CNY (about RM569) to 1099 CNY (about RM695). For those who can’t wait, a couple of retailers are  grey import units from RM699. So far we have no visibility of its local launch but we reckon it is likely to be after Chinese New Year.

Rory Lee,Celcom is one upping Digi and U Mobile with their most competitive postpaid plan yet,,"Celcom,Celcom FIRST Gold,Celcom FIRST Gold promo,Celcom Postpaid,Celcom Postpaid Plan,Celcom WiFi,Celcom WiFi plus,FIRST Gold,FIRST Gold promo,Players on the Field,postpaid plan","Celcom,Industry in General,Players on the Field,Promotions",2016-02-02,"As the telco war rages on,  has revised their  plan in a bid to make their plans more competitive. This new FIRST Gold plan offers users 10GB of mobile Internet + 5GB of WiFi and unlimited free calls and SMS for only RM80 a month.This new FIRST Gold plan is a bump up from the , offering users 10GB of mobile Internet that is split between 5GB of mobile data and 5GB of weekend data (1.25GB for every weekend) + 5GB of WiFi, compared to the existing plan’s 8GB mobile Internet (4GB mobile data + 4GB weekend data) and 4GB of WiFi.Not only that but the entire plan itself has received a price cut of RM20 working out to a theoretical RM5.33/GB of Internet. An emphasis on the theoretical part though because your Internet quota is split between three different types and even in the most ideal of situations it seems unlikely that you will be able to make full use of it all.Nevertheless, this plan also comes with unlimited calls and SMS to all networks which gives it the slight edge over Digi’s recent  SmartPlan 75 and the  which only offers unlimited calls, but as those two plans are cheaper at RM75 and RM70 respectively, it definitely evens things out.Plus, if you’re counting raw 24/7 data alone, both of the plans offer 7GB mobile data, which is 2GB up from Celcom’s 5GB. But, depending on your weekend data usage, you may use more than 2GB over four weekends which would once again place the plans quite evenly with each other. You will get to bring over any unused quota (up to 5GB) to the next month though, which is a nice touch.What’s more, if you exceed RM225 on your monthly usage, Celcom will give you 1GB of bonus data and 2GB of bonus data if you exceed RM500 per month. This means you’re eligible for up to 3GB of bonus data per month if you spend more than RM500 on your monthly usage.Celcom also provides free music streaming from Yonder for 12 months to their FIRST Gold subscribers. Besides that, you can also be in the running for Celcom’s giveaway promotion where they have given out free  and petrol thus far.Do keep in mind that this plan is only a promotional plan, so it will be available from 2 February to 31 March 2016 only.

It screws over some people who rely on ads to generate income so ad blocking is generally frowned upon but let’s face it, we all do it. Pop-up ads are just too annoying to not use an ad block program.While many are religious about using an ad block extension for browsing online, when it comes to mobile browsing, most don’t care anymore. Mostly because the process of installing an ad blocker on your phone is just so complicated.Well,  wants to help you along by adding support for content and ad blocking plugins to their preinstalled web browser.This updated browser is being pushed to all Samsung phones with Android Lollipop or newer starting today. It will allow users to install helper apps that block ads from websites they visit, similar to Apple’s Safari browser in iOS 9.The first content blocker available for Samsung’s Internet app is Adblock Fast — which is supposed to be the “world’s fastest ad blocker”. Whether that claim rings true doesn’t matter because it is said that this plugin can decrease the web page load times on Android by 51 percent — makes sense since you don’t have to load the banner/popup ads on a page. Still 51% isn’t a number to scoff at.A quick search on the Google Play Store, there are several browsers with built-in ad block functions but none of them have been able to really get people to jump over from Google Chrome.

This time, we supposedly get a glimpse at how Samsung are addressing one of the biggest weaknesses of their previous  flagship — the battery life.According to popular leakster Eldar Murtazin, the Galaxy S7 can last 17 hours of continuous video playback “with maximum backlight” — which according to Eldra is a record for this class of devices.Video playback consumes quite a lot of battery power — especially at maximum brightness on what should be a Quad HD display. If this is true, 17 hours of continuous video playback at maximum brightness is borderline bonkers. Even tablets can’t last 17 hours of continuous video playback.We are curious how they achieved this feat, if it’s true. If we compare the Galaxy S7’s purported 3,000 mAh battery to its predecessor Galaxy S6 active’s 3,500 mAh battery you can sort of get a scale of how insane this claim seems as the Galaxy S6 active can only manage about 10-11 hours of video playback with .What’s more, Murtazin revealed that the Galaxy S7’s battery takes 100 minutes to go from 0-100% charged which is a touch longer than the existing Galaxy S flagships, but we doubt that people will mind that if the battery can truly last as long as Murtazin claims it to be.That said, this is just a rumour with no word on the conditions of the test — for example, was this streamed or played offline — so do take it with a pinch of salt.If we add this to the list of purported specs that the Galaxy S7 is said to feature — a Snapdragon 820 SoC (and likely the Exynos 8890 in different regions), 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, a 12-megapixel BRITECELL primary camera and a 5MP wide-angle selfie camera (f/1.7 aperture for both) — plus waterproofing and a microSD card slot, Samsung’s next flagship looks to be a beast.The S7 is also said to come in two variants, the 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge. I guess we’ll find out if these specifications are true at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2016 event in Barcelona.[, , ]"

This time, we get an official announcement of the date — February 21 — exactly one day before MWC.And so the stage is set.Pretty darn sexy box if you ask me. Since now we have confirmation that the Unpacked event will be happening on the 21st, that means Samsung will be going head-to-head with its fellow South Korean manufacturer LG who is also holding an  on the same day.Clash of the titans?While we don’t think LG can even hold a candle to Samsung when it comes to sales, the flagship devices that these two giants can produce are pretty close in performance and capabilities. I mean the LG G4 is a great flagship phone and the V10 is basically a better version of the G4.In any case, it will be an interesting day to say the least as these two giants vie for media attention. It is said that the  (and its variants) will be revealed on that day itself, which we’re inclined to believe.If you’re unable to attend the event in Barcelona itself, Samsung will be holding a live stream of Unpacked on YouTube at their  or their . The event will begin at 19:00 CET on 21 February which translates to 2 am local time on 22 February. Plus, if we’re looking at the video it looks like there might be a virtual reality stream. 360-degree video hype?To recap, besides a host of internal upgrades, the Galaxy S7 is said to feature a similar design to the Galaxy S6 but with dust and waterproof capabilities as well as a microSD card slot.

Rory Lee,Samsung Pay is coming to Southeast Asia this year,,"Android,Samsung Pay,Samsung Pay Malaysia,Samsung Pay SEA,Samsung SEA Forum","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-01,"Good news! You can now put that fingerprint sensor on your  Galaxy device to, even more, use than before as the South Korean electronics giant has announced at their Samsung SEA Forum 2016 that Samsung Pay will be coming to the Southeast Asian regions this year.We’ve come to that stage in life where we use our smartphones for almost everything. Work, play, productivity, browsing and even the occasional phone call or text, can all be carried out in the palm of your hand. It’s just so much more convenient that way.Add that to the fact that smartphones now come with added security and encryption services, like the fingerprint, and you have another avenue for smartphone utilisation — paying for stuff at the store.Samsung Pay is one of these wireless, moneyless, wave-to-pay services that lets you use either of the following devices:to store your credit or debit card information and let you pay with your phone at “virtually anywhere you can swipe or tap your card”. Support for Samsung Pay is also available on the Gear S2 smartwatch.To illustrate, here’s a clever advertisement about Samsung Pay:As you can tell from the video, it’s fairly simple to get started on using this service. Simply swipe up on your phone to launch the app, pick the card you want to use, secure with your fingerprint and hover your device over the card reader to pay. Hassle free.Of course, it is likely that when this Service comes to SEA, not all banks or carriers will be supported but it is safe to assume that many of the major ones will be.As Samsung have only just announced this at their SEA Forum, there is little information on when this will actually arrive in Malaysia (or if it will at all), though Samsung has said that Singapore and Australia will be the first countries to get this service. We will keep you updated on any developments later."

U Mobile Postpaid","Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-01-29,"Last year, U Mobile had introduced its  plan that offers a generous 7GB of data and unlimited free calls for only RM70/month. Now they have enhanced its offering further with its new Hero Plus that’s designed to give you more data for you and your loved ones. For RM120/month, you get a total of 10GB of internet and unlimited free calls on 2 separate lines. There’s no change for the current Hero P70 postpaid plan and essentially what’s new is their new  supplementary line. Each “Share 50″ line costs RM50/month and it lets you enjoy unlimited free calls plus additional 3GB of data. You can add up to 3x Share 50 lines under a Hero P70 postpaid account, which gives you a total of 16GB of data that’s shareable across principal and supplementary lines. For a family of 4, that comes out to RM55/month per person for unlimited calls with an average of 4GB of data each. The Share 50 line is also applicable for i90 and i130 postpaid plans as well. Since the internet quota is shared, there’s no wastage as all lines will utilise internet from the same pool. So if one uses less, the other line holders will get to use more. Yesterday Digi had responded to U Mobile’s Hero Postpaid by  a new plan with 7GB of data and unlimited calls at RM75/month.

Rory Lee,"Windows Phone has died, here’s why we think it will stay dead",,,,2016-01-29,"A recent  by The Verge announced the death of the  platform. What started out as a promising third player in the mobile OS game was quickly shot down.In a recent  by the IDC, it showed that in the recent quarter, about 400 million smartphones were sold and if you compare that to Microsoft’s earnings report, only 4.5 million of them were Lumia devices. That’s 1.1% of the market share. To contrast,  moved around 85 million devices in that same quarter.Things don’t get much better if you compare all time sales between  +  and Windows, where Microsoft and Nokia only shipped 110 million devices total compared to the 4.5 billion Android and iOS devices sold in the same period. That’s only about 2.4% of the market share. And, if you look at this graph, things look like they’re going from bad to worse.I loved the Windows Phone. I spent two years of my life committed to my little Lumia 625. I loved the way it looks, the cool animations and most of all I loved the unified idea behind this new operating system. Despite all the qualms, despite all the bugs and despite all the problems, I convinced myself that the OS was new and it could only get better. Right?Well, I can’t say that with certainty anymore.When Windows Phone first came out, many jumped for it. Extensive investment went into the platform and developing devices for it.  took a stab with their Venue Pro,  went all-in with a pretty stellar lineup of devices (some were tempting from a looks standpoint) and even manufacturers like  and Samsung had a pretty decent lineup to offer.However, as pointed out by Vlad Savov, these investments proved fruitless. Microsoft wanted to be the leading light in their own OS — understandably — and the apparent favouritism towards  (which they later acquired) was enough to piss the other manufacturers off.Have you seen the new Lumia devices? They’re plastic slabs that are almost indistinguishable from the rest except for that Windows tramp stamp that adorns the back of the device. Gone is the inspired unibody plastic build. Missing are the funky colours that turns the phone into candy. Poof, goes that sexy subtle curve of the screen on Lumi flagships of old. Such a shame really."

This might be a pretty good chance for you to do so as the smartphone manufacturer are putting two of their devices on sale — the  and .Both of these midrange smartphones will for RM998 from the OPPO . That means an RM300 cut for the R7 Lite and an RM200 cut for the R1x.I don’t know if you would consider that a big price cut, but you if you do the math you could get about 15-25 Snack Plates from KFC during their lunch promo for that amount of money.

Camera wise, it gets a 13MP rear 8MP front snapper and is powered by a 2,320 mAh battery.On the other hand, the OPPO R1x sports pretty much the same specifications as the OPPO R7 Lite, except that it has a slightly bigger battery — at 2420 mAh — and I think a nicer design.If you wanna get your hands on the OPPO R7 , you can head to this link while the OPPO R1x can be bought .[]"

With the , the South Korean electronics company showed that they could do “premium” incredibly well and I wondered if that aspect would carry over to the Galaxy A lineup, or if it would just be a half-arsed rehash.Well, when I arrived at the launch venue floor, that thought was quickly answered.The one I was waiting to find out about. Was it going to live up to the hype? In short, yeah it did that and more. Like the Galaxy S6, the glass panels of the A series (yes all three of them) came together with the metal frame about as well as glass and metal can possibly come together. The 2.5D contoured edge glass helped with giving the side of the phone a rounded and more natural feel in the hand.Each panel was a massive fingerprint magnet, though — as glass usually is — but at least they’re Corning Gorilla Glass 4, so that should keep scratches at bay. The buttons were fantastically tactile and had a satisfying click, even the home button.The three devices are spec’d accordingly, with the smallest 4.7-inch Galaxy A3 being powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon quad-core processor paired with 1.5GHz on RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. It is also powered by a smaller 2,300 mAh battery.On the other hand, the bigger 5.2-inch Galaxy A5 has the same processor as the Galaxy A7 — a 1.6GHz octa-core Snapdragon SoC — with the only difference being that the 5.5-inch Galaxy A7 has 3GB of RAM over the Galaxy A5’s 2GB of RAM.Performance across the board was relatively smooth, the most buttery of which is the Galaxy A7. If you place the Galaxy A3 next to either the Galaxy A5 or Galaxy A7, you will notice a slight delay when it comes to switching between multiple applications. In terms of connectivity, all 3 models support Dual-SIM and you’ll be pleased to know that the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 has a dedicated microSD slot, so you can pop in two SIM cards with no compromises.For a series separated by price and tiers, buyers would be happy to know that Samsung didn’t skimp on the camera optics. Well, not by much anyway. All three devices share the same 13-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo, except for the fact that the Galaxy A3’s snapper is missing optical image stabilisation.Though, with a large f/1.9 aperture lens I don’t foresee poor low-light performance to take too much of a hit. That said, we will have to put them through a proper camera test before passing judgement.As these are Samsung devices. it isn’t surprising that they come preloaded with some extra features. While some were fairly gimmicky, there are two features that stand out. The first of which is the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7.It’s supposed to be an improved version over the existing Galaxy S6 and from what we can tell, it’s pretty good. Nowhere near as snappy as a Huawei or Apple sensor, but it’s not bad.Another great feature that we were happy came over to the midrange devices was the double tap home button to quick launch the camera. It works as well as on the other flagship devices.In conclusion, these are really pretty good devices. They’re well built and look really premium but they’re expensive. Very expensive. The Galaxy A3 is priced at RM1,299 while the Galaxy A5 is priced at RM1,599. The top of the range Galaxy A7 is going for RM1,899, which is encroaching flagship price territory. To make the Galaxy A series more enticing, all 3 models will come with an extra 32GB microSD card, giving them a total of 48GB of storage out of the box.If you’re looking for something affordable, I can’t honestly recommend any of these devices. But, they do come in pink (EVEN THE CHROME AROUND THE HOME BUTTON IS PINK), so if that tickles your fancy, then these will be the devices for you."

It comes preloaded on all new LG G3 devices and displays a variety of notifications and suggestions, including recommendations to stay in touch with favourite contacts.What happened was, the app failed to validate the data presented to users, making it possible for attackers to manipulate the data and lace it with a malicious code that can be executed on affected devices. According to the researchers who found out about this vulnerability, the malicious code could be triggered when events like callback reminders or birthday notifications were displayed.An estimated 10 million LG G3s were said to be affected by this vulnerability.

Rory Lee,Can your drone fly underwater?,,"cool stuff,Drone,drones,flying drone,loon copter,quad copter,swimming drone,underwater drone","Cool stuff,Others",2016-01-28,"Flying drones are pretty cool. Drones that can sail across the surface of the water like boats are also pretty cool. Just the other day we were talking about a whole bunch of . But what we didn’t include was this drone. This guy, is a helicopter, a boat, AND a submarine.While drones can let you get some sick wedding shots and awesome drag racing footage, they’re also a little creepy. People can use these little things to spy on you, streaming video directly into their creepy little devices. If you thought you could escape them like you escape bees (diving in the water, in case you’ve never been chased by bees before) you’re sorely mistaken.This flying, swimming and diving device called the Loon Copter was developed by the Oakland University’s Embedded Systems Research Laboratory. It uses a barrel like body, attached to an otherwise regular quadcopter, to act as a ballast tank in a submarine. Filling it with water allows it to sink beneath the surface. It fills in a unique way that rotates the quadcopter ninety degrees in the water, so that the propellers bcome like outboard motors, allowing the drone to navigate under water.It can’t really navigate very deep bodies of water, but as this is nowhere near mass production, we can forsee it diving much deeper in the near future. When you want the drone to fly again, simply empty the tank and it will send the Loon Copter to the surface again.While, swimming and flying drones aren’t all that new, what sets this drone apart is the fact that it uses the clever ballast system. According to the project’s lead scientist, the drone can sit on the surface of the water without any energy usage, as well as change and control depth with little power and no propeller use.Currently, you can’t stream video from the Loon Copter to your smartphone — so you need to record it for playback later — but the creators have noted that future versions of this little guy could make use of acoustic modems or repeater buoys to allow for live streaming and control options.Created out of noble aspirations to help with search and rescue operations, this drone could also be misused — like all good things in life. The end result would come from the user, and while we think that it could be a little scary to give people this much flexibilty when it comes to filming spy footage, there is no denying the cool (and potentially useful) factor of this little device.That said, imagine how much easier filming the next Jaws movie will be with the Loon Copter. All you need to do is strap a fin to its side and queue the music. Dum dum, dum dum![, ]"

Being one of the company’s first moves into the budget-premium market, the original Galaxy A series was fairly well received and Samsung hopes to replicate that success with the 2016 versions.Much like the original Galaxy A smartphones, these 2016 models feature a premium metal body that is reminiscent of the electronics giant’s flagship  smartphone. The glass panel on the backs of the devices definitely gives them an air of exceptional build quality.Today, they unveiled three phones — the , , and  — which are differentiated by price. As these phones are not created as equals, the more expensive Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 have a fingerprint sensor embedded bellow the home button, a big feature that is missing on the Galaxy A3. However, they do share several key features.The first, and most notable of which, is that all three devices — even the little Galaxy A3 — sports a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture primary shooter plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 front-facing selfie camera. What separates them is that the Galaxy A3’s primary camera unit does not have OIS while the bigger two do.All three devices also have support for dual-SIM plus an expandable microSD storage slot. Except for the Galaxy A3, the devices don’t use a hybrid-SIM set up so you can use two SIM cards and a microSD card simultaneously. On the Galaxy A3 you will have to sacrifice one SIM for storage expansion.The king of the hill among the Galaxy A lineup, the Galaxy A7 sports a large 5.5-inch full HD Super AMOLED display on the front of the phone. Inside, it’s powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). Giving this smartphone juice is a large 3,300 mAh battery.What is basically a shrunken version of the larger Galaxy A7, the Galaxy A5 comes in at only 5.2-inches, but sports the same Super AMOLED full HD panel found on the Galaxy A7. It packs a 1.6GHz octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. For battery, the Galaxy A5 gets a respectable 2,900 mAh unit in the back.Finally, we arrive at the runt of the family, the Galaxy A3. It comes with a small 4.7-inch HD Super AMOLED display and a quad-core 1.5GHz processor on the inside. Helping you with running apps is 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Since it’s the smallest device here, Samsung have fitted it with a small 2.300 mAh battery to keep things going.It is worth noting that none of these devices will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Instead, they will default to the older Android 5.1 Lollipop, though we do expect them to receive the Marshmallow update sometime in the future.If you want to get your hands on these three devices, the Galaxy A7 will go for RM1,899 while the Galaxy A5 retails for RM1,599 and the Galaxy A3 will set you back RM1,299 including GST. All of these devices can be purchased at the official Samsung retailers from 28 January onwards.All purchases will be bundled with a 32GB microSD card free of charge. The devices will come in four colours — Black, Gold, White and Pink Gold.  From today until 31 January 2016, there will be a roadshow at Sunway Pyramid’s Blue Concourse for the general public to experience the features that the Galaxy A Series 2016 has to offer.

You can add a microSD card up to 128GB on its hybrid Dual-SIM slot and powering the device is a huge 4,100mAh battery that supports 5V/2A fast charging. In terms of imaging, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 rear camera and a front-facing 5MP f/2.2 unit for your selfie needs.If Xiaomi sells this officially in our market, we reckon that it should go below RM600.

Rory Lee,IKEA’s new table lets you cook with your smartphone,,"Ikea,IKEA dinner no smartphone,IKEA phubbing,IKEA smart phone steamboat,IKEA smartphone steamboat,IKEA steamboat,IKEA table,smartphones at the table","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-01-27,"With the advent of the smartphone, using it at the dinner table (or any table for that matter) has become a norm. When you sit down, you whip out your phone. When the food comes, you whip it out to post a picture what you’re eating on social media. When you want to avoid awkward conversations with that family member you’re supposed to be close with but barely remember their name, you have to whip it out.I think you get the gist.It’s a bad habit but most of us are guilty of it. Dinner time should be about the food and the people you’re having it with — especially when it is a family dinner. So, IKEA decided enough was enough and came up with an inventive solution to this particular conundrum: They created a new….table?Who would’ve thought of a smartphone-powered-steamboat-machine-table-thingamabob? I definitely didn’t. It sounds fantastic. While the table was definitely interesting, what’s equally interesting are the subjects’ responses.When they sat down, the usual routine of whipping out the smartphone begins right up until the steamboat pot is placed on the fire. One eagle-eyed observer noticed that the soup wasn’t boiling and after some clarification, hit the button and raised the steamboat platform in a futuristic sci-fi manner.Obviously, everyone started freaking out at how cool that was, but when the waiter told them to take out their phones the subjects thought it was to take pictures of the contraption. When they found out they had to place their devices into the base of the machine to power the steamboat, many were hesitant but eventually gave in to their tummies demands.The result was pretty awesome. Everyone made a whole lot more eye contact and looking at each other’s faces rather than the Zuck’s Facebook. Conversation happened with their mouths as opposed to their thumbs. Smiles were exchanged without the need for round yellow emojis.It was heartwarming, to say the least. We’re big fans of good tech and are always on our devices — for work and for play. But sometimes it’s better to just disconnect from your devices and reconnect with actual people and respond to them without needing a notification tone to prompt you.Are you guys guilty of phubbing at the dinner table?

Our own device (also from the US) has for the past week and, for the longest time, nobody claimed responsibility or could even identify what was wrong with the device.Well, thanks to our knights in shining armour over at Android Authority and Techradar, we now have an answer.After picking up the story about the bootloop issues from LG G4 users, Android Authority gathered what they knew and confronted LG about it. Thankfully, instead of denying any problems the electronics giant admitted that there was a problem with the smartphone’s hardware and said that they would repair the affected devices, though it is unclear if your device needs to still be under warranty for it to be eligible.The problem puts the phone in a boot-up loop where it tries to reset, fails and tries again and again which then proceeds to brick the phone. We thought it was a problem with our device’s battery, but now according to , it is resulting from “loose contact between components”.Currently, it is unclear if this problem affects all LG G4s or if it is just limited to those units in the US. However, according to Android Authority, the bootloop issue persists and affects all regional and carrier models of the device. LG advises its customers who have bought their devices via a carrier and are experiencing such issues to contact their nearest LG Service Center for repair under full warranty.On the other hand, customers who have purchased their G4 smartphones from non-carrier retailers should contact an LG Service Center “with the understanding that warranty conditions will differ”.We don’t know if this problem affects local Malaysian units, so if you are using a local LG G4, do let us know if you’re experiencing such problems. We’ve contacted LG Malaysia ourselves and we’ll keep you updated on their response.[, ]"
Rory Lee,Zomato is going to bring you to your favourite food with Uber,,"food,food and ride sharing,Ride Sharing,Uber,Zomato,Zomato teams up with Uber","Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices",2016-01-27,"Have you ever been lounging at home when suddenly, like the changing winds out in the open sea, your stomach starts growling in hunger? Yes? Then have you ever been too lazy to get into your car and  all the way to a shop to grab a bite to eat not knowing if the food will even be good thus making the trip not worthwhile?Well, now you might not have to pull your hair out over it because popular food review app Zomato is teaming up with  to help bring you to good food. At least, we hope it’s good food.If you haven’t already heard about Zomato, it’s an app that helps you “discover” new food by providing information such as restaurant reviews and ratings as well as create your “own network of foodies for trusted recommendations”.How this works is: You launch the app and sign in to your account. Then you can scroll through a timeline-esque UI of food reviews and ratings based on your current location. Then, you can hit on whichever restaurant tickles your fancy to find out more information about the establishment. While previously it only gives you directions to the restaurant, now it will give you the option to “Ride there with Uber”.Why is this better than just launching the Uber app and inputting the destination? Well, because it happens with a single touch. Hitting the option would bring up a pickup time plus the estimated price range for the trip — just as you would find on the regular Uber app — without needing to launch a new app. Saves some time I guess?This feature has been available to Zomato users in 30+ cities across 13 countries, namely India, Australia, Canada, The UK, South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, The Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Turkey, UAE and the United States.Unfortunately, as of right now, we are still unable to get the option here in Selangor. Curious, we contacted Zomato and they told us that the function would roll out in stages. So far only users in Kuala Lumpur can access this function, with Selangor’s availability on the way soon.While I think this is pretty neat, I’ve actually never tried it before. So do let us know, if you’re a Zomato user, what you think about this little feature. If you aren’t a Zomato user, would you be interested in trying this out?The Zomato app is available on ,  and ."

If you aren’t one now though, from today onwards you can sign up or upgrade to the SmartPlan 65 (or any higher plan) and get this very offer as well.But there’s more. This deal is supposedly limited and it will operate on a first come first served basis which means that if you want to take advantage of this free year of iflix, it would probably be wise to act soon. That said, Digi never specified a specific “limit” to this offer — no dates, no number of customers, nothing. Could this be a marketing strategy to generate hype?Well, if it is, this wouldn’t be the first time Malaysians have been lured in by the word “free” and “limited”. Let’s just say we like free things.In any case, much like the TM deal, this one requires no login because Digi has “back-end” integration with iflix allowing the streaming service to automatically detect if you’re on a Digi line and grant you unrestricted access to their library. All you need to do is download the app (via a Digi network) on either  or , and launch it. iflix will take care of the rest. Plus you get 1GB of extra quota (until March 2016) to watch iflix content.If you’re not interested in upgrading to a Digi SmartPlan 65 or higher, you can still opt to retain the 60-days free subscription with iflix that is the result of the first collaboration between the telco and the streaming service. For those who are curious, Digi’s SmartPlan 65 offers two variants — one that has unlimited calls to all networks plus 3GB of data, versus one that has 5GB of data and only 200mins of free calls.

They’re horribly old fashioned and often come in colours that resemble different shades of puke. Plus, except for  Case, most flip cases never did anything particularly . Sure you might have some practical functions, but none that doesn’t scream “ZOMG WHAT A DWEEB”.Okay, maybe I’m being a little harsh here but the point is, I would never, ever,  use a flip cover case…unless they did this.So with a flip case for your smartphone, you’re often left with a lot of space on the inside of your flip case. Space which can be used to either let your toddler/cousin/nephew/niece enthusiastically doodle on, or perhaps use it as a space for you to stick photos of your loved ones — y’know like the inside of a locker door.However, neither of those are particularly practical, nor do they help you do more with your smartphone in any way. Well, it looks like the boffins at Microsoft Research — Microsoft’s research division (go figure) — seem to have figured out a brilliant way to make use of that space.Enter the  “Type Cover” for your phone. What they’ve done with the flip cover is line the inside of the case with an always-on, low-power display that can display “useful information”. Some examples provided by the concept includes the displaying of travel itineraries, tickets, the calendar while you’re composing an email, and (my personal favourite) a fully qwerty touch keyboard. That sounds fantastic doesn’t it?It is, until you realise that if this “inside screen” is touch sensitive and is attached to the side of your phone, how on earth are you going to type with both hands? Here’s a picture to illustrate my point:So unless you’re typing with your index fingers on the table, or if you tuck the case behind your device, it’s kind of unfeasible. Plus, if you do the latter, you might as well just use the multitasking button to switch between apps.There is promise when it comes to the full QWERTY keyboard though, but even that has it’s problems. Because if the phone/case does not have a kickstand it’ll just end up looking like this really  for a .Either way, it looks like this is merely a concept and could do with a lot more polishing. The good news is that we might not have to wait for the rumoured “” to (hopefully) test this case out because Microsoft Research is supposedly “in deep talks” with the Lumia division to turn these flip covers into real products.What do you guys think? Is one screen enough?[, ]"
Cheryl Bates,Acer Predator 8 Review: Made for fun,,,,2016-01-26,"One of the first of its kind, the Acer Predator 8 is essentially the one of the world firsts in terms of tablets built for gaming. As far as the design and build go, the Predator 8 isn’t your bog standard tablet. Coming in at about 8 inches in size, the tablet has a rather unique shape; with four front-facing speakers (called the Predator Quadio) with one situated at each corner of the tablet.The tablet is surprisingly light considering how chunky it looks and how solid it feels; weighing in at a paltry 350g with the battery in.The sides are also shaped in a way that you have a decent place to grip without your hands getting in the way of said speakers if you want to play games in landscape mode. One minor gripe is the placement of its microUSB port at the top of the device as the charging cable will get in the way if you are playing games while charging.The rear of the device is home to a brushed metal plate with the Predator logo on it and is the only bit of the tablet that is made of solid metal. The rest of the Predator 8 is made of a combination of plastic and rubber that only simulates that metal finish but still looks good regardless. Due to its unique shape you probably won’t find many 3rd party cases for it, unfortunately, but .Also, we feel we need to mention that this is the first (compact) gaming tablet that has a form of haptic feedback called the Predator TacSense. There are two haptic motors, with one placed on each side. So depending on the games you are playing it might vibrate to your actions, even the startup screen has the tablet buzzing to the logo. We do notice that the tactile feedback doesn’t apply to all games, though, only those which have been tweaked to have the feature in the first place."

Clad in an all-metal unibody, the honor 5X comes with a 5.5-inch full HD and packs a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage.It also comes with a 13MP f/2.0 primary camera with a dual-LED flash for taking photos. Selfies are taken care of by the front-facing 5MP f/2.4 snapper. The 5X also sports a large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0, plus a dedicated dual-SIM tray — so none of that hybrid-SIM nonsense. The device will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with the EMUI 3.1 skin on top.As you can tell by the name, the honor 7 Enhanced is slightly improved version of the old (but gold) honor 7. It still packs the same 2.2GHz octa-core Kirin 935 processor paired with 3GB of RAM thrumming under a 5.2-inch full-HD display. It also brings over the honor 7’s 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash plus an 8MP front-facing camera with its own LED flash.What has changed then? It has more storage — double in fact at 32GB from the old 16GB found on the original honor 7. While it may seem like a simple change it is a significant one as one of the biggest qualms users had of this otherwise excellent device was the fact that it had a measly 16GB of onboard storage, which as we all know is not going to be enough especially with that 20MP snapper.This is also the first non-Nexus device to come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box that has been launched in Malaysia.If you want to get your hands on either of these devices, you can register your interest on Vmall.my from 26 January onwards. There is currently no information on the price of these devices, but we believe that the 5X should come in below RM1,000."

A metal build, a nice full HD display and a snappy fingerprint sensor are hard to come by at this end of the market. While honor have not announced when the device will go on sale or how much it would cost, we got to take a quick look at this all-metal midrange device.A premium metal construction is almost a necessity these days. While  that a metal body is all that, smartphone manufacturers and people who want to show off certainly do. Has honor delivered with the 5X?Well, I can tell you that it definitely feels better than the more expensive honor 7. The front of the device is nothing to shout about, but when you move to the sides of the device, you can see where all of honor’s effort went. They talked endlessly about the sandblasting they had to do to keep the device feeling smooth in the hand and they did accomplish that to a certain extent.The sides are nicely chamfered (ala-Nexus 6P) to help with grip and very smooth to the touch. They decided to go with a brushed metal look for the back plate but the moment your fingers touch it, the panel feels in no way shape or form brushed. It was smooth as a baby’s bottom — which may appeal to some, but I like a little grain and roughness.There are other niggles that come from the buttons. While they had nice tactile feedback which felt really premium, the power button shifts around a little too much and if you apply pressure to the center of the volume rockers you will be greeted with an incredibly unpleasant flex.Since this isn’t really a high-end device, you can’t really expect much when it comes to performance. It sports a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. With proper optimisation, those specs would do fine for light to medium tasks, but from our brief hands-on it doesn’t seem to be the case.Switching between applications was slow and sluggish. Exiting the camera app was the most painful thing to watch as the frames stuttered and choked. It was a disaster. That said, this can probably be fixed with a quick update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow.The honor 5X comes with a decent 13-megapixel f/2.0 main camera with a dual-LED flash mounted on the rear, right above the fingerprint scanner. It’s a pretty decent snapper with a host of features as is the hallmark of EMUI’s camera app. Stuff like beautification, HDR, panorama are all bundled into it. Shots from that sensor are decent with reasonable amounts of colour accuracy and detail. The front 5MP f/2.4 selfie cam also takes reasonably good pictures, though we would have liked if it was a little wider for those crucial wefies.Its Huawei-made fingerprint scanner is as fantastic as ever. I loved the accuracy and speed though I would have appreciated a little haptic feedback when it successfully reads your finger but that’s me nitpicking. The honor 5X’s sensor only needs 6 taps to register your fingerprint yet it has an amazing level of accuracy.As is a common theme in Huawei made devices, the fingerprint scanner at the back is more than simply a fingerprint scanner. You can swipe down on it to pull down your notifications, as well as hold it to exit your application and return to the home screen. It also allows you to take photos by tapping it though we found that quite pointless and horribly unergonomic.It also has a curious function that lets the fingerprint scanner act as a back button allowing you to tap it once to go back to your previous task. So what if I’ve enabled the camera single tap to take a photo? Design oversight? It also lacks the swipe left and swipe right to scroll through pictures or text.All in all, it’s a pretty decent budget premium device with an okay camera and decent specs. All it needs is some proper optimisation (please patch ASAP) and a little skill when taking photographs. It’s a decent all-rounder but it faces tough competition from the likes of the  and the  (when it arrives) even if our estimate of a sub RM1,000 price tag comes true."

Based on this listing, the two devices bearing the model number SM-G930R4 and SM-G935R4 — which is the Galaxy S7 and  respectively — have been listed to pack a 5.1-inch screen for the S7 and a 5.5-inch screen for the S7 edge. This reflects the earlier  outed by popular benchmark AnTuTu. Plus, since only two models have been imported, it is becoming less and less likely that Samsung will launch four devices at the same time. Then again, smartphone manufacturers have done crazier things. Though, it is worth noting that only two of each device have been imported, probably because they’re tester units (as can be seen in the description “FOR TESTNG”).Based on most leaks, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge should come with a Quad HD display packing either an Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 processor (likely depending on region) plus 4GB of RAM and either 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of expandable internal storage.

They should also come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.If you’d like to catch up on what we know about the new Galaxy S lineup, you can find more info  and .

The brilliant work of author/comic-writer/kid-trapped-in-an-adult’s-body Matthew Inman has been passed around the Internet more often than a keg at a frat house party, and for good reason. His comics are brilliant. He takes daily life situations, adds some magic, some ridiculousness, a  and boom, you’ll be on the floor clutching your sides laughing your head off, or trying not to puke from the graphic images. Either way, it’s a lot of fun.While most of his work was designed to have people cackling like witches on a broomstick, he does have some pretty hard hitting and emotional ones as well. One of his newer works about , for example, was as motivational as it was  inducing.Not too long ago, The Oatmeal collaborated with Elan Lee and Shane Small to launch a  for their own imaginative card game: Exploding Kittens. It became one of the  projects on Kickstarter and quickly won the hearts of many but it suffered from the limitation of being a physical card game. Now, well…there’s an app for that.Exploding Kittens is a simple and straightforward game to be played with friends. The objective is simple — don’t explode. Each player starts with four cards and a defuse card with a universal draw deck in the middle. Players then take turns to play an action card followed by drawing another card from the deck in the centre. If a player draws a card with an exploding kitten, they will have to defuse the card or get blown up and ejected from the game. It continues until only one player is left.The app version of the game promises to be exactly the same. That means you get to have all the brilliant drawings of The Oatmeal, plus the simple and addictive mechanics of the game. What’s more, the app version will obviously have more attractive graphics for your actions, like this cat paw stealing your cards:If you’d like to download this app you can find it at the Apple .

You should be impressed by now but wait until you see the full picture.While it looks like you’re getting a whopping 3GB with full speed internet on the surface, the reality is that nothing has changed. As a mobile internet user, you’ll depend mostly on high-speed internet which in this case, remains at 1GB for free.

U Mobile didn’t specify a limit for its throttled usage back then and now they have officially put a cap at 2GB. Assuming there was never a limit in the first place, this could be even seen as a downgrade. Considering  are offering 500MB of Basic Internet, U Mobile thought this would be a good idea to boast 4x more throttled internet than the rest. Upon hitting your basic internet limit, you will still lose connectivity until your next top up. The rest of the Power Prepaid deal remains unchanged.

With such a large following though it seems weird that Kickstarter never brought their application to the Google Play Store — until now.It does seem odd that Kickstarter left the Android platform without an app for so long, but maybe they were caught up with something. Well, they clearly got around to doing so eventually, but it appears some key functions missing.

When abused, it can cause adverse effects. That’s what Communication and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Salleh Said Keruak believes as the government is mulling for tougher enforcements for online users.According to the minister, social media is often abused for defaming and to incite hatred against leaders and the institutions of government. To put an end to these issues, the government is pushing to amend the MCMC Act in March, which will give it more powers to act on such abusers. The police will work closely with the MCMC in their investigations. To speed up the process, a dedicated deputy public prosecutor has been appointed by the Attorney-General’s Chambers to handle social media cases.  The new amendment could also allow more websites to be blocked, especially those that are seen to be threatening the peace and violating the Sedition Act. One such site is Sarawak Report, which he says has been spreading lies against the government and it creates confusion among the people. The minister has also added that he hopes Malaysians won’t view this in a negative light as it was necessary to safeguard the public’s interest. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen such warning. In the middle of last year, MCMC had  advising Malaysians against spreading lies on 1MDB. Once the amendment is passed in 2 months time, you better think twice before making slanderous statements on your Facebook, Twitter and other social channels. That one rant could win you a “Go to Jail” card. There are a lot of nasty things being posted on social media these days but there’s a difference between offensive and defamatory. Will the police and MCMC be able to tell the difference between the two? In the UK, there had been several cases of  for being offensive. What do you think of this MCMC Act amendment?

Now, we’ve just received an email indicating that Samsung will be launching these new devices — the ,  and  — next week.Samsung Malaysia has set the official unveiling of the Galaxy A line for 28 January 2016  which is next Thursday. The Galaxy A series will share the Galaxy S6’s good looks with its glass front and back panels held together by a metal frame. The edges are rounded for a better grip and feel in the hand.The devices also get a bump, across the line, up to a 13-megapixel f/1,9 aperture rear shooter and a front-facing 5MP f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates the Galaxy A3’s camera from the other two bigger devices is the lack of OIS though we suspect people who are going for a budget device won’t mind this too much. The best part? All three devices have a Pink Gold colour option — which we hope they will bring to Malaysia as well.Sitting at the top of the Galaxy A’s pecking order is the largest of the trio with a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED display. On the inside, the devices will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Thankfully the internal storage is expandable via microSD to up to 128GB of extra internal storage. The Galaxy A7 also gets a large 3,300 mAh battery.Next up we have the Galaxy A5 which is slightly smaller at 5.2″ but with the same full-HD (1920×1080) Super AMOLED display. Powering the device will be a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. However, it gets a smaller 2,900 mAh battery for juice.Rounding out the trio is the smallest sibling, the Galaxy A3. Sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720) Super AMOLED display with a quad-core 1.5GHz processor running on the inside. It also packs 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. The device will be drawing power from a 2,300 mAh battery.The trio of devices will not launch with Android 6.0 Marshmallow though, as they’re set to come with Android 5.1 Lollipop out-of-the-box. That said, we do expect them to get Marshmallow within a reasonable amount of time. The two higher end devices — the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 — also sport a fingerprint scanner.Those are mighty specs for a budget device, but only if these devices are actually priced like a budget device. Based on the Singaporean pricing of the Galaxy A line, that doesn’t really look to be the case. In Singapore, the Galaxy A3 is going for SGD398 (around RM1,211),  while the Galaxy A5 costs SGD598 (around RM1,820) and the biggest Galaxy A7 will set you back SGD698 (around RM2,125).A pretty hefty price tag then. Then again, Singapore’s prices have generally been much higher than in Malaysia. If we’re going off last year’s Malaysian pricing, the Galaxy A3 went for RM899, Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199 and the Galaxy A7 had an RM1,499 price tag. But, keep in mind that these prices were before GST.Would you consider these devices at those price ranges? Let us know in the comments section below."

Since Malaysia is a key market, we anticipated a local launch would follow soon after and sure enough, OPPO have brought this mid-range device to our shores.Despite the name, the F1 has nothing to do with the popular motorsport Formula 1. It does, however, look like the splitting image of the smartphones from OPPO’s R7 line, from white front panel right down to the square rear-mounted camera module and flash. The resemblance is uncanny.The device has a relatively small 5″ 720p HD display (1280×720 pixels) with a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor on the inside paired with 3GB of RAM for a pretty decent spec list. Internal storage is a tiny 16GB but that’s expandable via microSD for up to 128GB of extra storage. This smartphone also has support for dual-SIM (one Micro and one Nano) but since it’s a hybrid SIM set up, you will have to sacrifice one slot if you want to use a microSD card.This smartphone promises a “premium” photography experience at a reasonable price, so it gets a 13MP ISOCELL f/2.2 aperture rear-facing camera with Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) and a single LED flash. On the front, it packs an 8-megapixel f/2.0 snapper with a 1/4-inch sensor and built-in beautification features.Powering the device will be a modest 2,500 mAh battery which is a touch more than the OPPO R7 Lite and R7 models. It will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop with ColorOS 2.1 running on top.With those specs, this places the OPPO F1 right in the Xiaomi Redmi 3’s crosshairs. The F1 should have the edge in terms of performance though as it has 3GB of RAM versus the Redmi 3’s 2GB, but that extra performance does come with a higher price tag. The only question is how much lower will the Redmi 3 retail at?The OPPO F1 officially goes on sale online tomorrow, 22 January 2016, at midnight on the  for RM1,198. The first 200 customers to purchase this device from the online store will receive a free OPPO Selfie Stick.

Now a video has surfaced, claiming to be the “First real 4-inch iPhone 2016″ video leak, the short 40-second clip — if true — does give at least some information on Apple’s purported next product.Yeah, it looks exactly like an iPhone 6/6s. In fact, it looks so much like an iPhone 6/6s that many are calling this video a fake and that the reason it looks small-ish is because the guy manning the camera has large hands. Honestly, it does look kind of sketchy and as 9to5Mac pointed out, the speaker grille ratios were pretty similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone so that does add some credence to the “big-hands” justification.It is said that MIC Gadget has a reasonable history in obtaining devices for a hands-on ahead of time so maybe there is some truth to all of this. But, there is no way of identifying if this is actually the new iPhone 6C or if it is just a regular iPhone 6. There’s tape over many of the important identifier bits, there is no comparison with the iPhone 6/6s, and there is really nothing in the room that can tell us anything about the scale of this device.Considering how good  have gotten, it honestly wouldn’t be too surprising if the phone in the video is actually a clone made to look like it could be the iPhone 6c.

Rory Lee,5 reasons you should ditch the Facebook app,,,,2016-01-20,"A popular saying when it comes to these little devices we carry around all day called smartphones. It’s amazing what our devices can do with a dedicated app, especially when it comes to social media applications. If you’ve ever used the  app versus visiting it on the browser, you will know what I mean.Unfortunately, some applications are really heavy and take up a lot of resources, slowing down slower phones. One of which is the  application. It takes up a whopping amount of space in your internal storage versus something like Instagram that only uses a fraction of the amount, but because this is the only and most complete application for browsing Facebook, we begrudgingly use it.Common perception would be that the mobile browser version is always a whole lot worse than the app, but according to Android Central, that isn’t the case. Russell Holly wrote an  about how he uninstalled Facebook on his Android device and it turned out to be a better experience than he expected.That got us thinking, is the Facebook app really worth it? Well, for what we believe is the majority of FB users, we doubt it. Here are the five reasons we think  users should ditch the Facebook application.If you’re on it for a moderate amount of time a day, you will notice that it becomes one of the biggest battery drainers on your phone. Plus, it is a performance hog too, something Russell also notes, so it will significantly slow down the performance of lower-end devices.If you’ve ever installed the Facebook app, I’m sure you’d notice the ridiculous amount of permissions they “require” to function properly. It wants access to so much of my information that I’m pretty sure the Zuck knows me better than my mom does."

OPPO are so committed to the selfie abilities of this smartphone that they’ve even hired “Selfie Ambassador” Nora Danish to demonstrate just how powerful this device is at taking selfies.
Let’s start with the build. If you’ve been following our coverage of the OPPO F1, I’m sure you would have noticed how similar this device is with the OPPO R7 series. It so happened we had an OPPO R7s on hand so we placed the two devices side by side. Quickly, which device is which?Honestly, besides the size and the back firing speaker grille, these two devices are almost exactly the same from the back. The camera module, the flash, the two toned rear panels (because of the different materials), the feel and the rounded edges were all exactly the same. It was unreal.Since it was exactly the same, it also had the same feel in the hand as the R7s — albeit the smaller footprint — so that part didn’t feel so good. Then again, for a midrange device, you can’t really complain. Around the front, that’s a different story.The front bears enough differences to identify which is which. Opting for capacitive buttons instead of the on-screen ones on the R7s, the F1 lets you use its display to its maximum potential. Not that it had a very impressive display, but we’ll get into that later. What I did like was the rounded front edges.With the 2.5D glass set to curve slightly more and slightly later, the glass and the metal blended seamlessly into each other giving the device a nice rounded edge. It was almost iPhone 6s Plus like, so props to OPPO for acheiving the something like that on a midrange device.Beyond that, the device felt generally nice in the hand — though I would have liked it a little more if it had a slight curve, but that’s up to the individual.The OPPO F1 is powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. At the front, the device sports a 5-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) IPS panel which isn’t all that impressive. The device comes running Android 5.1 Lollipop with OPPO’s ColorOS 2.1 running on top. The device draws juice from a 2,500 mAh battery and also has support for dual-SIM (Micro+Nano) although since it’s a hybrid set up you will have to sacrifice a microSD slot for the second SIM.Performance was pretty decent. It didn’t lag when switching between applications (though there weren’t many applications pre-installed to begin with) and it handled what little multitasking I threw at it. I’m not particularly a fan of the ColorOS Android skin, but some of you may like it so that’s ultimately down to personal preference. The display was okay-ish and you probably wouldn’t notice the 720p-ness unless you’re coming from a higher screen resolution.Now we get to the part everyone has been waiting for — the camera. It packs a 13-megapixel ISOCELL rear shooter with Phase Detection AF and a large f/2.2 aperture that was pretty good in the venue’s sketchy lighting. It took decent shots, but since we could only view it on a 720p screen, we won’t make any claims just yet. What everyone’s curious about is the 8MP front-facing snapper.When you think of a “selfie phone”, you’d think of something like the  which sports a massive 13MP front facing selfie shooter with autofocus and dual LED flash for RM1,049. Next to those beastly specs, the OPPO F1 that costs RM1,198 simply pales in comparison. It doesn’t even have a front facing flash — instead it relies on a “screen flash”, which basically turns your screen white and bright, to illuminate dark subjects. Probably best used in dark conditions, the screen flash did absolutely nothing in the launch venue’s dodgy lighting, but again we will have to fully test this out before we make any judgements.When you think about this phone, you can’t go at it purely from a specs perspective. If you were to do that, perhaps the ZenFone Selfie is the better device with it’s 5.5″ full HD display, but look at it. It’s chunky, it’s fat and it is very plasticky. The OPPO F1 on the other hand, is a slim thing with a great build and a premium feel. It’s rounded metal rails and smooth metallic back are awesome to run your hand across. It’s the phone for the fashionista, for someone who cares more about style and looks than pure hardware specs. Let me put it this way, could you see Nora Danish using a ZenFone Selfie?Exactly."

Rory Lee,Here’s why we think the “Indonesian Iron Man” is fake,,,,2016-01-20,"By now, I’m sure most of you have seen a video making its rounds on social media, and even , about a guy with a robotic arm that he built in a garage to help him overcome the limitations of his paralysed left hand. Sounds amazing right?Yeah, we think this sounds too good to be true. Here’s why.I Wayan Sutawan, affectionately referred to as Tawan, suffered a minor stroke six months ago which paralysed his left arm. Because he’s a mechanic of sorts, one can imagine that having a paralysed left hand can be quite a cumbersome thing. So, rather than sit around and whine about it, Tawan set to work and in two months created a robotic arm out of spare parts he had around his workshop.He can control the robot arm via a headband around his forehead that picks up his brain signals and allows him to control the arm movement accordingly. Based on the video, not only can he lift objects and move his arm around, he can also pick up and hold on to rather delicate objects.So why do we think this miraculous feat has more in common with the Boy Who Cried Wolf than it does with Iron Man?That means the body part — the muscles, the nerve cells, the tendons and ligaments — are perfectly functional, there is just nothing telling them to move. So, if it’s the brain that can’t issue the command, how then can his “brainwave detector” — that looks like a bunch of LEDs strapped around his head with duct tape — detect the brainwaves issued by a part of the brain that no longer functions?Plus, even if that contraption around his head  pick up the brainwaves from dead/damaged braincells that can no longer issue commands via a human’s regular nervous system, where on earth did he store the processor needed to make sense of those brainwaves (or even identify the correct ones) and translate them into mechanical motor functions? How did he develop such sophisticated programming? What kind of supercomputing power is being used to digest all that data?While the motors and the hydraulics for the upper segments of the arm could possibly pass off as motors to facilitate movement, the glove that controls Tawan’s finer finger movements don’t have any actuators at all. So how could this contraption allow him to make the finger movements necessary to pick up and grip the solder in the video?Prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the brain aren’t exactly new. Take a look at this  by The Guardian on a DARPA-funded research project for robotic arms that can feel. What the scientists at Johns Hopkins university Applied Physics Laboratory did was have the electrodes from the prosthetic hand inserted into his sensory and motor cortexes so that he could not only control the hand with thought, he could also feel and sense when his “fingers” were touched.Once again, this is proof that in order for your brain to control a prosthetic arm, the necessary cortexes would have to be able to send a signal and function properly first. Another thing to note is that if a project led by the brilliant scientists of Johns Hopkins needed funding from a US military agency like DARPA to succeed, how on earth did Tawan manage to build one himself out of spare parts?What is more likely is that the man simply has a weak arm that needs some motorised help to actually function properly. In fact, if you pay close attention to his left arm when he is inserting it into his mechanical contraption, you can see his wrist flick upwards before it enters the sleeve.Everything about this story seems too sketchy to be true. The fact that a simple mechanic from a rural town could just one day up and build something so advanced from spare parts should have raised at least a few flags. Add “brainwave-controlled” to that description and you would have a beautiful script to a story designed for the big screen. You would have Iron Man actually. And Tony Stark doesn’t exist — no matter how hard Elon Musk tries.[, ]"

Rory Lee,We’ve broken the AppLock -Fingerprint- “encryption” and it wasn’t even that difficult,,"AppLock,AppLock Fingerprint,Fingerprint decrypted,Fingerprint encryption","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Others",2016-01-21,"We’ve touched on how good the Nexus 6P’s fingerprint sensor is in the past with its quick unlock speed and high accuracy despite only needing six taps to register your finger. You can also use it to authenticate Google Play as well as Android Pay purchases, but we’ve always hoped it could do more especially since Google baked fingerprint support into Android 6.0 Marshmallow itself.Thanks to the open API though, now you can use your fingerprint to lock specific apps in your phone — but there’s a catch.App locking is no new concept. It simply allows you to lock specific applications, requiring either a password or pin to access that particular app. Let’s say, your friends are the nosy bunch and the moment they get their hands on your device, they like to head into the gallery to look at all your embarrassing failed selfie attempts. Thanks to an app locker, you can stop that by protecting access to that application with an app locker. Some devices even have that natively in their Android skin, while others even allow you to lock entire folders of applications.Entering a password is  last century and developer SurpriseToYou have come up with AppLock -Fingerprint-, an app that lets you (if you’re on Android 6.0 Marshmallow) lock individual applications in your phone with your fingerprint. Although we must note the incredibly sketchy developer name. When I’m using a security app, I don’t really want it to surprise me. To use it, the app requires you to grant it three different levels of access — Apps with usage access, Draw over other apps, and Activate device administrator.Once in, it’s a simple task of choosing which application you want locked by flicking the toggle next to that specific app. Once you launch the app that you’ve locked, the AppLock -Fingerprint- overlay will draw over the app and ask for your fingerprint.But, true to the developer’s name, here’s the surprise — when that overlay pops up and “locks” your app, should you receive a banner notification from WhatsApp, the overlay drops and you have access to said “locked” app without ever inputting your fingerprint. What kind of security is this?!While the fact that this app runs on ads without a way to disable it is a little annoying, I think the far more pressing issue is the fact that you can break the “encryption” with a single banner notification. If, however, that doesn’t bother you and you’re interested in this app, you can get it from the PlayStore. Just, erm I don’t know, turn off your banner notifications in the mean time?[, , ]"

Based on the diagram, it does indeed look like the phone will have a flat design unlike that of the previous  and  models.Besides that the diagram confirms that the G5’s volume control buttons will be placed at the side of the smartphone while the power button remains put beneath the camera module (likely where the fingerprint sensor will reside as well). It does seems kind of silly to have a clickable button at the back, but then again we’ve doubted the back button placement before and that turned out pretty well in the end.Speaking of that camera module, while it does look like a massive module, it seems that there will only be one camera at the back. Judging from the cutout in the middle plus the earlier concepts by CNet Korea, the rest of to module will be home to the dual-tone LED flash and a laser autofocus.It also looks like the G5 will indeed be thinner, taller and wider than the LG G4, measuring in at 149.4 x 73.9 x 8.2mm versus the G4’s 148.9 x 76.1 x 6.3-9.8mm.Unfortunately, while this diagram does confirm a lot about the device, there is no mention of specs or what exactly the body will be made of. If we’re going off past rumours the G5 should have a 5.7-inch QHD display plus an all metal body with a removable battery that can be slid out by  off the bottom or top of the device.[]"

Some of us have tried it out for ourselves first hand. It seemed like a gigantic design oversight by the South Korean electronics giant, but the solution was a simple one — don’t put the pen in backwards.Sometimes, accidents happen and it seems that  has picked up on that as they’ve quietly fixed this gigantic flaw with the S Pen via a hardware modification to their newer Galaxy Note5 models. But, as there is no way of telling if your device has the fix, please don’t try this with your own device.Based on the image, it looks like Samsung have added a little lever (left) to the original circuit board which looks like it will allow users to eject the S Pen if it were inserted the wrong way. According to Phandroid’s sources, this new mechanism works beautifully despite the fact that it looks like it is being held together by some tape.We don’t think that’s how Samsung will actually hold the lever there, but if there is a fix for this issue it is pretty good news. However, since Samsung made the oversight in the first place, we’re sure many of the early Galaxy Note5 adopters must be pissed that their device doesn’t have this hardware fix.Plus, since Samsung seems to have ninja-fixed this, it doesn’t look like they want others to find out about it which is kind of a bummer. While we’d like to hope that Samsung will offer a hotfix for this problem to existing Galaxy Note5 users, we highly doubt that will be the case.Do you own a Galaxy Note5?

Suffice to say we will be bringing you live updates from the ground on that very day.Of the two devices launched, the honor 5X is definitely the more interesting one. The 5X is honor’s answer to the , with it’s full metal build as well as rear mounted fingerprint scanner. The 5.5″ device will sport a full HD screen plus a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor — a departure from their home-grown Kirin SoCs. Nevertheless, the Snapdragon 616 will be paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage.What it does have over the Redmi Note 3 is a dedicated microSD card slot which allows you to expand that small internal memory. Because of the fact that honor ditched the hybrid SIM set up, users can use two SIM cards and the microSD storage simultaneously. It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with their EMUI 3.1 skin running over it.For camera optics, the device will sport a 13MP f/2.0 primary shooter with dual-LED flash to help out in low light conditions, as well as a 5-megapixel f/2.4 front shooter. The phone will draw power from a fairly large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0.The honor 5X is going for RMB1,099 in China (around RM730) which is only a touch higher than the Redmi Note 3’s 16GB version and the same price as the 32GB version. In Malaysia you can get an imported Redmi Note 3 () for under RM1,000, so the question is: How low will honor go?The honor 7 Enhanced isn’t all that different than the already good un-enhanced version which we  a lot. The only enhancement is the fact that this device will now come with 32GB of internal storage and Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.While the bump in storage from 16GB might not be that big of a deal to some, many felt that one of the biggest problems with the honor 7 was the lack of storage space. Now with double that, this device just got a whole lot better.Besides that, this will be the first non-nexus smartphone in Malaysia to be officially sold with Android M out-of-the-box. So, you get to have all those awesome Marshmallow features to yourself.The device features a 5.2″ full HD display on the front with an octa-core Kirin 935 processor clocked at 2.2GHz paired with 3GB of RAM. Camera-wise it has a 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash. The front camera is an 8MP unit with its own front-facing flash to help with those low-light selfies.In China, the honor 7 Enhanced is going for RMB 1,999 (around RM1330) — the same price as the honor 7, with the original getting a bump down to RMB1,799 (around RM1,200) — which is quite the steal. In Malaysia, the honor 7 is priced at RM1,399 so we expect the new Enhanced version match the original’s price."

Rory Lee,Did you damage your device? Soon it’ll bleed to let you know,,"bleed,car bleeding,casing bleed,color changing polymer,colour changing polymer,early damage detection,how to see tiny cracks,polymer coating","Cool stuff,Others",2016-01-20,"Sometimes, a tiny crack is all it takes to cause severe damage to an object. It’s these tiny cracks that we don’t see because they’re often impossible to spot in, for example, your car’s windscreen. However, these cracks become the first weaknesses in any object and could potentially lead to something really bad somewhere down the road.Well, a University of Illinois research has led to a  coating that could be an important early damage warning system, making it easier to find cracks or damage in particular objects by making them bleed.This polymer coating consists of tiny micro beads that crack open, causing a chemical reaction that will visibly highlight any damage with colour. These beads are pH sensitive so any damage will cause a colour change — from yellow to red — without the need for additional chemicals. The bigger the crack or scratch, the deeper the object will bleed as more capsules are affected.What’s good about this coating is that it works on multiple kinds of polymers that can coat metals, other polymers and even glass. Plus, they’re apparently not too expensive either, but no specific quote of a price was given. What’s more, the coating shows no sign of degradation — meaning the microcapsules will stay intact until actual cracks or damage happens.The application possibilities of this technology are endless. Since only 5% of a polymer needs to be microcapsules to have a strong damage indication ability, you can apply it to a myriad of things. While this can prove useful to big projects like rocket launches into space as well as deep sea exploration, there are also plenty of everyday products that can benefit.Off the top of my head would be your action cam/smartphone’s waterproof casing. Those things are transparent so it’s incredible difficult to find small cracks in their seal, but all it takes is a little nick to let the water in and damage your precious device. Planes and vehicles stand to benefit from this polymer too, as important components in these machines can be coated to allow for early damage detection which could potentially save lives. It’s kind of nice to think that your car could bleed for you before you have to bleed yourself.[, ]"

So,  anyone?According to Windows Central, multiple sources have confirmed with them that February 1 will be the date that Microsoft reveals details about the device including pricing and availability.

It is also said to have an 8MP/5MP rear-front camera combo with an LED flash.What is interesting is that they also note that this could very well be the last Lumia device of 2016 as they said both the rumoured Lumia 850 and Lumia 750 have been  in July of 2015. Then again that article also said that the Lumia 550 was cancelled, so, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt.With the abrupt cancellation of both Lumia devices, it is unlikely that Microsoft will sit on their hands and not launch any more mobile devices this year.

Rory Lee,Sometimes it’s all about the feel: What’s the best phone you’ve held?,,,,2016-01-18,"Pick up your phone, yes that one. The one that’s never more than an arm’s reach from you at all times. The one that has probably been in the bathroom with you more times than the toilet roll has.

And no, I don’t mean this in a metaphorical out-of-body-experience sense, I mean this in a literal sense. We spend every waking moment (some sleeping) of our lives holding onto a little brick that probably weighs no more than a really heavy spoon at a posh restaurant, but most of us put little to no thought into how a device feels in the hand when deciding on a purchase. It’s all about specs and that’s rather unfortunate.I was scrolling lazily through one day when I noticed an interesting  by  (props for the dope name) asking the subreddit about what Android phone they felt had the best feel in the hand. Honestly, the responses surprised me — there were a surprising number of non-metal smartphones.That got me thinking, what  the best feeling smartphone I’ve ever held in my hand? With all the smartphone manufacturers pursuing metal and glass bodied phones as the agreed ‘standard’ for a premium build and feel, the question becomes: Does that really give the best feel in the hand? Based on the Reddit thread the answer was no. So, I asked the other writers here at SoyaCincau.com, as well as the other sites under the , to see if we could find out.Here are what we think are the best phones we’ve ever held in our hands before.

Rory Lee,Huawei P9 to come in four models — one of which has a dual-camera set up,,"Android,Barcelona,dual camera,huawei,Huawei P9,Huawei P9 enhanced,Huawei P9 variants,Huawei P9lite,Huawei P9max,Kirin 950,MWC,rumour,rumour mill,smart phone,smartphone","Android,huawei,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-01-19,"Big smartphone manufacturers seem to love adding variants to their popular devices so you can pretty much expect at least two versions of what is essentially the same smartphone (or at least under the same line) that will cater to different people’s needs.  isn’t bucking this trend as new information has surfaced that they’re launching four different variants of their upcoming  handset — one more than last year. What’s more, the fourth device will feature a dual rear camera setup.According to a report on VentureBeat by Evan Blass, otherwise known as , Huawei’s P9 lineup will include the regular P9, a budget-friendly P9lite, a larger P9max as well as an unnamed “feature-enhanced P9″. Although Blass noted that his source fell short of dubbing it a premium model, this enhanced P9 is said to feature a larger screen (though not as large as the P9max) more RAM, more internal storage as well as a dual 12-megapixel rear-facing camera.This isn’t new for the Chinese smartphone manufacturer however as they’ve already tried the dual-camera set up on the 2014-2015 . In fact, this new P9’s camera is supposed to be a second generation upgrade of that very dual-camera. Therefore, it will likely mean that the P9’s dual-camera will offer the same additional features afforded by the honor 6 Plus’ like post-capture refocus, simulated aperture adjustment and filter application plus what VentureBeat says will be “even more unique capabilities” as this camera concept has been further refined.Is two better than one? If our  on the upcoming LG G5 is any indication, it would appear smartphone manufacturers definitely think so, as that device is rumoured to sport not only a dual-screen setup like the LG V10 but also a dual rear mounted camera. That said, these are merely rumours as there has been no official confirmation beyond a person with alleged knowledge of Huawei so take this with a grain of salt.One thing is for sure though none of the P9 variants will feature a QHD resolution screen (2560×1440 pixels). As with all Huawei devices (except the Nexus 6P which we can all argue can be considered more of a Google device), the company feels that the slightly better screen and image quality offered by a QHD screen just isn’t worth the shorter battery life. We were pretty  with the Mate S’ battery life, so maybe they do know what they’re doing.As far as specs are concerned, Blass’ source didn’t reveal anything, but we did come across a device that posted a  on Geekbench that we believe could be the Kirin 950-powered Huawei P9. With that kind of horsepower and now a dual-camera, suffice to say we’re excited.Despite all of this information and anticipation, Blass indicates that Huawei will not launch these smartphones during the Barcelona Mobile World Congress’ timeframe, choosing instead to give them a dedicated launch several weeks after MWC. However, it is said that Huawei is expected to unveil a Surface Book-like 2-in-1 in Barcelona next month but there are unfortunately no details on this product for the time being.[]"

This is because WhatsApp realises that many of their customers did not possess credit or debit cards and were afraid of losing their access to this service.According to the company, nearly a billion people around the world rely on this app to stay in touch with their friends and family across the globe. Since this app can basically let you reach as far as there is some semblance of an Internet connection, rural folks were worried that — due to their limited to non-existent access to banking services — they would lose this connection to their loved ones.Besides that, WhatsApp has also ensured their users that they would not be resorting to third-party advertisements on their application to generate income. Instead, they’re testing tools that will allow users to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organisations that they want to talk to. Think of it as a messaging gateway for enterprises. For example, you could possibly communicate with your bank about whether a recent transaction was fraudulent or with an airline about your recent flight delay. Also imagine being able to receive TAC PIN number from your bank on WhatsApp instead of SMS. This means instant updates that could otherwise take hours — a good idea in concept at least.The thing about this is, have you ever paid for WhatsApp? Yeah sure, some of you early adopters on  and  might have had to pay USD0.99 (RM4.40), but I think the rest of us haven’t paid for it once. I know I haven’t, despite all that “free-for-first-year” thing. What about you guys? How many of you have paid for WhatsApp and are annoyed with this?[]"

While we weren’t that surprised that the  was #1 on their list, we were shocked at how MUCH further it was from the competition. Let me give you a hint: 132k.According to the popular cross-platform benchmarker, the average score of an iPhone 6s Plus is 132,620 points, the only device to break the 100k mark in 2015.On paper, this gap doesn’t seem possible as the iPhone 6s Plus is powered by a dual-core Twister A9 chip that is clocked at a tame 1.84GHz  and a PowerVR GT7600 GPU paired with (a frankly depressing) 2GB of RAM. Comparatively, the second placed  packs a monstrous next-gen octa-core Kirin 950 SoC — four Cortex A72 CPU cores clocked at 2.3GHz, four Cortex A53 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz and a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU — plus 4GB of RAM.Yet somehow the iPhone 6s Plus outperforms it by about 30%.

However, it is worth noting that these are average scores so the number of benchmarks ran as well as the conditions in which these benchmarks were run should also factor into the results. That said, I don’t think anything short of a nuclear war could stop the iPhone 6s Plus from running away with the crown.[, ]"

Rory Lee,ASUS ZenFone Zoom camera comparison: Does optical zoom really make a difference?,,,,2016-01-16,"recently  the world’s thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphone, the , here in Malaysia and the first question on everyone’s mind is: Whats the big deal? Now the word “optical zoom” may not be a term everyone recognises. Some of you might be thinking that your current smartphones can zoom jolly well, so why would you bother about this device?You see, the zoom commonly found on your smartphone camera is what people call “digital zoom” which essentially crops the image to a smaller frame and enlarges to make it seem like you’re bringing the subject closer to you. No lens movement happens within the camera module. On the other hand, conventional DSLRs and their respective lenses use “optical zoom” which works when the different elements that make up a lens move around to refract light differently, bringing the image closer to you.The biggest difference though is that when you use digital zoom to zoom in on a subject, you lose quality, because you are no longer using the full image — rather you’re only using a cropped fraction of it. Optical zoom then is the way to go if you want to zoom (but not with your feet) and you don’t want to lose image quality at the same time.If the benefits are so great, why don’t more manufacturers equip their smartphones with optical zoom? The biggest reason is size. With more than one element in your lens, the whole camera module tends to get pretty ginormous. Think  or the . However, with ASUS’s 13-megapixel camera on the ZenFone Zoom, they have used a special dual-periscope design to mount the camera horizontally across the back of the smartphone, letting them hide the camera bump with the ZenFone’s signature curved back.But, to say that this tiny lens array strapped to the back of a smartphone is on par with those on a DSLR’s lens might be pushing it. In fact, we weren’t even that convinced this whole “optical zoom smartphone” thing would work very well. So, while we were at the launch event, we came up with the brilliant idea of pitting ASUS’s camera-centric ZenFone Zoom against some of the best cameras in the market right now. And whaddya know, we conveniently had a , a  and an  with us at the time. Here’s the camera zoom shootout you’ve been waiting for."

Its 13-megapixel Panasonic SmartFSI sensor has a 10-element f/2.7-4.8 aperture lens that utilises a dual-periscope horizontal-mount design allowing it to not only have a massive 3x optical zoom, but also maintain a relatively thin form factor. Besides that the primary camera comes with other goodies like optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus and a dual-tone LED flash. To help the camera out in low light, the ZenFone Zoom comes with ASUS’ Pixel Master 2.0 technology which is renown for its low light and long exposure capabilities.If 13-megapixels isn’t enough, ASUS have bundled a Super Resolution function into the camera which allows it to take gigantic 52-megapixel photos, by stitching four 13MP shots together for more detail and clarity. While the sample shots on display (taken by Peter Tan) looked rather impressive, we would have to fully test out the functions for ourselves before making a decision.Being a camera-centric phone, the smartphone comes with dedicated camera hardware buttons — a dedicated shutter and video record button — which were awesome and tactile. The device also has equally tactile dedicated zoom keys that can double as volume rockers when not in the camera app.Zooming in and out with the keys was pretty satisfying as the phone gives you a little buzz when it hits the maximum 3x optical zoom. We did notice that launching the camera from the shutter button (which you can do by holding it down) was a little slow (maybe 2-3) seconds. Besides that, the shutter speed and time between shots were not as snappy as something like an iPhone 6s or a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+.However, it does have a complete manual mode with full manual controls that can be easily accessed via a tap of the M button located to the top of the on-screen shutter button.What we were impressed with was the macro capabilities of this device. ASUS boasts a 5cm macro focal distance and from our brief testing, you could get pretty darn close to the subject and still focus with no problems. The front camera is an average 5MP f/2.0 unit with a wide-angle lens and support for Pano Selfie.For a better understanding of this device’s cameras and what optical versus digital zoom really means, stay tuned for our camera comparison.Spec wise, the ZenFone Zoom isn’t all that different from ASUS’ previous flagship, the . It has an updated quad-core Intel Atom Z3590 processor clocked at 2.5GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable (via microSD up to 64GB) storage.The smartphone also comes running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’ ZenUI running on top. It’s a shame that it isn’t a more updated version of Android but we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update. Connectivity wise, the device will have a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot and will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi.From our brief hands-on, though, the device handles itself quite well, not stuttering or lagging when switching between applications, then again with 4GB of RAM and a high-end Intel chip, this isn’t really surprising.Being a premium phone, it is definitely built well. The nice rounded metal rails were fabulous to hold in the hand and the back curved nicely to fit in our palms. The camera unit is barely noticeable, letting you believe that it could just be a normal camera. Kudos to ASUS for hiding such a beast of a lens array.ASUS says that the leather on the back of the device is real leather, not some faux nonsense, and we were inclined to believe them…until we took the rear panel off. But, when we held the panel by itself, we started to doubt their claims. That said, the stitching around the “ergonomic hump” is real as we could move the thread around.It felt flimsy and plasticky so be careful when you rip that baby off. The bump on the back to help ergonomics was interesting, to say the least, and we quite liked it since it helped a little with the ergonomics. But as most of us usually take photos with a certain finger positions (like pictured earlier), we didn’t really notice it helping much with grip. What did feel nice were once again the metal rails and those fantastic buttons.ASUS also includes a wrist strap that attaches itself to the back of the device, which is a nice touch. As a whole it was fantastic to hold in the hand and it definitely feels like the premium price you’re paying for.However, do note that from the devices on display, there was a difference between the front of the device between the black model and the white model. The black one will remind you of every other ZenFone model with that familiar chin, but the white one seems to have done away with the chin, instead moving the ASUS logo to the bottom of the device.The device is priced at RM2,099 and ASUS says that the device will be available locally at the end of January."
Rory Lee,Netflix is sick and tired of your VPN and Proxies,,"Netflix,Netflix blocking proxy,Netflix blocking VPN,Netflix Malaysia,Netflix Malaysia proxy,Netflix Malaysia VPN,Netflix Proxy,Netflix VPN,proxy,vpn","Android,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-01-15,"recently went “global” and everyone got very excited. We’ve all heard good things about this streaming service, from the shows they have to the quality of their stream plus all the Netflix exclusives like Daredevil and Jessica Jones. It’s gotten so popular that we see it mentioned in TV shows themselves, that one time in Suits when Mike Ross wanted to piss Edward Darby off for example.But, when we took a hard look at their catalogue from our Malaysian accounts, we were quite bummed out that there were so . Even popular comedy series How I Met Your Mother wasn’t there. So the craftier of us went ahead and used VPNs (Virtual Private Network) and proxies to mask our IP addresses and as a result, gain more access to their content.Well, it seems like Netflix has had enough of our scheming ways and has said openly that they’re putting a stop to VPN users once and for all.For those of you who don’t know what a VPN or proxy does, it basically masks your IP address, preventing a website — Netflix for example — from finding out where you are connecting from. So, with a VPN or proxy you can set it up to have the site or app detect that you’re connecting from an American IP address, for example, then the region locked site would grant you access to their content as if you were coming from the US. If you’d like a more detailed explanation you can head on over to Gizmodo’s article on .In short when it comes to Netflix, this allows you to bypass region restrictions and circumvent the walls Netflix have put up (because of licensing, censorship and other technical reasons) and have access to whatever content you want — something Netflix is clearly upset about.In a blog statement by Netflix Vice President of Content Delivery Architecture David Fullagar, he said that Netflix would continue to enforce content licensing according to geographical location. However, they did say that they were working on making all their content available to all their subscribers — something they anticipate being able to do.For now, though, they’re focusing on blocking proxies and ensuring that you can only access content from your own region. Although they didn’t say exactly how or when they would block the proxies aside from a vague “as technology continues to evolve and we are evolving with it” line.One possible way we could see them doing it is locking your account by credit card. For example, if you wanted to use an American account, you would have to have an American credit card, likewise, if you’re using a Malaysian credit card you can only access the Malaysian Netflix content. Although they could also take more drastic measures and force you to use your IC/identification numbers to register. Though we doubt it since it would cause some amount of hindrance to user experience. Either way, it looks like your proxy days are numbered.If you want to know more about Netflix in Malaysia, check out our list of .[, ]"

The  was one of the last remaining flagships to feature a removable battery and an expandable microSD slot. This is a trend that is slowly diminishing as brands are moving towards a fully enclosed design for a better look and feel. The  is said to be following  but new information suggests that they won’t be abandoning the needs of power users. The folks at CNet Korea has posted a render of what the new flagship could look like. Instead of a curvy shape as seen on the G Flex and G4 models, the new G5 will have a flatter design with round edges. Another radical change is the volume rocker and power buttons are now purportedly moved towards the sides. Despite having a full unibody design, the source also claims that the battery is still removable. How is this even possible? Apparently their engineers have made a mechanism that allows the bottom portion to be removed, giving you access to its battery. The lower end of the device will get a drawer-like design that helps to keep dust and water away. When we think of a full unibody design with a removable battery, we thought of the old  that was released about 6 years ago. It had a sturdy body made from a single block of aluminum and the removable cap at the bottom gives you access to its SIM, microSD and removable battery. This was the time when HTC was at its peak. If the alleged LG G5 design is true, this is something interesting to look forward to next month. However, some LG fans might be disappointed if they are doing away with its signature rear-mounted volume and power buttons. [ ,  ]"

Rory Lee,Upgrade your Windows 8 device or be exposed to security risks,,"IE,Internet Explorer,microsoft,Microsoft Edge,Microsoft Internet Explorer,Microsoft stops support for Internet Explorer,Microsoft stops support for Windows 8,Microsoft Windows 10,Microsoft Windows 7,Microsoft Windows 8,No support for Windows 8,Windows 8.1","Industry in General,Windows 10",2016-01-13,"As with all old software,  is terminating support for , as well as older versions of its Internet Explorer (IE) web browser — IE 8, IE 9 and IE 10. This is to facilitate the push towards Microsoft’s new operating system, . When we say terminate, we don’t mean that your Windows 8 machine will just up and die or stop working straight away, it’s just that Windows 8 won’t receive updates, security fixes and bug fixes it used to get.If you are running on Windows 8 though, don’t worry because there is a simple way around this issue.Besides the obvious upgrade to Windows 10 being one of the solutions, Windows 8 users can also upgrade to Windows 8.1, which based on their lifecycle fact sheet, will continue to receive updates for two more years until January 9, 2018. If you’ve read the horror stories of Windows 10’s ominous privacy terms and want to avoid such dangers by staying on an older version of Windows, you can now do so.As you can see, today also marks the end of Windows 7 service Pack 1’s mainstream support — but don’t worry you will still continue to receive security updates as extended support will go all the way to January 14, 2020. All you lose is the mainstream support which includes free incident support, warranty claims and fixes for non-security and security bugs, plus design changes and feature requests. Based on statistics published by Tech Crunch, 2-3% of PCs (30-40 million devices) are still running on Windows 8, while Windows 7 is said to currently be in use on .Why is it important to keep your system updated and within Microsoft’s support lifecycle? Well, the first and most obvious reason is security. As operating systems lose their security updates, they become vulnerable to new malware and potential attacks, which puts your information as well as your system at risk. Microsoft, via updates, patches these new vulnerabilities when they come up so that these exploitable holes are fixed. Once that support ends, you lose all protection against future vulnerabilities.Besides Windows 8, Microsoft is also terminating support for older versions of IE, urging users to upgrade either to IE 11 or Microsoft’s new Edge browser. I’ve personally never been a fan of IE because of how messy the interface is and how clunky it makes browsing feel, so it comes as a surprise to me that 20% of the desktop web browser market still uses the older versions of IE (8, 9, 10) as their daily driver. Unfortunately for those people, they will have to migrate to either the new IE 11, Microsoft Edge, or other third party browsers like  or , or else they would be facing security vulnerabilities when browsing the web.Microsoft Edge, the built-in browser on Windows 10, promised much in terms of functionality and performance. Things like extensions were supposed to come to Edge to keep it up to par with browsers like Google’s Chrome but til this day, there is still  anywhere. I don’t know about you guys but I definitely need my extensions.Killing off old software is nothing new, and I welcome it because not only does it allow software developers to focus on their latest and greatest product, it also allows them to free up valuable resources to focus on new projects. Resources that would otherwise go to updating and patching old software can now be redirected towards either new software or the improvement of current software.[, , ]"

The only reason we switch on navigation apps (like ) in the morning is to find out which is the least congested route, but doing so every morning, having to manually set your location each time can be rather cumbersome.So what if you don’t want to have to set your location each morning but still want to find out which is the least congested/fastest way to get to work on time?  has the answer.With the continuous development of Waze, it has become a fantastic navigation app and I personally use it over Google Maps, less because I feel that it is a better navigation app that Maps (which I don’t) and more because of its nifty, user-friendly features.Features like knowing where you’re going based on your history — for example, if you leave for work at 9 AM a few days in a row the app will suggest “work” the next time you fire it up at around the same time of day — as well as changing your route on the fly based on the changing traffic.That said, I do feel that the application updates the routes rather slowly (especially when it comes to congestion) and the navigation isn’t as crisp and informative as Google Maps’. Plus I really hate the way it looks and how slow it is to launch and calculate routes.With Google Maps v9.19 though, it seems that there is an alternative to that. With the acquisition of Waze by the search engine giant,  has slowly integrated more and more of Waze’s features into their own navigation app. Now, along with a whole host of interesting new things, Google Maps has support for Driving Mode — but you’ll have to activate it first.Driving Mode isn’t what you think it means. It doesn’t convert your phone into a landscape screen that has gigantic buttons for doing simple tasks to like answering your phone calls so you won’t get distracted on the road. Instead, it guesses (based on your history) where you’re going and it gives you live updates on the traffic situation as well as the fastest routes to your destination, without the need for you to set a location beforehand.However, thanks to the comments section, users have pointed out that signing out and signing into Maps itself will trigger the feature and unlock the additional options. From there, simply hit “Add Driving shortcut” and you can access this awesome new feature.Once in you will be greeted with the new interface that shows you multicoloured roads (much like Waze) with different colours indicating different levels of congestion.

Without which 9to5Mac estimates the headphones’ battery life at just under 4 hours on a single charge. These AirPods could also be port-less requiring you to charge them in that case.Ditching the 3.5mm jack is nothing new in the mobile phone industry, even Oppo has done it with their uber-thin R5. While Apple’s decision could be driven by the fact that they want to make the iPhone 7 thinner, it could also be because — with all these waterproof iPhone rumours floating about — having a 3.5mm jack would mean another headache when trying to make the device waterproof.When the original iPhone came out right until the iPhone 4s, the headphone jack was located at the top of the device. Since the iPhone 5’s inception, however, the 3.5mm jack has transferred to the bottom, a trend that has carried on even to the iPhone 6s of today.Apple isn’t a stranger to changing things up with their line of products; removing the optical drives from most of their computer devices was one move, changing the headphone jack placements is another. When they made the first move on the iPhone 5, it was because it apparently made more sense to have all your cables sticking out on one end of the device. People were also more inclined to placing their devices head first into their pockets — something I agree with.With their upcoming iPhone 7, Apple is looking to mix things up even more — design wise — with a  and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, opting instead to stick with either a Lightning port or a wireless Bluetooth solution. The thing is, wireless devices run on battery, and if you’re already charging your smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, tablet and over-ear headphones, do you really want to charge your earbuds too?The worst part? Having to charge your earbuds are just the tip of the iceberg. At first, Apple locks you within their app ecosystem. Then they don’t allow you to use third-party ports and connectors. Now, they don’t even want you to use third-party headphones, forcing you to stick with their proprietary ones. What about those of us who have bought a solid set of headphones with a 3.5mm jack? Are we forced to use an adapter?Apple has always made some beautiful devices, with gorgeous fit and finishes, but ever since they launched their rendition of a , we’re a little worried about the new iPhone. Maybe the  was a dud, the ugly apple pie you hide from your guests when they come over for dinner. A lazy oversight. For Apple’s sake, we sure hope so.[]"
Rory Lee,Leaked Xperia C6 images show a pink bezel-less device,,"Android,smartphone,Sony,Sony Mobile,Sony Xperia C5,sony xperia c5 ultra,Sony Xperia C6,sony xperia z5,Sony Xperia Z5 Pink","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Sony",2016-01-12,"‘s last flagship, the  was a little hit or miss. While there were some who liked it, everyone in our office was not impressed with their “flagship”. It was a little sluggish and for a device rated so highly on DxOMark, we were quite disappointed with the camera.With a device that left much to be desired and a quiet CES 2016 showing, Sony fans must be hungry for something cool to come out of the tech giant. Well, we don’t have their new flagship for you, but here’s a pretty pink-gold (rose gold? It could just be gold with bad white balance/me being a little colour blind) Sony device.It appears all of Sony’s quietness hasn’t stopped someone from leaking what looks to be the Xperia C6 — sporting a sexy rounded bezel-less design with Sony’s trademark camera-shutter-esque power button. If you’ve been paying attention to futuristic sci-fi movies, you’ll know that bezel-less is the way to go and we were glad Sony are going one step further from the near bezel-less display that appeared on the  from last year.That said, this doesn’t look like a C6 Ultra simply because it looks relatively small in what we’re assuming is the leakster’s hands. Unless of course he/she has gargantuan hands. Either way, if we look at the device’s designs, the good looks we’ve grown accustomed to in a Sony device are all mostly apparent with that thin body and the familiar shape. The edges are rounded like the Xperia C5 Ultra which should make it nicer to hold than the Xperia Z5 though it does seem that the device still has a flat back.There is also a distinct lack of front-facing speakers (aw man) despite all that chin and forehead sony are giving it. What’s a little unnerving is that the back panel of this device seems to be peeling off — which we hope won’t be a problem on the finished product. Sony devices have had pretty good build quality after all.The Xperia C6 is rumoured to sport a 5.5″ full HD display up front, with a 2.0GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor running on the inside. Besides that, there isn’t much information left about the device itself. I guess we’ll have to wait for the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year to (hopefully) find out more.Since it’s pink though, it could potentially tie in with an upcoming pink Sony device that the company has been endlessly teasing on their , With, nine images teased thus far, this device’s reveal has been set for 12 January 2016 and the folks over at Xperia Blog reckon it isn’t a pink Xperia Z5.Hype?: The new Pink smartphone from Sony is a Xperia Z5.

This is due to blue light emitted from digital screens that can cause eye fatigue. This could even cause  in the long run.With the upcoming iOS 9.3 update for the iPhone and iPad, Apple wants you to sleep better at night with its new “Night Shift” feature. According to Apple, Night Shift aims to make it easier for you to sleep by making the display more pleasant to your eyes. Using your device’s time and GPS, it will know when it is sunset and would gradually change the display to show warmer colours, cutting down on blue light emission. As a result, it would help to increase  naturally, a vital component to get better sleep at night. Of course, this isn’t entirely new. Most smartphones from China including Xiaomi, OPPO, Huawei and BenQ have their own low blue light or reading mode that does the same thing. The only difference is that Apple is making it automatic based on your current time.  There’s no mention if there’s an option to turn it off, but we are sure it would be important for those actually working night shifts. Apart from this low blue light mode, the new iOS 9.3 update will also introduce a multi-user feature for the iPad. This would allow several people to share a single device and the experience will be customised based on their individual profiles. Unfortunately, this appears to be catered for schools and we are not sure if they would extend this to end users as well. On top of that, the native Notes app can be secured with your fingerprints.

Look at their  series where the  and the  were wildly different — one had a full metal body and a fingerprint scanner — yet they were both launched only two months apart.Would it really surprise you then that they would do something as radical as having two different back panel/constructions on their upcoming flagship device? Well if it comes true that will definitely still surprise me.Of the two devices, the first one is purported to have curved 2.5D glass at the front and the back of the device with a metal frame. Think  or . This variant is also supposed to feature a 1080p full HD resolution display with the possibility of having 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.On the other hand, the supposed second phone is said to feature an all-metal design — that means full-metal rear housing instead of curved 2.5D glass. Additionally, the device is said to have a higher QHD 2K resolution display and it could possibly house the 4GB RAM/64GB internal storage variant.Other than that, both devices should be identical — sporting a Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a suggested screen size that can range from 5 to 5.2-inches. The smartphone is also said to have a 3,600 mAh battery and become official by January 21, though sales are only expected to start on February 8.Of course, this is all just guess work based on rumours at this point and for all we know it could be the other way around. That said, this isn’t the first time Xiaomi have done two versions of the same device as the  and  are essentially the same device except for the fact that the Pro variant has a more powerful processor plus more RAM and a higher resolution screen.If these rumours of the Mi 5 are true though, it would be the first time that the Chinese company have gone with two completely different back constructions on a phone.

The device that aims to reinvent the phone with its 3 in 1 proposition – an iPod, a phone and an Internet communications device. At the same time, Apple had also dropped the word “Computer” from its company name, to better reflect its growing product portfolio that goes beyond Macs. The move of getting into the phone business was timely. Close to a billion mobile phones was sold in 2006 worldwide. That’s about 5X more than PCs, over 7X the number of MP3 players and 10X more than digital cameras at that time. Steve Jobs was targeting just 1% market share with a goal of selling 10 million iPhones for 2008. The iPhone was revolutionary back then with its full touch-screen capacitive display with its multi-touch technology. Browsing the web was smooth and there were no cluttered keys or buttons that get in the way. Steve Jobs even mocked the use of a stylus as the iPhone was intuitive enough to be used with your bare fingers. Compared to today’s iPhones, the original model was very barebones. At a time when smartphone makers are moving towards 3G, the iPhone was only a 2G device supporting up to EDGE. There was no AppStore, meaning you’re stuck with its native apps, and the common copy and paste feature was only introduced with iOS 3.0, 2 years later.At the time, many had doubts on the iPhone. The base 4GB model was priced from US$499 (RM1,746 at that time) on a 2-year contract. If you want more storage, the 8GB version was going for US$599 (about RM2096), also on contract. Even Steve Ballmer of Microsoft had a laugh about it and this was a time when Windows Mobile and Nokia Symbian phones reign supreme. When it was eventually released in 2008, Apple  phones, surpassing its original goal and the rest is history. For Malaysia, the first iPhone to reach here officially was the . It was priced at RM2,540 for 8GB and RM2,960 for 16GB models. Until this very day, the iPhone is still considered as the de facto benchmark for the smartphone industry. It changed the way we interact with touch-screen devices and how we consume content and services on a mobile device. However, after Steve Job’s departure, it seems that Apple hasn’t been innovating as much as before, with the competition offering compelling choices at a much competitive price point. For Steve Baller, he regretted not moving into the hardware business earlier, which saw themselves overtaken by Apple and Samsung.

If you can’t wrap your head around what I’m talking about, take a look at this short clip by Gizmodo:Pretty freaking cool. However, Mashable’s Pete Pachal does note that while all the moving around is cool and stuff, when the screens do come together, he could see the seams between the displays which we found pretty disappointing. Then again this is relatively new tech so there are plenty of kinks to work out.Another TV that Samsung had on display showcased the ability for the TV to change its aspect ratios with the modular technology. The display could rotate two sides of the screen to switch it from a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 4:3 aspect ratio in seconds. This means you can use up all of those valuable pixels for either of the popular aspect ratios, eliminating those annoying black bars. It’s pretty cool but once again Pete noted that the seam was visible.One final modular TV on display, however, showcased what is realistically the closest to a completed product — a massive 170″ wall TV that is made up of several smaller panels. Mashable notes that this is perhaps the most practical use of the modular technology, especially since the seams were not visible.Not only does it allow manufacturers to push the TV’s size to even more ridiculous proportions, Mashable notes that it also makes these monstrous TVs easier to ship because movers can break down a huge set to smaller screens.That’s cool and all but we can think of one more way to utilise these modular panels. Assuming they’re easy to remove and hot swap, parents could easily remove a section of the TV to prevent their kids from watching it when they’re being grounded or during their study sessions. In fact, you could probably remove one panel and bring it along with you on holiday to discourage thieves from nicking your precious television. Then again they’d have to have a pretty sizable moving truck to be able to ship a 170″ television in the first place.Either way, as all modular things usually are, the possibilities are almost endless. What do you guys think of a modular TV? Can you think of any other useful things it can bring to the table that your current TV set can’t? Let us know in the comments below.[, ]"

Alexander Wong,Maybank and Visa lets you make payments from your wrist,,"Contactless Payment,Maybank,Maybank PayBand,Maybank Visa PayBand,NFC,Smart Wearable,Visa,Visa Payband,wearable,Wearable Payment","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-01-08,"Paying by cash is troublesome. You would need to keep a sufficient amount in your wallet and if you don’t have exact change, you’ll end up with bulky coins in your pocket. While Touch ‘n Go is gaining momentum in stores, here’s another way to pay without cash.Maybank together with Visa has just announced the PayBand, the first payment wearable in Malaysia. According to Visa, Malaysians are moving towards contactless transactions and they are more likely to shop at a place that accepts one. How it works is somewhat similar to the Maybank’s , which is a sticker that you can stick onto your smartphone. Details of Maybank’s Visa PayBand isn’t available on their site, but if it follows the same mechanism, you can make payments up to RM250 without the need of signatures or pin numbers. Think of it as a Touch ‘n Go in a wristband form and it charges directly to your credit card. In terms of acceptance, it will work with Visa PayWave terminals throughout Malaysia. Just like that PayWave enabled credit card, you would need to wave it in less than 4cm from the terminal to make a payment. This apparently is better than handing over a physical card as there’s no chance for merchants to obtain your full card details. You can learn more about its availability .The PayBand device isn’t entirely new as  had introduced this in the UK in wristband, keychain fob and sticker format. So if you’re going for a jog, you can stop for coffee or breakfast without carrying your wallet. We have yet to see the Payband ourselves and we are curious to know if there are offering customisable band options. With most smartphones and even smartwatches these days supporting NFC, we are still surprised that mobile NFC payments have yet to catch on in Malaysia. There were several attempts by Maxis with , in collaboration with CIMB and Maybank. Unfortunately, it was short-lived and we haven’t heard of them since. Carrying an extra band would be quite cumbersome if you’re already wearing a smartband or a smartwatch. Having SamsungPay and Apple Pay in Malaysia would be a more elegant solution don’t you think?Would you consider getting a Visa PayBand? Let us know in the comments below.[    ]"

One2Touch have introduced the SlimType — an NFC keyboard smartphone cover designed specifically for the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. Do you want to touch it?Smartphones took the world by storm as people discovered exactly how much they could do on a tiny little device that fit in their pocket. Users began using them for instant messaging, web browsing, social media browsing and media consumption. In fact, people are using them for anything but making a call.However, productivity has been the weakest link in the smartphone’s chain, due to many reasons. First is the fact that with screen real estate that is only the size of your palm, it is quite difficult to view something like a spreadsheet, for instance. Matters are made worse when users have to type because the virtual keyboard usually takes up half the screen.Plus it isn’t very satisfying typing on a virtual keyboard — one reason why  kept the keyboard on the . With SlimType though, it looks like you can use your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge as a productivity device.There is one major problem that we’ve picked up on, though. Have you seen it yet? Yup, it doesn’t have a kickstand.Most tablet keyboard covers either rely on the device’s built-in kickstand or they fold in some sort of elaborate manner to form a triangular base. On the SlimType though, none of those options appear to be available. We don’t know about you but a kickstand seems mighty useful when you’re trying to be productive.The keyboard doesn’t look like it has much travel or much of a mechanical feel, which makes sense since it’s a phone cover. Doesn’t mean it will be nice to type on, though.Maybe this keyboard can work in a pinch or if you simply hate virtual keyboards and what it does to the size of your screen. Will it truly turn your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge into much more of a productivity beast than it already is? We doubt it.A cool attempt, but alas it doesn’t seem very practical. Although this device, which is on , currently doesn’t ship directly to Malaysia, there are still ways to get such products into your hands. Google it you lazy people!We’re the type of people who simply must have the best when it comes to productive typing, so maybe we’re being overcritical. What do you guys think? Would you consider dropping USD39.99 (around RM174) on it?[, , ]"
Rory Lee,Could this be confirmation that Samsung is launching four S7 variants?,,"Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note5,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Battery,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge plus,Samsung Galaxy S7 plus,Spigen","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2016-01-08,"A few days ago, popular leakster  dropped a 360-degree video render of what should be the upcoming . The video, while it gives us some insight into what the regular version of the device should look like, it doesn’t have any renders of the variants.Awhile back, there was some discussion on whether the S7 launch in February would see four variants (the S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge Plus) of Samsung’s new flagship. We didn’t think so, but new information has surfaced recently about the possibility of a Galaxy S7 Plus and a Galaxy S7 edge Plus being launched.Popular case manufacturer Spigen has put their Samsung Galaxy S7 cases on sale on  even before the device has been launched, though the cases are not on . The cases are going from USD14.99 (around RM66).What’s interesting isn’t that the cases are out — because this isn’t the first time Spigen has  — it is that there is a case for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Plus and Galaxy S7 edge Plus. This could very well be confirmation of an earlier @evleaks post about the 4 S7 variants. While we don’t think that Samsung will be launching the S7 Plus and the S7 edge Plus in February, it also doesn’t make sense for Spigen to have the preorder for those cases so soon if Samsung weren’t going to launch their devices until the end of the year.If they do launch four of them at the same time, the devices could either be separated by region, size or even processor. However, if the devices do get separated by region like  and , we’re sure there will be many unhappy Samsung fans.That said, the images look like placeholder/rendered images because if we were to compare them to @OnLeaks’ (who is quite reputable when it comes to leaks) youtube video, you’d notice that Spigen’s model device is missing the -esque rear curves.As a recap of the specs. both the S7 and the S7 edge are said to run either their latest Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 depending on the market paired with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Good news is that that storage is said to be expandable as leaks claim Samsung is  slot that was missing from their 2015 flagships.Camera wise, the Samsungs are said to have a lower megapixel count, at 12MP for the primary, but feature the Korean manufacturer’s latest BRITECELL camera technology that is said to improve low light photography and reduce the camera hump. That coupled with a rumoured f/1.7 aperture lens should see the camera do quite well in low light.The S7 should come in a 5.1″ form-factor while the S7 edge takes on the 5.5″ body. Both devices could also be waterproof,  which looks like  for the upcoming 2016 flagships.[, , ]"

Rory Lee,This is the mechanical Apple Watch you’ve been waiting for,,"apple,apple joke,Apple Watch,H Moser & Cie,joke,Smart Watch,SmartWatch,Swiss Alp Watch,watch","Apple,Industry in General,Mobile Devices",2016-01-08,"Have you ever looked down at your  and thought it was simply  too digital? You’re not alone! Swiss watchmaker H. Moser & Cie, who are seemingly appalled by the smartwatch fad, have launched what is essentially a mechanical Apple Watch.Remember that one guy saying that the Apple Watch looked like it was ? Well, this Swiss company just took making fun of the Apple Watch to a whole new level.You might have noticed that Apple’s coveted Watch has finally  to our shores. If you haven’t, what rock have you been living under?! While many see the Apple Watch as a marvelous piece of engineering, these Swiss watchmakers are unimpressed. So much so they told smartwatch users to “get a life” by upgrading to a mechanical watch.Oops, we’d better not show them our  then.Dubbed the Swiss Alp Watch, H. Moser & Cie’s light-hearted jab at Apple comes complete with an Apple-esque product video, complete with rotating close up shots and cheesy “revolutionary” one-line product descriptions. There’s even audio of what sounds like someone taking a bite out of an apple. Kind of reminds us of the time Ikea took a , complete with the same .As amusing as this video is, the Swiss Alp Watch is certainly no joke. Besides being a carbon copy of Apple’s smartwatch, the Swiss Alp Watch comes in 18-carat white gold body that has the same dimensions as the Apple Watch.It also has a screw-in non-digital crown adorned with an M, which will power on the device with a single twist. Besides that, the watch has a see-through sapphire crystal rear case that allows you to see the watch in all its beautifully-crafted mechanical glory.As far as features are concerned, the watch (obviously) doesn’t have support for phone calls, heartbeat sensors, text messages or sketching. It does, however, show what H. Moser & Cie calls the “most valuable commodity”: The time. It will “let you reconnect with people by getting out there, meeting your friends and spending time with your loved ones”.All that intricate engineering will cost you, as the watch — which is limited to 50 units — costs a whopping USD24,900 (around RM109,000) which is a touch more than the Apple Watch Edition, which will set you back RM80,000. Okay, maybe more of a smack than a touch.Either way, this video shouldn’t be taken too seriously, as The Verge points out because H. Moser & Cie is by no means a large watchmaker. So it’s more likely that this was made simply to be a tongue-in-cheek joke than anything else. It supposedly represents the company’s “resilience” and their “ferocious desire to fight our values and traditions”, embodying everything they believe in.The important thing is that this is compatible with  device.[, , ]"

Rory Lee,Anyone can crash your WhatsApp with the power of emojis,,"Android,emoji crash whatsapp,smartphone,Whatsapp,whatsapp crash,whatsapp emoji,WhatsApp vulnerability,whatsapp weakeness","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-11,"seems to be full of vulnerabilities these days. At first, it tried to steal your  through a malware in WhatsApp’s update, now it seems that you can crash specific users’ apps by sending them a whole bunch of emojis.5,000 emojis to be precise.Researcher Indrajeet Bhuyan reveals that people can cause Android versions of the WhatsApp application to crash by sending them at least 5,000 emojis from the web version of WhatsApp. When a user receives the application and tries to open it, the whole app would crash.The only way to recover from that is to delete the entire conversation. Through our experimentation, it does indeed work. When we tried to open the “malicious” message, sure enough, our application crashed and we had to close and restart it before we could access the app again.However, the other conversations were unaffected by the malicious thread, so as long as you leave that conversation alone it won’t crash the application. This also works for group chats. The only way to access that conversation again is to delete the entire thread and start a new conversation with that contact.That said, if you have 4GB of RAM like we did on our Oppo R7s, you can have varying degrees of success in opening the thread again though you would have to wait awhile. This vulnerability does not extend to the iOS version of WhatsApp as the emojis only cause the app to lag, unlike a previous  that relied on a specific message.Although WhatsApp does have a character limit of 6,000 — to prevent messages that the application cannot handle — it seems that this still far too many as a mere 5,000 emojis will kill the app.When talking about the potential exploits of having such a vulnerability, Bhuyan says that an attacker could be sending abusive messages to their victim, blackmailing or threatening them, then send them 5,000 emojis to crash that thread and make it so that the victim can’t access the thread for evidence again.Let’s hope WhatsApp (or Facebook) pushes out a fix for this soon before people with bad intentions catch on and start abusing this.[, ]"

While smartphone cameras have gotten better with each iteration, one of their flaws have always been a lack of optical zoom.This was because adding an optical zoom would cause your device to be much thicker than a regular smartphone — a compromise device manufacturers were not willing to make. So, unless one was willing to manually zoom with one’s feet, smartphone photographers often had to settle for a grainier picture if they wanted to zoom.With the Zenfone Zoom, however, ASUS is claiming that this is the thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphone…in the world. They accomplished this by mounting the smartphone camera’s dual periscope horizontally across the back of the device. As a result, it boasts a 5mm “ultra-thin edge” thanks to an ergonomic curve that looks a lot like ASUS’s other Zenfones.The primary camera itself, while only sporting 13-megapixels, comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus, a dual-tone LED flash and a SmartFSI Panasonic sensor. To make up for the lack in resolution, ASUS has implemented a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for greater clarity (up to 52MP). It also has ASUS’s PixelMaster 2.0 — a feature famed for its low-light performance.To facilitate the impressive camera specifications, the Zenfone Zoom will have not only have a dedicated shutter button, it also has a dedicated video button.It’s no slouch when it comes to performance either, sporting a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom CPU paired with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB/128GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). The phone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box with ASUS’s ZenUI skin on top.At the front, this camera-centric smartphone features a 5.5″ full-HD display tucked under Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. It also has a metal finish along the rails of the phone to give it a more premium feel. Around the back, there seems to be some differences compared to the one , as that one had some kind of textured back (faux leather perhaps?).However, this could be because the images in the Malaysian site are outdated. If you head on over to the  you can see that the build more closely resembles the one released in Taiwan. Nevertheless, we will find out how it looks like in about a week’s time.The Zenfone Zoom will sport a 3,000 mAh capacity battery, paired with ASUS’s BoostMaster technology. It is supposed to give you a 60% charge in 39 minutes. Although the Zenfone Zoom has support for up to 802.11ac WiFi, it only has one micro-SIM slot for mobile connectivity.In the US, the Zenfone Zoom comes in at around USD399, which translates to about RM1,760. Considering the state of the ringgit, an optimistic estimate of the Zenfone Zoom’s price here in Malaysia would be RM1,799, but realistically we should probably see it closer to RM1,899.While we’re pretty stoked about the device, we want to know what you guys think.

Rory Lee,This is a 16-lens DSLR killer that can fit in your pocket,,"16 lens camera,Android Marshmallow,camera,CES 2016,DSLR,DSLR killer,L16 camera,Light L16,Light L16 camera,Snapdragon 820","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-08,"The problem with getting started on a DSLR is that you have to fork out a tonne of cash to be able to afford a decent body plus a lens. Sure some of you might say that you’re OK with the kit lens, but let’s face it, we all want a red band around our lens. Unless you’re not using a Canon device.A startup called Light is trying to change that with their L16 camera — a camera that has 16 lenses packed into a body small enough to fit in your pocket.Well, sort of. By Mashable’s estimate, the camera is about the size of three iPhone 6 Pluses stacked together. It probably won’t fit in your skinny jeans then. Nevertheless, it is still an impressive feat that they managed to cram that much tech and that many lenses into a body so small. Oh, did we mention it’s powered by a Snapdragon 820 SoC?On the hardware side of things, this camera has 16 (5x35mm, 5x70mm, 6x150mm) different prime lenses that work together to take an image. The camera sets it up in a way that — depending on your zoom and framing — 10 lenses will fire at the same time, taking different quadrants of an image. Note that Mashable says the device has 120mm lenses instead of 150mm lenses, but from the company’s video and several other sites, they say that it uses 150mm lenses.The camera then stitches the 10 images together to form a high 52-megapixel image that is should eliminate quality loss normally experienced at the fringes of a lens. These lenses don’t use any kind of fancy glass, instead, they all use f/2.4 P5 plastic lenses coupled with smartphone camera sensors. Plus, since it uses so many lenses at so many different focal lengths, Light claims that the camera has a near infinite depth of field — something you can adjust in post processing.Sporting a 5″ touchscreen paired with a Snapdragon 820 SoC and an interface based off of Android M, this device looks to bring camera and smartphone imaging technology closer together. Don’t be fooled, this doesn’t have a cellular modem so you can’t make phone calls.A best of both worlds then? We certainly hope so.News of this little guy has been floating around for quite awhile now but recently Mashable got to take a look at one of the prototypes for the device. According to them, the photo stitching on the prototype took a little while to process (it ultimately froze), with the company stating that they’re trying to get the image stitching and processing down to below 1 minute. A pretty ridiculous waiting time for a photo if you ask me.The silver lining is that the processing time is only for the 52-megapixel image, so if you want to post a quick snap on social media, the camera will generate a lower quality image for you. My nose is wrinkling in annoyance.According to Mashable, when Light compared the images between an , Canon 5D Mark III and the Light L16, they were impressed with how detailed the L16 images were but noted that there was a lot of image noise. Battery life on the other hand, Mashable says that the company ballparks it at about 400 shots.While this is a noble attempt at killing our tried and tested DSLR cameras, it seems like it is still a long way off from actually dealing the final blow. Even if the software is perfected and the device works wonderfully, we (like Mashable) believe that the DSLR will continue to live on and be the primary tool for professional photographers.For events and on-the-go photography though, we can see how this device can be very useful for the professionals thanks to it’s portability and, hopefully, stellar image quality. We will have to see how it stacks up against other compact monsters like the Sony RX100 series before jumping to a conclusion though.That said, if this device works out, it could be a great (and much cheaper, coming in at USD1,699 which is around RM7452) alternative to the DSLR for hobbyists and prosumers. Exciting stuff then![, , ]"

So they are removing a name but the entity will continue to tinker away under a division of Lenovo.One has to have a sense of humour to appreciate the different stances that took place but for once we think Lenovo and Motorola have finally sorts out their branding issues or so we hope.Back in August,  was what Lenovo decided to do as reported by Android Authority. A slight U-turn of decisions by our records but we guess it’s not easy running a company as large as Lenovo and they’re bound to make some wrong turns along the way.At least following their statements today we can conclude that brand name-wise, Motorola will cease to exist. Subsequently, any new devices under the umbrella will be sold as Moto by Lenovo or Vibe by Lenovo.So the crux of all this is, any future “Moto” device will still very much be built, designed and created by Motorola – e.g. Moto X, Moto G and Moto E – the only different being the company name that sells it. Business will go on, as usual, just the technicalities behind the “names” who sell them will differ.We already saw all of this coming since Q3 of last year but riding the “Motorola” name is really sad to see. In the light of this move, we’re going to take everyone on a trip down memory lane.[  ]The company we once knew has changed throughout the years, same goes for their ownership but under the surface, it seems there’s nothing much to shout about.[ , ,  ]"
Rory Lee,You will have to pay for your printed TM bill come July 2016.

Well, there has been a new development in the matter as TM have decided to postpone their defaulting to the e-Bill format by six months.Towards the end of last year, TM broadband subscribers (Streamyx and UniFi) exploded in outrage when they found out that TM was planning to charge them an exorbitant amount for their printed bills. The ISP justified their actions by claiming that it was part of their move to go green — cutting down and eliminating the usage of paper.As a form of ‘motivation’ to get customers to switch to e-Billing, the telecommunications company was going to incur a monthly charge of RM2 for those who still want to receive their bill in paper format. Charge Malaysians extra for anything and you know outrage will soon follow.In any case, TM issued an explanation that ended up giving consumers more confusion than confirmation because while they announced that it was an RM2 surcharge on their website, a surcharge of RM5 was mentioned on the printed bills. Now, there is finally a very official document detailing TM’s plans.According to the release, TM is postponing the defaulting of billing to the e-billing system to 1 July 2016 — seven months after the original intended implementation date of January 2016. This means that customers can still continue to receive their printed bill for now, but are strongly encouraged to make the switch as soon as possible.Customers who fail to make the switch by 1 July 2016 will continue to receive their printed bill but be incurred a surcharge of RM2 per month. TM is calling on all their subscribers to make the switch as soon as possible if they don’t want to be forced to pay more.They highlight that there are many benefits to using the e-billing system, from speed (customers can receive their bills within 4 days) to SMS alerts and even the ability to check your bill online (up to 6 months) from anywhere at any time by simply logging on to this .To do so, simply update your preferred email address and mobile number by sending an email to help@tm.com.my or visit the nearest TMpoint outlet, or call TM Contact Centre at 100 from your landline. According to TM, over 700,000 out of more than 4.4 million TM residential customers are already on the e-Bill statements. That’s only about 16% of the user base.Do note that this does not affect people who are only subscribed to TM’s telephone services (without broadband). These customers will receive the printed bill for free.[]"

Now, on Xiaomi’s official Weibo account, the company released an image confirming our suspicions.What’s more, they’ve also included a release date!Beyond that, Xiaomi hasn’t confirmed any of the other specifications but if we’re going off the TENAA entry, the device should have a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. That 5″ screen should also be a 720p HD screen and the device will likely run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.For camera optics, the Redmi 3 should have a 13MP primary camera paired with a 5MP front camera combo. On paper, this is a significant boost over the Redmi 2, pushing this into the mid-range category. We can only hope that the price will not follow suit.Popular Youtuber MKBHD once said that good phones are getting cheap while cheap phones are getting good and we share that sentiment. This is definitely something that is catching on because it seems that even Xiaomi realised they can’t continue making plasticky budget phones anymore.The only unfortunate thing is that this move to metal will most likely bring a higher price tag, which we’re sure many would frown upon. Keep in mind that this device will probably take a few months to reach our shores. What do you guys think, would you pay more for this Redmi?[, ]"
Rory Lee,The ASUS Reco Smart camera is more than just a dash-cam,,"ASUS dash camera,ASUS portable camera,ASUS Reco Smart camera,ASUS Reco Smart Camera launch,CES 2016,Reco Smart,Reco Smart camera","Asus,Mobile Accessories",2016-01-06,"just dropped a video for their new Reco Smart camera that is designed to not only work as a dash cam but also as a portable camera.  With a fast lens, Sony sensor and an interesting design, things are looking pretty good for it.The Reco Smart camera is shaped a lot like a regular camera lens, without the body, which means that it is also quite large, much like ‘s QX Camera. With that extra real estate though, ASUS can fit a large (and fast) f/1.8 aperture lens which should let it perform well in low-light conditions.ASUS’s camera also has a ‘Parking monitor mode’ that lets the camera detect movement in front of your vehicle and automatically start recording until it detects no further movement for one minute. Coupled with a 150-degree wide-angle lens, this Reco Smart cam is shaping up to be a pretty good dash-cam.In the event of a collision, the built-in three-axis G-sensor triggers the emergency record function. It will then save the recording to the ASUS WebStorage cloud and lock it down so it won’t be deleted by accident. Besides that, the camera can also be programmed to send out an emergency text message to a designated contact.Although there is no mention of the sensor’s megapixel count, the camera supports full-HD 1080p video recording as well as real-time previews and downloads on smart devices via the Reco app. Pairing with your smart device should also be a breeze with NFC One Touch Engage. As the device is WiFi capable (802.11 b/g/n), you also get 500GB of ASUS WebStorage cloud storage for free for one year.When ASUS said that the device could also function as a portable camera, they weren’t kidding because from the looks of things, the Reco Camera is compatible with a wide range of standard camera accessories. Stuff like tripods, monopods and even lens filters (which work with 58mm diameter lenses) should fit with no problems.The only bummer is that the device comes with a tiny 720mAh battery that can only support up to one hour of 1080p video recording with the WiFi turned on. As a comparison, a  Hero4 usually averages 1.5 hours of battery life at 1080p recording.You do get a decent amount of kit in the package though, including a microSD card, car charger, dual USB car charger, GPS mount holder and more. A waterproof housing for the camera is also available for purchase. For now, there is no information on availability or pricing.[, ]"

When I look around at my friends, more than half of them have more well-defined abs than I do life goals.To fulfill this desire to track health and fitness, tech companies have launched a myriad of fitness bands, trackers and applications designed to keep you as well informed about your body as possible. But while most of those devices existed as individual elements, none were truly unified.At least, that’s what HTC and Under Armour said when they launched their brand new ‘fitness system’ that costs USD400 (around RM1751).You must be thinking, you’d get a lot of gear right? Well, that depends on your definition of ‘a lot’. What we do know is that with the UA HealthBox, you will be receiving three devices — a fitness band, a smart scale and a heart-rate monitor.Dubbed the UA Band, this fitness band is designed to be worn all-day every day because it tracks daily activities, workout and sleep. Under the band’s “seamless exterior shell” is a display which is “discreetly hidden” allowing it to disappear when not in use. While we don’t know how hidden they wanted the screen to be, from the pictures (even their product shots) it certainly looks like it’s well hidden enough to be a nightmare to view under sunlight.The UA Band also features an advanced workout mode with a display that stays on during the workout as well as an LED that indicates heart rate zone when paired with the heart rate monitor. Wow, a screen that stays on!Next, we have the UA Heart Rate — a compact heart rate monitor that is designed to be undetectable during workouts. It is also supposed to help individuals monitor intensity and train smarter while providing an accurate calculation of calories burned. How refreshing, a heart rate monitor that actually does all this accurately!Finally, we have the UA Scale. It’s a smart scale that is “beautifully crafted” and WiFi enabled in an “iconic circular design”. This scale also has a hidden LED display that makes the technology invisible when not in use. It also looks like there is a “nifty” feature where they show you a bunch of logos, greet you and only after they’ve done all that do they show you your weight. Perfect for when you’re in a hurry!According to them, these three devices are perfectly synced to provide the user with a “customised experience”, but they fail to mention exactly what that customised experience is. Based on the video, it looks like it’s just a personalised profile on your “dashboard” in the UA Record app.Speaking of the app, UA and HTC have made it available in both the  and  as a free download. The application shows you the results of your daily health and fitness tracking plus a “How do you feel?” scale.That said, there is some benefit to having all of these devices connected. Like they highlighted in their video, there is a lot of potential for growth into an actual ecosystem (via smart shoes, headphones, etc.). Plus there is the benefit of it being simple to use and understand.For now though, this “system” seems more like your paying a lot for a brand to be plastered onto existing technology and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, look at Beats by Dre, they’re selling like hot cakes.This fitness system will be available on January 22 in the US, retailing for USD400 (around RM1751), with pre-orders beginning today on ,  and at Under Armour Brand House locations. The HealthBox will eventually roll out internationally throughout this year."

The newer Snapdragon 820 processor aims to turn things around while bringing its performance up to the mark. At CES 2016, Qualcomm had announced China’s LeTV Le Max Pro as the first smartphone to use their SoC. Apart from having top end performance, the Le Max Pro is also the first device to feature Qualcomm’s  and the first to support multi-gigabit 802.11ad WiFi, which is also known as WiGig.  The LeTV Le Max Pro is a large 6.33″ phablet that pushes Quad HD resolution. Under the hood lies a Snapdragon 820 processor with quad Kyro cores at 2.2GHz that’s mated to 4GB of RAM. The processor claims to be more efficient with a 16nm process and it is accompanied by a Adreno 530 GPU. The new processor with quad-cores apparently provides 2X the performance of an Octa-Core based Snapdragon 810 unit. The Sense ID is supposedly a more advanced biometric feature as it uses ultrasonic sound waves that’s superior than capacitive based scanners commonly used today. Instead of recording an image of your fingertips, Sense ID scans deeper below the skin. As a result, it harder to spoof and it works well even with contaminated fingers. Another advantage is that it works underneath glass, plastics and metal materials, allowing manufacturers to implement the sensor discreetly on smartphones. In terms of design, it looks like a Huawei/honor device with a familiar antenna band stripes from an iPhone. Strangely there’s still a visible fingerprint scanner at the back which could have been omitted with Sense ID. The rear camera is said to be a 21MP shooter with Optical Image Stabilisation and powering this phablet is a generous 3,400mAh battery. As seen in the pictures below, it uses USB Type-C for charging and data transfer. Connectivity wise, it also supports Cat 12 4G LTE with download speeds up to 600Mbps and uplink up to 150Mbps. There’s no mention of its availability but you can expect more Snapdragon 820 flagship smartphones to be announced next month during MWC 2016.[    ]"

That means you can just toss it in the air and the drone will start flying though it does need a little bit of room to get it climbing.The Disco, with it’s single propeller and detachable wings, can hit speeds of up to 50mph (around 80kph) and stay flying for about 45 minutes on a single charge. There is also an ultrasound camera mounted at the bottom of the drone that helps it land autonomously.Well, more like crash autonomously if we’re looking at the teaser footage.Like the Bebop 2, you can control the Disco with Parrot’s Skycontroller or plot a flight plan and have the drone do the flying itself. The drone also has a “return home” function that does exactly what the name suggests.Mounted at the front is the same eye-like 14-megapixel fisheye lens camera Parrot mounts on the Bebop 2, so it will likely feature the same digital panning and stability options as well.While ditching the quadcopter design lets you fly more realistically (especially with FPV goggles), there will inevitably be drawbacks. The drone, for example, loses its ability to hover and takeoff vertically, making it less ideal for filming. It will also inevitably be less stable and manoeuvrable than a quadcopter.Upside? Y0u can fly, turn and pitch like an actual plane. COOL.Despite their claims, The Verge points out that Parrot aren’t the first to introduce a ready-to-fly fixed-wing drone as there are already several small fixed-wing drones in the market.Though we do think the Disco is one of the best looking fixed-wing drones out there. Or almost out there, since it’s still a prototype. Parrot does plan to make this available to consumers within this year so that’s something to look forward to.[]"

GPS and GLONASS are also supported.For optics, the Galaxy TabPro S will have a 5MP front and rear camera, which isn’t impressive but you don’t want to be that guy taking pictures with your 12″ tablet do you? For video, the cameras will support recording up to an FHD resolution (1920×1080).Powering the components will be a 5,200 mAh battery that Samsung says can last up to 10 hours, and because the tablet sports a USB Type-C port, it will also have fast charging allowing you to top the device up in about 2.5 hours.Since 2-in-1 devices are all the rage right now, the Galaxy TabPro S will come with a keyboard (not sold separately) that looks very much like the old  Type Cover. Unlike the , this keyboard can actually function as a cover because it adopts a more old-school approach to keyboard attachment. Also, note that it has a touchpad, something that is missing from both ‘s  and .For users who want a stylus or more ports, Samsung is offering a Bluetooth Pen and a multi-port adapter (HDMI, USB Type A & C) but are sold separately. Samsung says that the Galaxy TabPro S will be available globally come February 2016 though there is no mention of a recommended retail price.[, ]"
Rory Lee,Lenovo launches the Vibe K4 Note with a VR bundle,,"Android,Lenovo,lenovo k4 note,lenovo k4 note launch,Lenovo TheaterMax,lenovo Vibe,Lenovo Vibe k4,Lenovo Vibe K4 Note,Lenovo Vibe K4 Note launch,Lenovo VR Headset,smart phone,smartphone,vibe k4 note,vibe k4 official launch,VR headset","Android,Industry in General,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-05,"has finally launched a successor to their wildly popular K3 Note, the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note, which looks like it is more than worthy to fill the K3 Note’s big shoes.Alongside several interesting features, Lenovo will also be bundling its midrange device with a virtual reality (VR) headset.The Vibe K4 Note’s specifications look good on paper, with it sporting a 5.5-inch full-HD (1920×1080 pixels) IPS panel, which results in a pixel density of 401ppi. The display, which the company claims has a 1000:1 contrast ratio with adjustable colour balance, will be tucked under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3.On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC paired with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. For optics, the device will see a 13MP rear shooter with PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) and a fast f/2.2 aperture. Helping the device out with low-light shots is a two-tone LED flash to the right of the camera module. For selfies, the phone unsurprisingly sports a 5MP front-facing camera.What is surprising is the fact that the device will feature a pair of front-facing stereo Dolby Atmos speakers, something that’s missing even on most flagship devices. What’s more, this mid-range device also sports a fingerprint scanner mounted at the back just below the primary camera (my personal favourite location), something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market.Powering everything will be a quick charge enabled 3,300 mAh battery that is supposed to deliver 265 hours of 3G standby time and 22 hours of 3G talk time. The device also comes with dual-SIM support, both of which have support for 4G LTE. The device will run Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovo’s Vibe UI skin on top, though we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update in the near future.The reason they bundled the smartphone with a VR headset is so that users can take advantage of Lenovo’s TheaterMax technology which converts regular content into immersive VR content. While we don’t know how “immersive” TheaterMax will end up being, Lenovo seems pretty confident in it, leaving the final judgement to time itself.Lenovo’s mid-ranger will go on a flash sale on Amazon India on January 19 at INR11,999 (around RM783) for just the device, while the VR bundle will cost INR13,299 (around RM868). Note that for the first few flash sales, the device will only be sold in the VR bundle, but priced at a discounted INR12,499 (around RM816). No information on whether this device will make it to Malaysia is present at the time of this article’s writing. It is important to point out that the predecessor, the Note K3, is  at RM599.[, , ]"

This is an issue because the conditions of a disaster are never the same, often needing the rescue team to stay on the move to avoid getting caught up in it themselves. So, the participants are tasked with launching and landing a drone from the bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.Here’s the full timeline of the DJI SDK Developer Challenge:In certain parts of the world, drones bring about more fear than anything else, though it’s amazing to see that there are (obvious) pros in utilising them for aid drop-offs and search-and-rescue missions; lessening the risk of rescuers by putting drones out there instead. And let’s not forget the use of these drones by photojournalist worldwide, capturing civil unrest in states observing media lockdowns.Besides holding competitions to save the world, DJI has also updated their existing Phantom and Inspire drone series. While DJI’s uber cool Inspire 1 gets a minor colour update (it now comes in black), they’ve added a 4K camera to the Phantom 3, a feature only available on the Phantom 3 Professional in the past.[ , , , ]"

Well, the wait is almost up because Apple is set to put two exclusive Apple Watch Sport designs on sale in Malaysia on February 8.To commemorate the Chinese New Year celebrations, Apple looks to be putting these two “special” models on sale in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This comes after an announcement message appeared briefly on the countries’ corresponding Apple websites before being removed earlier today.The announcement read:9to5Mac also reports that while the “Buy Now” and “Shop Now” links appeared for a short time on Apple’s website, it looks like the company might have launched the announcement a bit prematurely. It is currently unclear how Apple plans to sell these devices, or if they will be priced at an equally “special” price from the normal Apple Watch Sport models.While Apple officially launched the Watch way back in 2014, the final release of the product was in April the following year. Since then, the availability of the device has slowly trickled into our neighbouring countries. Now it seems our time may be near, though at this point it is still a rumour because there is no official confirmation.That said, this information was sourced from 9to5Mac and MacRumours, both of whom are usually right when it comes to stuff like these. If this launch date holds true, this would mean that Malaysia is one of the last markets to get the Apple Watch — almost an entire year after it was officially released. To make matters worse, this sale is only available until February 22 while supplies last.

Or sick drag race vids. We’d go with the cat though because we all know cats rule the internet.In a short period of time, drones have intergrated seamlessly into our lives, with many using them for a variety of purposes. They have been used to advance the production capability of movies, TV series and Internet videos.They have also been crucial for the development of photojournalism, allowing access into locations previously too precarious for photographers.

Rory Lee,Paying too much attention to your phone could cost you your life,,,,2016-01-04,"Mobile phone addiction is becoming a real and serious threat to the wellbeing of society. People simply spend too much time on it, causing them to ignore their loved ones, peers and — like this woman found out the hard way — can even lead to death. Wang, a 28-year-old woman from Wenzhou, located in China’s Zhejiang province fell into a river and drowned after she missed her step because she was too preoccupied with her phone.Wang, who was a migrant worker and mother of two was walking in the middle of the road before the incident. However, as she was too preoccupied with her device, she didn’t notice when she gradually began walking towards the edge of the water.Online surveillance footage shows Wang struggling for over a minute before she disappeared from the surface of the water. Her body was discovered after her husband Yang spotted her shoe floating on the river when he went looking for her the next morning.Although the river was only chest-deep, the sludge at the riverbed can cause people to slip and fall. This incident has served as a wake-up call to the Chinese public as netizens took to the social media, calling for people to exercise caution when using phones.We’d like to say that this is the first tragedy caused by phubbing (snubbing someone in favour of your smartphone), but that just isn’t the case. It used to be “don’t drive and text”, now it needs to also be “don’t walk and use your phone”.You might think, “oh that’s not me, I only use it at the dinner table!”. What people don’t realise is that everything starts somewhere. Using them initially to avoid socially awkward situations can often lead to a reliance on the device and we all know where that leads.An Ohio State University researcher discovered that the number of pedestrian deaths has dramatically increased over the past few years and many of which were caused by telephone distractions. The figure is expected to double by 2015.Be mindful when using your device. It’s perfectly fine if you post that tweet an hour or even a day later.

Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S7 will get features you wanted so badly on the S6,,"Android,battery capacity,microSD,microSD Slot,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Battery,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 Specs,Samsung Galaxy S7 Waterproof,Waterproof","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-01-05,"Samsung is expected to launch its new  next month during . As we inch closer towards its launch day, serial leakster,  has dropped more details on Samsung’s next big duo. The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge had opened a new chapter for Samsung with its premium glass and metal design, along with top specs that hold well to this very day. Of course, there are many that frown upon its compromises. It was their first flagship to not have a removable battery and most critical of all, it lacks an expandable microSD slot. If you were disappointed by the Galaxy S6, there’s a lot to look forward to on the upcoming model.According to @evleaks, the new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will finally offer a microSD slot. Like the current S6, both models will be offered with either 32GB and 64GB storage options, which in Malaysia we are likely to receive the smallest option of just 32GB. This would be good news for those taking loads of pictures and 4K videos as the device is alleged to support microSD cards up to 200GB. This reaffirms an earlier “” that Samsung is finally bringing back the microSD slot to its latest flagship. With each new model, the Galaxy S lineup has always seen an increase of battery capacities. However on the Galaxy S6, it was downsized from 2,800mAh on the Galaxy S5 to just 2,550mAh (2,600mAh on the S6 edge). Fortunately, the new processor and energy efficient  were good at maximising every mAh of power. The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are alleged to receive 3,000mAh and 3,600mAh capacity batteries respectively, which is a huge jump. That’s like fitting a Galaxy Note battery into a smaller device, and hopefully this could translate to more than 24 hours of usage. Wireless Charging will still be the star of the show and Samsung will likely to support fast wireless charging for the new flagship duo as it did with the Galaxy Note5. Charging an S7 is reported to take about 2 hours wirelessly while the S7 edge will take slightly longer at 2.2 hours.  First introduced on the Galaxy S5, the S7 is said to be getting water and dust resistance with an IP67 rating. This is similar with the Galaxy S5 which in theory can be submerged up to 1 metre for up to 30 minutes. Even if you don’t go to the pool, having water resistance is a good feature to have especially for those unexpected moments. Even word has it that the folks at Cupertino  to make its upcoming iPhone waterproof. If Samsung is doing it, it better be a cap-less design without those clumsy flap covers. The Galaxy S7/S7 edge will be running on their latest Exynos 8890 processor but there will be a Qualcomm-powered version for selected markets that runs on a Snapdragon 820 processor. Expect them to come with 4GB of RAM and has support for faster Cat 9 4G LTE. In terms of screen size, the standard S7 is likely to retain the same compact 5.1″ Quad HD display while the S7 edge is rumoured to be either a larger 5.5 or 5.7 incher. To have a 5.7″ smartphone at this time of the year  as it would cannibalise its own S6 edge+ that was launched not too long ago.Camera wise, the new flagships will get a smaller pixel count of 12MP instead of its current 16MP shooter. However, it is compensated with faster f/1.7 lens versus f/1.9 for better low-light performance. With a smaller BRITECELL camera module, the new S7 could have a flat and flush back design without the protruding camera hump.  Are you excited now? MWC 2016 is happening on 22nd February 2016 and Samsung would normally announce their latest Galaxy S model a day earlier.[   ]"

Well, apparently it was done to prepare for the possibility of   for competitive reasons. They wanted to prepare for a future where users might have to resort to downloading the Facebook application from a source outside of the Google .Despite the fact that Facebook is one of the Play Store’s biggest application developers, there is a looming threat that the social network could bypass Google’s services altogether.The tests were allegedly conducted to see how far they could go to get Android users to abandon their platform altogether. The results? “People never stopped coming back.”According to a person familiar with the tests, those who were locked out of their application defaulted to the mobile web browser version of Facebook, rather than abandoning the application. Are you surprised?We weren’t. Right now, there is simply no alternative to Facebook and what the social media platform offers, so it seems only natural that users would find any means possible to access the site. The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back.The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back.Although this was supposedly a one-time experiment conducted years ago, this isn’t the first social experiment Facebook undertook. Yes, we’re talking about the controversy in 2014 where Facebook altered the content on users’ News Feeds to see if it would change their moods.Information surfaced last year that Facebook bombarded several users’ News Feeds with sad and depressing content to see if they were less likely to visit the site if it made them sad. The experiment was so controversial that even the editor behind the study was ““, questioning if the results of the study were actually worth all the backlash.What most people don’t realise — or choose to turn a blind eye on — is that social experimenting on the Internet is nothing new. Pretty much every website has done it to some extent. The question then becomes whether you know you’re being experimented on or not.Perhaps what makes what Facebook did so painful was that it felt personal on some level because these were people’s personal feeds.

On one end, you get a fixed USB Type-C connector that goes into your power adapter, while the other end has two pieces, with the small stub that stays permanently in your MacBook port. The cable is 6 feet (1.8 metres) long and the magnetic connector is about 12.8mm deep. On their , it is listed as coming soon with the retail price tag of US$39.99 (about RM173). As comparison, the original USB Type-C cable (2 metres) for the MacBook is  RM139.If you’re looking for a sleeker alternative, there’s  that debut on . This isn’t a cable but a two-piece connector head that gives you a “MagSafe” and a reversible feature for your existing Lightning, Micro-USB and USB Type-C cables. A set for Lightning and Micro-USB costs US$18.00 (about RM78) while USB Type-C costs US$24.00 (about RM104). Individual connectors and adapters are sold separately so you can “MagSafe” your entire device collection if required. You can  and they will ship by end of this month.[ ,  ]"

Well, thank goodness for crowd-funding because now we have the next best thing: Modular smartphone cases.
The thing that makes the idea of a modular device, be it a smartphone, , or, in this case, a smartcase, so brilliant is that it is completely customisable. For the first time the users themselves can decide exactly what they want or don’t want to have on their device.Fancy a good camera? Get a powerful camera module. Need more juice to last you an entire day? Get a battery module. Want a chainsaw to go jungle trekking?

However, with a case like nexpaq’s, a  that includes a case and four modules would only set you back USD169 (around RM728).The best part? The folks at nexpaq are enlisting the help of the community to develop their modular smartphone case, releasing developer kits for both the modules and its accompanying software.Now, more are following suit, with the latest one coming from a company called i-Blades who have put up their version of the modular smartphone case, the i-Blades Smartcase. The i-Blades Smartcase is currently on Indiegogo looking for funding and the best part about it is that their modules can apparently stack infinitely.Your device would look like it has one of Apple’s Cases though, but I digress. If you’re interested, head on over to their  and check it out.I really do believe that modular devices are the future.

Using a mobile app, Uber lets you request for a clean and reliable ride, which is like a breath of fresh air in cities with failed taxi services. The one billionth trip was taken in London on a Honda Insight Hybrid. To celebrate the occasion, the lucky rider is receiving a year’s worth of Uber rides, while the driver will be getting a well deserved holiday at a Uber city of his choice. Not bad for a short trip that only costs £5 (about RM32). To top it off, Uber is also making a charitable donation to an organisation at the neighbourhood where ride had started. Despite its political and regulatory hurdles, Uber has been growing quite rapidly covering hundreds of cities in 68 countries worldwide. It is said that they are currently doing 3 million trips a day which is substantially more than its competitor, Lyft. While they are doing well in most markets, Uber is also facing bans and suspension by some local authority such as Spain and Germany. Fortunately, it is still business as usual in Malaysia as it still operates in Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru. Despite protests by taxi drivers, SPAD (Land Transport Authority) has yet to  for these new “ride-sharing” services. For riders, it is a better alternative to taxis without the hassle of haggling. At the same time, driving with Uber is an opportunity to make extra income which is more critical with the rising cost of living. At the current rate, Uber isn’t slowing down and eventually it could possibly render car ownership redundant. Of course, this is only possible if it is extensive and affordable enough to do so. Already it is cheaper than most taxis and in some markets, it could be . Whatever regulation SPAD plans to enforce, we hope it would be beneficial to both consumers and the industry.

You might see Samsung expanding its range of flexible display devices, and it’s not the first time they stuffed a projector into a smartphone (remember the ?).Released in 2010, the Galaxy Beam is a novel idea that was probably ahead of its time but today with video on demand and mobile content steaming being a big thing, a phone with a built in projector wouldn’t be such a bad idea.

While there have been rumours going around about a potential Samsung Galaxy S7+, SamMobile believes that this will likely be the S7 edge instead.We highly doubt Samsung would cannibalise their popular recent flagship and risk their consumers getting pissed at them, just so they can be “radical”. It’s very unlikely that they would .Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, the picture also reveals another interesting specification: The camera module. According to the picture, the S7 (or S7 edge or S7+) looks to feature a 12.2-megapixel rear camera coupled with a 5-megapixel front shooter.What’s interesting is the drastic drop in megapixel count for the rear camera, down from 16MP, in a 2016 device. This is in-line with an earlier rumour that the device would sport a 12MP large pixel sensor, though it doesn’t match Samsung’s .At their Investor’s Forum last year, Samsung unveiled the BRITECELL camera technology, which utilises tiny one micron pixels which are “the smallest pixel for slim smartphone”. If Samsung were to use these small pixels and also drop pixel count, then they would really have to have something up their sleeve to help the sensor cope with low-light photography.The image also reveals that the device will have a Snapdragon 820 processor with an Adreno 530 GPU mated with 4GB of RAM, which is, unsurprising.In any case, these are only rumours and Samsung could just be pulling a fast one, using multiple prototypes to mislead leaksters.

With everything going up, the fares will be  to RM55/way effective 1st January 2016. That’s a hefty RM110 for two people heading to the airport. Is there a cheaper alternative? What if we tell you there’s another way of getting there with zero emission and it costs less than an  ride?COMOS, a ride-sharing provider that uses 100% electric vehicles has introduced an Airport Valet Service. For a flat rate of RM70, you can head to KLIA or KLIA2 in an electric-powered . The service comes with a designated COMOS staff, so you can hop-on and hop-off without worrying about parking. Do note that the Renault Zoe is a compact hatchback, so the boot isn’t as spacious as a typical sedan car. The COMOS Airport Valet service would cost you RM70 which is inclusive of GST, toll and delivery charges to your location. So that equates to RM35/person for a trip for two or RM23.34/person for 3 pax. On the downside, it is only available from 9:00AM to 4:00PM, and it covers just the following areas in the Klang Valley. If you haven’t tried COMOS before, the first step of getting a key card would take a while. You would need to  for a membership which now costs RM50 for 1 year (Normal: RM300). Once that’s done, you can collect your COMOS card and start booking as follows:You are advised to request the service at least 2 hours ahead of the intended time and it is subject to actual availability of cars. You may book for the next day but the option is only available after 10:00PM. This is a cashless service and the final amount will be charged to your registered credit card. You can read up more about the service .COMOS was introduced as an alternative means to car ownership. Being a ride-sharing service, you only pay for membership and usage fees according to your usage. At the moment, the rental costs RM6 for 15 minutes with a minimum booking of 30 minutes (RM12). For an all day usage, it will cost you a flat rate of RM144. With its fleet of electric cars, there’s no fuel cost involved so you won’t need to return the car with a full tank. There are several COMOS pick up stations located around PJ and KL with more being planned out in the near future. Currently all bookings are done via its website on  and soon they will be releasing a mobile app for iOS and Android.We’ve tried COMOS a couple of times and it is quite an experience driving a quiet vehicle that hums like a spaceship. Since it’s new, the number of stations with charging points are quite limited. It isn’t really that cost efficient for simple point to point trips since you’re required to return the vehicle to its limited pickup/drop off points. If you’re making a stop, you would still need to pay for parking, which defeats the purpose of saving time and money. This would probably make more sense once they have more stations around strategic points including shopping malls and office complexes. If COMOS isn’t viable due to timing and location, Uber is  a flat rate of RM75 (excluding tolls) to KLIA/KLIA2. There’s no promo code required, and you can request anytime from now until 5th January 2016. Uber is available on ,  and .If you’re traveling alone, KLIA Express is still the cheaper option overall. Despite the RM55/way announcement, there are additional discounts if you book return tickets and purchasing them online or using specific credit cards. At the moment,  are entitled to a 20% discount. A return KLIA Express ticket cost RM100 and it will cost you just RM80 which is equivalent to RM40 per way. That’s basically RM5 more than usual RM35/way price. [  ]"
Rory Lee,Mobile data in Malaysia is more affordable than you think,,"internet data price,internet price,Malaysia,Malaysia Broadband Price,malaysia data price,malaysia internet price,malaysia mobile data price,mobile data,mobile data price,mobile data price malaysia","Industry in General,Players on the Field",2015-12-31,"If you’re frustrated with how expensive your data plan is, or if you feel cheated by some mobile operators who  but limits usage to certain times of the day, we understand your pain. If you’ve been envying our neighbours in Indonesia, who are paying nearly half of what we pay for 1GB of data, we feel you too.But, if you’re thinking of creating a blog to hate on our mobile carriers, citing examples of how much cheaper data is in our neighbouring countries, you might want to reconsider. This is because based on data collected by website , we actually have more affordable data — on average, per 1GB — than most countries in Southeast Asia.In their study, Tech In Asia compiled data from all the Southeast Asian countries and calculated what the typical price of 1GB (in USD) of data was. Then, they looked up the minimum wage of each country, (picking the typical wage of a low-income worker in Brunei, Singapore and Cambodia because they didn’t have an official minimum wage) comparing it with the respective data costs.Finally, they used that data to estimate how many hours a worker would have to work to be able to afford 1GB of data and arranged the countries according to scale in a nifty infographic. The results of their study are as follows:From the data, Malaysia is actually doing quite well, finishing within the top 5 of all the countries in SEA for the most affordable data, despite the fact that we’re paying nearly USD1.60 (RM6.88) more than Indonesia and almost USD1 (RM4.30) higher than Vietnam and Myanmar for 1GB of data. Thanks to our higher minimum wage, a Malaysian minimum wage worker would only have to put in 3 hours and 45 minutes of hard work to enjoy 1GB of data.We’re still far off from Brunei though, who leads the pack at only 1 hour and 4 minutes of work needed for 1GB of data, despite their data costing USD2.67 (RM11.48) more than Malaysia. The power of a higher income nation eh?Another interesting bit of information is how incredibly low the price of mobile data in Cambodia is, coming in at a cool USD1.50/GB (RM6.45), sliding them into third place right behind Singapore despite their minimum wage being only USD0.66 (RM2.84) per hour.There is only one cause for concern: The accuracy of this data. Let’s take Malaysia for example. Based on the infographic, we average USD4.42 per 1GB of data, which is roughly equivalent to RM19/GB. Are our plans that expensive?Let’s take a look at the current prepaid data plans being offered by our Telcos:
Across these 18 different plans, the average (mean) cost of 1GB of data in Malaysia is RM18.68, which is pretty close to the average in the data set. Keep in mind the lower average value is likely because of the promotions that are currently active. Hashtag legit information (as far as Malaysia is concerned anyway).It’s no secret that we’ve arrived at an era where everyone is obsessed with staying connected. In the past, only moderately large F&B chains offer free WiFi to their customers, but now even mamak shops have “FREE WIFI” signs pasted in and around their establishment. Why? Well, smartphones are getting more and more accessible for the masses and we all know that unless we keep our phones connected to the Internet, they’re little more than 180g bricks.But, we can’t always rely on WiFi to stay connected. What if we’re on the train? Or in a cab? I mean, we can’t just NOT send that tweet or NOT check if our new Instagram picture broke the 11-like barrier right? That would be . As the citizens flailed about in a chaotic mess, crying out for a saviour, our local telcos came riding in on white stallions offering data plans like food to the hungry.Those who could afford it rejoiced while others griped about how expensive it was compared to our neighbouring countries — some of which could be considered less developed than we are. The problem with that is when you argue “affordability” based purely on how much a plan costs, you’re leaving other crucial factors like income, development, penetration and even freedom of Internet, out of the equation.That’s like arguing who’s the best badminton player based purely on how fast their smashes are.It seems that the folks over at Tech In Asia have had enough of this nonsense and thanks to them, we now have a better understanding (hopefully) of what affordability really means. That said, this chart doesn’t appear to differentiate between connection speeds (4G LTE, 3G, 2G, etc) so that could be another factor affecting cost. could also be another reason for the difference in cost. We’d much rather pay a little more for a wider and more stable data connection.What do you think of this infographic? Should carriers focus more on reducing cost or improving coverage and stability?

Can you confidently tell how far apart one building is from the next and navigate it without a proper scale? What about those little parts that are obscured by a building or a shadow? Can you tell what’s hidden there?Now imagine all of that detail compressed into the body of a baby girl and you’ve only begun to scrape the surface of how difficult surgeon Dr Redmond Burke’s operation was.Teegan Lexcen, a 4-month-old baby was admitted into the Niklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami, Florida because she was born with a misplaced heart. Without surgery, she would be dead by Christmas.The worst part? Doctors couldn’t see a way in to operate.I don’t think I need to tell you how delicate heart surgery is, or how difficult it can be. It becomes nigh impossible when you don’t have all the information you need.Burke says that surgeons need to be able to visualise the entire procedure before they step into the operating room, which is why many surgical teams passed on Teegan’s operation because they kept running into walls during this process: It seemed inoperable.Burke had the same problem as he had no way of knowing if a standard incision over the sternum would be enough, but “inoperable” was not a word he enjoyed using. Exhausting medical solutions, the team began looking for creative solutions and one particularly enterprising member uploaded the scans of Teegan’s chest to , converting them into 3D stereoscopic imagines, which allowed them to view it in VR.Virtual Reality. That was the answer. Burke said that with  and a smartphone he was able to see the patient’s entire heart by simply tilting his head. He could turn it and manipulate it as if he was already in the operating room.From there, Burke could see Teegan’s heart as well as her chest wall and with that information, he knew that a standard incision would indeed be fine.According to Burke, this solution came just in the nick of time; any longer and her kidneys may have suffered too much from her being put under. She would be alive, but on dialysis for the rest of her days.We’re floored that a little bit of cardboard and a smartphone actually saved someone’s life. That and good old fashioned human ingenuity of course.Burke views every operation as possible and it was down to whether the doctor had the confidence to perform it or not. With VR he could visualise the steps in his head and help him come up with a plan of operation for his team which allowed him to save his patient.Seven hours later, little Teegan was all patched up and ready for Christmas and ho, ho, ho-pefully for many more Christmases to come.[, ]"

If you’re a smartphone buyer, odds are you have bought more than one device. The only problem is, what do you do with your old phone when your new one arrives?Do you toss it out? Give it to a niece/nephew/child (let’s be real they probably have better phones than your old  anyway)? Try to sell it to on a certain popular local forum filled with lowballers? Well,  now has a new option for you.Vmall Malaysia is currently conducting a BETA test for their “Trade-in & Go Green With Honor!” programme, in collaboration with LTG Technologies, where — yep you guessed it — you can trade in your old devices and be compensated for it.You won’t be getting money, though. Instead, you’ll be getting a Vmall code which you can then use to redeem a Vmall voucher which you can use to purchase any device on the website.To put it in simpler terms:At this moment, the number of devices per manufacturer, with the exception being  and , is rather limited. Hopefully, they will add support for more devices further down the line.If your trade-in value is RM40 or higher, LTG will arrange for a pickup at your specified address free of charge. Once LTG receives your products, they will evaluate and see if your devices are worth the quoted amount. If they sign off on it, you will receive a Vmall voucher code of equal value to that of your devices.If they don’t, they will inform you of the new value of your device, allowing you to decide whether or not you want to take the offer. If you don’t respond within 3 days, they will automatically assume you accept the revised offer.The best thing about this programme is that you can register any amount of smartphones, from old and functioning to broken phones (yes they accept broken phones if it is within their criteria).However, remember to register all your devices at one go so that you receive a single code for a single voucher. Not only will this help you hit that RM40 free delivery sweet spot, it will also help when you make purchases on Vmall, because you can only use one voucher per purchase.Keep in mind that this programme is only in BETA but it is expected to go live sometime early next year. If you’ve had your eye on an honor or Huawei device, this seems like a pretty decent incentive to go and get one.[]"

Rory Lee,Apple gets sued for rolling out iOS 9,,"apple,Apple iPhone 4s,apple sued,apple users sue apple,class action lawsuit,iOS,iOS 9,iPhone 4S","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-30,"They say a king is nothing without his people. A tree, nothing, without its roots. A product, nothing, without its consumers. So what happens when a smartphone manufacturer gets slapped with a class action lawsuit filed by the very people who used to preach their excellence?Draaaama!More than a hundred infuriated  owners have filed a lawsuit against , claiming USD5 million (around RM21.5 million) in damages, accusing them of significantly slowing down their devices with the new  9 update. The lawsuit was filed with a New York district court, though no hearings have been set at this time.According to plaintiff Chiam Lerman and several others, the new update slowed the device down so much that it interfered with day-to-day usage.It seems that after upgrading, both first and third-party applications exhibited delayed launch times, slow response to touchscreen input and other problems. Overall performance was also affected by freezes and crash events.They also accuse Apple of engaging in deceptive trade practices and false advertising by proclaiming that the update is compatible with legacy smartphones dating back to the iPhone 4s models. The lawsuit also claims that Apple were well aware of iOS 9’s negative impacts on the iPhone 4s but went ahead with the marketing campaign anyway.The campaign advertised faster performance, enhanced security, longer battery life among other enticing features. To make matters worse, the company’s advertisements, website, and iOS page did not have any warning of potential compatibility issues for older devices.Apparently the complaint went after Apple’s iOS system itself, because when faced with a sluggish and slow device, it is more likely that the average Apple user would upgrade to a new iOS product instead of branching out. The reason being that transferring information across devices within the same ecosystem is much easier. Plus there is also the familiarity factor.It isn’t too surprising that a new iOS update would slow down older devices because each new update is designed to take advantage of the hardware from the recent models. This includes a host of new features and improvements that an older device may not have even dreamt was possible, much less have support for it.Apple has been in this situation before, back in 2011, where plaintiffs complained that iOS 4 turned their iPhone 3G into “iBricks”. That case was tossed out a year later and it seems likely that this lawsuit will suffer the same fate.One of the main arguments in the iOS vs Android war was that Apple always pushed new updates, even to old devices such as the iPhone 4s while Android devices have a realistic lifespan of 2 years. After 2 years, it is very unlikely that your Android device would be getting any updates from its manufacturer.Apple fans argued that this was because Android was so fragmented, with so many different manufacturers making so many different versions of the Android OS. iOS isn’t the same because everything was unified under one banner.That said, there is an exception to this  dilemma: The  devices. Nexus smartphones tend to receive OS updates much quicker and for longer than most other devices. But unlike what’s happening to these unfortunate iPhone 4s users, each Android update usually improves the performance of older devices due to improved optimisation of the OS.This brings Apple users to what looks like a difficult decision. Do you update your OS to get new features and better security at the risk of sluggish performance? Or do you stick to what already works and brave potential security risks? Let us know in the comments below.If you’re as frustrated as these users and think Apple does this on purpose so that people will be forced to buy a new iPhone, don’t hesitate to drop your opinion in the comment box too![, ]"

As the transition is taking place with new reload cards entering the shelves, a couple of telcos are dishing out special offers that will give you more than your money’s worth. Read on to find out what offers are available.For Digi, they are giving an extra 8% bonus on top of your actual airtime. So if you purchased a RM10 topup at RM10.60, you’ll be getting 80 sen bonus extra. The bonus airtime will be will be given to you within 72 hours and this is only applicable until 31st December 2015.

For Xpax Prepaid by Celcom, they are doing something similar but they are giving only 6% extra. This is basically matching the same value ringgit to ringgit based the retail price.

Like Digi, the extra airtime will be granted within 72 hours, but take note that this is only applicable for domestic use only (not for roaming). TuneTalk probably has the most generous offer of all.

Arif Lee,The four-way 4K video battle,,,,2015-12-29,"You asked for a video comparison and here you have it. We put these four heavyweights in the camera department to the 4K video recording test. And while we understand that most people out there won’t have the technology to view 4K content, we decided that choosing the highest recording resolution for all four devices would be the fairest gauge. Duking it out will be:A slow but steady advancement of camera technology has us finding that most flagship smartphones are now capable of being the only device we’d use to take images and video, rendering point and shoots somewhat obsolete. Easily put – the best camera you’ll have is the one in your pocket.How you use that technology will be dictated by the photography skills you’ve honed throughout your “journey”, if there’s one to begin with. That said, a professional photographer could definitely take better photos than someone that has little/no knowledge on the matter. Of course, when using a smartphone, you don’t necessarily have to be knowledgeable in photography to begin with but have you seen those campaigns dedicated to showing off what these smartphone cameras are capable of?Apple has been running a  to show-off what the iPhones can do. Other smartphone makers didn’t bother following suit but you can check out their imaging and video capabilities through a quick search.When 4K video recording hit the scene back in 2013, we thought capturing content at that resolution was crazy; more so, when you’re viewing it on screens that hover around 5-inches.But we’re not here to argue about whether Full HD or Quad HD screens are sufficient when it comes to actually viewing the content on them. We’re here to see how 4 smartphones perform when tasked to handle the rough and bumpy Malaysian roads that often surprise you with a new pothole or two with every passing day – obviously, OIS would be important here.The following are a breakdown of the 4 respective specs:All four devices had some form of image/video stabilisation; the Nexus 6P uses software based technology, shared also by the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual which uses its own software-based two-stage SteadyShot stabilisation.On the other hand, Apple is the only one that uses solely hardware based stabilisation. Particularly special out of the bunch, the Galaxy Note5 uses both hardware and software video stabilisation but this combination is only available when shooting up to Full HD (1080p) at 30fps.We thought it was clear which came out on top but feel free to share your opinions."
Rory Lee,"HTC’s One X9 is definitely no flagship, but maybe that’s not such a bad thing",,"Android,Android Marshmallow,HTC,HTC One,HTC One A9,HTC One X9,HTC One X9 launch,HTC One X9 launch china,One A9,One X9 launch,One X9 launch china,smart phone,smartphone","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-28,"MORE HORSEPOWER. That’s usually a buyer’s biggest criteria when looking for a smartphone. It’s also what people look for when determining the value-for-money aspect of a device, as consumers will try their best to squeeze every bit of horsepower for as low of a price as possible.It is these buyers that were ultimately disappointed when  launched the  because it had decidedly mediocre specs for a not-low-at-all asking price of USD400. In a world where smartphone manufacturers are churning out devices with incredible specs for an equally incredible low price, this is simply unacceptable. Thankfully, HTC’s new “hero” device seems to rectify this problem, to some extent at least.Rumours have been floating around for awhile now about HTC’s new . Early leaks suggested that it could run the , which reignited the fire within the hearts of many an HTC fan. However, as time progressed, the rumours changed and on paper it looked like the One X9 .Well, the device has finally come out from the shadows and at first glance, it definitely doesn’t look like the flagship device everyone was clamouring for. Then again, since this was launched this year, were we realistically expecting it to outperform the  especially since it doesn’t even bear the M badge?The One X9 sports a 5.5″ 1080p panel (though there doesn’t seem to be any information on whether it will be an AMOLED or IPS screen) which results in a pixel density of 401 ppi that HTC claims has a 170-degree viewing angle. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 processor and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of internal storage. Thankfully, HTC has included a microSD slot that allows expansion up to 2TB.It will also feature a reasonably large 3,000 mAh battery and support for dual-SIM. Optics-wise, the device sports a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with optical image stabilisation and 4K video recording, plus a 5MP f/2.8 front-facing shooter. It is likely that the device will come pre-loaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, much like the HTC One A9.Although the specs are nothing to shout about, the device does bring back HTC’s much-loved BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers, something that is missing from it’s smaller brother, the One A9. HTC also went further down “nostalgia alley”, bringing back their backlit capacitive keys, which is placed where the HTC logo usually goes. One aspect that will be missed is the absence of a fingerprint sensor, something that is available on the HTC One A9.Another serving of good news is that the metallic smartphone looks to retail at a lower price than the One A9, coming in at 2,399 Yuan, which translates to around RM1,598. Yes, if you did pick up on it, the retail price is in CNY which means that this device — as of now — has only been launched in China with no information about availability elsewhere. This device, it seems, represents HTC’s stab at trying to get a bigger cut of the affordable premium smartphone market by competing with other Chinese manufacturers on their home soil.If you think horsepower is the be all and end all of smartphones, then this HTC One X9 will look like another disappointing HTC “hero” device that could have been so much more. It isn’t the best value-for-money device out there, but is a device’s worth measured only by how well it does on benchmarks? Sure, 4GB of RAM looks good on paper, but can you realistically feel the difference between 4GB and 3GB of RAM?Fit and finish has always been one of HTC’s strongest selling points. That and their front-facing speakers, both of which can be found on One X9. It honestly doesn’t look too bad either — except for that slightly sketchy camera visor — and based on the company’s track record, they certainly know how to do metal unibodies. The device’s closest competitor would probably be the Sony Xperia M5 Dual, and based on build alone, we definitely prefer a metal finish to the Xperia M5 Dual’s fingerprint-magnet glass-plastic construction.With proper optimisation, these specs should get you through day-to-day usage without a hitch and for a frankly reasonable price tag, this doesn’t seem like that bad a deal for HTC fans. Yeah, sure, you won’t be able to brag about it to your friends but then again, there aren’t that many brag-worthy HTC devices to begin with. With HTC’s flagships only managing to stay afloat as well as the Titanic could, perhaps the midrange premium market is where they can reclaim some of their former glory.[, , ]"

What caught everyone’s eye was the dragon it had beating at the heart of the device; a  to be specific. It was the first Windows Phone device to have been spotted with ‘s latest baby in the driver’s seat.What’s more, the GFXBench entry also indicated that the device would feature a large 5.8″ 2560×1440 pixel panel with a 20-megapixel primary camera and a 12MP front-facing selfie camera.Mmm, yummy specs.There were some oddities, however, as memory was only listed at 1GB of RAM with a peculiar 43GB of internal storage. Then again, it isn’t uncommon for manufacturers to configure the device differently when running benchmarks.In any case, it looks like there could be a monstrous Windows Phone (likely running Windows 10 Mobile) set to be released sometime next year. In fact, a new report out of  claims that the device could see an official unveiling at the upcoming  (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona next February.However, the report also notes that HP has yet to give the project the final go-ahead. With specs that exceed even Microsoft’s own Windows flagship devices (plus it could be cheaper), could this be the Windows Phone messiah fans have been waiting for?We doubt it. Especially if Windows 10 Mobile doesn’t receive the updates it needs in time. Though we haven’t spent time with the Lumia flagships, reports and reviews point to a worrying trend of incomplete (plus buggy) software, similar to that on the Surface line of 2-in-1 devices.Reviewers have noted some minor problems such as 4K video recording not working properly to big problems like the home screen disappearing entirely after an app crashes — something that happens quite often apparently — which shouldn’t happen in a completed product. If these problems lie with Windows 10 Mobile, then all the hardware in the world won’t be able to save the experience.It is admirable that it seems like HP wants to show Microsoft how to really build a Windows 10 Mobile flagship, but unless Redmond steps up its own game, the new device will likely not amount to anything. What a shame that would be.[, , ]"

OK, it’s quite useless actually since you can do practically everything on your Android smartphone anyway.So maybe , despite how incomplete and frustrating it is, is the way to go.  certainly thinks so since what looks like their latest 12-inch Windows 10 tablet was just certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG.Rumours that Samsung were working on a 12″ Windows 10 tablet have been floating around for quite some time now but this is the first piece of solid confirmation that this device is indeed in the pipeline. According to SamMobile Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG certifications are usually a good indicator that the device is on the way to the shelves soon.The 12-inch unit bearing the model number SM-W700 is said to feature a screen resolution of either 2560×1600 or 3840×2400. On the inside, the device will allegedly be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM.Some have said that the tablet may also come with an S Pen which, coupled with the full Windows 10 experience, could certainly improve productivity. If Samsung adds a keyboard accessory then we may have another Surface/iPad Pro challenger on our hands.As Android phones continue to get bigger, the equivalent OS tablet is becoming less and less relevant because people can already do so much on their phone. Front facing speakers plus a 5.7″ Smartphone can provide just as much immersion (if not more) as a side/rear speakered 7.9-inch tablet.It’s just not worth carrying an extra device just so you have a slightly bigger screen. Keep in mind bigger, in this sense, doesn’t always mean better as in general smartphones have a better pixel density than tablets and a better pixel density usually equals a better viewing experience.Let me put it this way, spreading a single cup of waffle batter over a baking tray the size of your palm would get you a thicker, fluffier, and more satisfying waffle versus spreading the same amount over a tray the size of a dining table.The same concept applies to screens. If you spread 1080p over a 5.7″ display, you’re bound to get a better screen than if it was spread over 12-inches of real estate.So if media consumption is not the best, productivity has to be the tablet’s redeeming factor, and in that Windows 10 beats Android hands down. Considering how wonky Windows 10 is, that’s saying quite a lot about how unoptimised Android is for the big screen.The Korean electronics giant isn’t the only one launching a Windows 10 tablet though as Xiaomi has just  in both Android and Windows 10. It has been a while since Samsung has launched a Windows-powered tablet but it seems that they’ve recognised that if you want a tablet, Android is no bueno.[]"

In a nutshell, Malaysians should be able to enjoy the full reload amount but provided that you’re registered. You are advised to check with your telco provider to ensure they have your correct details. The GST rebate is only for prepaid users, so Malaysian postpaid users will still continue to incur the 6% charge in their monthly bills.All domestic use including phone calls, SMS, mobile services and data are GST chargeable.

Following the release of its metal-clad , Xiaomi appears to be taking the same premium route for its upcoming budget device.The phone you’re seeing here has just appeared on China’s TENNA certification and it is believed to be the new Redmi 3. It gets an all metal back like its larger Redmi Note 3 but without a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Being a unibody design, the back cover doesn’t seem to be removable, which means you can’t replace the battery on your own. According to its purported spec-sheet, there will be a microSD expansion, which is likely to be housed on the SIM tray slot.

You take drastic measures, that’s what. Take a look at action camera maker GoPro’s , effectively halving its original USD400 price tag. It was simply too expensive for what it did and how it stacked up against GoPro’s own line, what more the competition. CEO John Chen apparently has the same idea because he recently said that the company’s latest (and only) Android smartphone, the , will be receiving a price cut next year. So, early PRIV adopters…oops?When everyone found out that the slider device would see an official launch in Malaysia, everyone began speculating on a price for BlackBerry’s flagship device. Simply converting its exorbitant American pricing of USD699 to our frankly depressing Ringgit, yielded a figure close to RM3,000 which caused some distress among the smartphone community.Then we found out that the  and everyone went nuts.

I think we can start to see why this device didn’t do as well as they wanted it to.To make matters worse, the smartphone didn’t feel like it was RM1,000 more premium than any of the other Android flagships. Performance then? Nope, it is smooth, but so is every other flagship device. Aha! The PRIV brought BlackBerry’s physical keyboard over, a big plus point when it comes to BlackBerry phones! Uh, nope. Based on our hands-on with the device at the launch event, the keyboard felt a little too soft and was nowhere near as satisfying to type on as older BlackBerry phones.It seems then that the Hail Mary phone that was supposed to be  for the Waterloo-based company, would instead end up being the . Seems like dire straits for John Chen, so he recently made an announcement that the device would receive a price cut around the time of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which will be held from February 22 to 25.Due to the obvious fact that the other smartphone manufacturers would be releasing new devices, John Chen said that the PRIV would receive a “mid-life kicker” in addition to its price cut to hopefully remain competitive in the free market. He seems optimistic enough though, since he said that if the PRIV performs well, they will . John, maybe you should start with that next time.While we don’t think that they would halve the price the PRIV, we do hope that it receives a significant enough price cut to remain competitive.

Arif Lee,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review: Best of the breed,,,,2015-12-24,"Microsoft said during their product launch that the  is measurable to the MacBook Air but we haven’t seen a refresh on that since March 2015. And that wasn’t a huge facelift to begin with, so 2016 could really shape up to be a big year for laptops and convertibles; Apple says they won’t bother making anything in-between the MacBook Air and iPad Pro but they may rework their formula – ala a Pencil instead of a stylus.Competition outside of Apple has everyone trying to “emulate” the Surface(s) and what they can do. The first name that comes to mind is the Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700, closely followed by HP’s Spectre x2. These two try to do what the Surface Pro 4 does but they don’t match up in terms of specs.This time around, more power equates to being more expensive. People might stay away hearing that, though we hope you’ll give this a read first before making any preconceived notions just based on the price."

Rory Lee,What if your car could see?,,"autonomous cars,SegNet,self-driving cars",Cool stuff,2015-12-23,"Autonomous cars are the next big thing. Well, it’s actually the current-to-next big thing, but we digress. The point is that people are apparently bored of driving cars and want systems and programs to drive them around everywhere so that they can sit in the back seat and pretend to be Donald Trump.The only problem with self-driving cars is that they aren’t able to function properly in the real world as you simply can’t replace human instinct and reaction when things on the road get challenging. Why? Because cars can’t see in real time the way we do, so it makes it very difficult to make split second decisions when that double parked car pulls out suddenly.Apparently, now they can.
Thanks to SegNet, a new system created by the University of Cambridge, your dreams of being driven around by software might just come into fruition. SegNet can “read” the road in front if it, allowing it to differentiate various elements like the sky, other cars, road markings and even people.SegNet “sees” the road in an RGB image and then classifies different layers and objects using a  of the scene. According to the release, the system can “take an image of a street scene it hasn’t seen before and classify it, sorting objects into 12 different categories in real time”. It can also apparently deal with light, shadow and night environments and currently labels more than 90% of pixels correctly.Unlike laser/radar-guided systems that require expensive base sensors which cost more than the car itself, SegNet has been “trained” by a group of Cambridge undergraduates who manually labelled every pixel in over 5,000 images. Once that was complete, the researchers proceeded to train the system for over 2 days, after which one of the students notes that it is surprisingly good at recognising things in an image.From our testing, we tend to agree. It does a remarkable job at differentiating between the 12 elements though there is quite a lot of polishing to do, especially at night. As this system is “trained” though, it can only get better over time as it sees more images and learns to recognise more elements.One of the biggest problems about driving around in Malaysia is that the lines are never where they should be. Add that to the fact that people double park like there is no tomorrow and that the roads have potholes the size of Canada, even human beings would have trouble navigating our treacherous streets, what more a software?With this though, there is the potential to train the system to recognise these little nuances that make up our little snowflake of a country. Given the right circumstances, the possibilities are quite endless. Although the researchers say that this is still far from being able to be implemented into autonomous cars, we could possibly see this in a domestic robot – like a robot vacuum cleaner – in the short term.From where we stand, trust in an autonomous car seems to be the biggest hurdle for people to overcome. Would you relinquish control of your car in a highway to a computer program developed by some bloke in a laboratory?If you want to test out this system for yourself, head on over to  and you can upload a picture of your own to be scanned by SegNet, or you can browse through the sample images they’ve uploaded.[, , ]"

And we mean big feature.As our demands for smartphone performance and portability grows, manufacturers have often skimmed on battery life to ensure that their device stays as lean and mean as possible. But that means they hardly ever last a day, much less two days. Carrying a power bank or a charger has become a norm in our society.Acer has good news for those who want raw, unadulterated battery power, because their  smartphone comes with an enormous 4,000 mAh replaceable battery. With a battery this size it becomes very unlikely that you will need to carry a powerbank around, much less another battery.In fact, that massive battery supports USB OTG (on-the-go) charging so you can even help a friend out by giving them a quick top-up if their device is running low on battery. Mighty handy in a pinch and for RM659, this is one of the most affordable and good valued devices with a 4,000 mAh battery that supports OTG charging in Malaysia.This is because the device itself does boast pretty decent specs, with a quad-core MediaTek processor clocked at 1.3GHz paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. This should ensure that everyday tasks and light to moderate application multitasking will go on without a hitch. It also has a 5.5-inch HD IPS panel and an 8-megapixel front and rear camera combo.8-megapixels is quite a lot for a front facing camera, especially in this device’s price bracket. Even some flagship devices only rock a 5MP sensor. More megapixels mean that your selfies will be much more detailed and less pixelated.If you don’t fancy such a big device, or you simply feel that you don’t need all that battery power, Acer does offer a smaller device with a 5” HD IPS display, the Acer . The name suggests that this smartphone would be a downgrade from the the Liquid Z630, but it also shares its bigger brother’s internal hardware as well as camera optics. That’s a pretty good deal for RM559.Acer also has an entry level device in the Liquid Z line, the Liquid , priced at RM439. It comes bundled with a 1.1GHz Snapdragon 210 quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM running underneath its 4.5” screen. That should be more than enough for you to get a feel of what the Android experience is all about, making this device the perfect starter smartphone for anyone.All three devices will have blazingly fast dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity and will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Acer’s Liquid UI running over it. Additionally, these devices will have the Acer Float Apps which essentially allows users to open more than one application and multitask at the same time. Acer also bundles a Float Caller which appears as a mini popup when a call comes in, letting the user decide how to respond without interrupting what they’re doing.Every one of the trio will also have what Acer calls the Quick Mode. The Quick Mode functions to allow users to pick between three customised layout options: Standard Mode (for those familiar with smartphones), Easy Mode (for those just starting out), and Basic Mode (locks down application and usage for kids).There is also a Kids Center application which grants parental control over the device for a safer browsing, viewing and playing environment for your child. These devices also come with Acer’s Bluelightshield which reduces strain on the eyes by reducing the amount of blue light emissions from the display.For more information, head over to ."

While the underlying operating system is the same, each brand would have their own customised skin to differentiate themselves from the rest. For the regular consumer, the custom interface adds more value and nifty features which . Of course, there are others that will consider pre-installed software as unnecessary bloatware, and proclaim plain vanilla is the way to go. Whichever side you pick, let’s take a look at the Chinese manufacturers. With Apple seen as a status symbol, most of these Chinese smartphone UI lacks an App Drawer. Yes, it can be simple for first timers but power users might find it cluttered or annoying when it comes to organising their home screens. Of course, another popularity with Chinese Android UI is the wide availability of themes that you can customise to your preference.So Xiaomi has their MIUI, while Huawei has their very own EMUI. On the current version, EMUI looks awfully similar to Xiaomi’s own interface from the flat icon design, to the minimalistic approach for its built-in apps such as phone dialer, alarm clock, stopwatch, toggle switches and even the menu page. Even the shutdown menu interface that’s displayed after long pressing the power button looks the same as well. Just recently, images of OPPO’s new ColorOS 3.0 has surfaced, and it looks awfully familiar with both custom interfaces. The photos you’re seeing here is an  that runs on ColorOS 3.0.0_151216_Alpha. At first glance, it looks like another honor device if you didn’t notice the ColorOS and OPPO branding. So far there’s no word of its release but it is likely to be running out of the box with their upcoming 2016 models. Disappointingly, it still runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop instead of the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow.At the rate these Chinese companies are going, they all might end up looking the same and the only difference is the exterior and the logo plastered at the back.

Rory Lee,Time to add some toppings to your vanilla Android experience,,,,2015-12-21,"Earlier, we covered why , much to the chagrin of fanatical  purists who didn’t hesitate to declare their undying devotion to the stock Android experience, mocking us in the process. While that was – for the most part – amusing, we were glad to see that there were even more who were able to form logical arguments and valid points towards the strengths and weaknesses of the stock OS.Kudos to you!What most people do not realise is that there are users (in fact a considerable majority) who use their devices in the configuration it came out of the box, fearing to dig deeper into their device’s settings in the event something disastrous happens. While one could make the argument that previous Nexus devices were geared more towards those with experience rather than the mass market, we feel that the  is the first truly “mainstream” Nexus device that we would have no problem recommending to anyone.It’s got great software, a great camera, a great screen, and a premium build with a premium price to boot. Naturally, more and more people who are not so entrenched, some inexperienced, in the ways of the Android (sorry coming off a Star Wars high here) would be enticed to purchase this device.If you are one of those people and the entire universe of Android customisation seems a little too overwhelming, fret not, we’ve got you covered. Here are a few bite-sized pieces of beginner-friendly customisability that should improve the usability of your Nexus device."

What do you do?So this happened at .CEO  told all his staff to prepare for a beach holiday, which meant dressing up in beach wear, bringing a valid passport and packed suitcase, when they came to work on Thursday (Dec 17).On the day, Morten did an unplanned town hall and randomly picked the names of 13 lucky Maxis employees. All of them won an all-expenses VIP trip for two to Bali. Right after the announcement, the winners we’re chauffeured to KLIA and were soon on their way to Bali, just like that.It’s refreshing to see a company with such a fun and dynamic CEO like Morten. And those who got picked to go on the trip certainly got a huge morale boost. I like companies that do crazy things like this and I guess Morten subscribes to the belief that if you take care of your employees, your employees will take care of your customers. And if your customers are happy, your company should be doing ok.Some may disagree but I think Maxis is one of the better mobile operators in Malaysia. They are not perfect but they’re doing the right things.I hope the positive vibe that Morten is spreading to his employees carries through to the customer experience. And as a Maxis customer, I certainly wouldn’t mind getting a phone call from Morten out of the blue telling me that I got chosen to go on an all-expenses paid beach holiday. That would make me happy.What do you guys think?"

The  with two selfie cameras has officially arrived in Malaysia. This mid-range device allows you to do more than just taking a standard picture of yourself. The unique dual-camera concept is quite similar to HTC’s Duo Camera setup and Lenovo is taking it to the front seat for better selfies. It consists of an 8MP main camera and it is assisted by a 2MP secondary unit that helps with depth of field. This allows you to take creative blur shots with refocusing and bokeh effects. It is a shame that it doesn’t come with a front facing flashlight. If you need to take better lit selfies, you can always pop-in an optional VIBE Xtension selfie flash that plugs into the headphone jack. For regular photoshoots, the rear of the Vibe S1 has a 13MP ybut with Phase Detection AF, and it is assisted by dual-tone LED flash. As for the phone, it gets a 5″ Full HD IPS display and it is powered by a 64-bit MediaTek MT6752 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board, it gets a generous 32GB of storage which is expandable with microSD. Like most smartphones today, it supports 4G LTE and has Dual-SIM slots. Keeping the lights on is a 2,500mAh capacity battery and overall it weighs 132 grams with a respectable thickness of 7.8mm. At time of writing, the Vibe S1 is running on Android 5.0 Lollipop.If you love taking selfies, this could be the device for you. However for those who prefer to take photos with the rear camera, the  would be the better alternative as it comes with a 16MP main camera with Optical Image Stabiliser and Laser Auto Focus.

Rory Lee,So this is what happens when a Nexus device has a meltdown,,"Android,google,Google Nexus,Google Nexus 5X,LG Nexus 5X,Nexus 5X,nexus 5x explode,nexus 5x exploding,nexus 5x melt,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,LG,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Others",2015-12-21,"When the new Nexus devices, the  and the , were announced, Android users were very excited.

Even more excited than others were the fans of ‘s old  because they finally had an upgrade to their beloved 4.95-inch phone.Well, that was until it melted in one of their pockets.User AFChimpanse took to the  forums yesterday and shared a story about how his/her brand new Nexus 5X had a meltdown, literally. According to the OP (original poster), the device was sitting in his/her pocket when suddenly it started heating up. When the OP took it out, it continued to heat up and started producing a “low frizzling sound” releasing an “extremely toxic smell”. The smartphone eventually got too hot to hold in the hand and the OP had to put it down.When (we’re assuming the frizzling had died down) the device was picked up again, the user noticed that a portion of the back cover to the right of the LG logo had melted inwards. User DarcyFitz and GlassHalfFull pointed out that it should be a battery issue judging from the location of the melted bit relative to the device’s internals identified by iFixit’s teardown photo:According to AFChimpanse, the device was only 11 days old and had never been plugged into a third-party charger before. So I guess we can rule out  as a cause.While there is nothing official to validate the user’s claims, this isn’t the first time a smartphone has exploded, as there have been cases where  and this  (though this was ) suffered a similar fate. Most smartphone batteries are filled with chemicals that could potentially be triggered if it endures excessive force or physical trauma, as can be seen in this video by TechRax below:Although you might not be taking a hammer to your device, there is a chance that these devices may come in contact some unfavourable conditions which may cause undesired reactions. Unfortunately, when it comes to phones you stop drop and roll so if your phone is getting a little hotter than usual, our suggestion would be to take it out of your pocket immediately. We don’t think this is the type of explosion you’d want in your pants.As you know, the Nexus 5X isn’t officially available in Malaysia, but you can .

All he wanted was to buy an iPhone 6, but instead, he was forced to fork out more than double the price by an unscrupulous seller. Just when you thought nobody will pull the same trick here in Malaysia, think again. A local paper had reported several customers being held against their will until they pay up more than what was agreed upon. A 28-year-old victim was reported to be buying 4 phones at RM200 each at Kota Raya Shopping Complex. However after making the payment of RM800, he was told to enter a secluded room where he was locked up for hours. He was then told to pay an exorbitant RM10,000 fee for his release. Eventually, the victim was set free, but not after he withdrawn RM5,000 from an ATM. To rub salt to the wound, the 4 phones which he got was different from what was shown earlier. Obviously, the next thing to do was to report to the relevant authorities. He was said to have complained to several agencies including the Ministry of trade and Consumer Affairs, but no action has been taken. As a last resort, he seeks help from PPIM (Persatuan Pengguna Islam Malaysia) which proceeded to raid the shop. From the operation, it was found that there are a number of phone shops at Kota Raya that are selling counterfeit products at skyrocketed prices. In total, they had managed to cover as much as RM11,900 on behalf of 7 victims. Apart from locals, these shops tend to target foreigners especially women that would often fall prey to such tactics. As always, it is advisable to shop at reputable retailers and beware of dodgy dealers that offer unbelievable deals. If the deal is too good to be true, then it probably is. This isn’t just limited to expensive phone models as we’ve seen  in the market as well.If you’re planning to get a smartphone, it is best to visit an authorised dealer or order directly from the official online store.

No surprise as the “USD to MYR” was searched highly too, followed by “GST” and the “Bersih 4.0″ rally.For the top 10 most searched individuals list, it seemed that Malaysians looked for information regarding notable people who passed away during the year. That includes, the late: Lee Kuan Yew, Former Prime Minister of Singapore; Paul Walker, the famous actor that passed away during a car crash; and Kevin Morais, the murdered deputy prosecutor.Our current Prime Minister was also on the list, while athlete Farah Ann Abdul Hadi made her way on it as well (for obvious, gymnastic attire reasons). People also kept up with international news, as searches for the missing QZ8501 airplane, the Paris Attacks and ISIS, topped the list for trending news searches.The list of searches really show what we’re looking for, be it happenings of the world or an important individual. Given the growth of the Internet and Google being one of the go-to search engines (seriously, who still uses Yahoo or Bing?), we’ll continue to see what sort of information our country is keen to look for, hopefully John Cena won’t make the list again next year.For a full low-down on what Malaysians looked for on the internet, head on over to the full-list ."

Then again, the ability to view petrol prices doesn’t really matter here since it is standardised across all stations.In any case, this will surely put a smile on iOS users’ faces (ironic that it would be Google to do so) as they now have another choice for reliable offline navigation in Malaysia.[]"

Many, ourselves included, felt that Microsoft shipped an unfinished product. From what we gathered, it isn’t the hardware that the Surface users are unhappy about, rather it was the software implementation that let the devices down.What’s worse, Microsoft’s “solution” to the problem was an apology on their forums which only served to irk more users. Now though, they seem to have actually come up with a solution to at least one of their problems.Besides the issues with the device’s power drainage during sleep and random reboots, one other nagging issue was the Surface device’s keyboard and touchpad. The much improved Surface Pro 4 Type Cover keyboard was so advanced, it seemed, that it didn’t deem the Surface Pro 4 a worthy device and thus refused to pair with it properly. The Surface Pro 4 had issues connecting with its keyboard, especially when removing the Type Cover and reattaching it, bugging out the mouse cursors and other modes for Continuum.For us, the problems were more rudimentary when it came to the Surface Pro 4. We found out that if the keyboard was attached when the device was off, it wouldn’t detect the keyboard when we switched it on, forcing us to disengage and reattach the keyboard to the device.This update also affects Surface Book users, where apparently the device had problems with its touchpad and keyboard as well. Here are the changelogs:If you were anywhere near as excited as us for the launch of the Surface Pro 4, and dropped a considerable chunk of your savings to get one with the Type Cover keyboard, I’m sure you were equally crestfallen when you discovered that Microsoft already knew the device had issues yet still decided to put it in the market.While doing something like this is, frankly, unforgivable, you’d think that a company as big as Microsoft would have some kind of fix ready almost immediately after it put an unfinished product on sale. Instead, they said that major fixes would .In any case, these problems seem to be software based, and fixable via updates so if you’ve bought a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book device, our advice is to hunker down and weather this initial storm in the hopes that your device will eventually live up to its full potential.If you’re still on the fence about purchasing one, stay tuned to our upcoming review of the Surface Pro 4 where we will be taking a close look at the device, all of its problems, fixes and more.[]"

This will be the first time you’re seeing Continuum: a PC-like experience on your Lumia 950 or 950 XL via Display Dock and Windows 10 on any smartphone. The question is, will it change Microsoft’s success in the local market? Let’s see if Digi enterprise/business customers take advantage of this special deal.The smaller of the two, the Lumia 950 will be absolutely free of charge though it’ll come with a hefty monthly fee of RM 238 on a 2 year (24 months) contract – working out to a huge RM 5,712 total. It isn’t just for the phone, as you’ll be getting 10GBs of mobile data, totally unlimited calls, text and instant messaging (WhatsApp and WeChat).If you’d prefer something bigger and more powerful, the Lumia 950 XL will be available too. You’ll get the same plan as talked about above, at the same monthly price, but you’ll have to fork out an additional RM 330 upfront for the smartphone itself; bringing you to an eventual RM 6,042 total cost.Given that spending RM 238 per month doesn’t sound as practical for someone who doesn’t use all that bundled data, calls/texts and instant messaging, you can bump that price down by choosing other Digi plans that will be announced on the 18th of December; mind you, the two smartphones’ will cost more, but you’ll be paying less monthly.During the same announcement, Digi mentioned that this collaboration will bring about a third (more affordable) device, the Microsoft Lumia 550, that will be free on the Digi SmartPlan 98. It’ll be available slightly later, at the end of December of this year.Head on over to our  for a full recap of what these Windows 10 devices have to offer, as well as their full specs."

They flooded the online stores on  and  which resulted in an impressive  itself. However, purchasing anything online can be rather risky because sometimes, mix ups can happen.Local Ian Oz found this out the hard way. He, like many other Nexus 6P fans, ordered the device off Lazada’s website, however, when the package arrived, instead of unwrapping a brand spanking new smartphone, Ian unwrapped a pair of…earrings? Oh dear.
It turns out Lazada had somehow screwed up the order and sent Ian six pairs of earrings (worth RM58), which were initially meant for someone named Irene Yeow. The worst part was that based on the receipt, Irene’s earrings were meant to go Johor, which in case you didn’t know, is in another state.As it looks like Lazada had mistakenly stuffed the earrings into the Nexus 6P package, it seems likely that Ian’s smartphone was stuffed into the earrings package. The good news is that there is a contact number included in the shipping invoice. Ian, obviously outraged, took his irritation onto the social media, posting a picture of his receipt on Huawei’s Facebook page. Luckily, Huawei responded fairly quickly and ensured Ian that they had escalated the problem to their core fulfillment team and Lazada.What we don’t understand is how a mistake like this could be made in the first place. On the Pos Laju statement, it clearly states that the package should weigh 0.2kg (Nexus 6P weighs around 178g) which reflects the device’s weight, but it seems unlikely that six pairs of earrings would weigh the same as Google’s latest device.Nevertheless, paying RM58 for a brand new Nexus 6P seems like a phenomenal deal. Where can we sign up for it? In all seriousness though, we wish Ian luck in the retrieval of his device because we know how terrible it must feel to pay over two and a half thousand ringgit only for your shipment to be messed up. If you were thinking about getting the Nexus 6P, perhaps it would be wiser to purchase it from , which is Huawei’s official online store.[]"

Well,  has the next best thing. Ahead of the official Malaysian premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Google has thrown together an interesting new Chrome web browser experience that lets you wield a lightsaber to fend off First Order Stormtroopers.The Lightsaber Escape game uses a simple mechanism that lets you wield your phone as if it was a lightsaber and slay Stormtroopers on either your laptop or computer in an attempt to escape a space station. Here’s how you play: Simply log on to the Lightsaber Escape  with your laptop or computer, then enter the URL displayed on the resulting web page into your phone. Once there, your phone should begin calibrating its accelerometer and upon completion, turn into the lightsaber it was always meant to be. You can then either play it on your computer’s monitor or cast/hook it up to a projector and have some theater level fun like we did.When you’re calibrated and past the tutorial mission, that’s when the real fun begins. The game takes you on an on-rail action adventure through a space station filled with Stormtroopers who happen to be surprisingly accurate. With your trusty lightsaber equipped, you will engage in ranged combat, where you deflect blaster fire back at your attackers,  as well as melee combat. We haven’t made it far enough into the game where we’ve encountered a Sith yet, so do let us know in the comments below if you have.It is a fantastic experience we highly recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or otherwise especially since it works on both iOS and Android. We did encounter some input lag in our adventures through the game as well as some drops in framerate but that is kind of expected when playing a browser game. The experience in itself more than makes up for it though, so all is forgiven. Maybe by the next installment of the Star Wars franchise we will be able to play this (or something like this) in virtual reality.[]"

Alexander Wong,Microsoft Lumia 950/950 XL: Are these really made for productivity?,,,,2015-12-16,"When Microsoft , they had embarked on a One Windows strategy. It aims to converge its latest operating system across a variety of devices, no matter what screen size you’re on. So this means all Windows Phones are simply called a Windows 10 mobile device.It has been a while since we’ve seen a flagship Lumia and the last one was the  back in early 2014. After Microsoft took the helm of the mobile business, they are mostly preoccupied with entry to mid-range devices running on Windows Phone 8.1.After almost 2 years of waiting, the  and  have officially landed in Malaysia. Not only this is the first flagship Lumia under the Microsoft banner, but most importantly they are the first Windows 10 smartphones in the market.Like most flagships today, Microsoft is going with a two size approach for its flagship. The Lumia 950 with a compact 5.2″ display is going for RM2,699 while its larger 5.7″ “phablet” model, the Lumia 950 XL is priced at RM2,999. That’s a significant price jump over its predecessors, and you can partly blame our foreign exchange rates for that.The internals has the best specs you would expect from a flagship, which includes Quad HD displays, Snapdragon 808/810 processors, 3GB of RAM and a minimum of 32GB of storage. Both has an expandable microSD slot and dual-SIM slots with 4G LTE support.Being a flagship Lumia, it comes equipped with their renowned PureView camera. It has a 20MP sensor at the rear with triple LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation, while the front 5MP camera takes care of selfie duties. Keeping up with the times, it also shoots videos in 4K resolution. There’s fast charge that does 0-50% in 30 minutes, USB Type-C connectivity and Qi wireless charging support. The only difference between the 950 and its XL version is the screen size, processors (950 – Snapdragon 808, 950 XL – Snapdragon 810) and battery capacity (950 – 3,000mAh, 950 XL – 3,340mah). On concerns of overheating, Microsoft says they have implemented liquid cooling to keep things cool as the going gets tough."
Rory Lee,HTC’s One X9 has one interesting camera “visor”,,"Android,HTC,HTC One A9,HTC One M9,HTC One X9,htc one x9 leak,rumour mill,smart phone,smartphone,smartphone leak","Android,HTC,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-15,"HTC is going through a rough patch lately. Not only did their flagship device lose out to high-end flagships from other manufacturers like  and , it was also plagued with controversy as its Snapdragon 810 was running way too hot, all of which led to . Then in hopes of pulling more sales, they launched the  which has been accused of looking , though was rather well received by critics. On paper, the One A9’s specs were far from being a world beater, with only a Snapdragon 617 processor mated with 2GB of RAM, so it left many HTC fans who desired a worthy flagship wanting more.Then, the Taiwanese company gave fans another glimmer of hope when the  leaked online with what . Now, more pictures of the device have also been leaked and it looks…different to say the least.Based on the pictures, the new addition to the One lineup looks to have a couple of very interesting design choices. The first, and most obvious of which, is that camera “visor” ala-Nexus 6P that stretches across the top of the device right around the camera module.When images of the Nexus 6P were first leaked and people saw the visor, they were a little apprehensive to it and how it seemed to have tainted what could have been a good looking device. Now though, that visor has become a signature of the latest Nexus device and at a glance, people can easily differentiate it from its less powerful brother the Nexus 5X. The thing is, while Huawei decided to set that visor apart, letting it dominate in its blackness across the top of the phone, HTC seems to have tried to “hide” their “visor” by painting it the same colour as the rest of the device.Again, apprehensive is the word we could best use to describe those looks. That said, taste varies between the individual so there obviously will be people who completely dig that look. Around the front of the device, HTC seems to have gone “retro” with the inclusion of capacitive buttons along the bottom of the device (where their logo usually is) while the HTC logo has moved to the device’s forehead. There also seems to be, what looks like, a pair of front facing speakers (which we hope are BoomSound speakers) as well as a front facing camera.The HTC One X9 recently . revealing what looks to be some frankly disappointing specifications. It looks like the device will be running an octa-core 2.2GHz processor (which rules out the Snapdragon 820 and Helios X20 rumoured earlier) mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable via microSD up to 1TB. The smartphone also looks to sport a 5.5″ full HD IPS display (1920×1080 pixels).In terms of optics, the device will get a 13MP primary camera with an LED flash and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter on the front. It is also rumoured to run Android 5.0.1 Lollipop (likely with HTC’s Sense UI on top) out of the box. To be fair, we couldn’t really expect this to be a full-fledged flagship device, especially since it doesn’t bear the M badge. One could hope, right?[, , ]"

Hold on a minute, the latest Android hasn’t even gone mainstream but they want to talk about the future?Representing Google during an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session, the 6-man team chipped in on a slew of topics, including: the direction of Pixel C and the future of Android. If you’re asking why there’s such a bridging of the two; it’s mainly due to a merger that’s reported to take place come 2017.The report suggests that heads at Google think combining the two makes the most sense, since Android has had an early start as an operating system for quite some time. And we’re already starting to see small changes that point towards a unification in latest Pixel product.Google’s Pixel branding has been have over the place, of late; partly due to the Pixel C choosing Android over Chrome OS. This further points to a crossover of operating systems and that might mean more “desktop”-like capabilities to ease productivity in the following phase of Android.So while mediating all these unanswered questions regarding the switch, the software team thought it would be a great idea to hold an AMA session. Allowing users to ask whatever they needed to. But it was surprising that the developers choose to share two facts about Android N, given that non-Nexus devices have yet to receive Marshmallow.The first of the two is a proper split-screen/multi-window function that we’ve already seen on iOS (iPad Pro only) and some Android OEM skins as well. This pretty much only applies to tablets since it’ll be a tiresome experience navigating multiple windows on your smartphone screen.Another feature that came about was DisplayPort via USB Type-C connector, that a competitor has put to good use – yes, we’re looking at Windows with their Continuum support. A trend that you could see a mile away, with more people dropping PCs for day to day task and opting convertibles that are slowly catching up in the processor department.These replies below were from the team themselves:Faster processors in smaller packages are already here and they’ll only continue to get better.

Almost 2 years ago, YTL was  to be testing  on 2.3GHz, which supposedly is more efficient in bandwidth and cost. Utilising Time Division instead of Frequency Division, TD-LTE requires just one channel for download/upload as opposed to having a pair of frequencies for the same purpose. In Malaysia, our existing telcos are running on FDD-LTE, while TD-LTE is commonly used in China and India. Whether  boils down to the telco itself. It is not what you have, but how you manage your network and your customer experience. Seamless transition from WiMAX, is also a factor why YTL favours TD-LTE.

The full HD display remains a Super AMOLED unit and it is purported to be running on a 1.8GHz Snapdragon 620 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM.Accompanying its bigger screen is a larger 4,000mAh capacity battery. It isn’t confirmed yet but word has it that it could be used to charge other devices via USB OTG as seen on most recent smartphones with larger batteries. It also gets the same 13MP f/1.9 shooter with OIS as the rest, however the front gets an upgrade to 8MP for higher resolution selfie shots. On-board storage is said to be atleast 32GB with the option to expand further with microSD. The home button also comes with an integrated fingerprint scanner which can be used for Samsung Pay. The Galaxy A9 is expected to be available in China by end of this month or early January next year with an estimated price tag of 3,000CNY (about RM2,000). [ ,  ]"

Announced during IFA 2015, the Acer Predator 8 has finally arrived in Malaysia. Sporting a 8″ Full HD (1920×1200) display, this is Acer’s compact tablet with the gamer in mind. It gets a gaming inspired aluminium frame and has not one, not two but four front-facing speakers with Dolby Audio enhancement. For a more immersive gaming experience, the Android tablet has two haptic motors inside that rumbles on both ends. Powering the device is Intel’s Atom x7-Z8700 2.4GHz Quad-Core processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. Onboard, it gets 32GB of storage which you can expand via a microSD up to 128GB. The Predator 8’s IPS display claims to have 100% NTSC colour gamut that provides a vibrant and accurate colour reproduction. The included MediaMaster settings let you optimise the display and audio for gaming, movie, photo viewing and standard modes. The main highlight, of course, would be its Predator Quadio (Quad Audio) setup that offers a virtual surround sound. Whether you’re holding it in landscape or portrait mode, it is smart enough to switch orientation automatically. Despite its chunky utilitarian appearance, it is 8.7mm thin and weighs 350 grams including its 4,420mAh battery. It does feel solid in the hands while the red coloured speaker grills protrude out from each corner to remind you that this is no ordinary tablet. There’s no 3G/4G mobile connectivity, but it has your usual Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and 802.11n WiFi with 2×2 MIMO support. Should you need to take pictures, it gets a 2MP shooter at the front while the rear gets a 5MP camera. At time of writing, it runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop.The Acer Predator 8 will go on sale in Malaysia starting next week with the retail price tag of RM1,499. To get your game on, they have also pre-installed Asphalt 8 with 320,000 credits worth US$50."

The PRIV does have a trick up its sleeve though as it features a physical QWERTY keyboard that slides out from under its display.This slide out keyboard also functions as a touchpad for scrolling that makes text selection quicker and more accurate. There is also a text prediction feature that lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard.BlackBerry’s PRIV is the largest device the ever manufactured by the Waterloo corporation and comes with a 5.4″ quad-HD panel, that is curved every so slightly, similar to  and . Spec-wise, the device runs an octa-core Snapdragon 808 processor with 3GB of ram and 32GB of internal storage. Storage is expandable via microSD up to 2TB, assuming you ever find cards with that much storage.Powering the device is a relatively large 3,140 mAh battery and it also runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box. The bonus feature is that the PRIV comes with a host of BlackBerry productivity apps including a unified Hub.In terms of optics, the device features an 18-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) and a dual-LED flash. It is also certified by Schneider-Kreuznach. Unfortunately, the PRIV only receives a 2-megapixel selfie-panorama front facing camera for selfies, which we’re sure may disappoint some. However, cameras aren’t all about optics, so we will have to see how good this 2MP shooter is.Many expect the PRIV to be a game changer as it is supposed to bring the best of both Android and BlackBerry operating systems together in a premium device. Well, it certainly has to be a game changer because BlackBerry CEO has stated that the company is relying heavily on the PRIV to do well for them to stay afloat.If you want to get your hands on this device, you can preorder the PRIV at a discounted price of RM3,388 for the first 60 customers on , or head over to any Celcom Blue Cube outlets to preorder for the same price until the 14th of December.

These are synonymous with Apple. People may disagree with a lot of things but many will agree that when it comes to making something as ubiquitous as a smartphone look like a work of art, Apple does it best.But sometimes, even the best get it wrong.This is the Apple Smart Battery Case. It’s the company’s first ever battery pack and it’s decidedly un-Apple. More on that later but first, let’s go into the specs.The Smart Battery Case is a battery pack that fits the  and . It packs a 1,877mAh battery and Apple says it’s good for 18 hours of internet browsing time on LTE or 20 hours of video playback time. The battery case has a soft touch silicone exterior with a microfibre inner lining to protect your iPhone. There are two colours to choose from (white and charcoal gray) currently and it’s the only battery case that comes with a lighting connector.So why is the Smart Battery Case un-Apple?It’s the design. Next to the slim, sleek and slender iPhone 6, the Smart Battery Case, with its unsightly bulge, looks like an afterthought, like the designers at Apple didn’t even bother to make this thing look good.It’s not that great as a battery case either. There’s no separate switch to activate or deactivate the battery case and the lack of an external battery indicator makes it difficult to know how much power you have left without turning on your iPhone.You do however get an integrated battery status built into iOS when the battery case is plugged into your iPhone but that means you will have to turn on your phone every time you want check the power status of the battery case.And for the  asking price, you’re not getting a lot. A popular battery case alternative like the  with a 2,750mAh battery pack, a dedicated on/off switch and external LED indicators costs about the same.So if you’re an iPhone 6 or 6S user that’s constantly looking for a power point because your iPhone is out of battery, you might want to stay away from the Apple Battery Pack. It’s ugly, it’s expensive and for something that’s designed for the iPhone by the makers of the iPhone itself, it’s decidedly un-Apple.Maybe Apple took some inspiration from the device below.

Malaysian  fans have been clamouring for the Apple Watch ever since it was announced, but here we are eight months later and still no Watch in sight. Well, we actually don’t know if this is good news or just slightly sad news because apparently Apple is already preparing a March 2016 event to unveil the second generation Apple Watch alongside what could be the 4-inch “iPhone 6c”.9to5Mac reports that the second-generation wearable could possibly start shipping in April, a full year after the first device was launched.

If it follows in the footsteps of the iPhone 5c then it should come in a plastic body sporting a multitude of funky and bright colours. The smaller size would be a throwback to a time before iPhones became “iPhablets” which we’re sure will be welcomed by those with smaller hands.However, with the current abysmal exchange rate of the Ringgit, if this device is launched, would it be affordable enough to appeal to those below the high-end market? Based on the iPhone 5c’s , RM1,999 for the 16GB model and RM2,399 for the 32GB model (keep in mind both of these are without GST), we doubt so.

The magnetic keyboard is a USD149 (around RM635) optional extra, but it does also come with a folio keyboard, similar to the Nexus 9’s and will also be priced at USD149. Based on these figures, the Pixel C looks like its a pretty good bargain, especially if you compare it with the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet which will set you back RM2,699 for the device and another RM799 for the accompanying keyboard.Unfortunately, the Pixel C isn’t available in Malaysia. As of this moment there doesn’t seem to be any information on availability in our market but we do hope they will bring it over soon so that we can see first hand what Google thinks is the proper way to build a tablet.[, , ]"

In the face of heighten competition from its affordable Chinese rivals, they are continuing to grow from 3.9 million units shipped in Q1 this year to 4.7 million shipped in the last quarter. Driving the sales is their popular Charge and Surge, as they continue to increase its presence worldwide. According to IDC, the increase for Fitbit was also attributed to the rise of corporate wellness programs with large corporations providing Fitbit trackers for their staff. With the entry of Apple Watch, the Cupertino company has managed to catapult itself to 2nd place, putting a dent to the market share of current wearable brands. In Q3, Apple has shipped 3.9 Watches, an increase of 300,000 over Q2 as it increased its availability to more market. Strangely Malaysians are still not getting the Watch, while it is already on sale officially in Singapore, Thailand and most recently  starting yesterday.At number 3 for Q3 2015 is Xiaomi with its super affordable Mi Band. So far they have shipped out 9.6 million units for 2015 and they are expected to close the year higher after its recent Single’s Day sale.

It also doesn’t have optical image stabilisation, which by today’s standards could be a big no-noGoogle does however bet on the sensors large pixel size, listed at 1.55 µm to compensate the fact that the lens has no Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS). A combination of an aperture of f/2.0 and the larger micrometre would mean that it’ll absorb a lot more light, at least on paper; making shots in low light scenes easier to manage. Also, PDAF and laser autofocus makes a formidable duo, mediating those poorly dialed in images.How about the front?

Announced just in time for the mega Single’s Day sale in China, the  is bringing its audio experience up a notch while maintaining a low price tag. The V3 Piston priced at RM69 were much improved over its former V2.1 Pistons with an ergonomically designed earpiece for greater comfort. The new Pro version carries this over and it boasts better sound with its hybrid driver set up consisting of a dynamic unit and a two-way balanced armature driver. On the exterior, it gets a polished metal back and it uses a durable Kevlar fiber cable that’s wrapped in a braided sleeve. For smartphone use, there’s a 3-button controller with a built-in mic attached to the right side cable. Despite its more upmarket audio credentials, the packaging for the Mi In-Ear Headphones Pro is rather basic compared to its former Piston V2.1/V3.0 series. There’s no nice hard plastic case or a rubber cable organiser. For RM79, we can’t really complain and it has a stronger bass than the previous Pistons. If you want something better than your stock bundled headphones, this pair is definitely worth paying for.

Rory Lee,"Samsung Galaxy A line unveiled, premium for the masses v2.0",,"Android,budget smartphone,Samsung,samsung budget smartphone,Samsung Galaxy A,Samsung Galaxy A revealed,Samsung Galaxy A3,Samsung Galaxy A3 revealed,Samsung Galaxy A5,Samsung Galaxy A5 revealed,Samsung Galaxy A7,Samsung Galaxy A7 revealed,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-12-03,"After numerous  and , the  series has finally been revealed. If they keep the pricing in the same bracket as the previous Galaxy A series, we could have a serious contender in the low-to-midrange end of the smartphone market.The Galaxy A series consists of three phones, the , , and  all bearing their new “6” badge that is supposed to represent 2016. We don’t know about you, but this peculiar badging just seems like another way to unnecessarily confuse prospective buyers.At first glance, all three devices share ’s  flagship’s looks with a metal body sandwiched between two panels of glass. They also feature the rounded edges of the Galaxy S6 and pretty much the same layout we’ve grown to get used to for Samsung devices. All three devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box.One thing that we were quite impressed with was the camera. All devices across the announced Galaxy A range feature a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture rear shooter and a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates them is that on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 both come bundled with optical image stabilisation (OIS) for their primary imaging unit. That’s pretty impressive for what looks to be mid-range devices. The best part? They all come in Pink Gold, so if you’ve ever wanted that colour but not the price tag it usually comes with, this could be your chance.That aside, the Galaxy A series begins with what looks like the entry-level Galaxy A3 sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) Super AMOLED display. The device would be powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz processor mated with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. This smartphone will also come with a 2,300 mAh battery.The Galaxy A3 will also have dual-SIM support, but it doesn’t appear to be a hybrid-SIM set up which means that you can have two SIMs and a microSD card. Other goodies include Cat.4 LTE connectivity support and 802.11 b/g/n WiFi. It also comes with Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, but no support for Samsung Pay.Moving up the pecking order comes the mid-range Galaxy A5. As the name implies, the Galaxy A5 is a step up from the Galaxy A3 and features a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (also expandable via microSD up to 128GB). It is also bigger, with a 5.2” full-HD (1920×1080 pixels) Super AMOLED display. Powering it all will be a 2,900 mAh battery with fast charging.Connectivity options include Cat.6 LTE support, 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, this time with support for Samsung Pay. Perhaps one of the key features of this device is the fingerprint scanner, which is quite rare beyond the top end of the smartphone spectrum. Much like the Galaxy A3, the Galaxy A5 also has dual-SIM support.Sitting at the top of the range is the Galaxy A7, which is the largest device, featuring a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel. Under the hood, the smartphone will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. It also has dual-SIM capabilities.Connectivity options are the same as the Galaxy A5, but the Galaxy A7 gets a bigger 3,300 mAh battery also with fast charging. Like its smaller brother the Galaxy A5, the Galaxy A7 also comes with a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay.Though the specific type of processor was not revealed, we have a hunch that it is Samsung’s Exynos processor. The first range of the Galaxy A smartphones were launched towards the end of 2014 and it was Samsung’s first attempt at truly bringing premium build quality to the masses. Before the Galaxy A series was launched, Samsung’s low end devices were all very plasticky and felt cheaply made, which felt like a rude reminder to all those who bought them to work harder.Now, with the rise of Chinese OEMs and their seemingly impossible smartphone value-for-money, especially in the lower end of the spectrum, the Korean electronics giant can’t afford to be complacent in their budget smartphones and risk giving up this lucrative section in the market.If the refreshed 2016 versions of the Galaxy A lineup are to be priced similarly to the previous Galaxy A lineup, we think that it could definitely be very competitive in that market. However, if Samsung prices these devices higher than their previous lineup, you’d be better off with a discounted Galaxy S6 instead.As a reference, when the original Galaxy A lineup was launched, the Galaxy A3 was priced at RM899, while the Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199, and the Galaxy A7 would set you back RM1,499. Bear in mind, these prices were before the implementation of GST and the falling ringgit. Of course, there are other good smartphones at this price bracket as well, such as the , the  and the . So the question is, do you buy into Samsung’s idea of a premium mid-range device?We’re pretty keen on these devices, what do you guys think? Let us know in the comments below.[, ]"

By making his own smartphone. An engineer by occupation, Andy Rubin has been around; he’s graced Car Zeiss, Apple, MSN, Google and of course, Android Inc. Interestingly, a report from The Information has the long lost granddaddy of all things Android calling for a recruitment drive for individuals to join his revisited escapade.A year plus after taking his leave from , it’s apparent that his brainchild Playground Global will finally start giving back to his own causes. The aforementioned start-up by Rubin serves as a tech hatchery of sorts; enabling those wanting to start their own thing but don’t have the resources, mentorship and funding to make it happen.The Fund itself, managed to raise roughly US$ 300 million from investments by Google (no duh), Hewlett-Packard aka HP, Seagate and others. Leveraging on his venture capital experiences with Redpoint Ventures (where he is a partner), as for now, his cash flow has been streaming to artificial intelligence and smart home segments. Though the aforementioned report states that Rubin still sees the opportunity to enter the Android smartphone market.Folks at the Verge seems to think that the dynamics of the low to midrange market is too volatile to enter, with manufactures popping up every now and then. Thus, maybe his best bet is to make a premium device that’ll hope to take a slice away from the Apple pie.The inhibitors of Mountain View might have something to say about that, since Google themselves have been reported to be working on their own hardware; all the pieces seem to be lining up quite well for the former head of Android Inc. And a possible return to the smartphone scene might amount to a foreseeable re-entry at Google.Jumping at any opportunity to make something great, Rubin has touched the lives of many, even if we fail to realise it. As the master of surprises and all things Android, should we expect anything less from him?[ ,  ]"

Now in its 7th generation, Google has partnered with Huawei with the all new . It isn’t just another reference device but an upmarket one that could very well compete with the current crop of flagship smartphones.After its  in late September, the Nexus 6P is finally here in Malaysia and you can place your orders beginning this Thursday, 10th December.Available in a single 64GB storage variant, the Nexus 6P is priced officially at RM2,698 inclusive of GST. For Malaysia, we are getting two colour options – Aluminium and Graphite. So far there’s no news of its other Gold and Frost White versions.In terms of size, the Nexus 6P despite its “6” moniker has a 5.7″ screen which makes it more compact than last year’s Nexus 6 by Motorola. The AMOLED screen pushes a Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440 that gives a pixel density of 518 pixels per inch. The exterior is where the Nexus 6P stands out. It gets an all-metal unibody design with a “helmet visor” bump at the back that houses its camera module.Accompanying its high-resolution screen is a pair of stereo speakers which is perfect for gaming and audio playback. For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P also gets a fingerprint scanner at the back that’s natively supported by Android Marshmallow. Like most rear-mounted fingerprint scanners, it unlocks instantly in a single touch.Powering the device is a flagship class 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of RAM, which should be more than sufficient to provide a buttery smooth experience. Like all Nexus smartphones (except for the Nexus One by HTC), there’s no expandable microSD slot and it comes with a single nano SIM slot supporting 4G LTE.In terms of cameras, the Nexus 6P focuses on larger pixels rather than the usual pixel count. Despite having a 12.3MP sensor from Sony, it boasts a larger 1.55 μm pixel size that allows in more light and this apparently is good enough to compensate for the lack of an Optical Image Stabilisation. It gets a dual-tone LED flash, Phase Detection and Laser Auto Focus so that you won’t miss a shot. Over at the front, selfies are taken care by its rather large 8MP shooter.Keeping the lights on, the Nexus 6P has a generous 3,450mAh battery and it charges up via a reversible USB Type C port. Out of the box, you get 2 sets of cables – a USB Type-C to Type-C and the standard USB Type-C to full sized USB. The power adapter pushes a higher 3Amp output through a USB Type-C port which should be faster than standard 2Amp chargers in the market. Of course the main reason why anyone would get a Nexus, is for its pure Android experience without the unnecessary fluff that’s often preinstalled by OEMs.The Nexus 6P will be available online this Thursday (10th December) through Huawei’s  and  Online store. Those who snap up units quickly, Huawei will be throwing in an introductory offer of a  (the first version) worth RM 199, totally free of charge to the first 600.

Alexander Wong,BlackBerry PRIV: Can an Android smartphone with a physical keyboard save the day?,,"Android,blackberry,BlackBerry Android Smart Phone,BlackBerry PRIV,Blackberry PRIV First impressions,Blackberry PRIV Hands-on,BlackBerry PRIV Malaysia,BlackBerry PRIV Malaysia Launch,first impressions","Android,BlackBerry,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-03,"A BlackBerry running Android? Several years ago, the idea would be laughable, but today an Android smartphone could actually make or break this once dominate mobile brand. As BlackBerry continues to lose ground in smartphone , they are pinning  hopes on the . Their first Android device that comes with a slider keyboard. The PRIV will be launched in Malaysia  and we’re lucky enough to get a brief hands-on with this new slider device. At 5.4 inches, the PRIV is the largest smartphone BlackBerry has ever produced and the display features a double curve screen that’s very much like the S6 edge. Though the phone is not wrapped in metal, it does look premium enough for the business-centric user. The back has a grippy texture to it which gives it an assuring feel in the hands, but it took a little while to get used to.When held in the hands, it does have a nice heft to it and despite having a larger screen plus a sliding keyboard mechanism, it is lighter by a couple of grams than the . The sliding QWERTY keyboard is the main highlight of the PRIV, and the mechanism and the design are much improved from the old BlackBerry Torch. When sliding out, the PRIV feels slightly top heavy but it didn’t really bother us while typing. Having used a BlackBerry Bold previously, I found the keyboard to be enjoyable to use. Yes, you do type faster with on-screen keyboards with advance prediction technology but it doesn’t give the same tactile satisfaction as the real deal. Another advantage of using a slider keyboard is that you’ll have an unobstructed display to view your stuff since there’s no on-screen keyboard occupying half of the screen.Like the BlackBerry Passport, the keyboard has a couple of neat tricks. It also functions as a touchpad for scrolling and it makes text selection quicker and accurate.  There’s also a text prediction feature that was introduced on BlackBerry 10 and it lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard. In terms of single-handed use, the width of the device is just right and you won’t struggle as much as the BlackBerry Passport that’s super wide. If you’re not using a physical keyboard, the stock BlackBerry keyboard works just fine and you probably could install 3rd party ones like Swype or SwiftKey. I can imagine myself using the virtual keyboard more frequently for quick social updates, replies or while hooked up to a holder while driving. In terms of performance, the PRIV that runs on Android 5.1.1 felt quite smooth and I didn’t experience any noticeable lags in the short time using it. The UI is very stock like and they do integrated a couple of native BlackBerry Apps including the unified BlackBerry Hub. If you’re using an Android device currently, you should feel quite at home but BB10 users might take a while to get used to it as  by their CEO John Chen.So is the BlackBerry PRIV the device to get? Probably the one and the only reason to consider is its physical keyboard. I love the feel of it, I really do and it is something that I find myself using regularly for writing stories or replying emails. But for other things when you just need to shoot a quick reply, the on-screen keyboard does the job just fine. Knowing BlackBerry will definitely  at a premium, we struggle to justify why anyone should get it over the Galaxy Note5. In terms of hardware, the Quad HD display, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is pretty much mainstream. You could get that on the LG G4 that’s currently going for about RM2,299. Of course, specs is just one factor to consider and the PRIV is also focused on privacy, which they are claiming to be the most if not one of the most secure Android smartphones in the market. Admittedly, I didn’t manage to explore other features such as the 18MP OIS-equipped camera and the DTEK security monitoring tool. Hopefully, we get to do so during the official local launch that’s happening on 8th December.Unless you’re getting this as a company phone, it is quite hard to justify paying more just the keyboard alone. Is there a genuine need for a physical QWERTY keyboard? Several Android brands have tried with the ,  and the , but most of them have ceased to exist. The recent attempt is by Samsung with its  for the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+, but with a less ideal implementation. Could BlackBerry stay relevant in the Android world with the PRIV?

The purpose is to allow users to try out the application before deciding whether or not they want to download it. According to Google, one in four applications downloaded is never even used because of the shortening mobile attention span of the average user.Trial Run Ads attempts to curb that by letting users really get a feel of an application before downloading them, thus benefiting both the user and the app developer. This application is only in its beta stage though, but Google has unveiled this to app developers so the ball is in their court now and it is up to them to decide how to best utilise this feature. With proper and effective implementation, this looks like it could be a very interesting feature.Besides this nifty app Harry Potter-y, Google is also starting the beta for Interactive Interstitial ads that utilises HTML5 to create interactive mobile advertisements. It will let advertisers completely customise the advertisement to their liking and give them the freedom they need to use HTML5 instead of standard templates and pull data dynamically.

If you want to register a sixth device, simply remove a previously registered device in iflix’s settings and register the new one. This is is pretty timely especially since iflix now also supports  on both iOS and Android devices.Before all you Streamyx subscribers start protesting, TM has also announced that they are working to bring these same benefits to their 4Mbps and 8Mbps Streamyx subscribers at a later date.

Rory Lee,"ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser Review: Good scope, bad shot",,,,2015-12-01,"In the world of television, spin-offs are a common sight as many networks try their hardest to keep that rare gem of a tv show alive. I completely understand this desire to milk every last drop out of your prized cow simply because money is hard to make in this world where piracy is rampant.Generally, many of these spin-offs tend to fall flat and the way I see it, there are two big reasons why this happens. The first is that the show doesn’t live up to the hype. It’s hard to follow in the footsteps of something as big as, say,  for example (we’re looking at you ). Secondly, it doesn’t eventually break off from the original and find and identity of its own, or that special niche that makes a show special.In the world of smartphones, it seems, that there exists this same desire to spin off into various other versions of an OEM’s flagship or popular device.Some spin-offs are designed to make their flagship devices more accessible with lower price points by omitting one or two key features but keeping the feel the same. Others try to incorporate one new key feature that’s absent from the main device.The latter is where ’s  comes in. In case you haven’t realised it yet, the keyword here is “laser”, which means that this spin-off device’s camera comes with a laser autofocus. And as with spin-offs, the question remains, does it float or does it fall?"

We also love them because it’s fun to watch an extremely premium device get smashed to bits in the most ridiculous fashion ever.If you share our sentiment then good news! UnboxTherapy just dropped a new video where he uses the Samsung Galaxy S6 active (which we know is one tough device) as a hockey puck. If you can’t tell, our noses are wrinkled with excitement now.In case you don’t already know, the  sports a 5.1″ quad-HD Super AMOLED display (1440×2560 pixels).

Alexander Wong,Speedtest reveals Malaysia’s fastest Broadband ISP and Mobile Networks,,"4g,4G LTE,Fastest ISP,Fastest Mobile Network,lte,Malaysia,malaysia's fastest mobile network,Ookla,Speedtest,speedtest fastest network,Speedtest.net,TM,TM Unifi,U Mobile,u mobile 3g,U Mobile 4G,Unifi","Celcom,DiGi,Industry in General,Maxis,Players on the Field,TM,U Mobile,Yes",2015-12-01,"A few days ago, U Mobile claims the title of  as awarded by Ookla’s . As a gesture of appreciation to its subscribers, they are giving out  for the month of December.So how fast is the fastest? Speedtest has finally revealed the numbers along with the rank of our current fixed and mobile operators in the country. Full details after the break. Starting with mobile networks that are running on 4G LTE, U Mobile is ranked #1 with an average download speed of 22.58Mbps with uploads of 10.34Mbps. Following in 2nd place is Celcom with 19.46Mbps downloads and Maxis holding on to third place at 18.20Mbps. Meanwhile, Digi takes the last place at 17.49Mbps.  For fixed broadband, TM takes up the Top 3 which is a mixture of various identifiers that lead back to Telekom Malaysia. Looking at the speeds, it is safe to assume that all 3 listings are predominantly Unifi subscribers on the highest 20Mbps Unifi plan. This is then followed by Maxis and YTL Communications, that operates Yes 4G WiMAX. Surprisingly Time Broadband didn’t make the list and we feel they could be among the Top 5 if it wasn’t for TM’s duplicated entries. To recap on the , Speedtest measures the average performance of each telco based on the fastest technology possible which is 4G LTE. So in theory, this wouldn’t take into account of speedtests conducted on 3G and on older non-LTE enabled devices. For fixed broadband ISP, the performance is calculated based on the top 10% of each network’s speedtest results. This according to Speedtest is to accurate represent customers that subscribe to the highest tier/package offered by the ISP. While 4G telcos are  the widest, fastest and best network, Speedtest is probably the best independent indicator for now. Another glaring difference between Malaysia versus other countries is that our mobile telcos are delivering faster speeds than our fixed broadband providers. In most cases, the fixed broadband providers in US, Canada, UK and Australia are clocking around 100Mbps or at least 2-3X faster than their fastest 4G operators. So what do you guys think of the verdict? [  ]"

What are we talking about? Well, the folks at  have decided it was a good idea to poke the metaphorical bear that is Apple, with their latest advert for an / Sandstone back case.Mmm, we love the smell of napalm in the morning.In their cheeky video – which looks like a parody of what we like to call the “swelling-music-advert” – OnePlus have painted themselves (or their users at least) as  who has got it “covered”, always ready and willing to help out their friends in need. In this case (ha ha), it would be OnePlus’ new friends over at Cupertino. As fun as this is, we certainly do hope OnePlus doesn’t think ALL its users dress like the guy in the video (that hat, really?).Just yesterday, OnePlus also posted a teaser on their Facebook page about their latest product, which I’m sure must’ve irked many an iPhone user now that the cat’s out of the bag.There is yet more evidence of this “friendly ribbing” on their product page as they strive to give iPhone 6/6s users the “Never Settle” feel, adding that its “sturdy, polycarbonate construction” adds both “grippiness and protection”. Apparently it’s one of those things “you won’t understand until you try it”.To sweeten the deal, OnePlus is throwing in a physical  invite with every purchase of this back case. That’s not all, the invites aren’t only invitations to buy the regular phone, but there is also a chance that you could get an invite to purchase the OnePlus X Ceramic or better yet, a free device. Now that sounds dandy and all but when we tried to purchase the case from their online store, a pop-up informed us that the case was currently out of stock, despite it being listed as in stock on the page itself.Maybe this is some kind of elaborate April fools prank in December. December Dummies perhaps? Of course, this isn’t the first time OnePlus has done something most people deem ridiculous to generate buzz, just a few months back their .

We’d still think that driving an automobile is an experience best felt by being fully in control but they’re obviously perks to being able to have the ability to control your vehicle autonomously or through a remote.
Pushing the boundaries of driving autonomously, the multi-talented UK based research team from Land Rover have been prototyping technology that allows you to move around your huge SUV or off-road beast, through fiddling with on-screen controls on your smartphone.
Usher your Multi-point turn enabled Range Rover in a relatively controlled environment at a max speed of 4mph and manoeuvre your way through tight situations. Handing you controls for steering, breaks and accelerator, you’ll be able to be outside your car as you carefully move it around challenging terrain or hard to see parking situations – taking bad viewing angles out of the equation.
Land Rover researchers also programmed the Multi-point turn technology to give those manning the virtual wheels the controls to adjust high and low range, angling the car in just the right manner to get around.It doesn’t stop there, as these in-built sensors on the car will apparently work in all weather conditions and environments, always enabling you to get yourself out of a tight spot, if need be. There are some limitations, such as range, when considering that you’ll only be able to “command” the car from a distance of 10 metres, all while your smartphone and smart keys are in close proximity.
The team of researchers have also developed technology that allows you to turn your car a full 180-degrees in a tight spot; basically conducting a three-point turn. A much dreaded manoeuvre for anyone’s that has been in the driver seat of a large vehicle.Although other carmakers have already started implementing some of these options, it’ll be interesting to see how the idea of controlling your car from your smartphone’s will run along. It won’t please any motorheads but given the notion, it might be pretty cool.[ ,  ]"

Powering the pure Android experience device is a 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM and it gets 64GB of storage which isn’t expandable. You get a 12.3MP f/2.0 main camera with Laser AutoFocus while the front gets an 8MP f/2.4 shooter.For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P gets a fingerprint sensor which unlocks on a single touch and it uses the new USB Type-C standard that’s reversible. Keeping this flagship device running for long is a generous 3,450mAh capacity battery which is charged with a 3Amp Fast Charger.

Of course, getting the Nexus 6P isn’t just about the hardware. It runs on the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow in its purest form, the way Android is intended to be experienced.

That’s slightly more than the Galaxy Note5 which was launched in the island state at S$1,088.Catching up since the BlackBerry Passport, the PRIV aims to stay relevant with updated hardware and a fresh user experience. It gets a 5.4″ AMOLED Quad HD screen with double curved edges and it runs on a more current Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. For storage it has 32GB on-board which is expandable with microSD. Running on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with the possibility of being upgraded to Marshmallow early next year, the PRIV eliminates the concern of having limited apps with full access to the Google Play Store. With virtually all Android players adopting a full touch screen display, BlackBerry hopes to fulfill the needs of consumers that desire the tactile feel of a physical keyboard. Given its retail price, the PRIV will face a tough challenge from likes of the Galaxy Note5, Xperia Z5 and even the Nexus 6P. After all, existing Android users will be their key focus group  to their Senior Director for Asia Pacific Product Management. The main deciding factor of course the slider keyboard. With the advancements of virtual keyboards such as SwiftKey and Swype, do you really need a physical keyboard in this day and age? Given a choice between a BlackBerry PRIV and a Galaxy Note5, which smartphone would you get? The PRIV has passed our local  a while back and it shouldn’t take too long for BlackBerry to launch it in Malaysia. [   ]"

The colours on offer are Champagne gold and Dark grey. Jogging your memory on this tablet, it has a 7.9-inch screen plastered onto its metal build, the screen itself has a resolution of 2048 x 1536 (326 ppi).Lighter, thinner and overall smaller than its predecessor, it maintains the same screen size but shrinks down the bezels all around the screen.

Xiaomi has plans on releasing a Windows 10 model soon, but we have no idea when it’ll be announced.Comparing prices abroad in the brand’s domestic market (China), the 16GB sells for roughly RM 662, that’s a RM 200+ premium, that you’re paying for. At the same time, the higher 64GB model retails for about RM 861, so think about that for a second.You pay for what you get it seems and DirectD has the ball in their court, whether or not it’ll be received well, that depends on you guys.[ , ,  ]"

That roughly translates to an uncompressed RAW 4K video (1 hour long) sizing in at 158.2GB transferring around 30 seconds – working out to 5GBps.Talking about driving pixels on screen, it’ll also be capable of displaying two 4K-resolution screens up to a 60Hz refresh rate at the same time and quicken charging for notebooks up to 100 watts.Setting a platform for other types of protocols like DisplayPort, Super Speed USB and PCIExpress, Intel will bank on Thunderbolt to gain traction, as it hasn’t really caught on for most users; except those tech-centric folks out there needing more from their ports.Already realised on smartphones like the OnePlus Two (but don’t use their cables, read about that here), Xiaomi’s Mi 4c, Lumia 950 series, latest Nexuses, PCs and tablets, we hope that USB Type-C catches on quickly. But then again, what about all our old cables and plugs?[ ,  ]"
Rory Lee,Banks in Singapore reports malware attacking its customers through WhatsApp,,"android hacked,Android vulnerability,android vunlerable,bank account vunlerabilities,fake android update,fake whatsapp update,scam,Singapore,Whatsapp,whatsapp scam,whatsapp vulnerabilitys","Android,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,SMS Scam Alert",2015-12-01,"A report by the Singapore Straits Times reveals that there is malware lurking within ‘s update that can affect Android devices. According to the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), this update was not initiated by the app maker and has been infecting Android devices in Singapore over the past few months.After the “update” has been downloaded, the malware will prompt the user to enter confidential information, such as credit card details. Then the malware would take over the affected device and intercepts the one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS to the phone for committing fraudulent transactions.“Criminals have been targeting computer users, but now criminals have turned to targeting Android phone users as banks are pushing out more banking apps for user convenience,” said ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon. It turns out convenience really is becoming the downfall of humanity as we continuously rely on our devices to carry out daily activities.According to Channel NewsAsia, this vulnerability extends beyond just WhatsApp as they claim the malware is disguising itself as an operating system update as well. They reported that about 50 smartphone users have been hit by malware targeting mobile banking customers in the last three months. Besides disguising itself as a WhatsApp update, it also reportedly masquerades as an operating system update for the battery management module.Channel NewsAsia also reports that ABS estimates the average amounts lost by the victims who are customers of major retail banks in Singapore were “a couple of hundred of dollars”, although some victims could have lost several thousand dollars through multiple transactions. The source of these fraudulent transactions appear to originate from Eastern Europe and includes purchases of budget airline tickets.“Jailbroken iPhones or rooted Android [devices] are vulnerable…and in particular Android, because that phone system involves easier download of third-party apps,” said Ong-Ang. The silver lining is that ABS states that banks may refund victims on a case-by-case basis depending on whether or not the victim took the necessary precautions to protect themselves from such attacks.Singapore is awfully close to our home soil of Malaysia, so please be warned and double check your updates before installing them. At the time that this article was written, there has been no official announcement on this matter posted on WhatsApp’s Facebook page, Twitter or Blog. So the moral of the story here is, please make sure that your application updates come directly from the Google Play Store.[, ]"

Well, they certainly weren’t kidding when they said it was designed specifically for the 4G LTE user.Hotlink FAST’s starter pack is priced at RM15 and it comes with RM5 preloaded airtime, 300MB preloaded high-speed Internet and offers users a choice of three internet passes. The first plan gives users a 2GB quota for 30 days, then the second plan doubles that up to 4GB and finally the third plan is sort of a “lite” version where it gives users 500MB for 7 days. Call rates are the same across all plans at 6sen/30sec to your ACTIV10 (10 Hotlink/Maxis numbers) and 12sen/30sec to all local networks. SMS is rated at 1sen/SMS to your ACTIV10 contacts and 12sen/SMS to all local networks.Users can also apply for an add-on of either 1GB (RM12), 500MB (RM8), or 300MB (RM5) that will last the duration of your quota cycle. On the website, it states that there will be “No credit drain” and that the “Internet will stop its service once the FAST Internet pass expires.” However, Hotlink informs us that one the quota has been finished, you can still surf the Internet, but at a throttled speed of 64kbps.They explained that although the quota was split between 4G LTE and non-4G LTE speeds, once a user depletes their designated 4G quota, they can continue surfing at 4G speeds but this time it will draw from their “All Networks” quota instead. Unfortunately, the inverse is not true. This means that if you were in a location without 4G LTE coverage, you can only use the “All Networks” quota, which is half of what you are actually paying for.Now we understand that to create a “competitive” plan, compromises have to be made, but surely this doesn’t make any sense. Why would Hotlink want to segregate quota by network type? This just seems like a major inconvenience to the consumer.Perhaps this is a testament to , but even that seems like a stretch to try and justify their actions. In any case the plans themselves, if you ignore the split quota, is quite reasonable. So, if you have faith in Maxis’ network coverage and would like to sign up for this plan, existing Hotlink users can do so via the Hotlink RED app by going to ‘My Account’ and selecting ‘Change’ next to ‘Rateplan’. Alternatively they can dial *100*6*1# from their mobile devices.Non-Hotlink members can simply proceed to the nearest Hotlink Dealer or Maxis Centre. For more information, head on over to their ."

From skin makers like dbrand and Slickwraps, to pimped out editions with diamonds and just overall expensive devices from brands like Vertu; seems a powerful smartphone isn’t enough anymore for the rich. Those with a large net-worth need a little more from their smartphones and Priv owners can now join the upper class – as if adding gold to your smartphone elevates your status.While production quality of the video posted by Karalux seems to be subpar, they showcase the Priv with other devices that they’ve pimped out before. Basically the 24K gold replaces any metal accents that you’d find on the BlackBerry’s first Android device – which isn’t a lot to begin with, mainly on the back of the slide out, the rear camera and the top and bottom of the smartphone.As talked about earlier, existing Priv owners in Vietnam, will get to deck their units out for a cool US$ 350 (RM 1,491), though if you’re in the country and want the gold-plated Priv, it’ll cost you US$ 1,100 (RM 4,687). International buyers, it’ll cost you US$ 1,300 (RM 5,540), if you want the same thing shipped to you.Malaysians haven’t been too lucky, for no official information has come up on when the BlackBerry Priv will hit our shores.

The new In-Ear Headphones Pro claims to be a hybrid unit with a dynamic driver accompanied by a two-way balanced-armature (BA) driver. This apparently is one of the smallest three-way headphones in the market that offers true reference quality audio. For a better audio experience, they have gotten help of Sound Engineer and Grammy/Latin Grammy Awards winner Luca Bignardi to tune the latest headphones. In terms of build, it gets a diamond cut metal body with fine textures like its former Piston series. Designed for smart phone use, there’s also a built-in microphone with 3 dedicated buttons for volume and audio playback controls. For better durability, the Mi In-ear Headphones Pro uses kevlar for its cables for better durability in the long run. In terms of specs, the new Pro headphones has a speaker impedance of 32Ω, similar to the V3 Pistons, but it is more sensitive at 101dB (V3 Pistons: 98dB). It weighs 14grams, which is the same as the current V3 but slightly heavier than the former V2.1 Pistons (12g). In China, the pair is going for 99 CNY (about RM66) but do expect a slight markup to buffer for potential currency fluctuation.

Rory Lee,The 3x optical zoom ASUS ZenFone Zoom is now on sale in Taiwan,,"Android,Asus,ASUS Malaysia,ASUS ZenFone,ASUS ZenFone Zoom,asus zenfone zoom launch,camera,lumia 1020,Optical Zoom,smart phone,smart phone camera,smartphone,smartphone camera,smartphone with optical zoom,ZenFone Zoom,zenfone zoom launch,zenfone zoom launch taiwan,zoom lens","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-02,"According to a report published in 2013, over  have only done so on a phone, not a traditional or standalone camera. That is a staggering number of people if you think about it, especially taking into consideration the keyword in that phrase is ‘ever’. Which means that, even two years ago, when smartphone cameras were arguably worse than they are now, people still defaulted to them for that snapshotting needs. This is completely understandable simply because a smartphone is more portable, usually cheaper and are just generally more convenient.Well,  hopes to add to that statistic with their latest , which officially goes on sale in Taiwan today.One of the biggest problems was that most smartphones relied on a digital zoom, which is more like a fancy way to crop your photos if you think about it. The one you want to go for when zooming is the optical zoom, which adjusts the glass positioned in a camera/lens unit to reposition the light hitting the sensor, which brings the image closer but maintains its quality. Most smartphones shy away from using this because having multiple pieces of glass in the camera unit means having more space which in turn translates to a bigger camera hump.The supposedly brilliant thing about the ZenFone Zoom though is that it is the “world’s thinnest 3x-optical zoom smartphone”. How thin is thin? Well ASUS states that the ZenFone Zoom only has a 5mm edge. Bear in mind, this is the edge, and as the ZenFone line of devices have usually been curved at the back, this looks to be no exception. From the looks of it, the device’s camera unit does take up an enormous amount of space on the back panel ala-, but it doesn’t seem to protrude as much as the Lumia.In a device that is designed to take photographs, most of the actual photography will be taken by the primary 13-megapixel rear shooter while selfies and video chats will be handled by the device’s 5MP front facing unit. Other primary camera goodies include a dual-LED flash, laser autofocus, optical image stabilisation (OIS) and ASUS’ PixelMaster 2.0 camera technology that is designed to greatly improve low light photography, granting up to a 400% increase in brightness. For those curious about the PixelMaster 2.0 technology, we’ve already put it through its paces in our . The ZenFone Zoom will also feature a dedicated shutter button, record button as well as a zoom rocker.Then again, we already expected most of this as the device was announced almost a year ago. What we do know now for sure now is that the device will come in 64GB and 128GB variants. Internal specs include an Intel Atom Z3580 quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz for the 64GB variant while the 128GB variant will be powered by a 2.5GHz Intel Atom Z3590 quad-core processor. Based on the website, it appears that the device will also come with 4GB of RAM and be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS’ BoostMaster quick charging technology. The devices will also come running Android Lollipop out of the box.Display wise, the smartphone will come with a 5.5-inch full HD display with a pixel density of 403 ppi tucked away under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The body will also be of an aluminium unibody construction with what looks like a faux leather back to help with grip and texture as well as a ridge at the bottom of the phone to help with one handed photography. But we all know what a unibody means: no removable battery. It does have what looks like a lanyard port and appears to come bundled with a camera strap.The 64GB device retails in Taiwan for TWD13,990 (around RM1,806) while the 128GB will go for TWD15,990 (around RM2,065). While ASUS did not announce when this device will be available in other markets,  has hinted at an , which means it could be any time now. The odd thing is that this device was announced a long time ago, and between its announcement and today ASUS has launched several devices already.This begs the question, what took them so long? Was there a massive kink in the device that delayed its launch this long? Let’s hope they’ve worked out whatever problems they had with it (if they had any problems) lest we have a repeat of .We suspect this device will appeal to some camera enthusiasts who were interested in the Lumia 1020 but not the Windows Mobile platform. While it does seem that this device is a worthy Android equivalent, its sensor is but a measly 13-megapixels versus the Lumia 1020’s 41-megapixel monstrosity. Then again, megapixel isn’t the be-all and end-all of camera quality, so we will just have to wait and see.[, , ]"
Rory Lee,OnePlus offering refunds for their problematic USB Type-C cables,,,,2015-11-27,"Awhile back,  came under fire from critics and the tech community in general when it was discovered that their . This could possibly lead to damage if used with any device other than the . Leading the charge was Google employee Benson Leung who had embarked on a crusade to purge the world of non-compliant USB Type-C cables.His method involved ordering cables off Amazon then testing them to see if they met the USB standards. When he arrived at the OnePlus cable, he found that even a cable manufactured by a proper smartphone manufacturer did not meet proper USB Type-C standards. Needless to say, the Caped Cable Crusader rained sweet justice down on the Chinese manufacturer, bringing them to their knees (metaphorically speaking, of course).Yesterday, OnePlus finally caved and admitted that their cables were indeed non-compliant, but it seems the USB Vigilante still isn’t entirely satisfied.OnePlus graciously accepted Benson and the community’s criticism, openly admitting on their official forum that their USB Type-C cables and adapters were using a 10kΩ resistor instead of the 56kΩ resistor detailed in version 1.1 of the USB Type-C port standard. This message came straight from the top, no less. According to the post, the issue with resistors was that the cables and adapter were only designed for a maximum of 2 amps of power, which is how much the OnePlus 2’s charger supports.However, when used on other devices that allow fast-charging, the resistor will let the devices try to draw more power than a power source may allow. Ultimately, this could result in damage to said power source (such as 3rd-party cables, USB ports, etc.) if they do not have an internal mechanism to self-regulate the amount of power flowing to or from them. OnePlus added that typically, if a charger has the CE, UL, or CCC markings, it should be certified and safe to use.The OEM also compiled their findings into a simple and easy-to-understand table detailed below:Unfortunately for OnePlus though, it appears that they didn’t get everything right.Ah Benson, do keep up the good work!In any case, OnePlus is offering a refund on the affected products purchased through the OnePlus website. Do note though that the cables that came bundled in the box with your OnePlus 2 will not be eligible for a refund. This is simply because OnePlus remains firm in saying that the cables and adaptors are entirely safe to use with the OnePlus 2 and that the problem was compatibility with other devices.Based on the post, the refund appears to only be available for customers in North America, Europe, India and China, and will only be offered by OnePlus until the end of December this year. For those of you thinking of cashing in to get some cables at discounted Black Friday prices and then getting a full priced refund for them, tough luck, because it appears that both the cable and the adapter are out-of-stock on the OnePlus website.[, ]"

Now invitations have gone out setting the date for the Google x Huawei collaborative device and by the looks of it, some gift boxes might include them just in time for Christmas.Early adopters might already have the device in their hands, since  began importing the units last week. They’ve been milking eager fans by a pretty margin but all is fair when it comes to grey importers, we suppose. The aforementioned page that went up on vmall.my listed the device will be on sale for RM 2,698 (w/ GST) for the 64GB model; which is equally stacked against another Huawei device, the  (64GB). Easily pointing to the manufacturer not wanting to bite themselves in the butt by selling the Nexus at a lower price, to keep some emphasis on their other smartphones.Playing down the state of our currency, it’s likely the heighten pricing is to leave some leeway for the Ringgit to continue to fluctuate. Taking into consideration that the 32GB Nexus 6P sells for US$ 499 (RM 2,128) and the 64GB model goes for US$ 549 (RM 2,341) in the US.The collaborative effort will bring about the latest version of Android, with Marshmallow finally coming into the horizon. Sizing in at 5.7-inches, you’ll get a QHD display (2560 x 1440), with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 under the hood. Internal memory options were listed above, while it’ll carry 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM for multitasking and app switching.In terms of photography, there will be a 12.3-megapixel sensor on the rear that’s equip with 1.55 micron pixels and an aperture of f/2.0 for those low light situations. Accompanying the camera module will be a dual-tone LED and laser auto focus as well. Taking a look at the front, an 8-megapixel f2.4 shutter will greet you near the top; this sensor will carry a 1.4-micron pixel size.For audio, it’ll boast dual front facing stereo speakers on the top and bottom, while Huawei also deploys USB Type-C for data and charging utilisation. The port itself, will help charge up the 3,450mAh battery that’s inside, while  the future-proof port will help bring it up to speed, just a little quicker – only on particular  though; nope those Quick Charge 2.0 charging heads won’t be of any use.The last bell and whistle would be the Nexus Imprint finger print sensor, that sits below the rear camera lens. A feature that pretty much lined up with Google’s vision to make native fingerprint scanning a thing on Android M.The announcement couldn’t come any sooner, since they’ve been consumers who are itching to get their own units after DirectD started offering the smartphone. Local warranty and a cheaper price seems like a no-brainer but we hope you waited."

Rory Lee,6 Tips to stay connected during floods,,"banjir,CFM,flood,Flooding,Malaysia Flood,MCMC,mobile tips during floods,poor signal during floods,tips during flood",Industry in General,2015-11-26,"The rainy season is in full effect now with many parts of the country experiencing constant downpour each day. And with the tide phenomenon that is expected to occur in the Straits of Tebrau from the 24th to 30th of November is likely to mean more trouble for affected locals.Malaysia has had its fair share of flood woes in the past and since it’s the rainy season again, the folks at Communications and Multimedia Consumer Forum of Malaysia (CFM) have decided to take a more proactive role to ensure effective communication during these potentially trying times remains strong.CFM have sent us a long list of tips that are designed to help the public better manage as well as communicate more effectively during times of emergency. We at SoyaCincau.com value your time and as a result have condensed their tips for your convenience.Here are the 6 communication tips during floods: CFM strongly urges the public to be patient when communicating. If your call or msg is unable to get through to the other person, wait awhile before trying again. The communication infrastructure is put under a lot of stress during times of emergency and can get congested due to the high volume of messages. So, if everyone incessantly tries to communicate, it becomes less likely that any messages will get through at all.It’s sort of like traffic congestion, really. If everyone leaves their office at 6pm, then nobody would be getting anywhere anytime soon. We know some of you have completely abandoned the SMS service, because frankly who needs it when you have free messaging applications like Whatsapp? But, CFM advises users to use this ‘retro’ form of communication during emergencies because they take up less bandwidth and will put a lighter load on the communication system.If we were to build on our traffic jam analogy, a call would be that large BMW 750Li, while a text message would only be a little Vespa zipping along between traffic. Needless to say, without power, that flagship smartphone you paid thousands of ringgit for is about as useful as a brick. Probably less useful since its so light and thin, so CFM encourages its consumers to charge up your devices and power banks when there is power. That way, if and when the power goes down, you will still have enough juice to keep your phones running.Of course, saving power also means using your devices less often. Save them for emergencies and only use them when you absolutely have to, not to post a selfie on Instagram. If your device has power saving mode, it is recommended to enable it to extend its battery life.  Speaking of Instagram, CFM implores everyone to limit their online activity to avoid coverage congestion. Actions like uploading photos, videos or sharing voice clips on social media consumes a lot of bandwidth and by now we’re sure you all know what that means. Yep, you guessed it, congestion.10 points to Gryffindor! We’ve all seen disaster movies. We’ve all seen the scene where the protagonists are trapped in a danger zone and are waiting by the radio with bated breath for information that could very well save them. Well, it turns out there is some truth in those scenes as CFM says that it becomes an important source of news during an emergency. However, they have stated that consumers should ensure that they have an adequate battery supply before doing so.You can also get the latest updates from local emergency response services or RELA members so it’s a good idea to keep their contact handy. Well, keep calm. There really is no use in panicking during an emergency. CFM informs us that they aren’t sitting on their hands at their end either. The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (KKMM) and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) are working with all Telecommunications Service Providers (SPs) to provide temporary base communication station towers at several affected areas as a support to enhance the coverage during floods or natural disasters.However, they did add that priority will be given to places that are in need of it the most. They also ask for your understanding that natural disasters can cause unavoidable damage to infrastructure in affected areas which would result in less than stellar coverage.Teamwork is key in these situations so do be considerate and work together to overcome times of emergency. []"

The  is their biggest yet with a gigantic 18.4″ screen and it runs on Android. In their latest ad, Samsung isn’t calling it a TV or a Tablet, but simply “entertainment reimagined”.Since both TV and tablets are generally media consumption devices, Samsung attempts to blur the line between the two, offering a larger screen experience in a somewhat “portable” form factor. Weighing at about 2.65kg, it is heavier than your average mobile device. With a handle at the back of the kickstand, Samsung wants it to be as easy to carry as a shopping bag.According to Samsung, the Galaxy View is designed to be used from an arm’s reach, hence they have created a new UI with larger icons and text for a more intuitive experience. Furthermore, the way people watch TV is much different now, with more opting to look for content when they want it, rather than to follow broadcast programs. For gaming, the Galaxy View has an S Console game app, where you can project your mobile games onto a bigger screen. It turns your smart phone into a controller for a console gaming-like experience. While the hardware could potentially replace a TV, it is a pity that Samsung hasn’t included the essential TV ports such as HDMI. This could have opened up the Galaxy View as a portable TV for console gaming or to connect to other AV equipment. In the US, it is currently priced at US$499 which is about RM2,110. It gets a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM and there’s a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD. With an on-board 5,700mAh battery, the Galaxy View can be used unplugged up to 8 hours. If it ever comes here, would you be interested to get one?[   ]"

Once that’s out of the way, you can start inviting your family and friends from your contact list.There are plenty of instant messaging apps out there but nobody does security better than Zipit Chat. Encrypted with AES 256 technology, your messages are impossible for anyone to intercept which gives you a true end to end encryption. When transmitting sensitive information such as password, pins or confidential information, you can set a Self-Destruct Timer from 30 seconds up to 10 minutes. For an extra layer of security, Zipit Chat even disables your phone screenshot function, so that nobody could snap a copy of it. Emails are still relevant these days and for business users, there are messages that are highly P&C. We’ve heard stories of email accounts being hacked and if it does happen to you, Zipit Chat can keep your email threads secured with the same military grade encryption. The content will be scrambled including its attachments and only the intended sender and recipient can view it fully via Zipit Chat. If you’re unconvinced, Celcom had earlier issued a challenge for anyone to decrypt 3 messages that are encrypted by Zipit Chat and nobody has managed to crack it so far. So even if some snooping agency or hackers have gain access to your inbox, it would take probably years to figure it out by brute force. Most people would have different logins and passwords for various accounts including online banking. If you find it hard to keep track of all of them, you jot them down safely under Zipit Chat’s Secure Notes. Similar to its email feature, it scrambles your note into a bunch of unreadable text, thus ensuring only you are able to read it. While it is not recommended to store passwords on your phone, at least you know there’s a safer way to keep from prying eyes. Having your phone stolen is bad enough and the last thing you want is to have your personal data stolen. With Zipit Chat, your messages, notes and emails are always password protected at all times. When left inactive, it will constantly require your pin number to launch the app.For another layer of secrecy, there’s a rather clever Stealth Mode which removes the Zipit Chat icon completely from your smart phone. To access the app again, just dial #*# followed by your pin number and then hit the call button.   Are you still putting your communication at risk? Just head over the  to download Zipit Chat. It costs RM10/month to subscribe but you can give it a try for free."
Rory Lee,A new challenger approaches: TM to enter mobile race next year,,"4G LTE Malaysia,lte,LTE Malaysia,P1,P1 malaysia,packet one,Telekom Malaysia,TM,TM 4G LTE,TM mobile,TMGo","Industry in General,Mobile Apps,P1,P1,Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-11-27,"The mobile industry is a booming one, with more and more industry players want to get a slice of it, be it manufacturers or telco providers. Set to be the latest horse to enter the race, TM is setting its sights on a 2016 entry into the mobile telco industry in Malaysia. This will complicate things, to say the least, for the existing four players – , ,  and . in October of 2014, TM set out to develop them into their mobile arm and mobility centre, eyeing an end of 2015 launch of their mobile services. However, clearly pushing into the mobile sector proved difficult even for the telco giant, so TM have instead decided to take baby steps and only start user trials and network readiness tests come December.However, according to TM group chief executive officer Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, development of Telekom Malaysia’s overall LTE network rollout is on track, with the core LTE network being managed and planned for future growth by .“We are now building on that core to roll out nationwide, starting with urban areas and adjacent to existing base stations,” said Zamzamzairani.This isn’t TM’s first foray into the LTE technology as they had launched their very own LTE-based 4G broadband service,  back in August of last year. TMgo was launched while the TM-P1 partnership was still pending approval, so it ran at a lower 850MHz frequency instead of the usual 1800MHz/2600MHz bands used by mainstream 4G operators.Now, with the full support of P1 at their backs, TM can really flex its muscles and push their way into the four-horse race. As with any industry, having more competition will only be beneficial for the consumer. With more competition, telcos have to tread carefully to keep their services relevant and avoid being run over by competition.With a major telecommunications player like TM entering the mobile services scene, you can expect the existing players who are currently locked in a four-way-free-for-all for LTE supremacy, to scramble and make sure the upstart new challenger doesn’t take their crown away from them.In any case, if TM successfully makes their way into the mobile sector, it can only mean good things for us consumers. We can realistically expect more competitive pricing,  and probably a whole lot more drama.[, ]"
Rory Lee,OPPO and local authorities crack down on counterfeiters,,"Android,counterfeit oppo,Counterfeit Phones,Fake OPPO,KPDNKK,Oppo,Oppo Find 7,Oppo Malaysia,Oppo N3,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2015-11-27,"has been a vanguard against the production of counterfeit mobile devices,  was rampant as well as issuing official certificates to their authorised retailers.Spending all your hard earned money on a fake device has to be one of the most heartbreaking things ever, so  Malaysia teamed up with the Ministry of Domestic Trade Co-operatives and Consumerism (KPDNKK) to crack down on these counterfeit bandits.On the 20th of November at 11am, the operation began and both OPPO Malaysia and KPDNKK raided two locations, Plaza Alam Sentral in Shah Alam as well as Terminal 1 in Seremban. KPDNKK’s Intellectual Property Enforcement Division head Othman Nawang said that based on the information and intelligence gathered during the KPDNKK’s investigation, they had conclusive evidence to carry out the raid on these two locations suspected of selling counterfeit OPPO products.Sure enough the raid was a success as the joint task force uncovered 8 counterfeit devices worth over RM4,200. This may only seem like a fraction of the earlier reported 644 counterfeit devices, but at least these are devices that people haven’t spent their hard earned money on, so at it’s a start if nothing else. Among the phones confiscated, were fake versions of the OPPO Find 7 and OPPO N3.Othman said that the ministry had sent out recon teams to investigate the two locations and they found that these counterfeit devices were being sold between RM400 and RM700, which is a stark contrast to their original price range of RM1,000 to RM2,098.According to OPPO Overseas Customer Service manager Boyce Lee, this was the first raid to crack down on counterfeit phones conducted by KPDNKK.“Ever since we received reports in early January, we have been in close contact with the Ministry to further strike down these counterfeiting activities,” he said. “We have brought this to the Ministry’s attention that the circulation of counterfeit products are getting worse with each passing day and we seek legal actions to be taken by the authority.”Boyce added that to the layman, the counterfeit products’ design were almost indistinguishable from original OPPO products, but the devices’ poor design quality and unstable features tainted the OPPO name. He added that there was a possibility that the cheap parts used could have direct harmful or toxic effects on the user.If you have any qualms about whether or not your OPPO device is authentic, OPPO has a program that allows you to  to determine authenticity. OPPO also encourages users who have any information regarding the sale or misconduct of counterfeit goods to contact KPDNKK on their hotline at 1800-886-800."
Arif Lee,A review of the Sony Xperia M5 Dual; the “Aqua” is no more but what remains?,,,,2015-11-27,"It takes a lot to remove a word from your smartphone model’s identity; evolving the  Xperia M series meant dropping the “Aqua” name on the . It’s going to take a lot more than product placement in a Bond film to revive the Japanese giant, or at least their mobile division, if they want to continue the Xperia brand.Adopting a two-time refresh every trading year, Sony dares to do something other smartphone makers would never even suggest in boardrooms, though have they kept up a timely trend? Or have these attempts been sloppy?The changes are not for show, not on the outside anyway, so don’t expect to have friends ask you about your upgrade from the Xperia M4 Aqua, you won’t be getting that. It will however, get you a speedier and more fluid experience, since internally it gets upped in all aspects. We’re talking about the same 5-inch footprint but a higher resolution screen, faster processor, more RAM, a better camera, and everything else, which we’ll delve deeper into on the following pages."

Alexander Wong,Guess which is the fastest mobile network in Malaysia,,"4G LTE,malaysia's fastest mobile network,Ookla,Speedtest,speedtest fastest network,Speedtest.net,U Mobile,u mobile 3g,U Mobile 4G","Players on the Field,U Mobile",2015-11-28,"Malaysian telcos (well, at least ) are obsessed with claiming the widest coverage for 4G LTE. When it comes to actual usage, speed is probably more important in our current connected age. So who is the fastest? A popular internet speed testing tool has just named Malaysia’s fastest mobile network and the winner might surprise you.
U Mobile, Malaysia’s youngest mobile telco was just awarded the Fastest Mobile Network in the country by Ookla’s Speedtest. An impressive feat considering U Mobile is the last among the 4 telcos . Despite not having extensive 4G coverage, U Mobile is capable of delivering high-speeds up to 42Mbps with its  network. We’ve mentioned  that the current 4G coverage race is getting rather silly. Any telco can throw numbers but ultimately what does it mean to the average consumer? For example, when Digi reclaimed the widest 4G LTE title, they  that customers can expect 5Mbps speeds on 4G and more than 15Mbps on 4G LTE-A. Those numbers are low for 4G standards and they are already achievable with current 3G technologies. After all, it is not what you have, but what you do with it. At the moment, Ookla has yet to publish the full Malaysian report on their  page but we assume that they used the same methodology here as other countries. The results are derived from the average performance recorded on the fastest technology possible which is 4G. Each test are aggregated by averaging each user’s test result at several locations each day. This prevents manipulation of repeated speedtests by a handful of users from affecting the overall result. You can read up how Ookla determine who’s the fastest over . So U Mobile subscribers, do you agree with this verdict?[  ]"

It seemed like a logical thing to do to keep up with the times. thought so too and while initial models of their Q line hardly looked high-tech, their latest smartwatch, the Q Founder, does.The Q Founder is Fossil’s first ever smartwatch to be powered by Android Wear and it’s the watchmaker’s attempt at mating “modern functionality and classic good looks”. With this watch, Fossil hoped to give smartwatches the “high-end-yet-mass-appeal design Fossil’s known for”.Previous devices in the Q line, namely the Q Reveler and Q Dreamer bracelets, and the Q Grant watch were made to be jewelry first, technology second and it showed. To the untrained eye, it is nearly impossible to know that they were high tech smart wearables.Fossil’s new Q Founder though, is entirely different. This device sports a full touch screen interface on its round watch face similar to that of the . Unfortunately, it also has the Moto 360’s flat tire design, instead of a fully round display.If classic watch looks were what Fossil was going for then the Q Founder does pull that off quite well. It certainly doesn’t look like it was  or one that could be .It is rather large though, coming in with a 46mm-diameter face and a 13mm-thick case which is the same as the expensive TAG Heuer Connected. Feature-wise, the smartwatch has a built in activity tracker that will help you track your steps, count calories and all the other good stuff. It’s also IP67 water and dust resistant so it’ll at least give you some peace of mind.

Rory Lee,Waze and Google Maps could expose Malaysia to “external threats” says UMNO MP,,"external threats,Google Maps,Google Maps Malaysia,navigation,parliament,Raime Unggi,TPP,trans-pacific partnership,umno,Waze","Industry in General,Mobile Apps",2015-11-26,"When we announced that ‘ offline navigation had finally rolled out in Malaysia, many rejoiced, but apparently not everyone is happy with being able to rely on navigation applications just a little more. UMNO lawmaker Datuk Raime Unggi said in Parliament today that Malaysian dependency on navigation apps to find their way around the maze-like labyrinth of Kuala Lumpur’s bustling city centre, was possibly exposing our country to “external threats” from foreign countries.The Tenom MP proceeded to elaborate that this was because when users use these applications for location searching, it indirectly provides information about Malaysia to external quarters such as the United States and Israel. The reason he cited these two countries, we assume, is because Google is headquartered in the US while Google owned Waze was developed in Israel.Kuala Selangor MP Datuk Irmohizam Ibrahim said that our nation cannot compromise when it comes to national security. He also brings up the issue about the extent to which our laws could protect such information leaks.“How far do we have laws that prevent information leaks in the usage of Google Map(s) and Waze?” he asks the Parliament. “Are there laws to make sure national security protected in the usage of such apps?”Communications and Multimedia Deputy Minister Datuk Jailani Johari reassured the concerned MPs that it was up to the users to decide how much personal information they wished to share and that they could choose to stop using the apps if they disagreed with the privacy policies.Jailani adds that the apps function based on privacy policies that are agreed upon by the individual and the application provider, be it Waze or Google Maps. If the user decides that they do not want to continue using the service, they can terminate the agreement and the provider will no longer hold on to their data.“We have yet to receive any report on any apps used for spying purposes.‘The real issue is that our users are fond of over-sharing private information on the Internet. This results in the information being misused. As a smart internet user, we should have our own controls,” said Jailani, who is also the MP for Hulu Terengganu.Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed also downplayed the danger claimed to be posed by the navigation applications, saying that these applications have helped citizens navigate more than it helps terrorists. He did however say that he acknowledges the security concerns, but he feels that the pros outweigh the cons.Kuala Krai MP Dr Mohd Hatta Ramli raised another concern that if the government decides to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) it could give foreign countries access to Malaysian personal data collected by the aforementioned navigation applications.“Our personal data used to be kept within the borders of the country,” he said. “Now with TPP, we must not allow it to be taken out of the county. We have a lot personal data that we would not like to share with other people.”. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a 12-nation free trade agreement backed by the United States which is set to be debated in Malaysia in January next year.Opposition MP for Kelana Jaya Wong Chen said that the free trade treaty required Malaysia to allow transfer of electronic information to foreign countries. “TPP prohibition on data localisation laws (Article 14.13) essentially means personal info that is hosted abroad would be subject to different laws on privacy,” he said. Wong further explained that under this, your personal data could be subjected to US surveillance laws such as the US Patriot Act, instead of our own privacy laws.[, , , ]"

Many owe this bad performance to the OEM’s disappointing 2015 flagship the  and how HTC didn’t go back to the drawing board when developing it. Perhaps it was because they were stubborn, or perhaps it was because of a lack of communication between the company and their customers that put them in this predicament.Well, HTC must’ve figured it was the latter because the smartphone manufacturer just announced that they are opening up the HTC Preview Program to all in the hope that it would help them better understand what exactly their customers want.In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on social, news and entertainment aggregation website Reddit, HTC’s USA Preview Team announced their intention to find a new way to connect back to the Android community, as well as answer any questions the community might have about this program. In a nutshell, this program will allow HTC fans to get their hands on the company’s latest software and hardware before it is released, in exchange for daily use and feedback.Yes, hardware too. In the  hosted on the Preview website, it is stated that while those selected to participate in this program will occasionally require participants to use their own devices, depending on the specific HTC Preview projects, the OEM may also provide loaner devices too. It seems like a good opportunity to get your hands on some unreleased HTC hardware.Of course, as the primary purpose of this program is to identify daily user habits, user information and feedback has to be collected by the company. However, HTC has clarified that while there will be logs running in the background to collect data on network/signal strength, battery information, usage times and apps used, they will not collect any sensitive personal data or tell what you are looking at on your screen unless you explicitly take a screenshot to share with them.They also clarified that one of the reasons they have opened up the HTC Preview program is to have actual hard facts and feedback on what their users want. This is so that they have actual data backing them when they tell executives what their customers want, which in turn makes it easier to have an impact on change within the company.HTC also reassured the community that they will take the feedback from this program very seriously and will tweak their upcoming devices to improve based on that information. They also added that if feedback for a device is overwhelmingly negative, they would even use that information to evaluate a product’s release.This is a very bold move by HTC, bringing what looks like, on the surface at least, more transparency to their product development. It should also ignite a warm fire in the hearts of HTC fans who have been clamouring for their voices to be heard and who are passionate about helping the company grow past these hard times.However, as this has only just been launched, the actual effectiveness of this program remains to be seen. They could just be all talk and have no action. For whatever it’s worth, let’s hope this does help them get back on its feet because it would be such a shame if the company, which had brought us one of the most beautiful metal unibody designs, fell out of the race.For those of you who are interested, you can also participate in the HTC Preview program, just head on over to  and follow the instructions there.[, ]"

Offering the same compact 7.9″ size, the new tablet gets an all metal body which is a huge leap over the plasticky predecessor.Compared to the previous version, the new Mi Pad 2 is 18% thinner at 6.95mm (Mi Pad: 8.5mm) and it is 11% lighter at 322g (Mi Pad: 360g). The Mi Pad 2 is also narrower and shorter as well, thanks to its reduced bezel design. The front 7.9″ display is pretty much retained with a 2048×1536 resolution that pushes a pixel density of 326 ppi. This is the same resolution as the current . Some of the new improvements include a Reading Mode which cuts down on harmful blue light and a button lock feature which deactivates the capacitive home, menu and back buttons when the tablet is held in landscape. While the old Mi Pad runs on Nvidia’s Tegra K1 chipset, the Mi Pad 2 is Xiaomi’s first Intel-powered device with a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 processor with 2GB of RAM. Storage wise it receives the same options of either 16GB or 64GB of storage. This time round, it appears that it lacks a microSD expansion slot, which isn’t good news for those wanting to store loads of TV shows on their tablet. The cameras combination appears unchanged with a 8MP f/2.0 camera capable of shooting full HD videos at the rear while the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter. The twin speaker grilles are still placed at the back, which could have been better placed at the front or at least on the sides.Powering the tablet is a smaller 6,190mAh battery that claims to push 100 hours of music playback or 12.5 hours of video streaming. It uses the new USB Type C connector to charge and it supports a typical 5V/2A fast charging standard. In terms of connectivity, it supports Bluetooth 4.1 and high speed 802.11ac WiFi. Like the predecessor, there’s no cellular 4G LTE version available. Out of the box, the Mi Pad 2 runs on MIUI 7 OS that’s based on Android. The 16GB Mi Pad 2 goes for 999 CNY (about RM662) while the 64GB version is priced at 1,299 CNY (about RM861), which is pretty decently priced for the hardware and build quality it offers. If you’re looking for something different, Xiaomi is also releasing a Windows 10 64GB edition as well for the same price of 1,299 CNY.

However, in terms of raw air cleaning power, the new model appears to fall short of the previous version, but not by a lot.Probably due to its size, the second-gen purifier outputs clean air in two modes, measuring a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) of 330 m3/h of clean air in standard mode and 388 m3/h of clean air in active mode, both of which are lower than the original Mi Air Purifier’s 406 m3/h. Cleaning range is also lower at up to 46.6 m2 of cleaning range, compared to the first-gen’s 48 m2 of effective coverage.It can also be attributed to the device’s single-motor, dual-fan setup versus its predecessor’s dual-motor, 4-air-duct engine. Despite that though, it boasts the ability to remove 99.7% of PM2.5 particles in just one hour, thanks to its triple filter setup.This isn’t to say that this new kid on the block is worse than its predecessor, because in every other aspect the sequel is an improvement. First off it is much smaller and lighter, measuring 240x240x520 mm versus the old air purifier’s 260x260x735 mm. It is also 58% more energy efficient and 11% quieter, weighing in at only 30db in Night mode.With the price of the Mi Air Purifier 2 set at RMB699 (around RM463), it is also much cheaper than the RMB899 (around RM596) Mi Air Purifer. Is the reduction in clean air output and coverage a trade-off you’re willing to make for a lighter, smaller, cheaper, quieter and more energy efficient air purifier?

This was to eliminate what Google called “screenshot jujitsu” and help the app better compete with other navigation applications like Here Maps as well as standalone navigation systems. Although the roll-out had officially begun, offline support for many parts of the world, including Malaysia, was still missing.Finally, after much anticipation, the application supports offline navigation within our home soil.With this feature, users can expect an improved navigation experience using the Maps app especially in areas where connectivity is bad, or when you want to save those precious few bytes of your quota. Google employs two different uses for their new offline navigation feature. The first is to bolster online navigation with the app, when connectivity is spotty at best, allowing Maps to freely switch between offline and online mode ensuring that you don’t lose crucial navigation information just because you entered an area with bad coverage.The second method is where users can opt to switch off connectivity completely and rely on the app to navigate with the pre-downloaded offline areas. To download an area, simply key in the location (or tap and hold a point on the map) and swipe up on the card that appears at the bottom. Then, select ‘download’ on the resulting screen, specify your desired region and tap the download button once more.Downloaded maps are stored on your device, so remember to free up some space before you decide to give this feature a spin. As an estimate, the amount of space required to download the greater area of Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur is about 300MB, whereas if you want offline navigation for Peninsular Malaysia, you will need to free up at least 1.5GB of space.Offline maps can be kept on your device for a total of 30 days. By default, stored locations will be updated via WiFi but that can be changed in the offline areas settings to allow for updates to be downloaded over a mobile network or to not be updated at all.This is definitely a bold move by Google, stepping into the world of offline navigation, but whether this move will pay off remains to be seen. Do give this feature a try the next time you need to navigate in unfamiliar territory, then let us know what you think of it in the comment section below.

Well they did it anyway, and for the first time it features an all-metal design, biometric security and a huge battery.
The Chinese manufacturer places high hopes on their most “premium” (if that word is fair) Redmi Note to date. Let’s talk about how it has changed, taking over the Redmi Note 2 in the most casual way possible; the biggest change would be the utilisation of a smooth metal finish – made by sandblasting the metallic layer.Surrounding the smartphone with the element and curving at the edges. Apparently, these curves will make the device more ergonomic when held, it’ll also just weigh 164grams, 4g heavier than the smartphone it replaces. Even with its massive 4000 mAh battery, the Redmi Note 3 will only be 8.65mm thick. They’ve managed to do this by using a 690Wh/L high density battery, that saves space underneath frame.Something really different this time around, the Redmi Note 3 will include a rear fingerprint sensor – a feature that has never been seen on older Xiaomi devices. They promise that you’ll be able to get into your device in less than 0.3seconds with the touch of your fingerprint. As far as recognition goes, the Redmi Note 3 will store up to 5 fingerprints, if you’d want to give other prying individuals the ability to unlock your pocket companion. It’ll also give you access to make secure payments through the aforementioned sensor.Otherwise it says relatively the same – which wasn’t awful to begin with. Here’s a recap on those specs: A MediaTek Helio X10 processor underneath the 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen. It’ll have 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory, while there will be a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear. Moving your way up front, you’ll be greeted by a 5-megaxpiel sensor.A power-packed package with near flagship like specs, since they’ve added a 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal memory option. Oh and did we mention; it’ll sell from RMB 899 (RM 596) and be available in 3 colours – Silver, Dark Grey and Gold. The higher end 3GB RAM + 32GB ROM will go for RMB 1,099 ( RM 728)Going full mental (oops metal), Xiaomi has a lot going for it with its new smartphone and we expected the device to sell for at least RM 800 in Malaysia, but we’ll only know for sure when/if it arrives here.Do let us know your thoughts on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 in the comments below.[  ]"

To make matters worse,  had only offered a vague explanation as to why the device was taken off the shelves late last week.This week, LG have finally decided to open up a little more and reveals that the device was pulled because of an issue with its display.When LG initially axed the Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, the company  that there was a problem with the smartwatch’s hardware and it affected “day-to-day functionality of the device”. Because of the “complicated nature of the issue” LG told Android Police that they would be cancelling the rollout of the device indefinitely. They added that future device availability would be decided at a later time as their top priority was quality assurance.Now, an LG representative told English daily The Telegraph that there was an issue with “a new advanced component” that had “never been used in an LG wearable device before”.Not wanting to point fingers or burn bridges with suppliers, LG simply said that after hours of stress testing, the “advanced component” failed to meet their quality standards and would have affected the smartwatch’s image quality.With that out in the open, critics can safely guess that the “advanced component” is the watch’s P-OLED display.

When pixels rot and die, the blue pixels are usually the first to go, resulting in a loss of brightness and inacurate colours, something we doubt any Watch Urbane 2 users would want.Besides its hyped screen, the LG’s follow up to the  was also set to be the first  device to have a built-in LTE modem. Being forced to drop such a high profile device after only six days due to an oversight in quality assurance must be incredibly painful for the electronics giant, something we doubt they will ever want to repeat.Large manufacturers often have large departments whose primary task is to ensure that their products meet the company’s quality standards, so it does seem a little odd that such a fundamental error was made by LG.

You would’ve heard it all before,  how their larger flagships starting showing up way before their 2015 Unpacked event in New York. To no surprise, we’re expecting the   line to face the same fortunate (for us) fate.Addressing the potential processors inside the device before, today, new reports are alleging that Samsung might re-equip their flagships with one feature that when left out, have scorned their existing customer base; more so when Malaysia and other regions only received the 32GB for purchase option – yes, we mean reinstating a microSD slot on the smartphone(s)A plethora of options open up with 2016 on the horizon, with new processors and new camera technology, the possibilities are endless. The year will mark the latest generation of mobile processors as it’ll bring about launches of the Exynos 8890, Kirin 950, and the Qualcomm 820 – no matter how unnecessary these high-end chipsets might be, the thirst for more power and futureproofing devices aren’t slowing down one bit.It’s likely that the Galaxy S7 series will see two SoC options, one Exynos and one Qualcomm; both models listed above, though they might be region specific. Other specs purported by rumours would be the latest reversible USB Type-C port and a display that reacts differently when more pressure is applied. If that sounds familiar, it’ll be some sort of 3D Touch/Pressure Sensitive display you’ve seen on the current-gen iPhones and Huawei devices.The announcement of BRITECELL, Samsung’s new camera technology then brings better potential for low-light photography. Enhancing photos and light sensitivity in badly lit conditions and boasts 1.0µm. You can read more about that .It’s been said that the Galaxy S7 edge will not be dual edged on the sides but instead have the same tapering glass on the top and bottom. Given the circumstances, this would be possible, since the manufacturer did patent a top-to-bottom curved display of late.Leaving leaks and rumours as they are, it’ll be interesting to see how redesigned the next flagship devices from Samsung will look like; since we can already expect them to go all the way when it comes to internal components.Would you spare Samsung another look, if they toyed with the idea of putting a microSD card back inside? Was that one of the reasons that made you leave the Galaxy series? Let us know your thoughts and reactions in the comments below.[ , ,  ]"

As they often say, better late than never. This late arrival isn’t unprecedented since the same smartwatch had issues launching in China but that was mainly due to Android Wear compatibility and Google services restrictions in the country.Going for the rather traditional approach, the watch itself is a circular watch face that sports a sapphire crystal screen. Taking a second look at the device for those who aren’t too familiar with its specs; it carries a 1.4 inch AMOLED screen with a 400 x 400 resolution. While running the show underneath its stainless steel body is a Snapdragon 400 SoC mated to 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage.Syncing and connectivity will go through Bluetooth 4.1 and you’ll find the typical fitness centric sensors inside, allowing you to track your heart rate, steps and calories too. The Huawei Watch has a 42mm footprint and on the top right you’ll notice a 18mm lug to go along with it. Powering everything will be a 300 mAh battery and at the same time it’s compatible with Android and iOS devices that run at least 4.3 or iOS 8.2, respectively.Shown on Huawei’s Facebook page, no other details were revealed, just stating that it’ll arrive “real soon”.

They would also get to experience a live demo of Continuum for Phones. This invitation came shorty after invitations to the 2nd November launch event in the UK were sent out.Windows Insiders who are going will also be able to purchase a Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL at the event through a sales package that includes a Microsoft Display Dock.Before you turn green with envy, this launch in India, coupled with the fact that both devices have already received certification from SIRIM, is a very good sign that you will be able to have these devices in your hands very, very soon.As a recap, the Lumia 950 will come with a 5.2” Quad HD AMOLED ClearBlack display, pushing 2560×1440 pixels. The device will be running on a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 chip clocked at 1.8GHz paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.Though lacking the power of some of the other flagships launched this year, Windows devices are commonly known to be incredibly optimised, thus requiring less raw power. It will also come with a microSD card slot allowing for storage expansion of up to 200GB.On the other hand, the bigger Lumia 950 XL will feature a larger 5.7-inch (2560×1440 pixels) QHD AMOLED ClearBlack display but with Gorilla Glass 4 on top instead of its younger brother’s Gorilla Glass 3.Internals see the Lumia 950 XL powered by a 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board memory.

Now, it seems that ’s premium Nexus phone has encountered a new problem: spotty voice quality.Several threads on the Google Product Forum and XDA-Developers have spawned with users complaining that people on the other end of their phone conversations couldn’t hear them very well. The problem appears to extend to the speakerphone as well.Based on unofficial experimentation by Nexus 6P users, it appears to be a problem with the phone’s noise cancellation setup. Some users say that covering the rear microphone solves this issue while others discovered that this actually causes the problem.For those who are unaware, most new smartphones use multiple microphones to supplement the main microphone to filter out surrounding noise, like wind, to improve the vocal clarity of phone calls. The root of the problem does seem to be related to this setup on the Nexus 6P as one of the users who posted on the Google forum indicated that a root-level build.prop modification solved the issue for him.On the plus side, Google representatives have responded to the posts on the official forum, letting users know that they are looking into it though as of this moment there is no official statement on the cause of these problems.Let’s hope that Google can fix this issue with a software update and not have to resort to recalling users’ shiny new Nexus 6P devices.[, , , ]"

Word had gotten out of TENAA that a smartphone had passed its certification; after which details of the  were spotted on Geekbench.Then on it got a whole lot for confusing, as  of the event went out and Xiaomi’s President  of the two devices. We’re going to try and make it easier for everyone to understand, at the same time giving out two cents on the whole situation.Metal isn’t one of the materials you’d usually find on a Xiaomi product, except for their higher-end range flagships – though the Mi Note and Mi 4 only explore using the element in minimal amounts, seen around the edges. The brand however, hasn’t started even considering finger print sensors on their flagships, hence the peculiarity of placing the aforementioned feature on the Redmi Note 2 Pro.It’ll be a totally new take, for the Redmi name if they decide to pursue the two features. Otherwise, it’ll have the same internals as its predecessor underneath. Moving to the other device that’s slated to launch, the Mi Pad 2; a device that didn’t confuse us as much as the former. Details on Geekbench made this short and sweet, stating what processor it’ll carry; an Intel Atom processor clocked to 2.24GHz and other accompanying specs.Xiaomi’s President didn’t stop there either, shortly after a few days, he decided to release photos of the smartphone and tablet. Leading us to finally cave in and actually believe that the company will release a follow up to the Redmi Note 2 before the same fiscal quarter comes to a close.Since then, more images go to contradict the existence of the Redmi Note 2 Pro, mentioning that it’ll instead be dubbed the Redmi Note 3. So far we know that it’ll be thin, light, have a fingerprint sensor and metal body. It isn’t farfetched to assume that Xiaomi wants to appeal to the higher-end market but adding two features on a non-flagship could either be a weird strategy or an opening of doors to more premium products in the future from the Chinese tech giant; yes, the Mi 5 too.Interestingly, new (rumoured) details have highlighted that the Redmi Note 3 will have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It’ll also supposedly be available with a 4000 mAh battery, making a huge jump from the existing device that only has a 3060 mAh battery.Maybe this long-shot might work for Xiaomi but we’re sure Redmi Note 2 customers won’t be too happy with this new information. We’ll wait for tomorrow to see what actually happens, who knows they might pull a “by the way” move and surprise everyone with more than two devices.[ , ,  ]"

Rory Lee,UE BOOM review: The singing soda can,,,,2015-11-24,"I never understood the need for a portable wireless speaker. Don’t get me wrong, I love my unnecessary gadgets. In fact I have an entire argument laid out about how I absolutely need a tablet/laptop hybrid even though I already have a laptop. desktop and phablet. That said, I just never saw the point of the Bluetooth speaker.I’ll admit, I’m no audiophile. Nor was I born in the time frame where “Say Anything…” was a thing. So the notion of carrying around an extra, rather heavy and rather expensive device just to play my music out loud – something I personally detest – seemed incredibly perplexing.Now that we’ve established my comic-book-esque origin story, we arrive at  (UE BOOM). Bought over by Logitech in 2008, Ultimate Ears have been making audio equipment since 1995. Their latest device, the UE BOOM, is an RM799 Bluetooth speaker the size of a can of ping pong balls, designed to be rugged as a rock and perfect for when you need to play your music out loud for everyone to hear. I think you can see where this is going.I thought so too when I started this review, but now, now I’m not so sure."

This overdrawn rally between the two has managed to do one thing, get both their customers rattled up. We’re seeing more negative comments from our readers of late, regarding their own experiences on the two networks. When push comes to shove, what we need are clear outlines on how each cellular provider measures themselves, and this is essentially what Maxis talked about earlier today.The parameters set by our telcos determine if they’ve set the bar(s) (figuratively) for their network, high enough to be considered acceptable by consumers. Quoting Maxis reps, 4G LTE is currently growing at an alarming rate and to keep up with that upward trend is a tough task but the green telco believes that the standards it has set is more than adequate enough to live up to their claims.Mentioning briefly that their 4G LTE population coverage is at 62%, placed in 144 locations including state capitals and secondary towns. If you kept track of the current developments, that betters Digi’s numbers by 2%; though there have different levels of signal strength, one being more stringent in their definitions of measurement.Backed by a desire to provide the most consistent experience across 2G, 3G, 4G and beyond, they’ve established standards that maintain their reputation and position as the best telco to provide a high performing internet experience. If you’re new to the whole debate and the jargon that goes along with it, feel free to read the following:How do telcos do about measuring this reading? Well they head to the very edges and see what they can maintain within an area before dropping to a lower speed aka 4G LTE to 3G. So now that we’ve got that out of the way, Maxis has issued (earlier on) that they measure their signal strength at , which on scale, is better than Digi’s base of measurement. The former goes on to add that if they followed Digi’s standards, it would easily hit 70% of population coverage."

Highlighted in our older articles, it didn’t seem to make sense to deploy something totally new to the brand, on a smartphone that could easily be mistaken to be a mid-range device – guess we were wrong, since Lin Bin, the President of the Chinese manufacturer teased two of their upcoming releases, that include the  and the  on his Weibo social media account.Making rounds earlier on, being shown passing  process, the Redmi Note 2 Pro is a really an odd device. We say so because it seems to include a finger-print sensor and metal-backed built – never seen before on any Xiaomi device. Plastering the aforementioned circular sensor on the back, underneath the LED module for the rear camera, they seem to have adopted the stylings of other Chinese smartphone makers.Since it’s the Pro version of the Redmi Note 2, it won’t have any other distinctive qualities, aside from mentioned above. Having said, it’ll carry a 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) resolution screen and underneath its glass panel you’ll likely find an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 clocked to 2GHz. Chances are you’ll find 2GB of RAM inside but rumours have discussed the possibilities of a 3GB RAM option as well; while it’ll have 16GB of native memory on board too.As far as camera optics goes, the same 13-megapixel rear shooter and 5-megapixel front sensor combo will apparently return. Powering the Redmi Note 2 Pro will be a 3060 mAh battery and it’ll run a backdated version of Android, likely 5.0.2 under its  skin.The bigger device revealed by Lin Bin was the Mi Pad 2 and by the looks of it, it’ll be really thin and have an uncanny resemblance to Apple’s iPads. Without giving away too much, the tablet looks to be fashioned entirely out of metal and feature a very sleek silhouette. It’s thought to carry a quad-core Intel chipset clocked to 2.24GHz.Interestingly, you won’t have to wait much longer since these two devices are slated to make an appearance during a Xiaomi event in China on the 24 of November. Still rolling on the excitement of getting our hands on the Redmi Note 2 domestically, we’re hoping that the smartphone maker will release the much-anticipated Mi 5 as well.[ , ,  ]"

Doubling up on functionality as a regular watch and now enabling you to use it as a clock will be much appreciated for those who purchased the smartwatch that starts from SG$ 518 (RM 1,590).Resembling a hockey puck, just a little flatter and tapered at the edges, techcrunch assumes that the dock is fashioned out of plastic, while the usual circular magnetic unit sits inside. Charging can be done in two orientations, the Nightstand mode, which allows the wearable to sit upright and the flat mode, setting your  onto the coaster.While other after-market options still utilise the charging puck that comes with Apple Watch, the Magnetic Charging Dock has its very own puck built-in. So at least for the price, the dock, only needs a lightning cable plugged into the back to power up.Apple hasn’t trailed away from their own proprietary cables and ports, but  has jumped on the same bandwagon, so the blame should be equally shared. Ridding consumers the convenience of universal plugs and ports, it’ll be harder to find a supported cable while at home or work (other than the one you already have).If you have an Apple Watch, or are thinking of purchasing one, you’ll have to get it in Singapore, the nearest option for Malaysians.

Rory Lee,Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m officially launched in Malaysia,,"5000 mAh battery,Android,big battery,Lenovo,Lenovo Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1,Lenovo Vibe P1 launch,Lenovo Vibe P1 Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1 Malaysia Launch,Lenovo Vibe P1m,Lenovo Vibe P1m launch,Lenovo Vibe P1m Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1m Malaysia Launch,on the go charging,Quick Charge,smart phone,smartphone,Snapdragon","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-19,"has finally officially unveiled its two battery behemoths, the  and  smartphones, sporting enormous battery capacities of up to 5,000 mAh. These devices are designed for the busy user who needs a phone that won’t run out of juice before they do.The Vibe P1 is the higher end of the duo and will come with a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display, powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor and 2GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 32GB but that’s expandable up to 128GB with a microSD card. The phone also has dual-SIM capabilities and supports 4G LTE.Beneath the Vibe P1’s aluminium body lies its party piece, the enormous 5,000 mAh battery with quick charge support. Security is also beefed up with a fingerprint scanner located underneath the physical home button. Camera wise, the Vibe P1 sports a 13-megapixel rear shooter with PDAF and a dual-LED flash alongside a 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera that is enhanced with a host of beauty features.On the other hand, the lower end Vibe P1m will instead be packaged with a 5-inch 720p HD display with a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage running under the hood. The P1m also supports expandable memory in the form of a microSD card up to 32GB. As a little cherry on top, the Vibe P1m will also get a splash-proof nano coating that will protect itself from accidental spills.In the optics department, the Vibe P1m gets a watered down 8-megapixel back + 5-megapixel front camera combo. Like its bigger brother, the Vibe P1m will also support dual-SIM and 4G LTE connectivity. Compared to the massive 5,000 mAh battery in the Vibe P1, this lower end device will ‘only’ have a 4,000 mAh battery, but since it is bundled with a lower 720p display, the smartphone should have no problems lasting you a day.When you do eventually need to charge it, you can have it up and running again in a jiffy with the phone’s Quick Charge 2.0 support. Lenovo states that a full charge for the Vibe P1 from empty would take 2 hours on its own charger.Both devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Both smartphones also have the ability to charge other USB powered devices through a USB OTG (On-The-Go) cable. The Vibe devices also have a dedicated power saver switch to extend its battery life should it go low. When toggled on however, the phone brings up a new home screen where you can assign six apps to use during power saver mode.The Vibe P1 will set you back RM1,199 and comes in Platinum and Graphite Grey options, whereas the Vibe P1m will retail for RM649 and have Pearl White and Onyx Black as colour options. If you want to get your hands on these devices, the Vibe P1 will be available in authorised retail stores and  starting 19 November. The Vibe P1m, on the other hand, will be available exclusively via  from 19 November onwards and will only hit the shelves of authorised local retailers in December. Lazada is offering an RM50 discount and two free gifts with every purchase of the Vibe P1m."
Rory Lee,"From soft drinks to smartphones, the Pepsi Phone P1 is now official",,"Android,Pepsi,Pepsi P1,Pepsi Phone P1,Pepsi smartphone,Phone P1,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-20,"It’s official. Soft drink mega-corporation Pepsi has taken its first step into the mobile industry by launching its own crowdfunding campaign on JD Finance to , the Pepsi Phone P1.Back in October,  that the soft-drink manufacturer would be releasing their own line of mobile accessories and even their own smartphone based in China. While preliminary specs were leaked, the information train stopped there and interest in the device screeched to a halt.Now that the world’s 29th most valuable brand has pulled back the covers of its pet project, we finally get to see some cold, hard specs.The device will come sporting a 5.5” 1080p display housed under 2.5D glass, with an octa-core 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6792 processor and 2GB of RAM at its heart. It only has 16GB of internal storage but that’s expandable via a hybrid dual-SIM tray up to 64GB. Out of the box, the device is said to run on Android 5.1 Lollipop with dido OS 6.1 plastered on top.For imaging, the device runs a 13-megapixel (f/2.0, 1/3.06 CMOS sensor) back snapper and 5-megapixel front camera combo. Interestingly, the Phone P1 also mounts a fingerprint scanner on the back of the device, right below the camera. To bring all of these parts to life, the phone will draw power from a 3,000 mAh battery.Since it’s a crowdfunding project, the device will be available through several layers of perks and support. The early bird option allowed interested parties to get the phone for CNY499 (around RM335), but that was only limited to the first 1,000 supporters. You can still opt for the limited CNY699 (around RM468) option which is still a good deal. Backers can also opt to get the phone at its full price of CNY1,299 (around RM870) instead.With only two weeks remaining, the Pepsi Phone P1 is still a long, long way from being funded so there is a chance that this whole thing could just fizzle out. If it does succeed though, it would be interesting to see if Pepsi’s nemesis Coca-Cola would take a gander at a mobile device.Specs wise, the phone looks like a fairly ordinary midrange device, but with its metal body we suspect that people will buy this purely as a novelty item rather than to use as a daily driver. All we’d like to see is for the device come in a phone sized Pepsi can instead of a boring old smartphone box.[, , ]"
Rory Lee,Samsung’s latest W2016 smartphone is a clamshell with flagship specs,,"AMOLED,Android,clamshell,Flip phone,Samsung,samsung clamshell,samsung flip phone,Samsung Galaxy Golden,Samsung Galaxy Golden 2,Samsung Galaxy Golden 3,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung W2016,smart phone,smartphone,W2016","Android,Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-11-22,"Mistaken as the , Korean electronics giant  have quietly revealed their latest handset, the W2016. If you’re familiar with Samsung’s line of clamshell smartphones running Android, then it should come as no surprise that many thought this latest flip phone was going to be the successor to the Galaxy Golden 2.This new flip phone is no underpowered feature phone though. Sporting two 3.9” AMOLED displays pushing 1280×768 pixels, an  chip, 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, this flip phone is essentially a  in a forgotten form factor. The primary camera is no slouch either as it likely the same high end 16-megapixel rear snapper as that in Samsung’s early 2015 flagship, with a 5-megapixel front camera to boot.Samsung’s W2016 will run  5.1.1 Lollipop with TouchWiz out of the box and the Korean manufacturer has also included modern elements like fast wired and wireless charging. Powering the device is a 2,000 mAh battery, which should be more than enough for the relatively small 3.9” screens to stay lit for a respectable amount of time.To many, the clamshell form factor is a thing of the past and it seems weird that Samsung would put so much into reviving it. But to some niche markets in Asia and nostalgic fans of this once glorious design, this is a welcomed move and we can see why.Aesthetically, the W2016 looks exquisite. The body is a sculpted aluminium frame that kind of emulates the Galaxy S6’s design, with a curved metal back and metallic accents. The screen sits flush into the front panel and the gentle slope towards the bottom of the phone gives it a much sleeker look. It looks like the kind of sophisticated device meant for the 0.01%, and not some playboy’s new gadget.Availability of the device at this point seems to be limited to China, without any news on whether or not it will make it to the rest of the world. While we do not have information on the pricing of the device, we wouldn’t be too surprised if it will eventually be sold elsewhere.On paper, the W2016 looks like a great way to bring the clamshell into today’s standards. For those of us who have used flip phones in the past, there is no doubt that we will remember this form factor fondly. Let’s face it, there aren’t many more satisfying ways to end a conversation than with the solid click of a clamshell snapping shut.[, ]"
Rory Lee,Hands-on with the Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m,,"5000 mAh battery,Android,big battery phone,lenovo launch malaysia,Lenovo Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1,Lenovo Vibe P1 Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1m,Lenovo Vibe P1m Malaysia,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-21,"Launched recently, the  and  are designed to last as long as you can with its enormous battery capacities of 5,000 mAh and 4,000 mAh respectively. These smartphones from  can also, in a pinch, double as powerbanks and charge your other devices via USB OTG (On-The-Go). As you can tell by the battery capacities, the Vibe P1 is designed to be the flag bearer of the “Power Player” line, while the Vibe P1m comes in as the runner-up.On paper that is very much the case as the Vibe P1 sports a 5.5″ full-HD IPS display and a brushed aluminium frame. The device’s unibody construction gives it a premium feel with a gentle curve at the back allowing the phone to fit nicely in the hand. In front you will find the front camera at the top and two capacitive buttons at the bottom, flanking the rectangular physical home button. Underneath the clicky, well-built button lies the Vibe P1’s fingerprint scanner which is a first for Lenovo.Around the back, the smartphone looks a lot like the flagships from  series. The main camera can be found at the top of the phone with the dual-LED flash right below it. The power button and volume keys are placed on the right side of the phone while the Vibe P1’s dedicated power saver toggle is located on the left. To differentiate the buttons, the power saver toggle has rough texture versus the smooth power and volume buttons. Either way, all the keys have a satisfying click without much wobble.The speaker grille and micro-USB port is located at the bottom opposite the phone’s headphone jack at the top. The top comes off revealing a tray that holds two nano-SIM cards and a microSD slot. As a whole, the device feels good in the hand. Even with that massive battery, the weight isn’t unbearable although it is rather thick and that adds to the bulk. The brushed aluminium helps the phone stay in the hand while staving off fingerprints.Much of the Vibe P1’s physical features are identical on its little brother, with the exception of the micro-USB port being on the top and the absence of a physical home button and fingerprint scanner on the Vibe P1m. Around the back, the primary camera is in the same place as the Vibe P1 but there is a brushed metal finish around the lens LED flash. The front is occupied by the Vibe P1m’s 5-inch 720p display, three capacitive buttons and the 5-megapixel camera at the top. The device is coated with a splash-proof nano coating.While the P1m does not have a brushed aluminium back, the textured removable rear cover feels very nice and sturdy, giving the phone even more grip. The smaller size also fits better in the hand, making up for its rather thick profile.Within the Vibe P1 beats the heart of an octa-core Snapdragon 615 clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and, 32GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). On the other hand, the lower end Vibe P1m is powered by a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor and 2GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but it is also expandable via microSD up to 32GB.Performance is good as both devices run smoothly on Android 5.1 Lollipop with almost no stuttering or noticeable lag when launching, exiting or switching between applications. It looks like Lenovo spent some time making sure that the software and hardware for both devices were well optimised. Then again, the Vibe P1m’s smooth performance can also be credited to the fact that it has less pixels to push on that smaller 720p display.Primary imaging on the Vibe P1 is taken care of by its 13-megapixel PDAF rear shooter while selfies can be delegated to the 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera. Our limited time with the Vibe P1’s camera reveals that it is snappy to launch and take pictures, but the venue’s poor lighting made it difficult to give a solid verdict on the camera’s performance. The same can also be said for the Vibe P1m’s 8-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo.Sitting under the back plate, powering all those hardware bits, lies the devices’ defining feature: their massive batteries. The Vibe P1 sports a 5,000 mAh battery that Lenovo claims gives the device 30 days of standby time and 45 hours of talk time. The phone also comes with Quick Charge 2.0 for when it eventually runs out of juice. Lenovo said that it would take 2 hours to charge up the P1 from empty using the device’s bundled charger.The Vibe P1m features a smaller, but still massive by conventional standards, 4,000 mAh battery. Besides the massive batteries, Lenovo took power saving to the next level with their included power saver toggle, available on both devices.With the power saver toggle flicked on, the phone enters power saver mode where the usual home screen is replaced by a simple black and white interface, showing you the clock, the battery level, a choice of six apps and how much time you have left before the phone runs out of juice. Very Jack Bauer. The six apps can be set by the user but by default three of the app slots are taken up by phone, contacts, and messaging.The Lenovo Vibe P1 which retails for RM1,199, will come in Platinum and Graphite Grey colour options. This device will be available in authorised retail stores and  starting 19 November. On the other hand, the Vibe P1m, costing RM649, will  from 19 November onwards, only hitting the shelves at authorised local retail outlets in December. As a bonus though, if you do choose to purchase the Vibe P1m from Lazada, they’re currently offering an RM50 discount and are throwing in a Lenovo Limited Edition Jersey and an 8GB SanDisk microSD card for free."

The exterior continues the One M9’s beautiful premium all-metal unibody and design scheme. The One M9s also keeps HTC’s excellent BoomSound front facing speakers, something that will certainly delight those who like to consume media on their smartphones.The phone measures 144.6 x 69.7 x 9.6mm and weighs a touch more than the original One M9 at 158g versus the base model’s 157g.On the inside, HTC swapped out the problematic Snapdragon 810, for an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 chip, but RAM and internal storage were bumped down to 2GB of RAM and only a tiny 16GB of internal storage. Fortunately, the One M9s will have the option to expand its storage up to 2TB via a microSD card. The device is reported to come running Android 5.0 Lollipop with HTC’s Sense on top.The rear camera has been downgraded in terms of megapixels though, dropping from a 20-megapixel affair to a 13-megapixel one. On the bright side, the One M9s’ f/2.0 primary camera will come with optical image stabilisation (OIS), something only available in the .HTC’s UltraPixel camera returns at the front, featuring the same 4-megapixel resolution and an f/2.0 aperture. HTC bundles the  with the One M9s’ cameras, allowing users to use voice controls to take a photo, as well as split screen front and back camera recording.Connectivity options are aplenty, including quad-band 2G/3G and LTE over a multitude of bands. Bluetooth v4.1, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, NFC and GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS and Beidou have also been included.As of this moment, the device can be pre-ordered now in Taiwan for TWD12,900 (around RM1,727). Unfortunately, no word on worldwide availability has been given. Although the HTC One M9 was not officially launched in Malaysia, you can get an imported one from DirectD for RM2,699.As a whole, the One M9s seems to be a light version of its older One M9 brother, with less RAM and internal storage, but, on paper at least, the camera should be better than the One M9 despite the drop in megapixels, because it comes with OIS.Is that a trade-off you are willing to make?

It is also said to feature an improved FaceTimeHD camera, Bluetooth 4.1, and Wi-Fi 802.11ac.This new information was gleaned from Japanese blog Mac Otakara, which has a good track record when it comes to all things Apple. The blog alleges that the new iPhone is apparently already in production and is set to launch in the first half of 2016, which contradicts earlier rumours placing it in the second half, so take it with a grain of salt.This phone looks to be a significant upgrade to the previous iPhone bearing the ‘c’ badge, the . No information on the iPhone 6c’s build was found, but if it will continue the trend set by the iPhone 5c, then the body will likely be made out of plastic with an array of colourful options. Earlier, alleged photos of the iPhone 5c were leaked, showing a plastic build and an oval camera LED flash that’s likely a dual-tone colour unit.It wouldn’t be too surprising if Apple decides to continue the ‘c’ badge as sales for the iPhone 5c were actually higher than expected.

We’ve addressed the prospect of the two chipset option returning before , so this further improves the chances of happening.Seen in a leaked list provided, these were the models along with their corresponding cellular carriers (US telcos):Notably, you’ll be able to spot that the Qualcomm processor is destined for only CDMA networks and carriers, while the Exynos 8890 will make an appearance for GSM and internationally unlocked models (Malaysia included, probably).A reminder to all, given the unofficial mannerism of these leaks, don’t take everything as face value. If Samsung follows their numbering system seen on older models, and this list tallies, well then it could hold water.

The Mate 8 apparently carries the  SoC, which could pose a threat to Samsung and Qualcomm’s top performing chips.Embracing the need for higher processing needs, the 950 Kirin processor will boast some highly clocked ARM Cortex cores; the four A72’s will run at 2.3GHz, while the more efficient A53 cores are listed at 1.8GHz. This is based on the big.LITTLE system, that allows an optimised Octa-Core set up, balancing between raw power and power consumption.Along with the aforementioned CPU, it’ll have a Mali-T880MP4 GPU to help out the graphics department. Rumours state that we should expect two models of the smartphone, taking note of two screen resolutions – 1920 x 1080 (FHD) and 2560 x 1440 (QHD) on the same 6-inch screen.Other sources speculate there will be differing internals on differing models. As such, one will supposedly offer 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage – you’d be expected to purchase this device for roughly US$ 517 (RM 2,266).

Well, Samsung has finally revealed the BRITECELL camera technology, though they did not provide any confirmation on whether or not it would be the one in the Galaxy S7.Revealed by Samsung LSI marketing head Kyushik Hong, BRITECELL promises enhanced light sensitivity in low-light conditions with less colour artifact. BRITECELL was not the rumoured Galaxy S7 1/2-inch sensor with large pixels though as it actually has smaller one micron pixels. Samsung says that these smaller pixels will help reduce the module height by 17% while maintaining low-light sensitivity at 1.12µm.The sensor also utilises Samsung’s Smart WDR technology which will help provide a more detailed image by using multi-exposure for better spatial resolution and Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF) for faster, more accurate photos.Although the electronics giant did not confirm whether this BRITECELL technology would be used in their smartphones, if they do, the Galaxy S7 could very well be the first one to receive it. With the BRITECELL’s focus on improving low-light performance, the next-generation Samsung phones could be significantly better than its predecessors.

After resolving the issue with the force reset method, the battery levels were listed at 100%. More comments pour in sharing the same sentiments but at least Apple is aware of the issue, or at least their Support Communities site is.Their response isn’t much help though, as they suggest to perform a simple factory reset, wiping your device on iTunes.

Now though, rumour has it that LG have finally decided to go with the flow and follow other major manufacturers with a metal unibody for their upcoming , and we all know what a metal unibody probably means: no removable battery.While initially seeming adamant to stay away from metal bodies, LG finally caved with the , which features a ‘DuraGuard’ stainless steel frame, designed to better protect the phone’s internals on impact. It seems that the success of its competitors and the demand for premium metal builds was too tempting to give up and so recent rumours suggest that we could see a premium feeling metal LG G5 coming next year.However, switching over to a metal unibody would probably mean that LG are ditching the removable back and battery that have been present in most of their recent smartphones, including the , G4, and even the “extra-premium” LG V10. Many of the big players in the smartphone industry have moved away from phones with removable backs and removable batteries, leaving LG as the only relatively well-known smartphone manufacturer to have this feature.Ditching one of their, frankly key, features could cause users who prioritise this feature to now have to look elsewhere, which is something LG would rather avoid, considering their already small market share.Rumours also indicate that we could see it as early as Q1 of 2016,  as Samsung’s .

Arif Lee,Digi reclaims its widest 4G LTE population coverage title but when it comes to speed…,,"4G LTE,4G LTE coverage,4G LTE coverage map,4G LTE speed,coverage map,DiGi,LTE-A,Malaysia,Maxis,network,population coverage,speeds,telco,telecommunications,VoLTE,VoWiFi,widest,widest 4G LTE,widest 4G lte coverage,widest 4G LTE network,widest 4G LTE population coverage Malaysia,Widest network","DiGi,Industry in General,LTE,Players on the Field,Technologies",2015-11-16,"Expanding as a telco is what you should be doing year around, thus Digi has managed to up its game by hitting more than half of nationwide population for its 4G LTE network – on paper this translates to 80 major cities and secondary towns at 60% of nationwide population coverage. Though their definition of what 4G LTE speeds are, could baffle many.Beginning the discussion of the who’s the widest 4G LTE provider in October, they had  listed the 4G LTE coverage to be 50%; but is a 10% jump a realistic in such a short span? (we’re asking the same question) Anyway, by Digi’s valuation, their 4G LTE network will deliver more than 5Mbps 80% of the time – petty by industry .They’ve also ramped up the number of network sites in Malaysia, adding 52 additional cell towers in the process. Furthermore, the telco provider mentions that of their 2 specified signal spectrums – 1,800Mhz and 2,600Mhz, there is now a 30% overlap. Simply going to say that a highly dense area won’t suffer as these dual-band offerings will come into play.Furthering the conversation, the company has announced LTE-Advanced, leveling at more than 10Mbps 80% of the time; they’ve managed to hit a 22% population coverage so far with this new technology. Again these speeds don’t meet up to standards of the world, as that speed should be easily achievable on a 3G network. Remember that by , 4G LTE (alone) is supposed to reach 100Mbps for downloads, while on the move. Digi and other local telcos have a lot to do before being able to talk about 4G LTE as a whole, if they want to be taken seriously.Using their time wisely, Digi has added that they’ve begun plans to roll-out VoWiFi in 2016, adding on to their earlier announcement about beginning VoLTE next year, as well. Tying it all together, the telco has begun a campaign on Twitter for their users to voice where they want new 4G LTE towers; once it wraps up within a month, the top 10 locations will get a cell tower put up – nope, they aren’t kidding.It’s sad to see the yellow coloured network provider list such low levels for 4G LTE (same goes for their supposed LTE-A). Taking a look at Maxis, who promise that their 4G LTE speeds exceed 15Mbps, at all hours, both indoor and outdoor. It isn’t even a competition,when the latter doesn’t maintain this either but they can manage 5Mbps easily. Of course, the tell of the tale today is about coverage but how we see it is a company just plucking numbers from the air, actions that only earn them bragging rights – without third party verification.We’d like to hear all your thoughts on the subject, as we’ve addressed earlier all this coverage talk should hold no value for customers who suffer coverage outages, even in the Klang Valley. Please wake up telcos, your customers are sick of all this. Coverage should be a right, it should be based in all towns, there shouldn’t be a online “contest” that dictates whether you get a consistent customer experience."

C’mon, the movies have told us at least that much.True enough,  came up with their “revolutionary”  technology that they claimed required countless hours of research to produce, but ended up being not much more than a gimmick, at least for now with the low amount of apps that actually make use of it. Well, if you want something more revolutionary, the boffins at Qeexo might just have what you need.Carnegie Mellon spin-off Qeexo have come up with a new algorithm that allows smartphones to recognise the angular position of a finger, and are hoping to change the way we interact with our devices.Dubbed the FingerAngle, this algorithm attempts to improve movements and interactions with a touch screen – like pinching or rotating – which require an extra finger to carry out properly. While on most modern smartphones, requiring an extra finger may not seem like that much of an inconvenience as screen real estate is ample. But when you need to perform those same actions on smaller screened devices like wearables, it becomes a little more tricky.FingerAngle though, changes this as it allows those devices to determine if you are rotating your finger, if your finger is tilted upwards, downwards or even swiveled side to side. This software estimates a finger’s 3D angle relative to a screen’s surface by measuring the finger’s pitch and yaw.This then opens up a whole new avenue of possibility for interacting with your device beyond just making it easier for wearables. One prominent possibility is in mobile gaming controls, where currently we have to use on-screen controls or rely on a device’s accelerometer. With FingerAngle, the control possibilities have now completely opened up.FingerAngle’s promotional video clearly shows that there are some kinks to work out, the latency for example, but as this isn’t the final product yet, things are certainly looking good.Of course, this technology is still new and there is no definite timeline to when this software will go live. But as this is purely software, who knows, a manufacturer might pick it up and it could come sooner than you think.[]"

In the face of this security breach, many tech organisations used their own means to help out by offering their services. The people behind AirBnB, Facebook, Google, Skype, Twitter all jumped into disaster relief mode. Can they along with other organisations continue in the light of similar tragic events around the world? We hope they do.Stemming from Twitter’s Porte Ouverte hashtag, that loosely translates to “Open Door”, Parisians used it to offer a temporary safe house, while those in public spaces could also look for those places and stay up to date on the happenings around the city.Facebook launched their Safety Check function, allowing those in the city a way to notify their loved ones that they were safe, albeit not doing so for other recent disasters that happened in other parts of the world. Users accused the social media site of being desensitised to the daily onslaught in the Middle East (e.g. Ankara and Beirut bombings); as such, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded by saying Facebook will enable this feature across the globe for future.This pivot in the industry could see more tech companies come to the aid of those affected, as their reach is truly global, and are limited only to the gadgets people carry around. Providing shelter, updates on loved ones and means of communication all for the human kind was a kind gesture that should be replicated given the circumstances.Consequently, the more connected the world becomes, the higher likeliness it will bring about an impending threat of terror organisations that camouflage themselves in the same social media networks as regular citizens – as Belgian minister Jan Jambon highlighted; ISIS agents have been driven to utilise the  network to communicate.Following the tragedy, how will nations react? Technology will be an actor regardless of what they do – meaning that states could possibly adopt new bills and acts that cover surveillance of its citizens.We at SoyaCincau offer our condolences to whoever lost their loved ones during this act of mindless violence and our hearts go out to anyone affected by this tragedy.[ , , ,  ]"

Shrapnel, which would have hit his head and probably killed him just moments later, instead left a hole in the back of his Galaxy S6 edge and a shattered screen.The attack on the Stade de France stadium was part of six coordinated acts of terror that struck Paris only a few days ago, leaving . According to a New York Times report, responsibility for the tragic attacks was claimed by the Islamic State and is alleged to be “the first of the storm”.Although miraculous, this is not the first time a smartphone has saved someone’s life as back in 2013 an  stopped during an attempted robbery in a petrol station in Orange County, Florida.

But as more images surface, we’re still doubting if this particular smartphone will actually be the . Anyhow consumers still have nothing to lose, we’re still getting fresh glimpses of a  device from China’s regulatory agency, .As you can tell, it’ll have a fingerprint sensor on the rear and some metal to go along with it, a first for any Xiaomi device out there ( and  were only metal edged). We would think that Xiaomi wouldn’t kick themselves in the butt, as it seems far-fetched for them to try out something so different on a Redmi – placing it on a flagship device would likely bring more promise and also the Redmi name has attached itself to a moniker so distinct that this would be a 180-degree turn around.Another thing we had noticed was, if this were to be a Redmi device, then why did they remove the red coloured capacitive buttons? Doesn’t make much sense, unless they want to move away from the Redmi platform and make the Xiaomi brand more uniform.Believe what you may, these are all leaks; so there’s no actual word from Xiaomi. Bar none, if it is truly the Redmi Note 2 Pro, it’ll carry the same specs as its predecessor. Translating to a MediaTek Helio X10 processor underneath the 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen. It’s purported to have 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory, while there will be a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear.Moving your way up front, you’ll be greeted by a 5-megaxpiel sensor. Once a realisation comes about, you’ll see that handing the smartphone a metal build means that there won’t be any chances of removing the 3060 mAh battery inside. If it stands as it is, the phone will have a selling price of US$ 172 (RM 753) – that’s if it really is another Redmi product.We apologise for the cynicism but things aren’t adding up on our end. More so since Xiaomi just brought the Redmi Note 2 to Malaysia (and other emerging markets). Rumours, maintain their bad rep; at least for this moment of time.We’ll have to wait to see what Xiaomi has to say about all this, which they likely won’t, since it fuels interest in the brand. One has to hand it to them, now everyone is merely guessing what their next move is and this witch-hunt is getting quite fun.Feel free to add to the rumours with your own analysis of all this and at the same time, check out the post about how the Xiaomi “Gemini” was spotted with a Snapdragon 820 processor .[ , ,  ]"

Rory Lee,OnePlus 2 USB Type-C cable may damage other devices,,,,2015-11-16,"has received some criticism lately, especially when it concerns their “2016 Flagship Killer” the , which many said was killed by this year’s flagships. To add to their woes, their  cables are now coming under fire for not being spec compliant.Who, you might ask, is attacking OnePlus? Well, some call him the Caped Cable Crusader, others call him the USB Vigilante, but his almost 7,000 followers on Google+ should know him better as Benson Leung.Google employee by day, Amazon cable critic by night, Benson cautioned users who purchased the OnePlus USB Type-C cable against using it with their Chromebook Pixel or the new  devices. This was because Benson found that OnePlus’ cable used a 3A identifier resistor instead of the “Default USB Power” resistor, and as a result could cause damage to those devices.He also found that OnePlus’ USB Type-C adapter was also using the wrong identifier resistor, raising concern regarding the actual quality of OnePlus’ accessories.Benson wasn’t deliberately picking on OnePlus though as he had already launched a campaign to test USB Type-C cables off Amazon to see if they met the minimum standards or if they were merely rip-offs.His process consisted of ordering USB Type-C cables from various manufacturers on the site and then testing them, subsequently  on their respective product pages on Amazon. While some did not follow the Release 1.1 USB Type-C specifications, the more common problem it seemed was that many of the cables were using incorrect resistors.While many of the problematic cables were from third party manufacturers, OnePlus’ failure was certainly not expected since their motto was to “Never Settle”. Perhaps they were trying to create cables that only rewarded the faithful. In any case, OnePlus owners don’t have to worry as long as they don’t stick their cables into a device that doesn’t bear the OnePlus logo.[, ]"

But if the were to arrive in Malaysia on the 19, we don’t think they’ll have one amazing gala, rather they’d build up anticipation of their devices gradually.Skimming through SIRIM, if you’d search for the model number RM-1116, the following information would be available to you:Saving you the trouble of digging through the spec-sheet, here’s what to expect from the Lumia 950 XL; for starters, it’ll carry a QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED 5.7-inch ClearBlack display, while on top you’ll find Gorilla Glass 4 to protect it from abrasions.Running all processes, is a 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, together with 3GB of RAM and 32GBs of on-board memory. If that doesn’t sit well with you, there’s a microSD slot for expandability up to 200GB – but believe us, if you’re going to be shooting 4K content, it’ll be a life saver.The PureView camera is back and this time it’s a 20-megapixel f/1.9 lens on the rear, equip with triple-LED RGB flash for less harsh illumination of your photos. You’ll find optical image stabilisation on board as well, that will come in handy taking quick shots with the dedicated camera button.When recording those 4K videos, you’ll be able to shoot up to 30fps and for audio quality, it’ll be supported by the 4 microphones using Lumia’s Rich Recording technology. Selfies on the other hand, will be taken with a 5-megapixel wide angle f/2.4 shooter, which allows Full HD video recording for video calls.To top it all off, it comes with a 3,340mAh battery and will give you Qi Wireless charging, if you prefer the no cable route. We’d like to think that you might stick with the old-school method since it’ll get you 0% to 50% in half an hour, through the USB Type-C port. It also ticks all the boxes for internal connectivity options – 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE.From our perspective, Malaysians should expect our local Microsoft to release the two Lumia devices concurrently, after the Surface Pro 4 launch. Based on currency conversions you should expect the Lumia 950 XL to cost roughly RM 2,813 but obviously, no official prices have been announced.We’ll keep you updated once we get official news from the manufacturer, regarding the Lumia devices. Till then, feel free to let us know your thoughts about how the Windows mobile platform is progressing/digressing in the comments below.A big thank you to Twitter user  for the tip."

Leading many to predict that this will be Xiaomi’s first attempt at such a high-end device; in terms of the metal design and beastly specs. We’ve seen Chinese manufacturers, , take it a step further recently, so maybe Xiaomi is ready to join the party.We’re not implying that the ,  and  aren’t worthy but this is really a step in the right direction for the Beijing based corporation. Posted with the MSM8996 model number (aka the Snapdragon 820), this “Gemini” will also take advantage of the Adreno 530 GPU on the same processor board.Giving you a brief introduction of the Snapdragon 820 chipset’s credentials; Qualcomm promises that it’ll draw 30% less power than the 820, while graphics will get a 40% bump up, thanks to the Adreno 530 GPU. You can read on about the latest Qualcomm processor .Nailing the benchmarks with a single-core score of 2140 and multi-core score of 4762, how does it compare to the rest? Looking at single-core performance, the head of the pack is the  with a 2,500 mark. While for the multi-core the  sits high with a 5,000 score.Some have dutifully pointed out that the clocked speeds are under-clocked, only at 1.6GHz so the full potential of the device is still in the wind. This is also just a prototype, not a working model, so we’re sure it’ll perform better once it’s official revealed. Another user , mentions that “Geekbench always prints the lower clock speed. Even the 7420 posts 1.5GHz while the big cores are 2.1GHz”.Good scores or bad scores, at least this listing shows that Xiaomi is working on a smartphone with the Snapdragon 820 inside. They’re no longer relying on lesser worthy chips and skipping the Snapdragon 810 all-together could finally pay off for them. We assure everyone that once more information comes to light, we’ll keep you posted, as we’re just as excited as you guys to hear this news.[ , ,  ]"

Moments of joy, sadness, heartbreak and the new experiences that capture the intricacies of what makes life worth living. Who could forget their first visit to a foreign place, the joy of that breathtaking sunset after a hard day’s climb or that first bite into the best burger you’ve ever had?The thing about moments though, is that they are like any other memory, they slip through the fragile grasp of our minds to the powerful tug of time. Moments end up hazy, becoming distant, unable to evoke the same emotions we felt on that day and that’s kind of a bummer because when we’re old and grey, memories of those moments are kind of all we have.Samsung plans to change that though, with the all new , sporting its amazing 16-megapixel rear shooter, voted best camera by our readers, and the all new S Pen.Capturing moments in real life can be challenging as they are fleeting, often disappearing as quickly as they come. Couple that with lighting that is uncertain at best and you will be in for a hard time making sure that the image will properly reflect what you are seeing.This though, is where the Galaxy Note5’s fast f/1.9 lens comes in. The wide aperture allows a lot of light into the sensor, making sure that your stills stay well exposed even in the dark confines of KL Live. Combine that with Samsung’s auto real-time HDR and you are almost guaranteed a great image no matter how dodgy the lighting.The Galaxy Note5’s camera is also ideal for quick snaps with its “quick launch” feature where a simple double tap on the home button will get you into the dedicated camera app letting you style-snap that fashionista walking down the sidewalk.When you have time to set up that perfect shot, head on into Pro Mode where you will have full access to exposure value (EV), shutter speed, ISO, white balance, and focal distance levels for optimal image capturing.
With that amazing rear shooter, Samsung also upgraded its front facing camera to a 5-megapixel one that maintains the rear’s HDR feature, bringing selfies to a whole new level. Join your precious moments and never have to worry about poor lighting again.Want to record a video instead? No problem. The Galaxy Note5’s small form factor coupled with the camera’s optical image stabilisation makes it ideal for handheld video recording. The bundled auto-eject S Pen makes video editing a breeze with its pressure sensitive point designed to give precision during editing.With live streaming being all the rage now, the Galaxy Note5’s camera gives users a Live Broadcast option, streaming video from either camera directly to live stream sites like YouTube. As the app is native, it eliminates potential sign-in problems giving the user instant recording.
Sometimes simply capturing images aren’t enough to capture a moment, so the S Pen lets users personalise their photos and edit on the fly with Screen Write and Photo Editor. Add that little context to an image to make it stand out and just be that little more special. Scribble a memory or even directions on images of popular landmarks so that you will never forget that awesome moment.
Once that’s done and dusted, share your amazing, personalised photos with the world through social media. Make sure that everyone can experience that moment with you because let’s face it, moments are like a good meal, best enjoyed in great company.In the case that you’d like to take a look at what the creative individuals can do with the Note5, here’s an amazing example:To encourage the capturing of moments and budding creative individuals, Samsung Malaysia will be running their Moment of Note campaign from the 7th of November to the 13th of December where two lucky participants will walk away with a brand new Galaxy Note5.

The Korean smart phone maker isn’t going to bring its launch earlier and there’s no reason for them to rush since the Galaxy Note5 is still a worthy flag bearer for now.

When analysing which platform is safer, two security firms have looked at how secure the  and  platforms are. The results may surprise you, but how worried should we be? And what cautionary steps should be taken?Users that dabble in third-party app stores (should) know what they’re doing, especially when it concerns workarounds and an unauthorised market place for apps. Bountiful in choices in countries like China and Russia, some of these apps are obviously laden with hidden malware and that’s where the official sources,  and the , vets them.Conventional thought has always made Apple the king when it comes to supplying the most secure operating system ( or iOS). Nevertheless, a new study provides some surprising insights that iOS is 4% more prone to vulnerable attacks compared to Android. The breakdown of the numbers is as listed below:Partly due to the amazing growth of the mobile ecosystem that sees nearly 1.5 million apps between the two platforms and multiple billions of downloads, this screams to be the best place for hackers to have some fun – at our expense. Extending way beyond instant messaging and social media, apps have evolved to include these sectors; banking and medicine, just to name a few.Dedicated detection in-built into apps would be one of the most promising course of action for smartphone vendors. It doesn’t help either that mobile OS’ run in a sandbox environment. To simplify what that means, you’re letting an application do what it needs to, in a secure setting. There are restrictions, so for example if you were to use an anti-spyware/malware app on your device, it can only do so much – now restricted by the operating system instead of the other way around. For a more thorough explanation head on over .Always ensure that the apps you download are from reputable developers, especially if you’re on an Android device. In a sense, iOS is more tightly overseen when giving power to developers, so that’s a smaller sandbox and vetting them before going live on the App Store.While  also has its own process, it isn’t as stringent as  – case and point, no validity for Play Store apps. It’s understandable that with a fairly open-sourced platform, Android will have its trade-offs when it concerns pushing out security updates but hopefully  solves this. OEMs have jumped on the idea of providing monthly security updates, as far as ,  and  is concerned.The full report from Checkmarx can be found . Till another malware attack arrives, keep your personal data safe everyone!For further reading, check out these articles below:

Arif Lee,Sightings of Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 edge firmware points to an early arrival of the duo,,"edge,Exynos 8890,flagship,Galaxy,Galaxy S7,Galaxy S7 edge,MWC,MWC 2016,S7,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Snapdragon 820","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-11-11,"September was a hot month for the Korean manufacturer, releasing two devices in the form of the  and the . With these two out and about, they can finally refocus efforts (as if they weren’t already) on the 7 generation flagships. What could this mean for the official release(s) of the  and the ? Trusting leaked information on their firmware codenames, it might mean a release earlier than usual.Looking at industry trends, Samsung has recently fast-tracked their products by a month or so – e.g. the release of Samsung’s Galaxy Note5, in contrast to its predecessor. Accordingly, the unreleased device(s) should lead to better processors, though will it be the  8890, the  or both?We’ve seen these Korean devices be outfitted with two different chipsets before; mainly specific to regions but they skipped it for two generations, when the two options were last seen on the Galaxy Note4. A revival would be in order, as Qualcomm has stepped their game back to norm with the Snapdragon 820 (that was released today).Riding other waves, Samsung might also consider lodging a bigger screen, enticing folks who’d prefer more screen real-estate. There are also some (crazy) reports going around stating that the company will launch two different screen variants of the Galaxy S7 edge at the same time – at this time, it doesn’t make sense for Samsung to release the larger version, once you consider the S6 edge+ has only been around for a while.We’ve also discussed the potential for the latest Samsung offerings to be equip with the class-leading USB Type-C, a 3D Touch/Pressure Sensitive display and a 20-megapixel ISOCELL sensor as well. You can revisit our post about the assumed spec-sheet .Spotted as G930FXXU0AOK6 and G935FXXU0AOK6, these are the latest leaks that support the theory that there will be two different versions of the Galaxy S7 (one regular, and the other a dual edged display). It is purported that they will begin the developmental stages for the software, from this month onwards.In the past the current line-up used SM-G920 and SM-G925 as internal codenames, so the G930 and G935 wouldn’t surprise anyone to be anything other than their successors. Phonearena has highlighted that 12 months ago, the Galaxy S6’s final firmware didn’t begin till December, so implications can be made that the Galaxy S7 line should be out just in time for MWC 2016, in February. What do you think? Should Samsung maintain their delivery times of their 4 main flagships? And are you excited by hearing this news? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.[ ,  ]"

Available now on the online store,,"apple,apple ipad pro,iPad,iPad Pro,iPad Pro Availability,iPad Pro Launch,iPad Pro Malaysia,iPad Pro Malaysia Launch,iPad Pro Price","Android,iPad,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-11,"As  earlier, the  today has landed in 40 countries including Malaysia. Following the notion that bigger is better, the iPad Pro is the largest iPad yet spanning 12.9 inches with a display that does 2732×2048 resolution at 264 ppi. The iPad Pro is designed to be a mobile powerhouse with a A9X chip under the hood that’s accompanied by a M9 co-processor. Also thrown in is a 8MP iSight camera and a front facing 1.2MP camera. It gets dual-mics and 4 speakers with one placed in each corner. With a larger screen, it is heavier at 713g for WiFi and 723g for the Cellular version. However they have managed to keep the bulk down to a mere 6.9mm, which is thinner than the earlier iPad Air (7.5mm). Apple claims that the iPad Pro display is the most advanced Retina display ever built. Apart from pushing an ultra high resolution display, it is able to track the Pencil’s input at 240 times per second, giving it a lag free response. On top of that, the display not only detects Pencil movement and pressure, but also the amount of tilt for a more realistic stroke effect that’s critical for illustrators. To maintain the same 10 hour of battery life, the iPad Pro display is smart enough to switch between 60Hz and 30Hz to conserve on power.The full iPad Pro and accessory pricing for Malaysia are priced as follows:If you have the money to splurge, you can place your orders now with shipping estimated to reach you by next week, 17th November. The iPad Pro comes in Gold, Silver and Space Grey colours. In terms of accessories, it will cost you quite a bit at RM799 for the Smart Keyboard and RM429 for the stylus Pencil. So at the bare minimum, that’s RM4,398 for an iPad Pro 32GB WiFi with a keyboard. If you plan on doing serious work, a  11″ can be yours from RM4,099, while the bigger 13″ version starts from RM4,549.

The top and bottom grill indicates the presence of its Boom Sound speakers and surprisingly it appears to have capacitive buttons in front. That’s rather odd since HTC smart phone these days have opted for on-screen buttons.It is alleged that it will carry a 5″ display that pushes a Quad HD (2560×1440) resolution with either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or Helio X20 processor running on -board.

Breaking its tradition of using smaller than average batteries, the One X9 is said to be fitted with a larger 3,500mAh capacity unit.Looking at the timing, it is strange that HTC is releasing a high-end device at this time of the year, especially when the new One M series is due for replacement during MWC 2016.

New photos have arrived showing the outer shell and it pretty much corroborates older images but still leave us unsure if  would pack all this in a mid-range device.Since the  will be available (in Malaysia) for pre-order in 2 days, this timely news might deter buyers who’d prefer a metal-clad phablet. That said, if the rumours are true, the Redmi Note 2 Pro could carry a 5.5-inch display but no information states whether it’ll maintain the 1080p resolution like the regular variant.Once you find your way inside, there will be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor coupled with either of these memory configurations:2GB RAM + 16GB internal storage – 1099 yuan (RM 756)
3GB RAM + 32GB internal storage – 1299 yuan (RM 893)
4GB RAM + 64GB internal storage – 1499 yuan (RM 1030)Something definitely doesn’t tally with this information but from photos we can say that a device does indeed exist. Whether it’ll actually be a Redmi Note 2 Pro is a whole other story. Firstly, it doesn’t make sense to pack a fingerprint sensor and premium build, in a mid-range product – if you were to do it, it would definitely be in your flagship.Another problem would be, why release a higher-end Redmi Note 2 if you just released it in August. But then again, we feel it won’t be anything else since the  was supposed to be a “respectable “replacement to the Mi 4. If Xiaomi truly decides to release a device with the aforementioned price points, this could be the most expensive Redmi to date.We’re as confused as you are but do keep in mind that these are all rumours, the only thing that is considered to be factual would be Xiaomi will release a smartphone on 11.11.

Following the onslaught of who’s the “best”, “widest” and “fastest” 4G LTE network, Maxis aims to put this issue to bed by releasing company data on how they classify their 4G LTE network. Moreover, the green coloured telco has also proposed to have a forum with two of its competitors to talk about the state of 4G LTE in Malaysia.Getting the ball rolling on a pressing issue that has left Malaysian baffled by both telcos claims (Digi and Maxis), this could mean that consumers will at the end gain more out of this. The initiator of all this has issued an open invitation to any member of the public to prove them wrong on their “widest” 4G LTE network; they also hope Digi and Celcom follow suit.Setting the date for the 23 of November, Maxis hopes that this platform will allow all three networks to have their own telecommunications engineers to talk about how they gauge their coverage. And at the end of the day, Maxis claims that they want to do this for consumers; evidently to let us “have a fair basis for choosing”.Strangely, Maxis has left out the 4 major player in the market, U Mobile. Possibly since the company isn’t publicly listed, otherwise we’d best not speculate further. While everyone claims to provide the “widest” 4G LTE, we’re still questioning if they’ve diverted their attention to problems that their customers are facing everyday – even in the heart of the Klang Valley.Our readers have been very open about their experiences on their networks, with some stating that there are service blind spots in popular landmarks and areas around the major cities. Silly if you think of it really, the fact that their customers in their key market areas are facing issues and they want to go on record being the “widest”, “fastest”, and “best” network.Previously, we talked about what all these bold titles mean to consumers, you can check it out . But if you’re really into these figures that Maxis has published, they are listed below:It’s easy to talk numbers and standards but do they really reflect in real-life situations? We’ve tried testing Maxis’ network at KLCC, on a weekday night and from the photo below, you can see we only managed 7Mbps download speeds, so what gives?We now throw it back to the telcos, step up your game, stop all the bickering and maintain your network coverage (and speed) across all your services – no matter 2G, 3G or 4G. We want a consistent experience, it doesn’t matter to us if you’re the widest if you can’t deliver in reality.There has been no official statement from either Digi and Celcom yet (but be fair to them, it’s a public holiday today). Once they’ve replied we’ll keep everyone updated. It’ll be a great thing to see our cellular providers meet in a neutral setting, we hope that all three will decide to have an unbiased moderator and that the public will be allowed to grill them on their gripes.

On the other hand ,to a timepiece aficionado the brand is usually the butt of jokes but its heritage is world-renown.

Somewhere down the line, they’ve lost their footing and are trying once again appeal to the wider consumer base. How can they turn it around with the  Connected?Jan-Claude Biver the CEO has officially announced how much this luxury watch will go for – setting you back a cool US$ 1,500 (RM 6,581), this wearable better be worth the money. If you ask us personally, knowing that your buying a TAG at that price (even if it doesn’t have the Swiss-made seal of approval) is a good deal; a quick run through some of their most affordable models and you’ll see that the starting price hover around the US$ 1k mark.Obviously geared for a posher market, Mr Biver was quoted to say that it’ll be similar to the , in terms of what it can do, though you shouldn’t in any way compare the two together. “I forbid my colleagues to say Apple is our competitor” – as said by the CEO.The titanium built Carrera inspired Connected will run pretty much like other smartwatches by wirelessly connecting to your smartphone for a wide array of features. On your wrist this 46mm beast will be relatively large when compared to the biggest Apple Watch at 42mm. It might even be larger than the 46mm , as far as we can tell from photos.Ladies, if you’re into the whole smart wearable luxury segment (if that existed prior to this – no we aren’t gonna bother comparing to the US$ 17,000 Apple Watch), the Swiss makers have plans to fashion a smaller version in the future. Admittedly, TAG Heuer have mentioned for the time being, their main market base are for males.Those on the edge of heritage, craftsmanship and tradition who’d want to try out a named smartwatch can give this wearable a go for 2 years; after which, if you decide its not for you, a US$ 1,500 top up will get you a trade-up/in to a traditional mechanical Carrera. Keep in mind that Carreras retail way over US$ 3,000, a worthy bargain if you have the cash to splash.Running on the  platform, you’ll have access to some special watch faces and some dedicated apps to help you with dining options and golf tracking. It’s has a 1.5-inch LCD sapphire glass screen at 360 x 360 resolution and come with 4GB of internal storage. Paying a pretty penny for this smartwatch, it leaves out an important piece that you’d expect to get for its price; an optical heart-rate sensor.Considering you aren’t too bummed out, it does however house a gyroscope, tilt detection sensor, microphone, haptic engine and a 410 mAh battery (that TAG Heuer promises will get you 30 hours of battery-life). With Intel-inside, it’ll run a 1.6GHz dual-core Atom processor mated to 1GB of RAM. For connectivity, there’s Wi-Fi (B/G/N) and Bluetooth 4.0 to pair with your iOS 8 (or higher) device or at least an Android running version 4.3 (and up).Big tech giants  and  both had some part in creating the smartwatch, proving that it could be a formidable time piece.

Most recently,  owners have taken to reddit to voice their concerns and experiences with the device. As we all know, the latest Nexus has glass on the back (a very small part) for its rear camera and other sensors. But what you wouldn’t expect is the rear glass panel suddenly cracking for no reason.First encountered by a reddit user by the name “jonny_rat”, the owner recalls his experience, thus raising some huge concerns about how  went into making these panels. The way jonny pictures it, the device was on a table, unattended and suddenly for no reason the glass just cracked. He isn’t alone as other users have also reported the panel splitting unexpectedly without fault or impact.Here are more photos below for you to take a look:A lot of science goes into the making of these intricate components, especially when you have a manufacturer like Corning involved. Though it’ll be tough to verify if these claims are true, and most importantly if no user error was involved. Until more reports surface or Google/Huawei makes an official statement, we’ll just have to rest on our laurels.These problems highlight a key complication with metal unibody devices, since metal as an element is more reactive to temperatures, humidity and air pressure compared to polycarbonate and other plastics. Huawei’s graceful entry into metal devices (,  and ) and eventual Nexus 6P was bound to bump into some issues along the road, so this wasn’t entirely unexpected.Bend-gate has been a thing since the iPhones and stress testing devices with this forceful (literal) methodology could now be seen as a “standard” for tech enthusiast.

The YouTuber in question took the Nexus 6P to its limits, halving the phablet in the process.Some individuals doubted the authenticity of the video and the way he went upon testing but after releasing a , more people have started to consider that maybe Huawei’s device isn’t as tough as it’s assumed. The news is definitely worrying for potential buyers to know, however a quick  on YouTube will show you people trying the same thing but failing to bend the phones – adding more drama to the whole situation.As users ourselves, it’s painful to watch anyone destroy a piece of tech but it’s nice to know that these people do it so we don’t have to. Let’s hope Huawei and Google explain themselves soon enough (like  did) since Malaysians might get the latest Nexus line by year end. The smartphone industry has to brace themselves as consumers find out new ways to point out design flaws in their products, they’ll either have to toughen up their products or substitute it with a material that can hold up to these tests.Feel free to drop a comment down below regarding any weird experiences with your devices.[ ,  ]"

In essence, Trivoly attaches itself underneath your regular watch, so nothing odd happens to your original timepiece – it does however, pack some great features in its small body.It secures itself on to the underside of your watch via Gecko-tape, a derivative of a suction cup mechanism. Measuring just 3mm thin, you’re likely to notice a bump but not by much. Once placed, it’ll sync up to your smartphone and provide notifications by vibrating or lighting up its LEDs to correspond to your settings. Trivoly’s UI lives inside an app, allowing you to do some great things when you tap around your watch face (actually the side of the disc but it’s all the same).The app lets you personalise your notifications by setting different colours and vibration patterns. There’s also a discreet function to avoid certain interruptions by prioritising the contacts you’ve managed. Inside the disc lives an optical heart rate sensor and accelerometer to support your fitness lifestyle by enabling advanced tracking for exercise on the dedicated app.Other features included are multimedia controls for apps like SONOS, iTunes and Spotify by taping from the top, bottom, left and right – each functioning differently and acting as a remote control of sorts. Lastly, it’ll also act as a wireless picture taking controller; up to 25 feet away, a simple tap will start a countdown timer and after 3 seconds a photo is taken.Hypo allergenic in nature and water resistant, the manufacturer promises the device will give you up to 4 days of battery life. Currently, it supports iPhone 5’s (and up) on iOS 8 or later, as well as Android smartphones that run at least 4.2 (and up).There will be two versions of the Trivoly, as the low end variant doesn’t have the fitness tracker component. At this current time, Trivoly 1 costs US$ 99 (RM 427), while the higher-end Trivoly 2 goes for US$ 129 (RM 556).

Tizen, a Linux based mobile OS that supersedes Samsung’s Bada OS has finally overtaken BlackBerry as the 4th biggest smart phone platform. While we hardly see any Tizen smart phones in our market, Samsung has found significant success in the Indian market.According to IDC’s Q2 2015 smart phone OS , Android dominates the top spot at 82.8%, followed by iOS at 13.9% and Windows Phone nabbing 3rd place at 2.6%. BlackBerry has been declining by the years from 4.9% market share (at #3 spot) back in 2012, to a new low of just 0.3% at 4th place in Q2 2015. IDC has yet to update its Q3 figures, but  has just reported that Tizen has shown tangible growth, propelling itself to overtake the once popular platform known for security. The biggest growth comes from Samsung’s Tizen Z series that’s hugely popular in India. Despite Microsoft inching its way into the affordable segment, the Tizen platform has managed to  in the local budget segment. Similar to Android, Tizen is an open-source platform. In order to entice more app development, Samsung is giving 100% app revenue back to its developers. It was surprising that Tizen had a fighting chance, considering there are ample of cheap Android smart phones in their market. The  came with very low specs for INR 5,700 (about RM373). It gets a basic 4″ WVGA display, an entry level dual-core processor, 768MB of RAM and paltry 3.1MP + VGA cameras. The latest addition is the Samsung Z3 which offers a 5″ HD display, a Quad-Core 1.3GHz processor, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage for a mere INR 8,399 (about RM550). As for BlackBerry, they are hoping to turn their fortunes around as they are making the switch to Android. Being a business focused device, the upcoming  is more expensive than their current BlackBerry Passport, which gives it very little appeal for the masses. In their current predicament, BlackBerry hopes to sell  or they might consider leaving the mobile business altogether. [   ]"

This keyboard may be just what you need,,"apple,battery keyboard,Bluetooth,cool keyboard,Emoji,emoji keyboard,EmojiWork,emojiworks keyboard,Keyboard,Mac,notebook,PC,qwerty keyboard,Tablet,taco,Windows,Wireless,wireless keyboard","Apple,Cool stuff,iOS,Kickstarter,Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Others,Windows Phone",2015-11-04,"Communication began from face to face conversations and has become more of a virtual experience in its current state. No matter in voice, video or text, we’ve all found new ways to get our messages across. Words fly across our screens all the time, especially in our instant messaging apps, but are letters enough? Do they allow individuals to express themselves well? If you feel you’ve always used Emojis more often than just plain text, you should take a look at the keyboard by EmojiWorks’.Usually our access to Emojis face an issue when it comes to PC compatibility, or at least non-mobile devices; unless you get a program that lets you display an on-screen keyboard. The list of these images/Emojis are constantly expanding and our need for them could be just cause they add more life into a conversation.Opening doors and new avenues with the Bluetooth enabled Emoji keyboard, EmojiWorks has begun taking pre-orders for the chiclet based typing slate and it’ll come in 3 options. The base model will get you 47 emojis; the Plus model hands you double, access to more than one skin tone option; the Pro version gets you almost triple the original emojis with 120 icons.These keyboards will come with the latest emoji icons (up to the last refresh) and it’ll be compatible with Apple products (Mac OS X and iOS) and Windows running machines (tablets, and PCs). The basis of having a keyboard would be allowing you to type in QWERTY format, and it gives you the same A-Z plus symbols and functionality as a regular keyboard – it’ll be smaller than most, since it rids itself of the numberpad keys.All three keyboards run on 2 AAA batteries and there’s an EmojiWorks specific software that you’ll have to install to get the emojis on your screen. Starting from US $79.95 (Emoji Keyboard), the mid-range model will cost US$ 89.95, while the top of the line Pro model will be just shy of US$ 100. They begin shipping in December.Has technology derailed the proper meaning of communication, to the point that humans are losing a piece of themselves in the process? Are these emojis merely images that don’t really reflect our actual emotions? Maybe we should backtrack and revert to the most personal way of communicating, at least then we’d all be more genuine. Let us know what you think about this keyboard and its impending affects on human communication in the comments below.[ ,  ]"
Arif Lee,Does having the widest 4G LTE coverage matter to Malaysians?,,"4g,4G LTE coverage,4G LTE network coverage,Celcom,Celcom 4G,coverage,DiGi,DiGi 4G,lte,Mais 4G,Malaysia,Maxis,Maxis 4G,Maxis 4G LTE,network coverage,U Mobile,U Mobile 4G,widest 4g,widest 4G LTE,widest 4G lte coverage,widest coverage","Celcom,Cool stuff,DiGi,HSPA+,Industry in General,LTE,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Players on the Field,Technologies,U Mobile",2015-11-03,"Last month, two telcos made bold claims to have managed to hit at least 50% population coverage for 4G LTE –  (50%) and  (55%). Issuing the who’s better  within a short period, the two have been bitten by a bug to prove who has the true widest 4G LTE network. Question is, when telcos claim to have the widest coverage would you gauge it based on population percentile or percentage of coverage areas? Who sets the standards? And most important of all, does it matter?To get to the bottom of this, we’ll have to set some key definitions first about what 4G LTE is. In a data-driven generation, we all emphasis speed and with that speed comes the necessary technology to support our thirst for it. Malaysians have gotten a taste of 4G LTE in 2013 and were offered by Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile.Referring to the specifications set by the United Nation’s official oversight commission (ITU-R) that monitors information and communication technologies; 4G LTE at its truest () would translate to 100 Mbps on the move, and roughly 1 Gbps when considered locally wireless. At least, in theory that is. Looking around the globe at some of the fastest speeds, none of them break the 40 Mbps mark.Referring to Open Signal’s “” report, these are the top 5 countries with the fastest (average) LTE speeds: New Zealand is the chart topper, posting 36Mbps; Singpore gets runner-up with 33Mbps; Romania surprisingly gets 30Mbps; South Korea gets the 4th spot with 29Mbps; Denmark rounds off the 5th spot with 26Mbps.Since the report refers to data from September, the info is backdated. Interestingly, Open Signal only has a sample size of approx. 300 thousand users – yes, a size quite small when you’re talking global proportions.In retrospect, Malaysian usually see a range of 15Mbps to 30Mbps but there have been instances where you’ll see a spike that actually meets the aforementioned standards. Surpassing and reaching LTE-Advance levels, which puts Maxis at the forefront (for the time being).Both sides will have a valid say, for example, what use would there be if you traveled to a desolated area in some deep jungle in the peninsular or eastwards? It’d be pointless (in a sense) to erect a cell tower in that area, because there wouldn’t be anyone to serve. But at the same time, if anyone were to be placed in that situation, aren’t they supposed to be covered, if their mobile operator is indeed the widest?Taking a look at the playing field, both telcos above (actually the major 4) run on the even platform – two spectrums: 1800GHz and 2600GHz. Ironically when 4G LTE was first rolled out, the iPhone 5 wasn’t able to run on LTE, as all networks were solely running on 2600GHz at the time. Lower bands get you better signal penetration (indoors and outdoors) but higher bands give you faster data speeds.In a race to the top, are telco providers forgetting that unless there is a way to quantify and verify their 4G LTE population coverage, it just simply an unrecognised title to hold? Do they deliver as promised? From our comments on Digi’s and Maxis’ coverage articles, many users are still facing service related issues. They’ve attached  for reference, testing their speeds in claimed areas and disputing them accordingly.For customer experience to be considered, our local telco players tend to knock about the notion of providing the best but are they really delivering? Nationwide, many users have voiced out about drops in cellular quality but we’d rather hear your thoughts; many factors go into objectively testing networks around Malaysia but with our readers coming from all over, we hope to get some feedback and your concerns to your providers and let them address them.Should Malaysian cellular providers bother in claiming the top coverage(s) title? They should first mediate issues that are faced by their users on a day-to-day basis – delivering what users need, consistently giving them the value they paid for in the first place.If we were to take part in a full-blown test that manages to encapsulate the varying telcos and their corresponding ability to cover areas, there would be many puzzles pieces and putting them together would include:Taking a respective number of locations – e.g. over 100 locations nationwide (East Malaysia and West Malaysia)
Using the same device, test the four telcos cellular data coverage
Establish if there is 4G LTE in the area through corresponding symbols on these devices
Test their speeds, take multiple tests on each network and get an average
Find out if these 4G speeds are better than 3G HSPA+ or even lower bands (cause if it isn’t, what’s the point of having the widest 4G coverage?)2G, 3G, 4G and whatever else that goes along with your user experience, it should be maintained across all their offerings, not being better here or coming short on the other. U Mobile has proven that while they were the new player, they’ve established a foothold in their 3G HSPA+ network with 4G-like speeds. We’re sure that users have had moments where nothing can be done on 3G (even with good coverage in that category).We have to start questioning the reasons why our providers are busy worrying about widest and fastest? Users would much prefer something tangible, and at the end of the day if their telcos work for them in their corresponding areas. Throwing marketing fluff here and there does nothing for their consumers.All we want is for our local players to show us why we should be on your network – through user experience, not some coverage map. Beside the fact, being the widest network shouldn’t be an issue, everyone should offer a wide network. Cellular data has become a necessity and our consumers deserve that, at the very least."

If you love pink, the Rose Gold device will be quite limited with not more than 1,000 units to go around. The OPPO R7s that was announced a couple weeks back is the middle child of the R7 family with a 5.5″ Full HD AMOLED display. Positioned as a premium device, the R7s gets a metal alloy unibody design with a smooth 2.5D front glass. It runs on a 64-bit Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor like the rest of its siblings but it gets a generous serving of 4GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage.It gets Dual-SIM slots with both supporting 4G LTE and the 2nd slot also accept microSD cards up to 128GB. For imaging, it has a 13MP f/2.2 main camera with Phase Detection AF while the front gets a large 8MP f/2.4 shooter. Embedded in its metal case is a 3,070mAh battery that supports VOOC Charge. OPPO claims that you can get 2 hours of talk time with just a quick 5 minute charge. Out of the box, it runs on a much improved ColorOS 2.1 that’s based on Android 5.1. So far OPPO Malaysia has yet to reveal its pricing and pre-orders are expected to start in the next couple of days.

Instead of a top spec flagship killing machine, the OnePlus X focuses more on design aesthetics. If you can’t wait for the official sales that come with its annoying invitation system, you can get it now in Malaysia thanks to our local grey importer, DirectD. Likely to be the Onyx version, DirectD is offering the OnePlus X for RM1,299 inclusive of GST. That’s not too shabby considering it retails for US$249 (RM1,069) in the US and 269 Euro (about RM1,255) in Europe. To recap on the specs, the internals are quite similar with the first OnePlus One model except for its smaller screen. The front gets a 5″ Full HD AMOLED display giving a 440 ppi pixel density and it runs on a Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM. Storage wise it packs just 16GB but this time it is expandable with microSD. Like the OnePlus 2, it gets a hybrid dual-SIM slot supporting two SIM cards or alternative 1 SIM plus 1 microSD card. For imaging, the OnePlus X gets a 13MP f/2.2 camera with a single LED flash, while the front gets a 8MP selfie camera. Keeping the lights on is a 2,525mAh battery and it also gets a 3-step alert slider on the sides like the bigger OnePlus 2 sibling. Out of the box, it runs on OxygenOS that’s based on Android 5.1.1. For the price and the specs it offers, it is pretty close to the OnePlus One that’s  at RM1,399 with GST. You get the exact same specs inside plus a larger 5.5″ Full HD screen. However do note that it only comes with a Single SIM slot and it lacks a microSD expansion slot and the new alert slider. If you’re interested, you can order the OnePlus X . Alternatively you can drop by their showroom at Subang Jaya or at their Gadget Mega Store along Federal Highway. According to DirectD, stocks will be available starting today 5th November after 7PM.[  ]"

The Kirin processor lineup by its own HiSilicon subsidiary has finally risen to the occasion and the folks at Qualcomm should really start to worry especially with it its . For instance, the Kirin 920 on the Honor 6 performs almost on par with their high-end Snapdragon 800 series processor.With Samsung currently enjoying the limelight with its epic Exynos 7420 processor, Huawei is attempting to knock them off with its brand new Kirin 950 processor. This new powerhouse is likely to debut on their upcoming . Announced at Beijing today, the Kirin 950 is set to be a game changer. It is manufactured based on a 16nm fab process and it uses 4x high performance ARM Cortex A72 cores that are clocked up to 2.3GHz that’s accompanied by 4x low power Cortex A53 cores at 1.8GHz. Running in a big.LITTLE set up, this helps to optimise the Octa-Core processor to balance between performance and power consumption. As comparison, Samsung’s Exynos 7420 is based on a 14nm process, with 4x Cortex A57 and 4x Cortex A53 while the current Snapdragon 810 is based on 20nm. For graphics, it relies on a Mali-T880 GPU and there’s also a little i5 co-processor as well. In terms of performance it does look promising as the preliminary Antutu benchmark scored over 80,000 points, surpassing the likes of the Galaxy Note 5 and the .

To cater for your future flagship needs, it will support  and 4G LTE-A connectivity as well. Overall it does look very promising and out of nowhere, HiSilicon is looking like a compelling rival to Samsung’s high-end Exynos processors. Of course the Korean semiconductor division won’t be standing still and they are expected to reveal a newer processor ahead of its upcoming Galaxy S7. [    ]"
Arif Lee,HTC One E9+ Review: Slimmed down but still worthy,,,,2015-11-05,

Oddly, the  looks to be a  on the inside, just taking a hit in battery and screen size, while adding some notable features and aesthetics. Unfortunately, Shenzhen’s “finest” have decided to deploy the same notorious invite system but there’s an improvement.The X runs their home-grown Oxygen OS based on Android 5.1.1 and there are two materials that differentiate the pair; Onyx and Ceramic. Making the device smaller, this time 5-inches, it carries an AMOLED display with a FHD resolution and has Gorilla Glass 3 plastered on top for protection.Repeating the usage of the Snapdragon 801 on their latest device, it’ll see only 32-bit processing, something that was acceptable on the OnePlus One but causes some concern looking at the latest crop of devices popping up. Continuing the trend, it has the same amount of RAM too, 3GB; which in this day and age, still holds up fine, though there’s only 16GB of expandable internal storage. In the past none of their models had a microSD slot, so this might mean that OnePlus could include expandability in the future devices.Changing it up this time around, they’ve added a hybrid dual-SIM functionality, that gives you networks up to 4G LTE but keep in mind you’ll have to do without one SIM slot for your expandable storage. Its rear camera lens is a 13-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 aperture sensor, while the front gets an 8-megapixel selfie shooter. All the power is provided by a 2,525 mAh battery and there’s the same three tier alert slider found on the higher-end OnePlus Two.The Onyx version retails for US$ 250 (RM 1,076) and the Ceramic version goes for around US$ 400 (RM 1,721). Only the former is sold in the States but otherwise they retail in the same countries worldwide. Sales will start in India on November 5th using the invite system but only for a month, after which it’ll be available for purchase without strings attached – this strategy will be mimicked across all continents.  No word when the device will hit Malaysian shores but it has already been spotted on , so you can anticipate it to arrive by year’s end.We don’t think the Flagship Killer 2016 was a killer at all, the company which at first was painstakingly trying to keep up with demands of some 2 million reservations, may have left customers waiting too long; they probably opted for other devices by now, seeing a sudden surge of flash sales and our own Maxis selling the device  without an invitation needed. Can OnePlus last long enough to put out their version of the 2017 Flagship Killer?[ ,  ]"

The display does Full HD resolution in 16:9 aspect ratio, which gives it a rather low 119ppi (pixels per inch). Since it is focused as a video consumption device, it also gets a pair of stereo speakers and underneath it runs on a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM. On-board it gets either 32GB or 64GB of storage with the option to add more via a microSD slot.For video conference purposes, it has a 2.1MP front facing camera and if you need to use it while on the go, it has a 5,700mAh battery that’s rated to last 8 hours of video playback. There’s also Bluetooth 4.1, WiFi 802.11ac and a NanoSIM slot (LTE Version) for your connectivity needs. While it is considered a portable Android device, the Galaxy View is quite a heft at 2.65kg and overall it is 11.9mm thick. The kickstand doesn’t seem to be foldable but Samsung still claims that it is versatile for either a stand mode or typing mode, when placed lying down. The Galaxy View runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop but the interface is said to be a video-centric one that primarily showcases video content. If we can sum this up, this is basically a tablet+TV hybrid.

Even with TM’s new Unifi plans that offer , many had frown upon the removal of its cheaper 5Mbps option at RM149/month. For those with the need for speed, it can get ridiculously expensive. Maxis offers  for a colossal RM398/month. Alternatively, TIME is also  at a cheaper RM179/month but it comes with a 100GB cap. Is there a way for Malaysians to get faster speeds at lower prices? A Singaporean broadband company wants to make it possible when it comes to Malaysia. MyRepublic that’s based in Singapore has caused quite a stir by offering 1Gbps of fibre internet for as low as S$49/month (about RM150) during its debut. It was a deal you can’t refuse as the other players were charging as high as S$395/month (about RM1215) for the same speed. It didn’t take too long before the existing incumbents started slashing prices to match MyRepublic’s offering. Even today, MyRepublic is offering  for home users at only S$59.99 (about RM185) per month. On top of that, they are also coming up as the  in Singapore, with unlimited high speed quota. Apart from Singapore, they are also in  offering as high as 1Gbps at NZ$89.99/month (about RM261). As reported by , MyRepublic is planning to enter Malaysia with the ambition to offer 100Mbps connectivity for around RM60-RM70 a month. Its CEO Malcolm Rodrigues wants to be very disruptive in the market and they are eager to take up the disruptor role in our local scene. The timing however depends on our regulatory environment, and they are looking forward for TM to open up its network access by 2016. At the moment, other fibre broadband players such as Maxis and P1 are tapping onto the same HSBB network as TM but they are basically wholesale deals which isn’t ideal for MyRepublic. In their expansion into Malaysia and other markets, they had , who is the former CEO of P1 and TM Net. Can MyRepublic disrupt our local broadband scene? 100Mbps at RM60/month sounds insane especially when TM charges double for a mere 1Mbps ADSL service. If Maxis could deliver  from as low as RM118/month, undercutting TM’s UniFi service on the same network, it won’t be surprising. Like most new ventures, they could offer broadband below cost just to rake the numbers in.

In terms of specs, Huawei is keeping most of the details well under wraps but it is speculated that they would be fitting its latest Kirin 950 processor that’s going to be unveiled this Thursday. According to , the Kirin 950 appears to be a serious powerhouse outdoing the Samsung Exynos 7420 chipset by 20% in Multi-core and 30% in Single-core tests on GeekBench.

Since the camera’s photos will be taking up most of your memory, Microsoft added a microSD slot allowing you to expand it up to an additional 200GB.Microsoft’s (actually Nokia’s) PureView camera is again touted to make waves, with its 20-megapixel f/1.9 aperture sensor.

Other than its USB Type-C charging port, you can also make use of its Qi Wireless charging but the cable method will get you a quicker charger at 50% of battery in 30 minutes – claimed during the presentation.For connectivity, you’ll get 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE. Based on SIRIM, we’ll be getting the dual-SIM variant. The Lumia 950 is set to go on sale in the States soon, and will go for US$ 549 (RM 2,367) – if you were looking for a price range that helps indicate Malaysian pricing, you’ve got it.That said, at that price, consumers might look elsewhere, opting for devices from named power houses; if you were to spend a little extra. Photo-centric users might still give it a shot but we’ll just have to see what the device has to offer once it goes on sale. Let us know what you think so far of the new Lumia 950, does it stand a chance?"

Alexander Wong,Huawei Mate S: Can Huawei play the premium game?,,"Android,Dual Sim,first impressions,huawei,Huawei Mate S,Huawei Mate S First Impressions,Huawei Mate S Hands-on,Huawei Mate S Malaysia","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-27,"Huawei is certainly a brand to watch out for as they are rising to the occasion with some compelling smart phones these days. On the Huawei P8, they had elevated their build quality perceptions with a premium unibody metal design, but it isn’t as refined as its mainstream rivals. Perception isn’t built overnight but more consumers are beginning to accept the new wave of alternatives coming from China.To show the world what they are capable of, Huawei had recently announced the , a premium device that eyes for the likes of the Galaxy Note 5 and the iPhone 6S Plus. Can they deliver? Read on to find out.At first glance, it looks like a bigger honor 7 with a full metal back that comes with a subtle curve. Upon picking it up, you’ll notice the finer details and the silky smooth surfaces that are nice to touch. Their previous P8 flagship was solid in the hands but the Mate S adds more refinement to the mix. At 7.2mm thin, it is slightly thicker than an iPhone 6s at the thickest point, but the sloping back gives a thinner feeling device at your fingertips. Looking towards the bottom, it shares the similar design as the Huawei P8 and the honor 7, with twin speaker/mic grills on each side of the micro USB port. On the left, you’ll find a dual-SIM tray slot, which is a hybrid one that accepts microSD.The volume buttons and power button are neatly placed on the right for easy reach but we felt that the power button could be larger for the perfect feel. The 5.5″ Full HD screen dominates the front with minimal clutter as it uses on-screen buttons for navigation. During its global launch, the Mate S was Huawei’s first smart phone to feature a “Force Touch” display that’s pressure sensitive but it isn’t present in our current unit. That apparently it reserved for its higher-spec model that comes with 128GB of storage.Underneath, the Huawei Mate S shares a lot of similarities with the honor 7. It runs on a high-end Kirin 935 Octa-Core 64-bit processor (2.2GHz x4, 1.5GHz x4) that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. On-board the mate S comes with 64GB of storage for Malaysia and it is expandable up to 128GB using microSD. With EMUI 3.1 that runs on top of Android 5.1.1, it runs rather smoothly without any hesitation so far.For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP camera with a 4-colour RGBW sensor that’s assisted by dual-LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation. Similar to the P8, it gets a variety of modes including Light Painting features. The Mate S gets a new Professional Mode that offers full manual settings for extra tweaks on ISO, Manual Focus, Exposure and AWB.For taking selfies, the front gets a 8MP camera that even comes with a soft flash light for brighter looking selfies. Despite being a 2015 flagship, the main camera doesn’t support 4K videos, shooting a maximum of up to Full HD 1080p.The single down facing speaker is quite loud but the biggest feature for audio has got to be its recording capabilities. The Mate S has 3 mics in total which can be used simultaneously to record a meeting conversation with individual attendee tagging, similar to the Galaxy Note 4. In the battery department, it packs a 2,700mAh capacity unit which is slightly more than the P8 by a slight margin.Unlocking the Mate S is rather quick with its rear mounted fingerprint scanner. It unlocks instantly with a touch and it does more than just securing the device. Similar to the honor 7, you can swipe downwards to view notification. On top of that, it performs double duty as a touch pad scroller in the image gallery as well as a remote trigger when taking pictures using both main and selfie cameras.Despite not having a pressure sensitive display, the Mate S still gets a decent amount of gesture features. Apart from the usual tap to wake, it has an improve Knuckle Sense technology that lets you screen capture or crop using your knuckles. Huawei has improved it further with a quick app launch feature where you can draw a “c” using your knuckle to launch the camera or “e” to open a browser.At RM2,698, the Huawei Mate S is also the most expensive smart phone and it goes neck to neck with the Galaxy Note5 that’s priced at RM2,699. For a quick comparison, the Mate S has the upper hand with double the storage at 64GB along with the option to add more with a microSD slot. However the Note5 offers more in specs including a faster processor, more RAM, faster camera and also a productive S Pen. If performance and productivity is what you’re looking for, it is tough to recommend the Mate S over the Galaxy Note5. The decision is even tougher considering the similar spec’ed albeit the smaller screen honor 7 can be have for just RM1,399. However if you’re looking for a stylish and premium alternative that isn’t a Samsung or an Apple, the Mate S could be something worth checking out."

A quick 10 minute charge claims to provide up to 7 hours of usage. As supported natively on Android Marshmallow, the Nexus 6P has a fingerprint scanner at the back which gets better with every repeated use. In terms of audio, the Nexus 6P packs a pair of stereo speakers, and 3 microphones for noise cancellation. In terms of price, do expect to pay quite a premium for the Nexus 6P. In the US, it is priced at US$499 (about RM2,124) while in Australia, it is priced from A$899 (about RM2,799) for the 32GB version."

Among their successful launches, the latest would be the , in  and the  in a partnership with . Can they break the stigma associated with Chinese manufacturers? Backed by the Huawei , they just might.Targeting a new market, as compared to its predecessor, it was launched at  with “Force Touch”, we won’t be getting that 128GB model but nonetheless, the Mate S is no one trick pony. It boasts a 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) AMOLED display and a familiar combination makes its way underneath the metal-only outer layer of the device; a Kirin 935 Octa-core processor, mated to 3GB of RAM. There will also be 64GB of internal memory, while its expandable through the hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slots (up-to 128GB).Its photographs are taken by a 13-megapixel RGBW rear camera equip with OIS and dual-LED flash; the front however gets an 8-megapixel shutter with an f/2.4 aperture and a single LED flash. Huawei’s signature rear fingerprint scanner is included here too for an alternative option for biometric security.In terms of software, Knuckle Sense gets an update, now version 2.0 and as per usual, allows you to interact differently through your knuckles in the form of double-tapping or drawing symbols. You’ll also notice EMUI 3.1 skinned over Android 5.1 Lollipop on the device.A 2,700 mAh battery fits inside the 156gram smartphone and will be available in two colour options, Prestige Gold and Coral Pink. The Mate S makes a big price jump as the newest edition to the Mate lineup; retracing back to the launch price of the Ascend Mate 7, it went for RM 1,999 during its launch. But, for the price you pay, Huawei wants to make it worth your money by adding these perks:And depending how early you decide to buy the device, the more you’ll get in return.Lest we forget, you’ll have to fork out RM 2,698 (w/ GST) for the Mate S, so be warned and make sure you have enough money in the bank. Having felt the device in our , we can say that the chamfered edges with 2.5D glass and metal build might be just enough make you favour the Mate S.Utilising the classic, oh “by the way” we have another (two) product(s) to show you technique, Huawei also launched the  today, a good-looking mid-ranger that just supplements the theory of the manufacturer playing the premium game; along with their new flagship tablet, the .The former is a also a 5.5-incher with a FHD display (1920 x 1080) and has the same 2.5D glass edged glass but has a slightly less metal make at 90% composition. Fittingly as a mid-ranger, it has a 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, coupled with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage (expandable).For imaging, the G8 gets a 28mm wide-angle 13-megapixel sensor on the rear and a 5-megapixel lens on the front. Akin to the Mate S, the more affordable G8 also has a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot but has a larger 3,000 mAh battery. Mirroring its big brother, it also has EMUI 3.1 on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop for its operating system.Onto the largest of the trio, the Huawei MediaPad M2 8.0, that as the name suggests, has an 8-inch screen with the same FHD resolution (1920 x 1080). Under the hood, it houses a 64-bit Octa-core 2GHz Kirin 930 chipset and for multitasking and app switching, there’s 2GB of RAM.As a tablet, the readily available 32GB might be a stretch but at least there’s a microSD slot for expandability.  An 8-inch device being used to take photos might be a sight for sore eyes but if you really need to, there’s an 8-megapixel rear camera; used more practically for video calling a 2-megapixel sensor will be on the front.Touted to “amplify your excitement” the tablet will offer a seamless audio experience, thanks to its side-facing dual speaker set-up. Utilising Clari-Fi technology and Super Wide Sound 2.0 by Harman Kardon, the brand promises to immerse you with 180-degree surround sound.Wrapping up, the tablet will have 4,800 mAh of battery to keep the 310gram device running and it’ll also have a single 4G LTE slot for cellular connectivity. The G8 and MediaPad M2 8.0 both retail for RM 1,499 (w/ GST) and are available in these colour options: Grey or Silver – G8 and Gold – MediaPad M2 8.0.The two smartphones will be available from today onwards, and be sold across all Huawei stores nationwide but you’ll have to wait till late November to get your hands on the tablet.

Doc Brown for one would surely reserve a “Great Scott!” for moments like these. The makers said that “in light of the increasing demands in the mid-range segments,  is bringing on its renowned One series”. Does it make the cut, a full 4 quarters later?It’s been 10 months since we saw the One M8 EYE on ‘s listing, leading us to believe it would’ve been launched in timely fashion but we guess 10 months was short enough for the smartphone manufacturer. Essentially, the same metal-clad flagship (One M8) but receiving some changes in the camera department on the rear. So that removes the infamous Ultrapixel Duo Camera on the back, replacing the mediocre main camera with a 13-megapixel lens. The front is maintained at a 5-megapixel lens.Everything else about the device is the same. To recap, the device is a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display, it runs a 2.3GHz Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, and is coupled with 2GB of RAM. There is also just 16GB of internal storage but that’s easily mediated with the available microSD slot. Offering one of the most distinctive audio experiences, the typical HTC BoomSound speakers are present here too.Although a latecomer, it still has 4G LTE available in the form of a nano SIM slot and runs Sense 6 on top of Android 5.0. It also comes with a 2,600 mAh battery to keep it running. Priced at RM 1,399 (w/ GST) it could possibly still give other devices a run for the money; but then again, it’s a year old. If you’d like to pick it up, head over to a major retailer to take a closer look at the Gunmetal Grey version.Would you bother?"

This came to light as Facebook Engineer  has admitted a couple of battery related issues but he assures that a fix is on its way.There are 2 reasons why this is happening. The first issues is what he calls as a CPU Spin within their network code. Basically it is a repeated process in the background which uses more power than usual. The second problem is how the Facebook app handles audio playback. If you leave Facebook after watching a video, the audio is muted but the session is still active in the background. While it appears that nothing is happening, it continues to consume power in the background.Ari Grant had also assured that the battery issue is not caused by their optional Location history feature.

Their latest venture in question is field-testing Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) on their 4G LTE network.
Boldly claiming to provide the , capable of connecting every 1 in 2 Malaysians, Digi seeks to add more value to their services by adding VoLTE to their repertoire. Data speeds have forever been a topic of discussion amongst Malaysians, especially those who rely on their smartphones.But have we forgotten that phones were made for us to actually talk to each other? Well having said, there hasn’t been a large emphasis on call quality, since the whole experience has been fairly satisfactory, albeit some drop calls every now and then. With VoLTE these issues might soon be a thing of the past, resolving it by delivering voice calls over the 4G data network.Currently “sedentary” to be made over 2G and 3G networks, imagine having voice calls through 4G networks – will there be a difference, you ask? Ever been in an LRT and your coach is screaming away and you can’t hear the person on the other end? Well in theory, VoLTE will transmit high fidelity audio and add noise cancellation features to your calls. That means a lot more talking/listening and a lot less shouting/closing one ear to hear clearly.VoLTE will also allow users to bridge the gap of internet use while active in a voice call; giving you 4G LTE speeds whilst in both uses. Presently, you’d notice that your network switches from 4G to 2G/3G when making a call? Yup, that’s the clear example. Another benefit would be faster connection to the other end, possibly 2-3 times faster to get you connected to the person you’re calling.Digi implementation of testing is already happening behind the scenes and their subscribers can expect to make use of the better call quality on their 4G LTE enabled-smartphones next year. 2G and 3G voice calls are still enabled after the launch of VoLTE for whoever has a non-4G LTE device. Head on over  to take a look at how call quality is improved using different voice-over technologies.Drop us a comment below to tell us what you’ve experience while talking on your device, especially when it concerns call quality and dropped calls."

It also states that there will be 3GB of RAM, together with 32GBs of internal memory; expandable up to 2TB (when the card exists) through microSD.On the rear there’s an 18-megapixel Schneider-Kreuznach sensor with Phase Detection Auto Focus, dual-flash LEDs and also OIS. There’s apparently a 2-megapixel shutter up front as well but there was no mention on the website when it was .A 3,410 mAh battery will power up the Android BlackBerry PRIV (sorry, it was so weird saying that) and they promise 22.5 hours of mixed usage but if you run out quickly there’s fast charging features to save you.

Both of which lead the pack way before Apple decided to hitch a ride on the same train. We could go on about what came first but do they get the credit? We feel that limelight stealing in general will continue forever.A leaked photo has given HTC executives some powerful ammunition to hand down to their underlings:Whether the market reacts positively or otherwise, we’ll have to wait but HTC is surely embracing all the free advertisement it’s getting. One thing we can be sure of is that the Taiwanese manufacturer will continue to stick to the design on the One A9; as quoted by Tong, it’ll eventually spill over to their top of the line M and Desire models.[ , , , ,  ]"

The 2nd screen is an always on 2.1″ screen with a 160×1040 pixels resolution. Like the Galaxy Note Edge, the secondary display gives you a view of notification, status updates and even shortcuts to your favourite apps.Design wise, the V10 body is reinforced by a SAE grade 316L stainless steel DuraGuard frame while the back and bottom has a softer material that could withstand scratches. In typical LG fashion, it has the power and volume rocker mounted at the back, underneath its main camera.

While usage of smartphones are usually for texting and social media, navigation would be the second thing that comes to mind. So what about driving? Your eyes are supposed to be peeled on the road, but we all still want access to our GPS and speedometer. Here’s when HUDWAY Glass, a universal vehicle accessory comes into the picture.Car mounts for smartphones save half the trouble but you’ll still be driving blind every time you make a glance at your navigation screen. Some luxury cars readily include these digitals augmented reality displays but the cars themselves, cost a bomb. HUDWAY on the other hand, costs only US$ 49 (RM 211).

The team plans to add these functionalities to the HUD display if they manage to hit their stretch goals:In Malaysia, our always sunny days might impair the clarity of the display (or rather your phone’s display reflected). So driving during the daytime while having the HUDWAY on your dashboard, you might not see everything clearly, but larger objects shouldn’t be an issue. Another problematic issue would be your phone overheating due to direct sunlight from being on the dashboard; they’ve put out frankly that this might be a problem and their accessory is passive, so there won’t be any temperature sensors or cooling elements.Let us know what you think of the HUDWAY dashboard car accessory, is it worth it?[  ]"

Meanwhile at the front, it has a hint of a Samsung Galaxy with smooth edges and a home button which also doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. In terms of specs, the front gets a 5″ Full HD AMOLED display that’s toughen with Gorilla Glass 4. The front looks cleaner and disappointingly it lacks HTC’s trademark BoomSound front stereo speakers that we liked a lot. Instead it opts for a single down firing speaker that’s similar to the iPhone 6s/Galaxy S6. Under the hood, it runs on Qualcomm’s newer 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 617 processor, with a choice of either 2GB RAM with 16GB storage, or a higher-spec 3GB RAM and 32GB storage version. If you need more, storage is still expandable with microSD up to 2TB. For imaging, the back camera is a 13MP f/2.0 unit that’s assisted by Optical Image Stabilisation. It supports RAW shooting with one touch enhancement and there’s also a hyperlapse feature to speed up or slow down your action videos. At the front, it still retains HTC’s 4MP f/2.0 Ultrapixel unit for brighter selfies in low light conditions.Despite its shortfall on external speakers, the One A9 compensates by having a HiFi DAC built-in. This delivers 24-bit/192KHz Hi-Res Audio with Dolby Audio™ Surround technology for better enjoyment with some quality headphones plugged-in. On top of that, the One A9 runs on the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box and HTC pledges to update the software within 15 days after the Nexus lineup gets them. In typical HTC fashion, it gets a smaller than average battery at 2,150mAh that supports Quick Charge 2.0. On the spec sheet, it mentions that  will be compatible once it is available officially.

Overall, this isn’t a flagship to challenge the likes of the Galaxy S6 or the Xperia Z5.

This minor annoyance has been fixed with the new iOS 9.1 which is rolling out now to current iOS 9 devices.

More so when it looks almost identical despite some contrasting characteristics.Under all that premium metal sits a Kirin 935 Octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM and if those words ring a bell, you’re right if you said that it’s the exact same combo found on the honor 7. The full line includes a 32GB and 128GB version but here we’ll get the gap between, a 64GB model that supports a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE/microSD slot up to 128GB.Flipping the phone over, you’ll see a 13-megapixel RGBW rear camera with OIS and a dual-LED flash module. Move over on to the front and there will be an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor greeting you for all your selfie needs.Unique to only the P8 previously, Knuckle Sense makes a return, now updated to a 2.0 version. A feature that is able to tell the difference between your finger tips and your knuckles; handing you extra gestures by double-tapping or drawing letters to give access to app functionality.Juicing its engine is a 2,700 mAh battery that has quick charge on board. The Mate S also has a fingerprint scanner under the rear camera module if you prefer biometric security to the usual PIN/password settings. All packaged in an overall weight of 156g that runs Huawei’s own EMUI 3.1 skin over Android 5.1 Lollipop. The device will be available in two colour options – Prestige Gold and Coral PinkTo be fair to Huawei, Apple’s crème de la crème  has also seen a huge price difference that increases every model, so maybe you can’t put all the blame on the Chinese smartphone maker. Maybe its just the fact that once a brand is recognised for something, it’s hard to shake off and Huawei has always been relatively affordable.Moving with the times isn’t a bad thing but they’ve thrown in some extras to get you on the Mate S team. The list below details what you’ll get together with your new phone:If you jump onboard before the 3,000 mark, they’ll even hand you a bespoke Pewter Membership Card from Royal Selangor; allowing you to be worry free and skip any line at any Huawei Exclusive Service Centres. Too busy to head over? You can also arrange for a delivery and pick-up option for your device’s servicing. Those who want to join the party earlier, or first 1,000 to be precise, will get a complimentary Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) earphones by Huawei.Rounding up, the brand has added some great perks if you purchase the device early but is that enough to convince you? The Huawei Mate S at RM 2,698 makes the  a value-buy or does it? Let us know in the comments below.[  ]"
Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S7 might launch in January 2016. Here’s what to expect,,"3D Touch,Android,force touch,Project Lucky,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Launch,Samsung Galaxy S7 Rumours,USB Type C","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-10-20,"With the  and  out of the way, Samsung is undoubtedly working full force on next year’s flagship, the Galaxy S7. At the moment, Samsung is leading the Android pack, with benchmark crushing performance and finally a premium build utilising metal and glass materials.So what will Samsung do next for the first half of 2016? Based on what we’ve heard so far, they are introducing a couple of new features to widen its gap against its competitors. For starters, the Galaxy S7 is expected to use USB Type C, a reversible cable connector that’s supposedly a future standard. Not only it allows faster rapid charge, it also provides faster data transfers even when compared to USB 3.0. New flagships like the OnePlus 2, Lumia 950/950XL and Nexus 5X/6P have already adopted this connector standard and we should be seeing more of these in 2016. The  has it and so does the latest . It was recently revealed that Samsung has patented a  that’s similar to 3D Touch. This allows it to differentiate the amount of force being applied onto the screen, based on corresponding voltage. From the illustrations above, the feature allows multi purpose input such as alternating between space/tab and apply upper case when a key is pressed with extra force. It is possible that Samsung might introduce this on their future flagships, and it may or may not be the Galaxy S7. The Exynos 7420 processor on the Galaxy S6/Note5 is a proven workhorse, churning out insane benchmark figures yet maintaining frugal battery consumption. For next year, Samsung is rumoured to release the Galaxy S7 with up to  variants. The Exynos 7422 which was earlier rumoured for the Galaxy Note5 will is expected to power India based units while a newer Exynos 8890 (also known as the Exynos M1) will find its way to Korea, Japan and European markets. Given a pass for Samsung’s 2015 flagships, Qualcomm appears to be making a come back with a Snapdragon 820 processor. The Snapdragon 820 variant is said to be fitted for China and US bound units. So far there’s no mention of what we’re getting in the South East Asian region. For imaging, the 16MP shooter on the Galaxy Note5/S6 remains unchanged since the Galaxy Note 4. To bring its photography capabilities to the next level, Samsung could be upgrading to a higher 20MP camera that utilises Samsung’s own ISOCELL sensor. Word also has it that it could carry a dual-camera set up, similar to the HTC One M9+.With the Apple iPhone 6s/6s Plus being announced in September, Samsung had brought forward its Galaxy Note5 launch to August, ahead of its traditional September IFA launch. This gave Samsung an early head start to build up its sales momentum before the iDevices go to market. For 2016, it appears that Samsung might announce the Galaxy S7 as early as January instead of its usual February/March timeline in conjunction with Mobile World Congress. Similar to its current Galaxy S6, there would be two models – SM-G930 and SM-G935 which carry a standard and a dual-curved display. January is just 3 months away. So if you’re planning to get a new flagship smart phone, would you just grab the Galaxy Note5 or wait for the next big thing?[ , ,  ]"

Under the hood, you’ll get a 1.8GHz Hexa-core Snapdragon 808, coupled with 3GB of RAM for all your processing needs. The manufacturer’s decision to stray away from the top of the line Qualcomm chipset would point to not wanting to have the burden of dealing with the heating issues that have plagued other smartphone makers.Although it has an option for a MicroSD card (up to 128GB), the base model has 16GB on board, while there’s a 32GB and 64GB variant as well; no word on which we’ll be receiving here.

It boils down to if you’re going to be disciplined enough to travel back to our neighbours down south for your warranty, if anything were to happen to your Apple product. For scalpers, its mainly down to luck, or if you purchase from places like Lazada, we’ll hope that they fulfill their end of providing warranty coverage.Then you have those who’d rather wait for the storm to end and get their devices hand-delivered to them while in their comforts of their homes.

Obviously having the company’s optics guy talk to you about how the camera performs isn’t exactly the best way to deliver a product without some favouritism but let’s see the photos first.While the post was fairly in-depth, it probably explored the parts where the Lumia shined – 5 photos in different lighting situations and highlighting different aspects of the phones cameras’ features. Listing out the bare specs of the cameras;Going off a limb by saying that the cameras has the same dynamic range as an SLR and “HDR is rarely needed”. Alakarhu adds on another paragraph how the Lumias are unmatched in low-light shots and how much of the difference the 5 gen OIS and large aperture makes in the images. In the low-light shot, two photos are compared, one from a competitor looking extremely grainy/noisy and the other looking much better.He then talks explains the Rich Capture mode, a feature that takes two exposure moments for the same image – taking in the short for any movements and the long for whatever is stationary. If it works as promised, it’ll allow you to tweak the amount of light in a shot, whilst using flash too. For flashes it’ll take one with and one without, while the three tone flash will appropriately balance out the colour balance to produce a more real life characteristics.It’ll be hard to say if there was any post-production touch-ups done on these images, though for the third photograph, Alakarhu does state that an external reflector and lighting were used for this image.Windows 10 will be on these devices, and they’ll have Continuum compatibility once hooked up to the Display Dock, shown . Time will tell if Windows Phones can resurrect the name of (Nokia) Lumias.
Stay tune, cause once its available we’ll probably have another camera shootout together with the Sony Xperia Z5.[ ,  ]"
Arif Lee,The only Laptop Killer that you should avoid,,"Dark Purple,Killer,malware,security researcher,spy,USB,USB Killer,USB Killer Dark Purple,Virus","Industry in General,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices",2015-10-16,"Possible aspirations from spy agencies have led a Russian security researcher to cook up a USB Killer; a device that fries your PCs instantaneously after being plugged in. A worthy companion for anyone that might need to rid their devices of incriminating data in a jiffy.Created by the researcher known as “Dark Purple”, this USB stick comes in the form of a regular USB thumb drive but in no way does it store bytes. This cyber weapon sends 220 volts through its USB interface to your plugged device shorting your whole circuit before you can say “destroyed.”The interface of the USB Killer can be switched to act as a malware stick but that removes the spy element from it, self-destructing would have more appeal for sure. Info from a blog post by the man himself, claimed that his creation could permanently impair “almost any equipment” as long as it had a USB slot – crippling newer TVs, routers, modems and the works.Little to no details have cropped up except for the aforementioned amount of voltage it sends through the USB circuit, or discharges the capacitor quickly. Fresh news crops up after its initial time of fame in March but there’s now a video showing the device being used on the researchers own laptop.The Russian ends by saying that although it seems like the laptop he was using is now “dead” it’ll be brought back to life once a simple motherboard switch is made. So the likeliness of the hard drive being affected is slim at best; why bother then if it only disables the motherboard and not wiping data in the process?Nonetheless, it’ll still keep users cautious not to simply plug in random USB thumb drives lying around.[ , ,  ]"

Again toying with the notion of launching a smart phone, the new site reads “A breakthrough device enhanced with Unifi” with the claim of providing the best broadband experience for your device.Scrolling further down, the page emphasises on 3 things – unlimited experience, unmatched choices and unbeatable value. In terms of current Unifi broadband, we are still getting unlimited quotas and this is expected to remain unchanged for the time being. As for choices, we’ve seen TM introducing more HyppTV channels and  that offer faster download speeds for less. Is TM going to respond to the competition with even faster speeds and affordable subscription? We really hope to see that this coming Thursday. What’s interesting is the area of Mobility as shown above. TM has the spectrum to operate a 4G LTE telco but we feel it is too soon for them to go live at this point of time. Furthermore, the site has been consistently talking about broadband rather than a mobile network. Perhaps it is an extended internet services from its TMgo 4G LTE broadband or its newly acquired P1 subsidiary that runs on WiMAX.

Alexander Wong,TM refreshes its broadband offering with new Unifi ADVANCE PLAN,,"All new Unifi,HSBB,TM HSBB,TM Unifi,Unifi,UniFi ADVANCE PLAN,Unifi BIZ ADVANCE PLAN","Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-10-15,"Today marks a change at TM with a new website and refresh of its high speed broadband offering. Branding wise, the Unifi logo remains unchanged since its inception but its online presence has been revamped with a store-like design for easier online application. With calls for faster and cheaper broadband, TM has revised its broadband offering with its new Unifi ADVANCE PLAN which claims to pack the best value in the industry.For starters, the new Unifi home plans come in just 2 options – 30Mbps and 50Mbps. This essentially is the same “new” plans  but with reduced subscription fees. The TM Unifi ADVANCE PLAN with 30Mbps is offered at RM179/month instead of RM199/month, and if you need 50Mbps, it can be yours for RM229/month (before GST).By default, you get HyppTV as standard which comes with HyppTV Aneka or HyppTV Varnam Pack for free. You also get a DECT Phone bundled in but calls are now charged separately at 20 sen/min to all local numbers including mobile. For those needing unlimited calls to fixed lines like its former VIP plans, you can opt for the Voice Pack that costs RM20/month. In terms of speed, the 30Mbps plan gives you 30Mbps download while uploads are at 5Mbps. For RM50/month extra, you get 50Mbps download with a faster uplink of 10Mbps. So if you’re an existing VIP 10 customer enjoying 10Mbps for both download and upload, your next upgrade should be the ADVANCE PLAN with 50Mbps download and 10Mbps. Essentially you’re getting 5x the download speed while the upload speed remains unchanged. TM insists that its Unifi packages are competitively priced against its competitors. With Maxis jumping onto the fibre broadband business, it had caused a stir with its cheaper 10Mbps offering from as low as RM128/month. When compared on the same speed of 30Mbps, Unifi appears to pack more value considering it includes HyppTV and you get a fixed line with the option for unlimited calls at RM20/month.For enterprise users, they have a similar offering with its Unifi BIZ ADVANCE PLAN. The base 30Mbps plan with Dynamic IP starts at RM259/month (Normal: RM299/month) and you have the option to upgrade to 50Mbps at RM50/month extra. There’s also Simple Voice Plus Plan for free fixed line calls at RM30/month and there are more add-ons for MS Office, POS systems and surveillance services. Like the Home plans, the 30Mbps offering comes with 5Mbps upload while the 50Mbps option gets 10Mbps upload. Strangely TM has removed its lower 5Mbps, 10Mbps and 20Mbps Unifi packages of old. While the new Unifi ADVANCE PLANS might offer higher speeds for less, it doesn’t really address the concerns of affordable broadband. When we did a , it seems that the 30Mbps/50Mbps plans have limited coverage areas and if you’re not covered, it suggests that you take up Streamyx instead. Perhaps they should consider introducing a cheaper 5Mbps option without the extra bells and whistles instead.For more information, head over to the new ."

The  will be available in Malaysia officially this Friday, 16th October at 12:00AM. If you’re looking to buy one on contract, it is available from all 4 telcos namely Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. This is the fastest iPhone 6s roll out yet for Malaysia and it is also the most extensive in terms of contract options.With U Mobile coming into the picture, they have shaken things up a little with its lower commitment plans and an interesting Microcredit financing option. For Maxis, it still retains the same iValue Plan offering that comes with bundled calls, text and SMS. However for those who make lots of phone calls, they are also making its MaxisONE Plan available as well. Celcom on the other hand has the simplest approach with just 3 FIRST plan options that come with its OPTIMISER feature. Last but not least is Digi where they are bundling the iPhone 6s with their new SmartPlan that can be have with either more data or more voice and SMS. In terms of contract duration, majority of the plans are on 24 months with exception for Maxis and Digi where they do have 12 months option for selected plans. So which telco should you go for? We’ve gathered the plans and device pricing from all 4 telcos for your easy reference. Check them out after the break.For consistency, we compared the permanent non-promo bundles from each plan with its pricing without the 6% GST. Do note that the above minimum cost of ownership is just a guide and it is based on the assumption that you don’t incur additional usage on top of what has been included with the plan. On Maxis, they are giving 1GB extra for 6 months on its highest MaxisOne 188 plan. On top of that, they are also giving  of additional 1GB for 4G LTE use only for the MaxisONE Plan as well. Digi on the other hand is giving 2GB of extra data for 12 months in conjunction with its current . Following closely behind is Celcom where they are giving 1GB extra of free data for 12 months. During sign up, most of these telcos would require an upfront payment, which is basically like a deposit that would be used to offset your upcoming bills. For U Mobile, they do offer a waiver for the advance payment but you’ll need to pay the device by credit card and sign up for their auto-debit billing feature. Before committing to a plan on contract, it is always recommended to pick one that suits your needs. The iPhone 6s is obviously cheaper on the highest plan and you might end up paying more than what you actually need. Apart from the calls, SMS and data offering, there are other things to consider such as network quality, customer service and other value added services including international roaming. For those who can’t afford to pay so much upfront, U Mobile offers the flexibility with Microcredit which you can determine its duration and amount. However do note that this works like a personal loan and there’s an interest of approximately 1.2%. As usual, if you spot any errors in the table above, do let us know in the comments above.Considering the iPhone is more expensive than before, getting one with a telco contract would garner more savings provided that you get the right plan. However for those who prefer to get it outright, an iPhone 6s is  from RM3,199 for the base 16GB model. Below is the full iPhone pricelist in Malaysia right now:"
Arif Lee,Google adds lane guidance to Maps navigation in Malaysia,,"Android,google,Google Maps,Google Maps Malaysia,Google Play Store,Google+ Malaysia,GPS,GPS Malaysia,iOS,Malaysia,Malaysia Navigation,Maps,Maps Malaysia,navigation","Android,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-15,"Finding your way around Malaysian roads can be a frustrating experience; for the road signs often state the same location times over, connecting you through a longer route if you choose the wrong exit. Putting yourself in this stressful situation tenfold won’t do any favours for your health, so Google has decided to ease that burden off your shoulders for a bit by adding lane guidance for Malaysian public roads.Featured on the Maps app (pre-installed on Android) but available  for iOS, the add-on helps you stay on the right lane so no missed or wrong exits are taken in the process. No longer will you have those last second moments to switch from the opposite end of lanes just to make it to where you’re heading to.Accessing the lane guidance is similar to just using the turn-by-turn Navigation already present on the application. Type in your location and tap on the Navigation icon to get voice assisted directions with lane guidance. Do note that Google mentioned that it’ll cover MOST public roads but be prepared that it might not support wherever you’re heading to, at least not yet. Knowing them, they’ll continue to add to the existing roads already supported to ensure Malaysian can rest easy while travelling and paying (more expensive) tolls.[  ]"

If that’s not enough, 3 more unique models will be heading our way which includes the epic ASUS Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition, Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Max.  This is the mother of all Zenfone 2s. The  is not only the fancier version of its top of the line Zenfone 2 with 4GB of RAM but it comes with a whopping 256GB of storage. In actual fact, the on-board storage is just 128GB but ASUS is throwing in additional 128GB extra with a bundled microSD card. The rest of the specs remain unchanged with a Intel Atom Z3580 Quad-Core processor mated to 4GB of RAM and it gets the similar 13MP+5MP camera combos, 3,000mAh battery and dual-SIM slots that support 4G LTE. From the recent ASUS media briefing, we are told that the Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition would be available in November.The elusive Zenfone Zoom that was  this year isn’t scrapped just yet. Seen as the answer to other photography centric smart phones like the Galaxy K Zoom, the Zenfone Zoom offers a 3X Optical Zoom lens that surprisingly doesn’t protrude. During its initial announcement, the camera has a 13MP sensor mated to 10 element lens which is assisted by OIS and dual-tone LED flash. In terms of hardware, it is said to feature a 5.5″ Full HD display, 128GB of on-board storage, 4G LTE support and a 3,000mAh capacity battery. Since it is almost a year, ASUS is likely to make some tweaks to keep it up to date with the current smart phones.  Last but not least is the ASUS Zenfone Max that’s entry level on specs but goes large on battery. It gets a 5.5″ HD 720p display and under the hood it gets a Snapdragon 410 processor with 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage. The biggest star of course is the massive 5,000mAh battery which should probably last more than 2 days on a single charge. Both the Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Max would be available sometime in December before the year is out."

This comes 2 months after Carl Pei was quoted on  that he had a hard time choosing between the (possible)  and the OnePlus 2. OnePlus’ newest smartphone is apparently its take on a more aesthetically pleasing product, not its usual “Flagship Killer” motive.What we can confirm so far is that the new One E1003 will only support Wi-Fi bands from a/g/n omitting the best “ac” support out. At least it’ll support Dual-SIM LTE based on the certification listing, bringing some hope for the device.A previous report states that the OnePlus X/mini would launch sometime during the holiday season, echoing the  of its co-founder and will retail for only  (RM 1,035). While its price might draw conclusions that it’ll less than worthy spec device, it surprises by supposedly running a MediaTek Helio X10 processor, coupled with 2GB of LP-DDR3 RAM.Its screen is reported to be a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and the storage appears to be 32GB internally, and it’ll have a microSD slot – a first for the OnePlus lineup. Tuned up with a polished 2.5D Gorilla Glass the edges will taper smoothly, hoping translating to better ergonomics.Somewhere under the hood, its purported that there will be at least 3,000/3,100 mAh powering the new smartphone. Straying a bit from the OnePlus 2, the Mini is claimed anonymously to carry NFC, an IR Blaster, front facing 1.2W loud speaker and the familiar USB Type-C that supports fast charge.Camera-wise it allegedly showcases a 13-megapixel f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor, supporting video up until 4K if you’re into the whole pixel game. The front on the other hand, gets a 5-megapixel shutter. There also has been rumours that it’ll be IP67 dust and waterproof, yet it’ll still maintain the removable back with customisable finishes and textures.Do you think  has delivered enough OnePlus 2’s to be able to handle the ramped-up demand of this mid-ranger? We’d just caution everyone that the information above barring the SIRIM details are rumours, so don’t jump the gun yet.By the way, our friends at  are giving away a new OnePlus 2 with an Otterbox case, if you’d like to find out more head on over .Thanks to Felix for pointing this out."

If you’ve ever wanted a Surface but preferred it to be bigger and a non-flex like typing experience, Microsoft has just machined it for you.At 13.5-inches, the Gorilla Glass PixelSense screen will still give you a touchscreen experience at 3000 x 2000 resolution delivering 267 ppi. The display gives you the ability to tote it around if you just want a “clipboard” or attach it to the keyboard for (Microsoft’s promised) the best typing experience on a laptop.Microsoft bundles the Surface Pen together giving you the tool to create content, be it drawing or writing. The Pen, which has 1,024 levels of touch sensitivity – that’s 4 times more compared to the old Pen, and they added an eraser too on the tail.Yet another way to interact with the screen in one of the most precise methods in a tool that supposedly gives you all-year battery life.. If the Pen doesn’t suit your needs, the keyboard and trackpad should – giving you 1.6mm of key travel and a huge precision touch glass pad for those cursor movements.Intel’s latest 6 Gen Intel (Skylake) processor sits inside this wonderful package. If you need more graphics? Just add on the dedicated graphics card (at a pretty price), which is somewhere under the keyboard. RAM options start from 8GB and go up to 16GB and you’ll have PCIE storage that range from 128GB to 512GB – odd, if you noticed that the Surface Pro 4 went up to 1TB. Being a Windows 10 devices event, its a given that the it runs Windows 10 out of the box.Productivity and exceptional performance, Microsoft’s new toy is expected to handle your designing, video editing and gaming; all in one seamless (not gap-less, eh) package. So much power in a small footprint but how does the battery fare? Microsoft swears by a 12-hour battery life but we’ll wait for the real-world testing first before jumping on the bandwagon.But wait, a laptop? Who could care less, then the video showed that you can detach it from the keyboard. Sharing information now is easier, just detach and pass it down; literally, they passed it around during the presentation. Run programs like Adobe Creative Cloud, AutoCAD, Citrix and anything else on the Book + Keyboard combo, since the discrete card lives in the latter.Their dynamic fulcrum hinge and cable wire lock technology looks promising but we noticed some unnecessary screen wobbling towards the end after angling the screen, hopefully it holds up well over time.Fashioned out of magnesium in a 3.48 pounds (approx. 1.5 kg) package, the dimensions of the device are below:The ports of this detach-able laptop are two USB 3.0 ports, a full-sized SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a mini DisplayPort. On connectivity you’ll get 802.11ac for Wi-Fi while also supporting a/b/g/n. Being a tablet of-sorts, it has an 8-megapixel rear camera with autofocus, capable of 1080p recording while for audio it has a dual microphone setup (front and rear) and Dolby front-facing stereo speakers.Here are the configuration options that you’ll be able to personalise your Surface Book and how well it stacks up against the Surface Pro 4:There’s no word when the Surface Book will arrive in Malaysia as of yet.

The last smartphone that took home the  as voted by you guys was the LG G4, but will it come to an end today?The newcomer of the group, the iPhone 6s Plus doesn’t pack a high megapixel count – only 12 on its rear iSight camera but its pixels come in at 1.22µ pixels, helping it somewhat. Storage might be an issue for the aforementioned device if you love those Live Photos, since the extra “moving picture” takes up roughly the same amount of space as the photos you take.Distinctive to the “Plus” is OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation), allowing you to take more stable shots when compared to its little brother, while its aperture is listed at f/2.2. For the first time we decided to include the front camera for our shootout and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus has a 5-megapixel sensor up front, with the same aperture as its rear camera. It also has the new Retina Flash, Apple’s alternative to putting an LED flash at the front like some selfie-centric phones in the market.Edging out the competition in the last shootout, does the 16-megapixel (rear) LG G4 camera have what it takes to hit the podium again? Well, the f/1.8 aperture rear camera has some tricks up its sleeves – similarly it has OIS as well but laser autofocus is what sets it apart. In terms of the front sensor, 8-megapixels makes its way on the top half of the display.A close second was the Galaxy Note5, that boasts the same megapixel count as the LG G4 and it also has OIS to back up its camera’s capabilities. On the front however, it isn’t so pixel hungry, as the selfie camera is only 5-megapixels."

Sharing his thoughts on the holiday-season ready OnePlus X during an interview with USA Today, Pei said that it was tough choosing between the OnePlus 2 and this new device. Seems like he liked how the old iPhones used to look.Rounded on the top and bottom, the OnePlus X looks almost identical to an iPhone 5 or an . Supporting documents to the FCC show that the unreleased smartphone will run a 1.9GHz processor, at least on the E1005 variant. It also adds to SIRIM’s details that it’ll have LTE on board and the photos imply that it’ll use a USB Type-C connector.Rumoured reports have gone to state that it’ll retail for only  (RM 1,035) and have a MediaTek Helio X10 processor under the hood, along with 2GB of LD-DDR3 RAM for performance related-task. Considered a mid-ranger of sorts, it’ll apparently sport a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and feature 32GB of internal storage that is expandable through a microSD card.It’s purported to house at least 3,000 mAh of battery and have NFC capabilities. Otherwise, its camera is rumoured to be a 13-megapixel f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor that can get you up to 4K video recording and a 5-megapixel shutter rounds off the front.Has OnePlus run out of ideas? Their “aesthetically pleasing” X model doesn’t scream any innovation or sense of design.

Given their recent troubles, this will be a make or break device(s) for Japanese company; with the  has the potential of being their saving grace. The three devices are slated to make an official appearance in Malaysia on the 29 October during this special invite-only event (you can sign up ). If you’re lucky enough to score yourself these exclusive invites, you’ll be in store for some lucky draws, giveaways and door gifts. Seen on SIRIM () earlier last week, it’ll be great to see how 4K will be illustrated in the form of the . Also, all three will make use of Sony’s latest 23-megapixel sensor that won it the best smartphone camera by , hopefully giving the other camera-ready flagships a run for their money in real-life situations.Sony smartphone camera sensors have always been top class, as seen on other notable flagships but the Japanese company seems to lag behind in the image processing department. The smallest of the Xperia bunch, the Z5 Compact will only command 4.6-inches of screen-estate in the form of a 720p (1280 x 720) resolution. While its internals utilise the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor found on its bigger brothers, it only has 2GB of RAM.For your storage there’s 32GB internally but you’ll get a microSD slot to expand up to 200GB if you want to. As mentioned earlier, it’ll come equipped with the same camera sensors as its bigger siblings; 23-megapixels on the rear and 5-megapixels on the front. As the smallest of the three, it shows itself in four playful colours; Graphite Black, White, Yellow and Coral.The middle-child, the Xperia Z5 sports a larger and denser 5.2-inch FHD display (1920 x 1080). Similarly, it’ll have the 810 SoC, 32GB of internal storage and feature the same camera setup but come with 3GB of RAM and a 2,900 mAh battery instead.Saving the best for last, the Xperia Z5 Premium will include the first-ever 4K (2840 x 2160) 5.5-inch screen – if you did the math, that’s about 806 ppi. A screen of such caliber has to have a camera capable of matching the output, so the aforementioned 23-megapixel 1 / 2.3-inch Exmor RS Sensor with a f/2.0 lens is capable of shooting 4K.: Sony Malaysia will be launching the Xperia Z5 Compact Dual, Xperia Z5 Dual and Xperia Z5 Premium Dual. Other than its larger 3,430 mAh capacity battery, there’s not much that sets it apart from the Xperia Z5. All three support LTE networks and could arrive in a dual-SIM variant on our shores but if you’re relying on SIRIM, the Compact model listed only shows the singular SIM. However, the two larger devices aren’t shown, so maybe they might be dual-SIM capable.If you’d like to find out more about the Xperia Z5 Compact and Z5 click , for the Z5 Premium make your way .[  ]"

Now there’s a better solution on the way as Google has just announced Google Drive backup integration with WhatsApp. This allows you to save those important WhatsApp chats, audio messages, photos and even videos to the cloud, so you’ll never lose them if anything happens to your device. Once enabled, you can set to backup automatically by daily, weekly or monthly. You also get to choose not to include those bulky videos to your backup. The cloud backup feature has been long anticipated for Android users, and it was  for a short while in April before WhatsApp pulled the plug. For iOS, iPhone users are already able to backup their chats automatically and they are stored on Apple’s iCloud service.At time of writing, the latest version on the Google Play Store still doesn’t have the Google Drive option yet.

Pre-orders start on the 9th can be made through the , ,  and  but these devices will only be in your hands from October 16th onwards.Hotly anticipated by Malaysians, as the Apple craze will sweep the nation yet again this year, though the long queues have dissipated since the iPhone 4s. Other than the previously stated telcos you’ll be able to get the smartphones from authorised retail outlets.Tougher and thicker, thanks to the 7000D series aluminium that added 0.1-0.2mm to its overall footprint. It also adds on 14grams of extra heft at 143 grams for the iPhone 6s and 20grams on the iPhone 6s Plus at 192g.Stacking the phones side by side, you’ll see a 4.7-inch (iPhone 6s) and 5.5-inch (iPhone 6s Plus) Retina Display – the same on the older 6 and 6 Plus smartphones. Under the hood, there’s a 64-bit enabled A9 chip that has a 70% increase in performance over the A8 processor.Performance is multiplied by integrating the M9 motion co-processor onto the A9 chip, saving some space internally as well at the same time. Taking a look at its battery, in actual fact the capacity decreases but in real-life situation it still maintains the same battery life with stronger power efficiency in iOS. For its colour options, Apple now adds a Rose Gold variant that is probably aimed to draw in the more feminine high-class crowd.Storage of these two devices remain the same at 16GB, 64GB and 128GB, a hard-case to justify why Apple doesn’t raise their bare minimum to 32GB but people will likely accept it.The prices below are , whose’ pre-order page went live before 12 midnight.

Here’s Maxis’ RRP pricing:Force Touch is a new feature on the latest iPhones that we’ve seen in action on the MacBook trackpads and Apple Watches.

The big brother in the form of the 6s Plus does have an upper hand in the camera department, as Apple has added Optical Image Stabilisation. On the front however, the old 1.2-megapixel sensor is replaced by a 5-megapixel shutter with f/2.2 aperture and adding the new Retina Flash to brighten up your selfies.Apple has prepared their new iPhones’ by adding more pixels to their sensors but how well will the devices stack up against the other camera smartphones in our latest  between the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s Plus, LG G4 and Samsung Note5.There are a wide array of features and other specifications on the pair of Apple devices, for more info you can head over .[  ]"
Arif Lee,Half of iPhone 6s’ produced may have lower performance and there’s nothing you can do about it,,"apple,iOS,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Battery Life,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Processor,iPhone 6s variants,iPhone 6s versions,Samsung,TSMC","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-09,"A manufacturer with high standards such as Apple would be assumed to be a company that it takes a lot to please but do 2% – 3% of a gap make a difference? Well it surely does, if you look at the actual numbers. Immensely so, if you needed that extra battery mile to last through your long work day or on your expedition in some desolated area. Apple says the difference is negligible on the  and the  but we’ll let you decide yourself.Basically, Apple’s iDevices vary in their processors by engaging two different vendors to supply their A9 chipset. On one hand, you have (their competitor) Samsung, while the other 50% is made by TSMC. The former has a 14nm FinFET process footprint, opposed to the latter – 16.nm FinFET process. This allegiance is nothing new, as Apple has enlisted help for quite a number of years already.In real-world scenarios the 2-3% could set off alarms, depending how you use your new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. A Geekbench battery test was run comparing the two devices and the results are shown below:Other than their battery scores, the two processors also performed differently on AnTuTu’s benchmark – TSMC’s chip won overall. In the same test, it was also clear that their batteries levels differed; again, the TSMC processor had more battery left (77%), when compared to the Samsung powered iPhone 6s (71%). If you managed to do the math, that’s a 6% disparity in numbers, which is double the 3% Apple noticed in their lab tests.Then again, once you’ve loaded up your apps and info, your device would run totally different compared to someone with the same chipset. So its possible that Apple was spot on with the 2-3% irregularity. Being quick to assess damage Apple has since made a statement addressed to the various publications that brought this information to light.There’s nothing much you can do about it though, but if you’d like to see if you’ve one-upped a friend/family member of yours, by all means use this iTunes approved  to identify if your iPhone 6s / Plus is using the better performing chipIf your device list these magic model numbers below then you’re in luck:
iPhone 6s – N71MAP / iPhone 6s Plus – N66MAPbut if you’re finding this model number instead, you’re on the other end:
iPhone 6s – N71AP / iPhone 6s Plus – N66APThere may be a silver lining after all, cause any company should have an amazing reason choosing two sources for their internals. As far as supply and demand go, it’s tough when you need to go to a competitor like Samsung to get your chipsets, and relying on them is definitely pain. You could say that, biting the bullet and producing real-world results through its products on the shelves allows Apple to gauge if there’s still worth in getting chips from Samsung.Can Malaysians nationwide do anything about this? Well it’ll be hard to make a case stating that their device is inferior, cause there’s no way of telling the difference when actually buying the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus; unlike Android OEMs (e.g Samsung) that clearly tell you that this model is an Exynos processor, while the other is a Qualcomm chip.Apple’s statement was only directed at one publication but it doesn’t take a lot to assume that they will continue to roll-out system updates that could make them more alike; whether that means making the Samsung chip in the iPhone 6s / Plus better than the TSMC’s or vice versa, still remains unseen. Their power in controlling both their hardware and software internally gives them the ability to tweak and adjust to these issues highlighted.What do you make of this? Will Apple’s new iPhones suffer? Or will people just live with their new status symbol? Let us know your thoughts in the comment below.[ , ,  ]"

In short, don’t expect them to be any different from what we’ve seen from Digi.As seen earlier, the full pricing is similar to Digi with the iPhone 6s priced from RM3,199 for the 16GB model while the iPhone 6s Plus going from RM3,699 for the same capacity. Below is the full pricelist for the entire range available right now:While it is listed on the , it isn’t available for orders just yet. Our guess is to try checking them out next week closer to launch but you would probably need a wait a bit longer for delivery. So RM3,199 for a 16GB iPhone 6s, is this the flagship worth paying for? For long term practicality especially if you take photos and videos a lot, which we think you would, we strongly recommend that you go for at least 64GB.  Alternatively you could consider taking one up subsidised on contract with a plan that suits your needs. Both  and  have revealed their plans and you can pre-order with them now.

Knowing that this is a roll-out, you can expect the OTA’s to eventually come in but be ready to wait up to a month or so, until the actual notification update comes in.Expect new apps and features to now live on your device – notably, an extensive search function; Now on Tap, battery saving elements, and a revamped app permissions system.Now on Tap is pretty much now your best friend, on your smartphone. It’ll help you search up pretty much anything you need, keeping your task, scheduling and info always in check. A video below details what you can do with Now on Tap.Technology in the battery department has stalled since the installation of the lithium-ion polymer, causing heartache for those who rely on their devices for most of their life. Google however, wants to help out in terms of improving how your devices utilises the power it has. Doze on Android is just one of them, which puts your Android device into a deep sleep when idle for an extended period to minimize power usage.Tested in “controlled environments” Android techs pit one set of Marshmallow Nexuses’ against another bunch with the older Lollipop – and surprise, surprise, the former ran *roughly* 30% longer (based on standby time). Users will also get another function dubbed App Standby. A feature that puts your lesser opened apps into a state of reduced activity, making your device conserve more power for the apps that you use more often.Privacy options get a much appreciated update, now allowing you to personalise and select which permissions you want to give apps. Users are now able to pick what they want their apps to have access to at the time of use. All apps running on Marshmallow now only request permission when it needs to access one of the device’s functionalities (e.g. microphone, contacts, camera). Rejoice cause now you can deny permissions and still use the app but at a reduced functionality, of course. Permissions can now even be turned on and off for any app, in the new settings.With Android M the arrival of native finger-print support came together. A new (naturally) supported way to interact with your device, giving you power to protect your device in a multiple array of methods. The new OS places your fingerprint at the forefront of safeguarding your information, unlocking your device, authorising payments on the Google Play Store (& more), signing into other apps and paying through Android Pay (if available in your country).Much to be excited about for those who own a piece of Nexus tech and a lot more incentive for consumers to pick up the newest Nexus smartphones; the 5X and 6P. We sure hope that Google Malaysia brings products (officially) to our domestic market soon, cause we’re loving what we’re hearing about Marshmallow so far. Are you?[  ]"

The operating system is no longer called Windows Phone but simply Windows 10 in line with its new direction. The Lumia 950 and 950 XL aren’t just about the latest hardware but a more integrated experience with its family of products. One notable feature is how it transforms the smart phone to deliver a PC-like experience via Windows Continuum. This is better implemented than other smart phone to PC docks we’ve seen before.Going through the specs, there’s no surprises from what we’ve seen in . Both the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL come with a Quad HD AMOLED ClearBlack display that are 5.2″ and 5.7″ respectively. These are the highest resolution smart phones Microsoft has ever made with over 500ppi in pixel density. The Lumia 950 XL gets Gorilla Glass 4 protection while the Lumia 950 settles for Gorilla Glass 3.

But in theory, it can go up to 2TB when such capacity is available.Being a flagship, the PureView camera is back with a 20MP f/1.9 1/2.4″ main shooter with a triple-LED RGB flash for natural looking illumination. Like most new high-end devices, it shoots 4K videos in 30fps while audio is is captured with Lumia Rich Recording that uses 4 microphones.

During the presentation, they shared that a 50% charge can be accomplished in just 30 minutes.Connectivity wise, both ticked the right boxes with faster 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE. Which ever model you pick, there’s also a dual-SIM variant but it is subject to each respective market. Another new feature is its Windows Hello biometric authentication feature. The actual workings behind it wasn’t explained clearly but the product demo looks similar to Android’s Face Unlock with the use of its front camera.

Arif Lee,Microsoft wants you to Live Healthier and Achieve More with its new Band 2,,"2,Band,Band 2,barometer,heart,microsoft,Microsoft Band 2,Microsoft smartwatch,Microsoft wearable,SmartWatch,wearable","Android,iOS,Microsoft,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows Phone",2015-10-08,"The tech giant built by Bill Gates just released a wide line-up of devices during its keynote two days ago. They drew oooohs and ahhhhs during their presentation that starred the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book, the HoloLens and the smallest of the bunch, the Microsoft Band 2. Microsoft wants you to destroy limits with their new wearable, stated for individuals who want to be in a better state of health and just get more things done.Microsoft’s first band was packed with features but failed to be something people would want on their wrist, partly cause of its design; often compared to be clunky and simply too cumbersome to be a daily wearable. Consumers should now be happier, cause Microsoft listened and their engineers in Redmond took more time to design the Band 2 to be more ergonomic. A word that you’d first expect to hear when wearables are concerned. Now curvier than ever, its Gorilla glass display tears at an angle! Yes, we all love curves.Some (beneficial) elements do return; in the form of the AMOLED display (320 x 128), 2 day battery life, GPS and an optical heart sensor. The device can thank the battery’s change of placement for being less bulky, now at one end of the smart watches’ straps. On the opposite end of the strap is a metal clasps – nothing too interesting, except it doubles as the charging connector that you snap on to the charging dock magnetically.The 0-80% in 30 minutes fast charging feature makes a return too, making sure you’ll be ready to get to it after charging in just half an hour. Design language aside, the Microsoft Band 2 has some internal upgrades that increase its adaptability for those who love staying active. A barometer now lives somewhere on the watch, along with a native UV sensor that monitors rays constantly. Golfers will surely ravel at the sensors and functionality included; distances measured from the tee to the hole and swing mechanics to help those drives just to name a few.It’ll help you track other stuff too with its 8 other sensors. Tracking sports like running, biking and weights should appeal to the common folk too. Day to day task are easier to handle with your new personal assistant, Cortana, who lives on your device as well.Supported mobile devices are listed below:You’ll be able to get your hands on the Microsoft Band 2 in the States for $249.99 (RM 1,049), $50 more than its predecessor but a worthy price to pay for a hefty upgrade. We’ll let you know if/when it comes our way, locally. Do let us know what you think about Microsoft’s new wearable in the comments below.Check out the product site ."
Alexander Wong,Purported OnePlus Mini specs revealed with more features than the 2,,"OnePlus,OnePlus 2 mini,OnePlus mini,OnePlus mini specs","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-10-06,"OnePlus will be announcing  before the year is out and this is looking like an affordable compact device. Dubbed as the OnePlus mini, it is said that it would be  aesthetically focused instead of having top notch specs like the .According to a new source, the OnePlus mini will be launched sometime in November/December with an estimated price tag of US$250, which is about RM1,091 in our current exchange rate. As expected with a “mini” model, it is a notch down with a purported 5″ Full HD IPS display and is powered by MediaTek’s Helio X10 processor mated with 2GB of LP-DDR3 RAM. On-board storage seems to be decent at 32GB and guess what, it even comes with a microSD slot. For the front, it gets a more polished 2.5D Gorilla Glass which makes it smoother to touch around the edges. Keeping the lights on is a decent 3,000/3,100mAh capacity battery which is non removable. The rest of the features appear to be an improvement over its “2016 Flagship Killer”. The anonymous source claims that NFC will be present along with an IR Blaster, front facing 1.2W loud speaker and a USB Type-C connector which supports fast charge. The camera is said to be a 13MP f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor that supports 4K videos while the front gets a standard 5MP shooter with Full HD video capabilities. Like the current OnePlus devices, the back is removable allowing you to customise with a variety of shells and word has it, that it could feature IP67 dust and waterproof capabilities.At this point, these are just speculations and while the specs are no way top notch like the OnePlus 2, the feature list seems to be quite compelling. However for the price tag, it faces cheaper alternatives like the Redmi Note 2 that’s priced at 999 CNY (about RM684). Even if you want it, buying it would be difficult as it would go through its rather limited invitation system. [ ,  ]"

Alexander Wong,Surface Pro 4: The Tablet that could put Most Laptops to shame,,"Laptop,microsoft,Microsoft Surface,Microsoft Surface Pro,Microsoft Surface Pro 4,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Malaysia,Microsoft Windows 10,New Surface pen,Surface,Surface Pro 4 Type Cover,Tablet,Windows 10","Microsoft,Mobile Devices",2015-10-07,"The tablet is normally seen as a media consumption device and nobody has done productivity better than Microsoft’s Surface Pro series. The new Surface Pro 4 marks its 4th generation of its 2-in-1 tablet/laptop convergence device and it runs on the very latest Windows 10. The current Surface Pro 3 to us is a breakthrough as it offers a full Windows experience in a true tablet form. It did live up to its “Tablet that could replace your Laptop” claim and the new one just raises the bar to a whole new level. Size does matter and we’ve seen countless of 2-in-1 devices that are just too heavy for tablet use. The Surface Pro 4 now gets a larger 12.3″ display that does a higher 2736×1824 pixels resolution while maintaining the same footprint of 292.1mm x 201.42mm. As comparison, the Surface Pro 3 has a 12″ screen that pushes 2160×1440 pixels resolution. On top of that, Microsoft has made it even thinner at 8.45mm (Surface Pro 3: 9.1mm) and lighter from 766 grams (Surface Pro 3: 800g). The front still gets a pair of stereo speakers and microphones while the top gets a 5MP front camera. Over at the rear, the camera gets bumped up to 8MP and it comes with auto focus. You still get a full sized USB 3.0, microSD card reader, headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort, all encased in its Magnesium body that comes in Silver. In the current Surface Pro 3, Microsoft had introduced a variety of Intel Core processors with various memory and storage options to suit every need. For the Surface Pro 4, the list is even more extensive with the latest 6th generation Intel Core processors. At the base level, they have opt for an Intel Core m3 processor instead of the usual i3 with a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage. For those who demand more power and have a loads of cash to burn, you can opt for the highest Core i7 processor with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Performance wise, the Surface Pro 4 is reported to be 30% faster than the Surface Pro 3 and 50% faster than the competing MacBook Air. No doubt it drives the price up to exorbitant levels and this is made worse with our current exchange rate. The full pricing for the Surface Pro 4 are as follows:Moving on to what makes the Surface Pro 4 a laptop replacement is the keyboard. The new Surface Pro 4 Type Cover has been massively improved to provide a better laptop class experience and it is thinner than before. The keys have been redesigned with larger spacing in between like a laptop chiclet keyboard which is made quieter and comfortable to type on.The trackpad meanwhile is 40% larger and it comes with a glass surface that tracks 5 multi-touch points. If you’re using a Surface Pro 3, good news for you as the new keyboard is compatible as well. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover is priced at US$129.99 which is about RM554.With more players getting their hands onto styluses, Microsoft had introduced a newer Surface Pen. It boasts 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity (current Surface Pen: 256 levels) and it even comes with an eraser at the back. This replaces the secondary button on the sides, leaving just one for right clicking, while the eraser tip still doubles as a Magic Button which launches OneNote on a single click. For the right feel and shade, there are interchangeable Pen Tips where you can swap from 2H, H, HB and B tips. It still connects via Bluetooth and with a AAAA battery, the new Surface Pen still lasts a whole year without charging needed in between. For storage, the Surface Pen now clips onto the slides of the Surface Pro 4 with the help of magnets. It sounds like a good solution but we’re not sure if it could hold on well with clumsy hands.  Overall, the Surface Pro 4 is thinner, lighter, faster and massively improved to steer you away from the traditional laptop. For those who work on the lap a lot, we are still unconvinced with the practicality of the kick stand but it is perfect when it’s used on the table. With the price tag of US$999 for the minimum Core i5 model, it is quite expensive compared to other similarly equipped laptops. If budget permits, this is still the best 2in1 hybrid tablet/laptop out there and it is more practical than Apple’s . It will be available at selected markets on 26th October with pre-orders available starting today. For more info, head over to the  page."

Worrying for Sony, who had relative success in supplying cameras to other flagships (iPhones, Samsungs and etc); success that has not streamed down to their own phone cameras, at least when field tested. A new change comes in the form of the latest , that’s been tested by the guys at , showing a vast improvement.The newer 23-megapixel 1 / 2.3-inch Exmor RS sensor with an f/2.0 lens, is the biggest determining factor here – when compared to the M5 that has a 21.5-megapixel IMX230 sensor. The newest flagship is expected to hit the streets in some markets by this week, since being released in September this year.Feature-rich in other elements too, with its 1080p 5.2-inch display, Snapdragon 810 SoC, 3GB, and 32GB of on-board storage. The Xperia Z5 runs Android 5.1 out of the box, which will be upgraded to  in the near future.If you’re taking 4K videos using the device, here’s where the microSD comes in (expandable up to 200GB), packing a solution to those huge files. That plus the 23-megapixel sensor that captures 5520 x 4120 resolution images, while its video capabilities range from 2160p/30fps down to 720p/120fps. Sony’s thrown in the regular bells and whistles too, with its phase-detection autofocus technology, LED flash, and HDR.Looks like more camera shootout comparisons will be coming your way, if this is anything to lead on. Impressively the Nexus 6P could appear out of nowhere as well, since DxOMark lists them at the current number two spot. LG and Samsung better watch out, cause these devices are potentially going to knock them off the podium.Here’s a breakdown at how the Xperia Z5 performed during the testing.  [  ]"

Celcom has introduced its new FIRST Basic 85 Internet Plan which gives you 21GB of mobile data for only RM85/month. Although it sounds the same, this isn’t the same as the standard  that comes with an OPTIMISER feature. Instead, this is a data-centric plan that gives you loads of data while calls are only charged when you need it.For RM85/month, by default it comes with 7GB of mobile data and 7GB of Celcom WiFi (if you could find one) that’s usable anytime of the day. The remaining 14GB of data (plus 14GB of Celcom WiFi) is allocated only for off-peak hours between 2AM and 8AM daily. According to the , unused internet can be carried forward with a maximum of 7GB to the following month and this is only from your 24 hour data bucket. Once you’ve finished your internet allocation, speeds will be throttled to 64kbps and there’s a limit of 15GB per billing cycle.If you need more data at full speeds, you can top up from as little as RM3 for 100MB, or you can opt for more at RM15/GB and RM50 for 5GB. As for calls, it isn’t specified clearly but SMS and MMS are charged at 15 sen to all networks. Interestingly if you’ve finished your FIRST Basic 85 Internet allocation, all calls and SMS are charged at 10sen. Come to think of it, this is basically Celcom’s  with voice and you can sign up without the unnecessary activation and registration fee. Should you get this over the standard Celcom FIRST Basic 85? If you use more than 5GB a month and hardly make any calls, the answer is probably yes. As comparison, the standard FIRST Basic 85  gives you 5GB of internet, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS for the heavy internet user. Alternative those who talk a lot will get 2GB of internet plus 600 minutes of calls and 600 SMS each month.If you’re interested, this plan is available from now until 31st October and take note that it comes with a 12 months contract.

Might not feature a “Force Touch” display,,"force touch,huawei,Huawei Malaysia,Huawei Mate S,Huawei Mate S launch,Huawei Mate S Malaysia,Huawei Mate S SIRIM,Huawei SIRIM,IFA,IFA 2015,IFA2015,Knuckle,Knuckle Sense,SIRIM","Android,huawei,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-03,"Freshly announced at , and briefly  as “unprecedented Sensibility”, the  was launched before Apple’s own, . Claimed to push the boundaries of interaction with your smartphone, it features a pressure sensitive screen that expands features based on touch and it could even weigh an orange!Following its global announcement, we finally have new details of it making a surprise appearance on  – leading us to believe that the device will soon make its way to Malaysia. The device isn’t a one trick-pony, considering it boasts some decent specs to go along with its “force touch” technology. Housed inside the all metal-chasis, is a home-grown Kirin 935 8-core processor, mated to 3GB of RAM, all in a 5.5-inch package.Its screen is a FHD display (1920 x 1080) and has curves on the back that tee off slightly, while the front makes use of 2.5D Gorrila Glass 4 to smooth the edges. There are two variants of the devices but the model listed on SIRIM is the CRR-UL00 model which comes with dual-SIM and has a different band support. It also supports 4G LTE in either FDD and TDD standards. But as a rough indication, the UK  site is selling the 32GB version at £469.00, instead of its larger 64GB model. Based on  in the UK, the Mate S in “Standard version” doesn’t come with the pressure sensitive display and it is said to be available later in a high-spec trim with 128GB of storage. So it is still a question mark whether we are getting the “Force Touch” high-spec version in Malaysia.In terms of its imaging, a 13-megapixel camera will support its photo taking on the rear, while the front gets a 8-megapixel shooter. The former is an f/2.0 4-colour RGBW camera sensor with OIS and dual-LED flash. On the latter, its an f/2.4 shooter with an accompanying soft LED light for flash.Fans of gestures will ravel over the (for show) Knuckle sense technology. An upgraded 2.0 version allows you to draw a “C” shape to open the camera app – we’re unsure how many of you will take notice or even use this though. The metal-chasis on the back surrounds a distinctive Huawei shaped fingerprint sensor. From Apple to Samsung, the Mate S also shares the 3 microphone multi way conference recording feature as seen on the Galaxy Note 4.A feather weight of sorts at 156grams and 7.2mm thick, it still manages to pack a 2,700 mAh battery under all that metal. Android 5.1 will run the device’s OS but have a EMUI 3.1 skin to go on top. No official word on its pricing yet in Malaysia, nor has there been news on the release date but we’ll keep you in the loop.Thanks to tipster  for the heads up."

Arif Lee,Sony’s Xperia Z5 Premium future-proof for 4K but will display mainly in 1080p,,"4K,downgrade 1080p,Premium,Sony,sony 4k,Sony statement,Sony Xperia Z5 Premium,xperia z5,Xperia Z5 4K,Xperia Z5 Premium","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2015-10-02,"brought some great devices, but at the same time Sony was busy as well releasing their latest smart phones and the  was one of them. What blew most people away was the fact that Sony decided to pack a 4K display on the 5.5-inch device – a first in the smartphone industry. But it certainly isn’t cheap because native isn’t easy to find. Sony’s latest statement answers some questions but we’ll have to see how well it attempts to levitate this problem.What the Japanese manufacturer attempts to do is downgrade non-4K content to a more reasonable 1080p, although it won’t sacrifice any proper 4K content, ensuring you’ll still get the most pixels. Here’s a snippet of what Sony said:They then offer an explanation as for why they decided to do so:It’s great that Sony has chosen to address these concerns and the reasons listed do make sense. Adding to that, the statement goes on to say that presently, the microSD slot handles cards up to 200GB just fine so 4K recordings won’t cause your phone’s memory to be maxed out so quickly.In the instance that you’ve yet to hear about the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium, let us jog your memory a bit. The device runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor that’s surely to give you enough power to handle all your tasks. While it’s RAM is listed at 3GB and the internal storage is 32GB (expanded to the amount earlier stated). And yes, the screen is a 4K 5.5-inch that has a mind-blowing 806 PPI (3840 x 2160 resolution)The rear camera on the device (1/2.3″ 23-megapixel Exmor RS) has already received the seal of approval from Dxomark, who’ve rated the latest Sony smartphone the best-in-camera title – you’ll be able to read-up on that in a follow-up post.It’s battery is rated at 3430 mAh; rather big for regular phones but Sony would be the first to show how 4K screens will affect a device’s battery life – they however rate the battery to last up to 2 days (dependent on your personal usage habits, of course). The phone also features Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, so that should help giving your battery a quick boost if it needs it.You can check out our post  for more info about the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium.[ ,  ]"

The Galaxy Active Neo could be considered sitting between the Galaxy Xcover 3 and the current high-end Galaxy S6 Active.Launched in Japan, the device carries a 4.5-inch display with a paltry 800 x 480 resolution, suiting its affordable price-tag. At least it runs Android Lollipop out of the box and is ready to resist dust and water, rated at IP67-certified, albeit having an exposed micro-USB port . It can also handle being dropped from 1.5 metres without damaging, helped by the Gorilla Glass 4 toughening the glass.At the helm of its brains will be a Snapdragon 410 processor and 2GB of RAM, providing just enough for daily tasks (little to no multitasking included). Camera-wise you’ll have an 8-megapixel rear and 2-megapixel front sensor, while its storage gets 16GB of expandable storage. Powering this LTE enabled device is a 2200 mAh battery and there are two colours to choose from – Camo White or Solid Black.Customers will also be entitled to a complimentary 100GB of Microsoft OneDrive storage for 2 years.

Arif Lee,HTC’s Butterfly 3 goes international,,"Announcement,Butterfly,Butterfly 3,Duo Camera,HTC,HTC Butterfly 3,HTC Duo,HTC Duo camera,launch,official","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-01,"Albeit being launched in Japan since May of this year, HTC’s newest device finally makes it way to its home-land, Taiwan. Placed to fill a gap in the non-metal phones of this year, the Butterfly 3 packs a great package with HTC’s signature dual rear camera setup in a lesser premium outer layer.For a pretty penny, the Butterfly 3 is filled with internals that beg the question, if priced so highly, why not just make metal-clad? It’s been tough for the Taiwanese company to make profits and since September, they’ve been  from the main Taiwan stock index (TWSE 50). Problems don’t just stop there, as the company announced that they would lay off nearly 15% of their global workforce.Market strategies aside, HTC Butterfly 3 is a 5.2-inch device; it’s screen is a QHD LCD display (2560 x 1440). Occupying the processor slot inside the device is an Octa-core Snapdragon 810, while the RAM sits at 3GB. For your storage you’ll get a decent 32GB internally but if you need a boost, you can always take advantage of the microSD slot.The star of the show of the Butterfly line has always been its camera optics, and the third generation device a Duo camera setup; 20.2-megapixels as the primary camera and a secondary lens to help with those bokeh shots. Protected by sapphire crystal it boasts an f/2.2 aperture and a dual-LED module sits on the left of the main sensor.Selfie taking individuals will be pleased as on the front you’ll see a 13-megapixel shutter with a BSI sensor. In terms of aperture, the front lens steps it up a bit with an f/2.0 lens instead. If you prefer videos, the rear sensor gets you 4K quality and the front is capable of 1080p films.Aesthetically, the Boomsound speaker grills are slightly thinner this time around, giving it a sleaker look but still maintaining its large bezels on the top and bottom. Powering the HTC Butterfly 3 is a 2,700 mAh battery and the smartphone has a IP rating of 57, ensuring that it’ll be slightly dust and water resistant. It also has a single 4G LTE SIM slot.Android 5.0 Lollipop is behind the device’s OS but has an overlay of HTC’s Sense 7. The device launches in Taiwan on the 20 of October for TWD 19,.900 (RM 2,657) though no word yet on international availability.[ ,  ]"

Among the repercussions were the removal of ‘s developer account that was attached to the app, thus getting it removed as well.This dismissal of sorts were caused by iFixit receiving a developer unit and risking it by tearing down the device that has yet to go on sale. While being dissembled, the people behind the website released info of the internals down to their model numbers, as they usually do.If you’re not familiar with iFixit, they’re the people behind the DIY fixing website for Apple products; they provide how-to’s and even provide the parts for self-repairs (if you’re desperate to look elsewhere).So far, they’ve released an official statement explaining the whole commotion that lead to Apple banning them. They explained that they knew the risk associated with going-ahead to tear down the Apple TV and the fact that “teardowns are in our DNA”, they couldn’t resist.Fittingly, Apple wasn’t too pleased but were fair to weigh the aforementioned decision against the repairing maestros and sent them a follow up e-mail explaining their offences; in-turn, banning the iFixit developer account with the app in tow.It isn’t all bad news though, as the team announced that their mobile site is essentially the exact same thing as the app; allowing the full functionality on the website. Adding that, due to the team being really small, they don’t have enough resources to keep the app up-to-date.Currently, they’ve no plans to rewrite their app, however the readily available APIs allow whoever wants to take up the task as the team has already given their seal of approval – since it’s open source. Meanwhile, the Android app still lives on and access to the repair guides are accessible on their existing mobile site.Watch the trouble-making teardown video below.[  ]"

Arif Lee,Samsung Galaxy View big on screen but half-way decent on specs?,,"benchmarks,Galaxy View,Galaxy View SM-T670,Galaxy View tablet,GFXbench,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy View,Samsung Galaxy View SM-T670,Samsung rumour,Samsung Tablet,SM-T670","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-10-02,"Teased during the Unpacked event that Samsung had in the heart of the Big Apple, the  from what we could tell was big. Officially there was no mention on screen size but they said it was all about a larger viewing experience. Possibly occupying a place in our dwellings but not moving around as much as smaller tablets. Spotted on GFXBench benchmarks, we now have a rough idea of what this device is going to be.Codenamed under the model number SM-T670, the monstrous tablet is listed to have an 18.5-inch display at 1920×1080 (FHD); at this size, we’d likely appreciate a higher resolution but we’ll have to see it in real life before making any assumptions. Theoretically the tablet will be viewed further away, more like a TV, so the “bigger” pixels shouldn’t be too noticeable.For it’s processor, it’ll run a 64-bit Octa-core Exynos 7580 processor coupled with a Mali-T720 GPU. This new processor is expected to fit in the mid-range chip-set market, as it’s supposedly only clocked at 1.6GHz; as far as we can tell, bigger model number doesn’t mean that this processor will be anywhere near the Exynos 7440. Similarly, the new processor was seen on the mid-range Galaxy J7 and the device’s benchmarks saw that it beat the Snapdragon 615 – which isn’t saying much.Back to the huge tablet’s specs, the listing also states that it’ll have 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Otherwise, it’ll carry an 8-megapixel rear camera (based on another report) and a measly 2-megapixel sensor on the front (probably just enough for video calls, if necessary).Samsung’s Galaxy View will apparently size at 451.8 x 275.8 x 11.9mm and feature a 5,700 mAh battery; raising some alarms, but it could mean that Samsung assumes you’ll have the device plugged in long-term. It has already been passed  and  certifications, a tell-tale sign that Samsung will probably launch this device soon.[ ,  ]"

A selling strategy that conjured up to ensure that they sell products at an extremely small profit margin. Their stint so far has proven that while people really want to buy their devices, they can’t keep up with the demand. So much so till it has driven Carl Pei to ask Samsung for an internship position, so he’ll be able to learn about being a bigger name in the market.The Shenzen based company, has faced a lot of hurdles since coming to existence in December 2013. They’ve suffered immense pressure to keep up the supply chain, and even daring to declare themselves as the “2016 Flagship Killer”. Maybe Mr Pei’s intentions of heading to Samsung would be to see how they incorporate Fast Charging in their devices; considering OnePlus didn’t include any form of the technology in their 2 devices or perhaps get some insider info on how to kill Samsung’s flagship in 2016.He’s even gone on record on his personal blog, stating that since the OnePlus 2, he’s learned important lessons from not meeting demands of orders. Adding that the company is working overtime just to get their newest device into the hands of their owners.It’s a given really when you intend to have a “one-hour open sale” that caused those on the invite-list to go mad – why have an open sale when you can’t even sell to those already waiting. We’re still not sure if they have a proper team handling marketing but at least they’ve set out to disrupt the market. Tipping the scales in favour of the consumer, so we’ll have to give lift our hats in that aspect.If the industry evolves, there’s likely room for more competition amongst the respective manufacturers – loosely quoting Carl Pei. But this is when it takes the cake, he goes on to say :-We’ll let you be the judge if this is an honest attempt at reaching out or just another stunt that could lead the brand further down the rabbit hole. Subsequently, the guys at Android Authority managed to dig up Pei’s LinkedIn account, which shows that the Co-founder has been around. Take a look at the photo below. kids could offer Carl some insights on how to successfully get an internship opportunity at Samsung. Take some pointers Mr Pei, they’re way ahead of you.[ ,  ]"

They’re more productive than regular mobile devices; the commonality? A keyboard. Yes, the way we type dictate how productive we are, or at least for the time being.So since we’ve seen that drafting long-winded text has always been a headache-inducing experience; hence, Google has reworked their existing Pixel brand to encase a new screen and bluetooth keyboard combination in the form of the Pixel C(onvertible).Could this be a direct answer to the dwindling tablet sales? Convergence devices have a chance to occupy some market share and it seems that most manufacturers are coming up with some sort of variation to tackle this problem.Omitting kickstands and clasps, yet maintaining its rigidity, the device attempts to be a tablet but combining the keyboard through magnets allows you to immediately start your full-on typing jobs. Adjustable to angles from 100 to 135 degrees, when attached, the presentation showed that you can handle it in an array of angles, not coming apart even without being grounded.As an add-on, the bluetooth linked keyboard decreases pitch of the key size from the regular keyboard’s 19mm (13-inch), to the Pixel C’s 18.8mm pitch; the size of keys center to center from each other. It also features a 1.4mm key travel, so typing won’t be too annoying. Stowing the typing add-on is easy, simply placing it under the tablet. Battery-wise it charges inductively when closed through the tablet itself, and a few minutes a day will keep the small keyboard’s battery fully charged, otherwise the keyboard will last for roughly 2 months.In terms of the tablet’s internals, it pushes a 2560 x 1800 pixel resolution through its aforementioned 10.2-inch screen that’s capable of 500 nits of brightness. Running the engine is a quad-core Nvidia Tegra X1 processor with a Maxwell GPU, mated with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage options are available in two choices; 32GB and 64GB.You’ll charge the new Google device through the USB Type-C port, and it has a nifty way of showing the battery percentage, just tap twice on the light bar and it’ll show you a gauge of the current percentage. As for software, it’ll run Android OS leaving out ChromeOS out in the cold.Beckoning the question – are they going to market this solely as a combo? Or will they let the tablet do most of the talking? As is, Android tablets have already had third-party options that allow users to add-on a keyboard, so this is nothing spectacularly new from Google.Some details have been left-out for the time being – like the camera optics, type of screen, and battery size but more info will likely be released at a later date to keep anticipation high.The device today was just teased and Google hopes to release the device by the holiday season. Fortunately, they didn’t withhold pricing and they’ve announced it’ll cost you $499/RM 2,211 (32GB), $599/RM 2,654 (64GB) and $149/RM 660 for the bluetooth keyboard add-on. Google has set up a product page but for now its really bare bones, you can check it out .Here’s the Google Keynote below (skip over to 1:11:28 for the Pixel C)"

This is the Piston 3.0 which succeeds its current  version, that’s priced at RM50. The new Mi Piston 3.0 is totally redesigned and gone is the metal chambers that usually come in gold, opting for a more ergonomic design with the use of durable plastic. While the previous version was straight, the new version slopes downward slightly with a 120 degree tilt outwards for a comfortable fit. The diaphragm in the ear piece uses an aerospace-grade metal composite material that’s sandwiched between its PET layers for a more balanced output. For optimal mid-range and bass performance, the sound chambers now has a new spiral air flow design which seems to direct sound better into your ear. Designed for smart phone usage, the Mi Piston 3.0 also comes with a microphone module that has your typical volume up, down and selection button. Unlike the previous version where the mic is placed at the splitting end of the cord, it is now located on the right side cable, about 3 inches below the ear piece. The cable still uses kevlar fibre that’s encased in a braided sleeve for better durability. From our long term use, the Piston 3.0 is more sleek in design and we find it to fit better in most ears. We know of some users complaining that the metal chambers of the current Piston 2.1 seem to hurt their ears during long usage, and it seems that the new ergonomic design has solved that. Noise isolation is a lot better and terms of quality, the mid-rangers are clearer while the bass is more warmer and full bodied. Overall, this is quite an improvement and the RM19 extra is definitely worth spending.If you’re interested, head over to the Mi Store to place your orders.

Ahead of the official event, the spec sheet of the Nexus 5X has been revealed and it is definitely a mid-ranger compared to its bigger Nexus 6P sibling. Head after the break for the full list.For starters, the front gets a 5.2″ display that pushes a Full HD resolution with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. That’s slightly bigger than the Nexus 5 and the size should be perfect for single handed use.

As the squeaky ball is round, it’ll work in either orientation, be it front-facing selfies, or rear camera portraits.

Coming in at a small form factor of 39.1grams the new streaming stick and its new music-inclined sibling now boast an improved WiFi frequency support,  to now be a circle and include an integrated HDMI cable.The pre-existing Chromecast used to look much like a stick with a HDMI head, opting for something a little more discrete and easier to plug in, Google has decided to switch to an integrated cable system to make the device easier plug in to hard-to-reach TV ports. The modern-looking Chromecast 2015 now adds support for a wider WiFi frequency; extending to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz with 802.11 ac bands. These bands have allowed Google to prove that the new device adapts to your WiFi surroundings in your home, giving you the best connection at any given time.Hardware aside, its app experience is now tweaked to give you a better overall time while using the device. Content is now shown on a home-screen but only caters to your personal app list, so if you don’t have a certain app, content from it won’t be shown. Though, through content discovery, it’ll show you the available apps that have the content you’ve choose to search for. Picking up (to) Full HD content on apps like Google Play, YouTube, Spotify and Netflix, users will surely have a lot of shows and movies to choose from.The updated Chromecast app wasn’t that slow to begin with but thanks to a pre-fetching option called “Fast Play”, app developers can allow their systems to decrease app load-times (80% faster in a test). Intrinsically, this pre-fetching extends further to utilise algorithms to pre-download content based on your behaviour – e.g. downloading a small bit of a new episode based on your current episode list. What about mobile gaming? Well, gaming is supported too, casting your screen onto your larger screen – now allowing multiplayer options that let users use their devices as controllers.Google also announced its audio only option with similar capabilities; the Chromecast Audio. As mentioned earlier, it’ll make your regular devices a little smarter, allowing you to repurpose your older expensive Hi-Fi systems by making them a streaming machine – similarly to a bluetooth speaker BUT you won’t be interrupted by phone calls anymore, since the device can run on its own without disturbing your listening.Owners can choose from an extensive list of apps like iHeart Radio, Pandora, Google Play Music (not available in Malaysia), Spotify and etc. Google aims to add to their Chromecast Audio app list throughout its lifetime. Some other perks when comparing it to a bluetooth speaker would be less battery drain, ability to use multiple cross-platform devices to control your “new” smart-er speaker.Sharing is enabled through audio sharing on the app that gives users on the same network the capability to control music options on the Chromecast Audio. Best thing is, casting is done on the app you’re playing your music from, so you won’t need to learn an entirely new app just to play music. Later in the year an OTA update will even allow multi-room audio, syncing all your speakers to play from one source.Both devices are readily available in 17 countries (Malaysia left-out) but only cost $35 each (RM 156) and come in 3 colour options – Lemonade, Coral and Black. The devices work with computers or mobile devices that use Android 4.1+, iOS 7.0+, Windows 7, or Mac OS X 10.7 and ChromeOS We’ll be sure to update everyone if/when the two devices come to Malaysia.

Seemingly, Asia as a continent is showing a propensity to put aside their PCs to solely rely on their smartphones for their online needs – be it shopping, learning, searching and etc.So Google being Google, they’re tasked to illustrate an image to show how people use the Internet – as quoted by MD SEA Sajith. Essentially, the research serves to encapsulate the behaviours of the world while connecting to their devices – these instances are dubbed “micro-moments” and so far they’re transcending markets in Asia.How hooked are we? Well the insights show that 66% of all Asians own a smartphone, numbers that aren’t trumped by any other region; Americas and Europe are 60% each. Our neighbours down south (Singapore) sit high and mighty with 88%, the country with the fastest internet (South Korea) are at 83%, while Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia come in at 79%, 78% and 77% respectively – Malaysia’s percentile was at 71%.Malaysia’s data shows some trends that might be worrying; to sum it up, Malaysians could be likely to have ADHD, or rather just find it hard to concentrate on one thing – in this case, device for a span of time. Coming in at number 2 thanks to logging a percentile of 91% Malaysia was only beaten by Indonesia (92%); numbers that show that both countries have individuals that use their smartphones while watching the TV. Numbers which implicate that these two nations are either:Then on, the data also shows that 36% of Malaysians only use their pocket companions and nothing else to surf the web – again number two, behind Thailand 37%. It seems that it could be that the portability of their smartphones are driving them away from tablets and computers.Buying habits are now also being dictated through smartphones, although the numbers aren’t too high at 20%. Supplementing this data are more percentages that corroborate that e-commerce is still quite stagnant in the country.51% of Malaysians prefer to do their groundwork on their purchases online but purchasing the actual item offline. The internet is helping them find out what they need and compare on the internet but knowing Asians, they still want to take a proper look at the thing they’re putting their money towards. Another interesting trend is that 48% of our citizens find out about products through online resources, first. E-commerce as an industry is still finding it hard to tackle the local consumer, but they’ll be happy to know that 30% of Malaysians are shopping online through other mediums (PCs, tablets, etc).Coming to a close, it’s no surprise that the majority of smartphone users come from Gen Y or younger (under 25; 93%) but these numbers are increasing in all age ranges. Some time during this article you’d probably compare yourself and decide if you fall within the majority; nevertheless, consumers could expect more content to be marketed based on these findings, so be prepared for interactive content that spreads across multiple-platforms.For more info check out the online poll ."

Alexander Wong,Google Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P announced with Marshmallow out of the box,,"Android,Android 6.0,Android M,google,Google Nexus,Google Nexus 5X,Google Nexus 6P,Huawei Nexus 6P,LG Nexus 5X,Nexus 5X,Nexus 5X Launch,Nexus 6P,Nexus 6P Launch","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,nexus 5,Nexus 6",2015-09-30,"There’s a saying that good things come in pairs. And that appears to be the formula for new flagships like the Galaxy Note5/S6 edge+ and the more recent iPhone 6s/6s Plus. The Nexus project has always been a showcase of what Google can do if they have full control on both hardware and software. In its 7th Nexus smart phone generation along with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, they had introduced not one but 2 Nexus smart phones that cater towards different users. With very little introduction required, the Nexus 5X is their new compact “flagship” while the Nexus 6P is their crème de la crème with a 5.7″ phablet form factor and top spec underpinnings. With LG being called up for another Nexus duty, the Nexus 5X is an upgrade over its previous Nexus 5 that’s encased in a premium injected molded polycarbonate body. The screen gets a slightly larger 5.2″ size but it still does a modest Full HD resolution. In terms of power, it manages to pull through with a Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor that’s also powering the LG G4. It only gets 2GB RAM with an option of either 16GB or 32GB storage. Looking at the rear, the Nexus 5X gets a main 12.3MP camera which claims to outdo its better specced rivals. While there are cameras out there with higher pixel count, the 12.3MP shooter from Sony boasts a larger 1.55 μm pixel size, which is pretty much the same formula as HTC’s Ultrapixel shooter. The main camera has a f/2.0 aperture lens, dual flash light and an IR laser AF for quicker focus. For the front, it gets a rather standard 5MP f/2.0 camera with 1.4 μm pixel size. Audio is pushed from a single speaker that’s firing from the front. Connectivity wise, it supports a wide range of networks covering Cat 6 4G LTE in TDD and FDD spectrums. It also has WiFi 802.11ac in 2×2 MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC support as standard. For better security, the rear mounted fingerprint scanner that’s called the Nexus Imprint lets you unlock by a mere touch. It recognises in under 600 ms and it learns to get better each time it is being put to use. Keeping the lights on is a 2,700mAh battery that’s rated for all day use and it charges up using USB Type C that supports Quick Charge. The Nexus 5X is available for pre-orders at selected markets with the 16GB version priced from US$379 (about RM1,690).As seen in earlier leaks, this is the first Nexus phone produced by Huawei. Apart from being a new appointed Nexus maker, it is also the first all metal Nexus smart phone and it boasts a rather slender 7.3mm thickness. With Huawei being reluctant of pushing a Quad HD smart phones, the Nexus 6P breaks that tradition with a 5.7″ Quad HD display that pushes a stunning 518ppi. To protect the display from harm, it gets toughen with Gorilla Glass 4 and there’s an added oleophobic coating for smudge resistance. The design looks like an odd mix between a Huawei P8 and an honor 7 especially with that visible camera bump. For audio playback, it does get a pair of front firing speakers and recording is assisted by 3 microphones that double up for noise cancellation. Under the hood, the Nexus 6P runs on a Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. You get more storage options ranging from 32GB, 64GB and 128GB which are also non-expandable.The list of connectivity support, Nexus Imprint and USB Type C are similar as the Nexus 5X but the same 12.3MP camera gets an extra trick of having to support a higher Slow Motion recording of 240FPS. Taking selfies should be better as well as the 6P gets a higher 8MP f/2.4 shooter. In terms of battery, it gets a phablet category 3,450mAh capacity unit which is fitting for the specs it carries. The Nexus 6P is priced from US$499 which is roughly RM2,225 in our current rates.  Both models are quite pricey when compared to mainstream Android smart phones but for the Android purist that want to get the very latest Android might appreciate one of these Marshmallow preloaded smart phones.

Alexander Wong,Leaked Nexus 6P presso reveals almost everything you need to know,,"Android,Android M,Google Nexus,huawei nexus,Huawei Nexus 6P,Nexus,Nexus 6P Camera,Nexus 6P Launch,Nexus 6P Specs","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Nexus 6",2015-09-27,"The new Nexus duo –  and  are set to be announced on  with the latest  pre-loaded. With about 2 days to go, the purported presentation slides for the Nexus 6P have surfaced online, revealing almost everything you need to know about the latest phablet. Firstly, the new Nexus 6P is the first Nexus flagship to feature an all metal build. Instead of a 6 incher (5.96″) like the current Motorola based Nexus 6, the new 6P that’s made by Huawei is going for a slightly smaller 5.7″ display. It pushes a Quad HD resolution that’s protected by Gorilla Glass 4. Accompanying the display is a pair of front ported speakers similar to its predecessor. Under the metal body, the Nexus 6P runs on Qualcomm’s Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor that’s found on most flagships today. There’s no mention of RAM but it comes with a variety of storage sizes – 32GB, 64GB and 128GB. As usual, there’s no expandable storage via microSD.For the first time on a Nexus, it will get USB Type-C which supports both faster data transfer and Quick Charge. At the back, there’s also a fingerprint scanner, that lets you unlock or skip passwords at a single touch.For imaging, the deck didn’t reveal exact pixel count numbers but its “Nexus Camera” is said to have been improved for better low light shots. Paired with its Google camera app, it promises quicker capture while keeping your subject in focus. .: According to  which has gotten a couple of more slides, the camera is confirmed to be a 12.3MP f/2.0 unit that comes with a larger 1.55 μM pixel size which allows more light. Meanwhile at the front, it is expected to carry a 8MP camera that has a standard 1.4 μM pixel size. With a 3,450mAh capacity battery, the Nexus 6P weighs 178 grams. That’s quite remarkable as it is 230mAh more than the current Nexus 6 but it is still lighter by 6 grams. The biggest change in terms of experience is definitely Android M as it comes with a couple of tweaks on app management, power efficiency and native support for more features including a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C. : The Nexus 6P  at US$499.99 (about RM2,215) for the 32GB storage option.It will be available in 4 colours – Aluminium, Graphite, Frost and Gold, with the last colour surprisingly exclusive initially for Japan. The Nexus 6P and its smaller Nexus 5X will be launched on 29th September at 11:00PM (Malaysian Time). You can check out all the slides in the source link below.[   ]"

It’ll also have 64GB of internal memory (no mention of expandability), a 21-megapixel camera and finger-print sensor combo on the back, while upfront it receives an 8-megapixel snapper. Overall, it is quite a huge step up from its former .Cellular connections will be managed by a dual-SIM LTE enabled slot, while the device runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and is powered by a huge 3,500 mAh battery; fitting, as Lenovo has a knack for putting large batteries in their devices.Since Lenovo’s acquisition of Motorola and the announcement that they plan to  their Mobile division to sell under the Motorola name, their design language has shifted – as you can tell from the photos, the speaker grills and less aggressive curves tell the tale.The same device has already been spotted in the wild, at a 2015 Chinese Telecommunications Expo, no less; so it definitely exists, but no confirmations of specs are to be seen.When will we see it being released and what specs will it carry? Your guess is as good as ours, but it’ll be soon enough, if the certification appearances are anything to lead on. We’ll be sure to keep everyone updated as we know more.A big thank you to  for the SIRIM tip.[  ]"

We compared the current deals offered by ,  and  for your easy reference. Check them out after the break. 
Getting an iPhone in Singapore is quite expensive to start with, no thanks to our current 1 SGD = RM3.08 exchange rate. Being an import or AP set, there’s an obvious premium to pay on top of the original price. The cheapest iPhone 6s with 16GB can be yours starting from RM3,559 on  but this is limited to the more classic Silver and Space Grey colours. Meanwhile, the phablet sized iPhone 6s Plus starts from RM4,699 for 16GB from both SatuGadget and Lazada. Across the board, the gold colours would cost more due to anticipated higher demand and it is more extravagant for the new pinkish Rose Gold. If you do plan on shooting lots of 4K videos, it is advisable to  and go for at least 64GB. If money is no object to you, the iPhone 6s Plus with 128GB storage is sold starting at RM5,945 on Lazada and it goes up to RM7,288 for the Rose Gold colour option. That’s seriously a lot of money to pay and history has always proven that there are always people willing to spend that insane amount. : The iPhone 6s/6s Plus will be  on 16th October. Better to wait for the official sets which are also available on contract from our telcos. : Some sellers have started throwing price with the iPhone 6s 16GB  RM3,199 on Lazada. That’s below the market price since it is priced at S$1,048 in Singapore, which is about RM3,282. For a more sensible purchase, you can probably wait until sometime in  when it is expected to launch officially in Malaysia. Looking at Apple’s constant , do expect to pay more compared to previous years. The prices above are correct at time of writing and they are subject to change without prior notice.

This time around, the bunch at Phone Buff set out to the Oceanic continent to see if Apple has tweaked the aluminium strength on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to settle the issue once and for all.In the video, the guys dropped the two devices at three different angles – front first, back first and sideways. Overall the new 7000 series aluminium held up quite well, merely scuffing when dropped in the last two orientations. The face first drop on the other hand caused the screens to crack – no surprise here, glass is still glass.We hope no one else actually does this for fun, or rather takes a videos of it; mainly cause the sound of the device hitting the ground is just painful to experience – over and over again.Has Apple addressed durability concerns? or will you be getting the new iPhones?

Think, Richard Mille, Patek Philippe, Franck Muller and the likes, in the watch making industry; similarly the Vertu Signature Touch aims to occupy the same segment, just for smartphones instead.The prices of their newest devices can fetch from between £6,500 all the way to £13,700, a hefty price for a smart phone. Now with premium prices, you’d expect a premium product, so what goes into making a smart phone that costs roughly the price of a compact car?First off, we’ll take a look at its exterior (yes, we’re treating this like a car impression); the device is fashioned out of expensive materials (go figure), you’ll get polished Grade 5 titanium – the kind you see in the high-end automotive and aerospace industry. Then we have a 130 carat sapphire crystal display ensuring you’ll have the “best” viewing experience. Lastly, the material that surrounds most of the smart phone is leather, and not just any type of leather; we’re talking calfskin, lizard and alligator hides from the best tanneries in Europe.But wait, what about its specs? In this department, the Signature Touch is no slouch either, accompanying its expensive exterior is a 64-bit Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, mated with 4GB of RAM. It’s screen is a 5.2-inch Full HD display, protected by the aforementioned sapphire crystal, while the internal memory is supported by 64GB of storage and features a MicroSD slot (support up to 2TB) that comes with a 64GB card inside.The device’s rear camera stands at a pretty 21-megapixels with phase detect autofocus and a twin Dual-tone LED flash providing better colour accuracy when lit. Moving over to the front, you’ll get a satisfactory 2.1-megapixel wide aperture sensor for those (expensive) selfies.Vertu’s Signature Touch promises to pack a punch when audio is concerned, thanks to its duo of stereo speakers enhanced by Dolby Digital Plus surround sound decoding. For connectivity its equipped with the full WiFi spectrum (a/b/g/n/ac), as well as Bluetooth 4.0, NFC and 4G LTE to boot.Under its titanium housing, you’ll be pleased to find a 3,160 mAh battery that’s readily compatible with Qualcomm QuickCharge 2.0 and also Qi wireless charging. Capping off the smartphone’s specs is the software it runs – Android 5.1 Lollipop with some added Vertu extras bundled with the device.So once you’ve put down that huge wad of cash on the Signature Touch,, it’s expected that it offers you a little more than just being your mobile device; well yes, Vertu has felt the same way, handing its owners an exclusive ruby cut key that gives you access to their added services that include:The phone is available for pre-order in a selected few Vertu boutiques from the 28 of September till the 8 of October, while the device officially goes on sale on October the 16.

Well it’s safe to say that Mr. Chen uses a BlackBerry (10) himself, seeing he tried to swipe up in the video you’ll see below.Providing an exclusive hands-on, the CEO talked about how the brand identifies to give its customers privacy, security and privilege, while handling the device – that wasn’t set up yet.The short time with the device was spent more on how the company has decided to give other OS’ a go, since they can’t keep up with competitors’ app ecosystem. He also gave us a look at the slider in action, mentioning that the QWERTY keyboard will have capacitive keys.Recapping the rumoured specs, the Priv runs a 6-core Snapdragon 808 processor and 3GB of RAM under the hood. Curved in nature (a first for BlackBerry) the 5.5-inch screen is purported to display in Quad HD resolution.For its camera, it’ll be sporting an 18-megapixel rear shutter with dual-LED flash, while the front gets a 5-megapixel camera. As you saw on the video, the Priv runs Android; apparently 5.0 but it’ll also have some of the BlackBerry exclusive apps like BlackBerry Hub.A stumble for sure, perhaps BlackBerry could’ve asked their top technology guy to handle the preview of the device instead. Hopefully they’ll buck up during their launch presentation, or at least get the demo unit set up properly – as it is estimated to launch around November.If you’re a BlackBerry user, tell us what you think about the notion of switching over to Android in the comments below.[  ]"

It’ll also include an altimeter; if we understood what Microsoft Insider reported as sensor to measure the “height of an exercise”.Accented with what looks like metal on its side, the Band 2 will supposedly include an optical heart sensor, accelerometer/gyrometer, GPS tracking, a microphone, ambient light sensor, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and UV sensor.Being the City That Never Sleeps, NYC will host the Microsoft event on the 6 of October – rounding off a busy few weeks that’s already seen the city host Apple and soon to go ahead with LG as well. Summing up, it seems like the second generation Microsoft wearable device could be a great update.Tell us what you think Microsoft will throw in the pot during its event in October in the comments below.[ ,  ]"
Alexander Wong,The Pebble Time Goes Round. The thinnest and lightest round smart watch you can buy,,"Pebble,Pebble Smart Watch,Pebble Time,Pebble Time Round,Pebble Time Round order,Round Smart Watch,Smart Watch","Mobile Devices,Smart Watch",2015-09-24,"Not too long after releasing its  series, Pebble has just introduced its new Pebble Time Round. Moving away from the typical square and toyish design, the new Pebble looks like a traditional watch with a variety of colours and bands to match. Furthermore, it is the lightest and thinnest smart watch yet weighing from just 28 grams with a thickness of 7.5mm. Like the new mainstream smart watches, the Pebble Time Round comes in 2 strap sizes, a 14mm size for the ladies and a broader 20mm version for men. It is slightly narrower than the typical 22mm size on the previous Pebbles and the bands are easy to swap with its quick change mechanism. For now, it comes with just leather bands and the metal versions would be made available later. In total there are 3 options (Silver, Rose Gold, Black) available for the 14mm Pebble Time Round and just 2 (Black and Silver) for the larger 20mm version.In terms of design, it looks pretty sleek with its marine grade stainless steel body and the watch display is an always-on colour E-Paper unit, just like the Pebble Time. It has the same buttons with a back button on the left and the typical 3 navigation buttons on the right, so usability hasn’t changed if you’re using the current Pebble Time. It still gets a built-in microphone that’s used for voice commands. When compared to other smart watches, you’ll notice a much thicker bezel but Pebble somewhat has managed to mask it with a variety of patterns from circular lines to numeric markers for the hour and minutes. The biggest sacrifice of going round and thin would be its battery life. Instead of the usual 7 to 10 days of use, the Pebble Time Round is rated to last just up to 2 days on a single charge. According to Pebble this is a worthy trade off for style and the new Time Round also supports quick charge, giving 24 hours of use with a quick 15 minutes charge. So a full charge for 2 days use in theory can be done in just 30 minutes, which is heaps faster than the Apple Watch. Charging is still done with its magnetic USB charger that snaps onto the back of the watch. Another trade off for the Pebble Time Round is it isn’t as water resistant as before. On the previous Pebbles including the Time Steel, it can be submerged under 30 metres of water with its 5 ATM rating. The Pebble Time Round however is only splash resistant even with its IPX7 rating. The product page has explicitly mentioned: “Pebble Time Round is splash resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to water–like unforeseeable rain–won’t ruin your device, but submerging the watch is not recommended.”No doubt the Pebble Time is more basic in “smart features” as compared to the Moto 360, Samsung Gear S2, Huawei Watch and LG Urbane. For Pebble, it isn’t about cramming the most tech but the main focus is on building a functional watch that tells the time 24/7 without sleep with the capabilities of notifications and apps. It is a pretty looking thing but we expected them to at least maintain the impressive 7 days of battery life. The good thing about Pebble is that it supports both Android and iOS devices, giving it a wider compatibility than other smart watches out there. If you’re interested, it is available for  at US$249.99 (RM1,095) with shipping to start sometime in November. Want something simpler? The original Pebble Classic is  for US$99 (RM438). [ ,  ]"
Arif Lee,Was the LG G4 a let down for you?

The positive ones that come to mind would be its camera capabilities, good performance (for an 808 SoC), and satisfactory QHD screen. Consequently, according to this rumour, LG wants to build on what it has going for itself but don’t expect it to be out so soon; probably sometime in Q1 next year.Quoting an anonymous report from an insider, the G5 will have the best of what Qualcomm and Sony has to offer, in the processing and camera department. The latter is supposedly going to be an LG exclusive sensor made by Sony; all 20-megapixels worth, boasting a half an inch diagonal size sensor (the biggest yet).Comparing the current-gen lot below:So we’ve  the top end cameras of the smart phone world and you guys decided that more pixels don’t necessarily mean the best photos, in real life scenarios. It doesn’t help either that manufacturers place an absurd amount of emphasis on the number of pixels a camera carries.Problems at the time with Qualcomm’s hot Snapdragon 810 processor saw LG look off and choose the 808 SoC instead; lets keep our fingers crossed that the 820 is the product of Qualcomm learning from their past and they’ve managed to keep it cool. So it’s safe to say the LG G5 will deliver in processing power – however there have been  of LG developing its own signature chipset.Rumours are rumours, so don’t be too excited for now; nonetheless, we’ll wait till Q1 2016 to see if there’s any weight to this news.[ , ,  ]"
Alexander Wong,"If this is real, the next big thing from HTC isn’t the flagship you’re looking for",,"Android,HTC,htc aero,HTC Hima,HTC One A9","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-24,"HTC is banging on their new “” smart phone to turn its fortunes around. Most mainstream players have announced their flagships for the 2nd half of this year, which includes the Galaxy Note5, Sony Xperia Z5 and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. If you are expecting HTC to come out with a new flagship to close the gap, you could be in for a disappointment. The new HTC Aero was initially  to run on MediaTek’s top of the line Helio X20 processor that comes with 10 cores. However based on the recent information from @evleaks, the new HTC One A9 is likely to be a premium mid-ranger instead, which is more of a direct competitor to the  and the  series. Even the model name  seems to be poking fun at Samsung’s Galaxy A series. Instead, it gets a more mainstream 5″ Full HD display, a Snapdragon 617 processor that’s mated with just 2GB of RAM and has 16GB of storage on board. For imaging, it has a 13MP main camera with OIS while the front retains HTC’s 4MP Ultra-pixel camera. The Aero is meant to be a fashion centric device with a slender unibody metal design at 7mm thick. As usual, HTC is rumoured to pack a smaller battery with just 2,150mAh capacity. As seen in the new pic above, there’s a fingerprint scanner at the front but surprisingly it is missing a speaker grill at the bottom. Just a few hours ago, @evleaks has also shared the 6 colour options available, which looks like a collection of iPod Touches. In summary, this isn’t going to replace its current One M9 but instead it is a possible successor of the former . The new HTC One A9 is expected to be released in November and hopefully this could be priced competitively to attract the masses. [ ,  ]"
Alexander Wong,Meizu PRO 5 official unveiled. A premium flagship that could take on the Note5,,"Android,FlymeOS,Meizu,Meizu Malaysia,Meizu PRO 5,Meizu Pro 5 Launch,MEIZU Pro 5 Malaysia","Android,Meizu,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-23,"Today Meizu has announced the PRO 5, a new premium flagship smart phone which has the means to take on the best Android smart phones available today. With Samsung  with its own in house developed components, you won’t be surprised to see Meizu putting the best possible specs to raise the bar higher.At 5.7 inch, it has the same display size as the Galaxy Note5 and home ground rival Mi Note. Instead of having a Quad HD display, Meizu is settling for a more traditional Full HD AMOLED display that comes encased under a 2.5D glass. Design wise, it retains the same unibody metal design as the past flagships like the  and the . At the front, it has a home button that doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. The new generation fingerprint scanner is said to be quicker with 0.5 second response time when touched in any direction. The hardware underneath is where it gets a little interesting. It runs on the same Exynos 7420 processor as the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5 that’s mated to either 3GB or 4GB of DDR4 RAM. On top of that, it also utilises Samsung’s  (UFS 2.0) which is faster and more efficient compared to typical eMMC 5.0 storage. With its own optimisation, the Meizu PRO 5 smashes the Galaxy S6 in Antutu benchmarks scoring over 77,000 points. There are 2 variants available, with the 3GB RAM paired with 32GB of storage, while the higher 4GB RAM variant gets 64GB of storage. In the imaging department, the back gets Sony’s new IMX230 21MP camera with Phase Detection AF, Laser Auto Focus assistance and dual-LED flash. Meanwhile the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter that comes with its own beautification features. For sound, the PRO 5 boasts Hi-Fi quality audio with its additional ES9018K2M DAC and OPA1612 OP Amp. Keeping the lights on, the Meizu PRO 5 is juiced up by a 3,050mAh capacity battery which comes with its mCharge 2.0 feature. With a faster 24W fast charger, it can charge up from 0-65% in just 30 minutes. That’s faster than Samsung but it is still a notch below OPPO’s VOOC Flash Charger that does 0-75% in the same duration. Meizu has also ditched the old school microUSB port for a reversible USB Type C that’s currently used on the latest MacBook, OnePlus 2, Nokia N1 and the recently announced Xiaomi Mi 4c.   In terms of connectivity, it supports dual-SIMs with 4G LTE and the 2nd slot accepts microSD with expandable storage up to 128GB extra. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.1 but with a heavily skinned FlymeOS 5.0 running on top. The Meizu PRO 5 is priced at 2,799CNY (about RM1,908) for the 32GB version while its bigger 64GB model is priced at 3,099CNY (about RM2,112). That’s quite a huge step up from its previous flagships, encroaching the price range of its mainstream rivals. Nevertheless, it is still quite an interesting alternative considering it packs the same high performance hardware as the Galaxy S6. For more info, you can check out the  product page."
Cheryl Bates,Dynamic Duo: The OPPO PM-3 Headphones and HA-2 Amp Review,,,,2015-09-25,": Both devices have had a minor price revision, the OPPO PM-3 now retails for RM 1,399 and the OPPO HA-2 at RM 1,699.It might seem a little odd seeing one of the Chinese smartphone brands that we know and love suddenly out some high end audioware, but believe it or not OPPO had its roots in audio way before they started producing phones.Here we have the OPPO PM-3 Planar Magnetic Headphones, the cheapest option of their high end series of headphones alongside their headphone amplifier-slash-battery pack the OPPO HA-2.In case you’re not sure what a “Planar Magnetic Driver” is, it’s basically a sound driver that generates sound via a thin diaphragm using a magnetic system. It’s generally pretty stable and produces minimal distortion.Its same kind of driver that resides on OPPO’s PM-1 headphones that features a FEM-optimized neodymium magnet system as well as seven-layer double side voice coil diaphragm to make it lightweight but still maintains sound quality. The drive also comes in at a rather large 55mm diameter which OPPO claims is tuned to deep, tight bass with a smooth sound signature. That essentially means you’re going to be getting some really good sound reproduction."

A let down to many that in this generation feel that screens should at least be 1080p but moving along, it’s designed with 2.5D curved glass – easing ergonomics for those concerned but being a 5-inch device, it should be a non-issue.Other internals include 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage (expandable). The mid-ranger will be equip with 4G LTE, NFC but only have a 2,050 mAh battery on board; fueling reasons to why they may have chosen the lowly Quad-core Snapdragon 410 chip, that clocks at only 1.2GHz.The device weighs in at 147grams and runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. So far the LG Class has been classified as a domestic-only product but if you’re still interested it retails at KRW 399,300 aka RM 1,451 (at that price, you’ll be able to purchase the ASUS Zenfone 2 or the OnePlus 2, if you can get an invite).

Still, if you’re one of the lucky few to have the OnePlus 2, the 2.1 update brings some new much awaited features.

Considering the brand has been hit hard even in Korea, it’s assumed that adding devices to their existing inventory could boost sales; especially since they have yet to refresh the LG G Pro 2 that was released early last year.Touted as the aforementioned phablet’s successor, the LG V10 is seen to be the maker’s answer to their domestic rivals, Samsung – a move that saw the LG G Pro 2 rival the then Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Much alike their rivals with their styluses, LG seeks to add their own twist to the mobile device world (while still copying some cues from who else, ) by adding this “ticker display”.A similar rendition of , that allows users to have a continuous info-stream on the smaller display, while the device’s main display is off. But for a better viewing experience, the LG V10’s ticker display is horizontal, so no need to turn your head or the device in horizontal orientation to view notifications – assuming that it offers the same features as the Note Edge.When looks are considered, it pretty much takes a lot after the , more so due to the lower front being empty, as the button placements are all on the back. A backing which seems to have a textured finish, based on photos.That aside, it’ll sport a 5.7-inch main display that pushes QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution, while the secondary smaller notification-like display has no mention of its pixels. In terms of it’s processor, the V10 is rumoured to carry the tried and true 6 cored Snapdragon 808 processor; aimed to play it safe and forgo issues with the Qualcomm 810’s overheating. It will have 3GB of RAM and a standard 64GB of internal memory; no mention of a microSD slot, unfortunately.Camera optics however stand at a supposed 16-megapixels for the rear camera, together with laser auto-focus and dual-LED flash but the front is where it takes an expected turn. From the image provided, it looks like LG’s V10 will have some form of dual-front facing cameras – then again these are leaks so lets not dwell much further. It could simply just be an LED flash but there is information stating that the front camera will be a 5-megapixel sensor.Rounding off, the home button might have been redesigned to house a finger-print sensor but we’re just speculating off  For now that’s pretty much all there is about this new LG device but with October the 1 not long away, the New York announcement should answer all our questions about this phablet.[  ]"

Since this is a direct import device, it appears that you would need to settle the SIRIM application yourself which would cost another RM100.

New reports by the people behind underkg seem to show the alleged “phablet” having a much smaller footprint. So what about the 5.7-inch phablet we saw in the Geekbench benchmarks?We’re not quite sure, it seems that there may be two devices out there that’s soon to be launched by LG (aside from the  in October). Though, the photo also brings confirmation of the Class being built out of real metal, not those faux metal (plastic) shells finishes.It’s well possible that LG is trying out this all metal design to combat the brand’s lack of premium feeling phones, instead of opting for those (good quality) polycarbonate designs that has made their mobile brand what it is today. A bid to unseat Samsung’s ‘A’ series perhaps? All we can say is LG G4 didn’t perform to the company’s expectations so maybe a change of direction might be good for the smartphone maker.What else does this latest report confirm? Only the fact that the images show the branding of one of South Korea’s mobile telco carrier’s, and possible pricing in the aforementioned country – KRW 400,000, roughly translating to RM 1,457. Nonetheless, LG has a tendency to release phones only for its home-country, but if you could, would you buy this device?[ ,  ]"

Dubbed as the BlackBerry Venice, this opens up a new opportunity for BlackBerry to tap into the Android segment where a built-in QWERTY keyboard is non-existent. The folks at Android Authority were lucky enough to get their hands on the Venice, giving us better views of the device and some details of its new software experience.  From their hands-on, the new slider device gets a stock Android looking interface that’s shown on a 5.4″ like display. It isn’t mentioned whether it has an actual curved display but it does have a slight “Galaxy S6 edge”-like appearance from the front. Without straying too far from its BlackBerry roots, communication is still the main focus with direct shortcuts to email, BBM messages and texting. The typical recent app interface has a slight tweak, displaying your running apps in different sizes depending on your usage. Over at the back, the camera is said to be an 18MP shooter and it comes accompanied with 2 LED flash. According to the source, this new flagship device is powered by a Snapdragon 808 processor that’s mated with 3GB of RAM. The Venice is targeted to launch sometime in November on the big 4 telcos in the US. If it is the same as the Passport, we shouldn’t wait too long for it to launch in Malaysia.

Going for a more unconventional route, leaked photos have surfaced showing the yet to be released Nexus 5 (2015) in a Mint colourway.The photo in question shows the smaller Nexus option in an angle where the polycarbonate back seems to present itself as a Mint hue. Then again this could just be a photo that had its white balance settings tweaked, so there’s no real confirmation; just to remind you, these are leaks, so take everything with a grain of salt. Along with this purported Mint colourway, it’ll join the existing (leaked) options in White and Black.That aside, no other news has surfaced to go along with this particular leak. Just to jog your memory, LG’s take on the Nexus is supposed to be a 5.2-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display, running a Hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor and built with 3GB of RAM. Based on the latest report, it’s camera capabilities will apparently come with a 12.3-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front camera.

As usual, there will be loads of people trying to get their hands on one especially in mainland China. With people willing to do almost anything to get the latest Apple product, a special kind of bank is offering an attractive way of owning iPhone 6s. Nope, you won’t even need to lose any of your  to get it and it is easier than you think. In a populous country with over a billion people, China surprisingly is in dire need to fill up 18 sperm banks around the country. Struggling to attract new donors, they have started a campaign that offers an easier way of obtaining an iPhone 6s. All they need to do is to make a donation at a sperm bank. The Hubei Human Sperm Bank had sent out a message over WeChat that links to an article entitled “New ways to get an iPhone 6s”. Inside it explains that the bank is seeking donors aged 22 to 45, with each to receive 5,000 CNY (about RM3,321) in subsidies. This in return would make them a step closer of buying an iPhone 6s that’s priced at 5,288 CNY (about RM3,512). So far there’s no word of its reception but the intimate deal has managed to get quite a lot of attention recording over 400,000 reads. You must be wondering why sperm donation is a concern in China considering they have strict population control. According to a research by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, the sperm fertility of Chinese males has been dropping by 1% each year since the 80s. With the mad desire for the latest iPhone, this is probably the safest and less excruciating route for those without cash to spare. [ ,  ]"

So far it isn’t clear it the microUSB to Type C adapter comes included in the box, but do expect this to be priced cheaply if sold separately. The rest of the specs are pretty much the same as before with a 5″ Full HD display, 2GB of RAM and the option of 16GB or 32GB of storage. For cameras, it would be utilising a 13MP main sensor at the back while the front gets a 5MP shooter. Battery is said to be more than 3,000mAh which is likely to be of the same capacity as the Mi 4i. Xiaomi’s Weibo page has been teasing its upcoming event with the title “the prince is coming”. Since this is a Chinese market device, we are not too sure if it will be sold outside mainland China. Perhaps it could come as an enhanced version of the Mi 4i which currently runs on a Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB RAM. Hopefully the USB Type C connector port supports Fast Charge with faster data transfer rates.[  ]"

It allows you to transfer existing photos, messages, contacts, calendars and more over WiFi. With Android die hard fans seeing this as a blasphemous act, they had raged a “Review” war by downloading the app and then leaving some deliberately poor ratings along with some interesting remarks. Some of the comments are hilarious with one claiming that he is turning into a sheep and another reporting the app is fake as it turned his LG G3 into a BlackBerry curve. There are those that are demanding Google to remove such app as Apple themselves would not allow such app to exist on their own App Store.

Although, the specs don’t really deserve a second glance, it’ll be fully constructed in metal, which could mean LG is changing its stance on its removable battery and plastic bodies for a more premium feel and look.Some things still remain as brand trademarks; seeing the button placements haven’t moved from the back but there seems to be a thin line that looks like a speaker grill, now nearing the top.

The camera optics of this device could be either a 12 or 13-megapixel sensor on the rear, assisted by a 5-megapixel camera on the front. Seeing that it carries the 615 chipset, it should come with LTE capabilities and will run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box.LG has already sent out invites for an event on October the 1, but that’s likely the , so it possibly means that they aren’t placing such an emphasis on their supposed phablet.

On the other hand, those on prepaid aren’t left out, as they can use their prepaid airtime balance to deduct the purchases outright.Digi’s Chief Marketing Officer, Christian Thrane shed some light on the partnership – stating that “Digi aims to be the best mobile internet provider for the mass market.” and introducing a service like Direct Billing for Google Play Store serves to add value for their 11.8 million customers.Looking at the Digi website, they’ve also support for the Windows Phone Store app, as well as the Blackberry World app – giving uses on these devices the same Direct Billing feature.The telco provider hopes that their aforementioned efforts will kick-off an echoing effect for mobile app developers to step up localised content for our market.

It was just an iPad mini 2 with TouchID and it comes available with a gold colour option. When the  was announced yesterday, they managed to slit in the iPad mini 4 into the keynote without much fanfare. So what’s new with the iPad mini 4? Surely it is better than the iPad mini 3 and it really is. As usual, there’s nothing new with the design so it still retains the unmistakable iPad mini appearance with its unibody aluminium body. However Apple has made some significant changes on the overall dimensions. It is only 6.1mm thin, which is the same as the , the thinnest for an iPad. In addition, they have also made some weight reductions bringing it down from 331g previously for the WiFi version to just 298.8g. Likewise, the WiFi + 4G Cellular versions which used to weigh 340g on the iPad mini 3 is now just 304g. The display is still the same 7.9″ incher but they have improved it with the same fully laminated display as the iPad Air 2 with additional anti reflective coating. In the camera department, it gets the same combo as the bigger iPads with an 8MP f/2.2 main camera which now brings Burst shots and Slow-mo onto an iPad mini. Meanwhile the front still gets the same 1.2MP unit.The most welcome change is the processor, where it gets a newer A8 chip but it is still a notch below the A8X chip that’s powering its top of the line iPad Air 2. Apple claims that the A8 is 1.3x faster in processing and 1.6x faster in graphics than the previous A7. With  being released very soon, the new Split View feature allowing you to run 2 apps side by side was previously exclusive just to the iPad Air 2, (and now iPad Pro) likely due to processor requirement. The new upgraded processor allows the iPad mini 4 to use split view, so this is good news for multi-taskers that prefer to use a smaller iPad. In terms of connectivity, it supports faster 802.11ac WiFi as well as Bluetooth 4.2. The battery life remains unchanged with up to 10 hours of use in a single charge.You get to pick up the iPad mini 4 in 3 colours – Silver, Space Grey and Gold. So far no word on its Malaysian availability but it won’t be as affordable as before especially with the  due to currency fluctuations. For more info, head over to the  product page."

That’s 4X the resolution of a standard Full HD 1080p clip.While most TVs and displays are still pushing full HD, there are those who prefer to capture moments in the best quality possible in 4K. There’s nothing wrong with that but the biggest concern is always on storage. With greater detail comes bigger file size and that could be a problem if you’re intending of buying the cheapest iPhone model available.MKBHD has gotten a hands-on with the new iPhone 6s and has shared some info on the new video formats. Under the settings page, a 4K video at 30fps would take around 375MB/minute of recording while a standard Full HD 1080p takes up just 130MB/minute. That’s nearly triple the file size just to shoot in the highest quality.Like most smart phones, you don’t really get the full available space as advertised as the storage is often partitioned for the operating system and bundled apps. So if you’re getting a 16GB iPhone 6s, you’re probably left about 10GB of free space once you’ve installed and set up all your essential apps. With just 10GB, that leaves you with enough space for just 27 minutes of 4K video. If 4K video recording is your thing, it is recommended that you take at least the 64GB model or 128GB if you could afford that extra premium. Alternatively, you can free up more space from time to time with the , which is like a thumb drive for your phone. With Apple’s premium iPhone pricing that continues to  in Malaysia, it is high time for them to kill off the paltry 16GB model.

Apple’s take on the TV set-top box is now bigger, more powerful and built with Siri to assist you through the new operating system.An overhaul that sees it now carrying a powerful 64-bit A8 CPU and PowerVR GX6450 GPU, together with 2GB of RAM. Significant jumps in each category; that sees Apple also adding more internal storage (32GB or 64GB), a better WiFi radio (802.11ac) and even a redesigned tvOS.A great operating system that will see the Apple TV now support Apps and have an accelerometer and gyroscope on its newest remote. Connectors on the small black box are similar on past editions, a power, HDMI and an ethernet port.With an addition of the app store for tvOS, Apple hopes that its third-party developers will expand and further the device’s functionality that places a new emphasis on gaming. You’ll be using the newly designed remote that comes with a glass touch pad on the top end that connects to your box through Bluetooth 4.0.Embracing voice-recognition and utilising Siri as its personal assistant, it’ll be one of the best ways to interact with your Apple TV but currently only has support in these 8 countries:For everyone elsewhere, the Siri button on the new controller will only get you to an “open the on-screen search app”. It’ll probably have the same traits as its predecessor, only with larger search functionality. Don’t be downhearted, if you’re initial thoughts were to pick it up, because Apple usually rolls support as the device’s lifetime lengthens.You’ll be able to ask the female personal assistant things like:Apple TV’s gaming experience will now have a shot at rivaling the Nintendo Wii, thanks to the new Siri remote that includes the accelerometer and gyroscope. During the keynote we saw a multiplayer game dubbed Crossy Road, which allows users to tether an iPod Touch or iPhone as an additional remote.Also demoed, was Beat Sports, a music and sports combo that sends music timed baseballs for you to hit. Apple’s main showcase to its new gaming element will be Disney Infinity 3.0, Guitar Hero Live and Rayman Adventures’, surely pleasing a wide range of gamers out there.A further extension of apps bring about a demonstration of online shopping directly on Apple TV, thanks to companies like Gilt – giving Apple an edge when compared to other set-top boxes out there. Obviously they won’t be leaving out the main purpose of the device, providing TV enthusiasts the viewing tools to get push notifications for game-time moments in live sports games.Potentially a great living room companion, the Apple TV starts shipping towards the end of October in 80 countries and will go for $149 / RM 641 (32GB) and $199 / RM 856 (64GB).

A promising candidate to make an appearance is the HTC One A9 (Aero) – a device that for the past few weeks leading up, has leaked quite a bit.The main game changer for HTC latest device, could be the processor that runs it; an assumed Deca-core (10) Helio X20 MT6797 chipset. Created with a tri-cluster system, the chipset’s supposed stats has finally been seen successfully testing its capabilities on Geekbench; topping the former number one Exynos 7420 carrying Samsung Galaxy S6 (4,547) by 1,337 marks.Other rumoured details of the smartphone include a 2.5D curve edged screen, that pushes a QHD resolution and protected by Gorilla Glass 4. It’s also purported to have 4GB of RAM and house an f/1.9 aperture camera (welcomed news, seeing that HTC’s cameras has suffered as of late).HTC’s One A9 is likely to run Android 5.1 out of the box with the usual Sense skin on top and could prove to be a very powerful device.

It gets even more complicated when you travel across the 2 countries. Telin Malaysia, a subsidiary of PT Telkom Indonesia and U Mobile have introduced a first of its kind two in one SIM Card for seamless cross border communication. The SIM is called KartuAs 2 in 1 and it runs on U Mobile as an MVNO along with its parent company, Telkom Indonesia for its service in our neighbouring country. Essentially this is a Prepaid SIM that holds both Malaysian and Indonesian mobile numbers. Its allows you to make affordable IDD calls to Indonesia and those in Indonesia can call you at local rates to your 2nd number. When you travel between Malaysia and Indonesia, there’s no roaming charges and you get to enjoy low rates like a local. This is like having the benefit of dual-SIM cards and all you’ll need is one card. The KartuAs 2 in 1 SIM Pack is sold at RM10.60 (inclusive of 6% GST) and it comes preloaded with RM5 and Rp 2,000 credit for each respective numbers.

A brave venture, considering that when the device will go on sale is still unknown; even crazier is the fact that Apple’s keynote only happens tomorrow.Pitching himself outside the extremely well-lit store located on George Street (the same store we visited to check out the ), has so far spent a day on his fold-able chair and tent combo. His intentions are based on past instances of the Oceanic country being one of the first to have the latest Apple products in store.Handmer has taken this brief moment of fame to (shamelessly) plug his self-created online secondhand technology marketplace, mysparetech.com, since seeing that other individuals have done it prior during their own line-up adventures. Apple’s iPhones tend to hit shelves around the 18 of September, if they’re sticking to their existing habits, Handmer will be out in the 12-17 degree Celsius weather for quite some time.Apart of his marketing stunt, the Australian won’t be purchasing the device for himself, instead he intends to auction the device(s) off for a charitable cause – , a startup that helps the homeless. He’s said that so far “it’s an up and down process” when asked about his experience so far going 24 hours in to the camp-out and had times where he questioned his decision to do so.The legality of it all is kind of up in the air, at least as far as Handmer is concerned, as the police officers he momentarily crossed paths with only pulled up to head into the nearby McDonald’s – at least for now. When more people join in the craze, he plans on keeping the atmosphere high by getting some party lights and music.It’ll be interesting to see how long he lasts out there but he’s fortunate enough to have a 24/7 McDonald’s and some gyms around the vicinity if he needs to get some food and freshen-up. Best of all, he’ll have some company during the weekend, when his fiance joins in.These occurrences are never bad for Apple but the employees at the Sydney store have some raised eyebrows at how the first potential person to purchase the latest iPhone uses a Dell laptop, together with a HTC phone. When asked about this, Handmer merely quipped that “Apple makes great products, but I guess I like the more technical stuff. Android, for those type of things.” and “I just tend to opt for the more affordable side of stuff.”If you’re interested to prepare yourself for a similar adventure, you can follow his journey on .Share with us your best experiences of lining up to purchase something, we’d surely like to hear about it in the comments below.[  ]"

Having spent some time with the  in London, we’re looking forward how the Malaysian market reacts to this device, possibly outclassing the Huawei P8 in the process.The honor series has raised the bar since releasing their latest device in Europe, which boasts a metal chassis, a first for the honor lineup. Perhaps honor has taken a new turn, as they’ve announced during the release in UK that they want to reach out to the new generation. Capturing the youth is a daunting task but it gets easier if you have an affordable, yet great looking product.Recapping some specs, the honor 7 carries a 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x1080) IPS-Neo display. Underneath the metal-clad body is a home-grown 64-bit Octa-core Kirin 935 processor, coupled with 3GB of RAM for zippy performance.Internationally, it gets 16GB of on-board storage, opposed to China’s huge 64GB step up option. Luckily there’s support for a microSD card up to 128GB for your expanded storage needs.Photo bugs will be pleased by the larger 20-megapixel sensor (f/2.0 aperture) that makes up the back of the device, along with its finger-print sensor module. On the front, selfies will be taken by an 8-megapixel shooter with soft flash.The lights will be kept on thanks to a 3,100 mAh battery that supports quick charge (0-50% in 30 minutes). A feature packed device that weighs in at 157 grams and 8.5mm thick. Operating system-wise it runs on EMUI 3.1 over Android 5.0 Lollipop.Malaysians love a bargain but there’s no info on the pricing as the vmall  leads to nothing (we checked), a bug that we hope the webmasters can sort out since many would be interested in this device. Its predecessor was launched at RM999 but the latest honor could see the price hover around RM 1,200 to RM 1,300, mainly dependent on how our currency continues to float on trading. We’re most probably going to hear something from the China based company soon regarding its pricing, as they usually do so before sales kick off.In the mean time, you can watch our hands-on of the honor 7 below:

Apple has even stepped up the personalisation of their two (out of three) watch models.App developers are now tooled to improve their apps thanks to watchOS 2, letting them play around with the watch’s hardware, opening doors to apps like iTranslate; for giving you voice translations on the fly, or the GoPro app, that lets you use your watch display as a viewfinder.Innovating in other fields like those involved in medicine, AirStip has already existed on other iDevices (iPhone and iPad) but with an upgrade to watchOS 2, the app now gives medical practitioners and the hospital team easier accessibility to patient records and their health readings.Daily rounds are displayed on the app, connecting the team within a network that lets them communication and share patient data on a more productive level. Time travel is now enabled and turning the digital crown lets you go through your daily rounds schedule to see upcoming patient visits and other appointments.

Sensors placed on the mother’s belly allows this and doctors can get an NST reading straight after the mother does a test at home – making the whole affair a more practical one.To the aesthetic side of things, Apple now adds to its collaboration list with Hermes joining forces to provide luxury watch bands and its own distinctive watch face with Hermes iconography. Hand-stitched leather in 3 options the Double Tour ($1,250/RM5,465), Single Tour ($1,100/RM4,852), and Cuff ($1,500/RM6,557) seems to be Apple’s venture into the more fashionable side of smart wearables.The French artisans made the first option to wrap twice around your wrist, coupling feminine elegance with security of mind. Available for the 38mm stainless steel case, this leather band will come in 4 colours – Fauve, Etain, Capucine and Bleu Jean.Wrapping only once around your wrist, the Single Tour attempts to appeal to both men and women and are available in the 38mm and 42mm stainless steel case. However, the single only comes in the Fauve and Noir, with an additional Capucine band for the 38mm.Hermes caps it off with the Cuff leather option, said to be created to stay in contact with the wrist better for a more accurate heart rate monitoring. It is only available in the 42mm stainless steel case in a Fauve colourway.Subsequently, Apple has also been busy updating their own designs, as two new finishes are now added to the line-up – Gold and Rose gold (38mm and 42mm) are now available in iodised aluminium. Two great colours that maintain the pricing of the original sports line up ($ 349/RM1,526 for 38mm, $ 399/RM1,736 for 42mm). There’s also a product RED version of the stainless steel case, which will have part its proceeds directed towards fighting AIDS.Although most of the updates are already available, the Hermes collection and watchOS 2 are slated to be out in October and September the 16, respectively. Unfortunately, Malaysia is once again left out of the list, so we’ll wait and see if Apple decides otherwise in the future.[  ]"

In our last , most of you  the , followed by the  as the camera of choice.With the  released with a similar 16MP sensor, is it better than the rest of today’s new smart phones? To find out, we’ve taken pictures with 10 devices and we are letting you decide which is the better shooter.For this shootout, we have the Galaxy Note5, the Galaxy S6 edge, iPhone 6, OnePlus 2, Sony Xperia M5, honor 7, HTC One E9+, Xiaomi Mi Note, Huawei P8 and the LG G4. The Galaxy S6 edge has an impressive camera and the new Note5 shouldn’t be far off. Following closely is the LG G4 which boast a similar 16MP sensor, faster f/1.8 lens and it comes assisted with Laser AF. In terms of pixel count, the Sony Xperia M5, honor 7 and HTC One E9+ leads on paper with its 20MP+ sensor. Like everything we’ve seen in the past, a higher pixel count doesn’t necessary represent higher quality. The Xperia M5 and honor 7 looks promising as it uses Sony’s latest IMX230 sensor that has Phase Detection AF for faster focus. While we are at it, we’ve also thrown in the Xiaomi Mi Note, Huawei P8 and the OnePlus 2 that comes with a 13MP camera with OIS. Of course, we can’t forget the iPhone 6. It might have the lowest pixel count at just 8MP but it is still impressive with its ease of use and snappy response. We want you to pick the top 3 photos from each set. For example, here’s how you can rank the top 3 pictures in Set 1, from best to worst: I, E, C. Just so you know, the smart phones are randomised so each alphablet represents a different device in each set. Then the reader proceeds to rank sets 2 – 4. So your votes should appear something like this:Submit your votes in the comment section down, we’ll tabulate the results. Voting closes on Sunday, 13th September and we will reveal the results on the following Monday on the same post. Head to the  to view the pictures and enjoy!"
Alexander Wong,Meet the 12.9″ iPad Pro. Apple’s answer to convergence devices,,"apple ipad pro,Apple iPad Pro Launch,Convergence Devices,iOS,iOS 9,iPad,iPad Pro,iPad Pro Announcement,iPad Pro Malaysia,Tablet","iOS,iPad,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"The  has revolutionised the way we consume content on a portable device. It started the whole tablet mania and it became the world’s  consumer product in history. For those needing to do some serious work on the go, the iPad still works but it isn’t as cut out as a real workhorse like the MacBook Air. With , the next big wave seems to be focused on convergence devices that blurs the line between tablet and PC like the . And that’s where Apple is heading with its new iPad Pro that was announced today at San Francisco. Designed as the ultimate media consumption and productivity tool, the iPad Pro is their largest tablet yet with a huge 12.9″ Retina Display that does 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution. This gives 78% more display area than its current iPad Air 2 and it pushes the same pixel density of 264 pixels per inch. It is 6.9mm thick, the same thickness as the  but thicker than the iPad Air at 6.1mm. Being a bigger device, it is heavier as well at 713 grams for WiFi and 723 grams for the Cellular version. As comparison, the original iPad weighs in at 680 grams for WiFi and it goes as much as 730 grams for the 3G + WiFi model. Like the rest of the iPad range, the exterior design is typical iPad and it gets a TouchID enabled home button along with Silver, Gold and Space Grey colour options.What makes this a productivity beast is on the inside. With a newer iOS 9 out of the box, you get more multi-tasking features which include split screen along with more shortcuts to get things done quicker. The A9X 64-bit chip on-board is their most powerful mobile processor yet with almost twice the power of the A8X chip found on the iPad Air 2. Setting the iPad Pro apart from the mainstream iPad is its new Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessory. Now this is starting to look like a Surface fighting device. The Smart Keyboard is sold separately as a US$169 option (about RM730) and doubles up as a smart cover with a keyboard built-in. It consists of 64 seamless keys that’s spill resistant. The fabric microfiber of the cover is just 3.2mm thin while the keys pops up slightly at 4mm with its spring-like tension feedback. Attaching the Smart Keyboard onto the iPad is seamless which lets you snap on and use immediately without the need of wireless pairing. Unlike the Surface which has ridges on the sides, the iPad Pro connectors are flush with its 3 smart connector pins. Steve Jobs used to poked fun at the stylus when the iPhone was introduced. For its new productivity product, they have finally introduced one as the Apple Pencil. This adds another freehand interaction which gives you the familiarity of a pencil. Boasting a 240 times per second response time, drawing claims to be more real time with no noticeable lags and it recognises pressure from a gentle touch to thicker stroke lines. It even supports shading when drawn sideways, as if you’re drawing with a charcoal pencil. During the keynote, they have invited Microsoft and Adobe on stage to demonstrate the Pencil’s editing capability for both MS Office and Photoshop. The Apple Pencil lasts 12 hours on a single charge which is juiced up with its lightning connector hidden underneath its silicon cap at the end. To charge it, you’ll need to plug it into the iPad Pro, which would probably look awkward if you’re carrying it while on the go. Thankfully it manages to rejuice an impressive 30 minutes of battery life from a mere 15 second charge. The Apple Pencil is sold separately at US$99 which is about RM427. One minor gripe is there’s no place for you to keep the Pencil on the iPad Pro and it doesn’t even come with a clip for you to hook it onto the case or a folder. Perhaps that might come as another optional accessory.So for the full productivity suite, the Smart Keyboard and  pencil will set you back close to RM1,200. Quite a substantial amount to pay compared to the ‘s Type Cover Keyboard and Pen costing RM479 and RM189 respectively. For video and music playback, the iPad Pro boasts 4 speakers with a pair of stereo speakers mounted on the top and bottom which rotates according to the orientation you’re in. For imaging, it gets the same 8MP f/2.4 main camera and a front facing 1.2MP HD Facetime unit as the iPad Air 2. Even with its bigger display and power processor, the iPad Pro still pushes its same 10 hour battery life on a single charge. At this point, you probably know that the iPad Pro will not come cheap. This is going to be a very niche device like the 12.2″ Samsung Galaxy NotePro 12.2 and its higher end model is actually pricier than a full blown MacBook Air 11″ with 128GB at US$899 (RM3,391 Malaysian RRP). With the thinner MacBook around, the iPad Pro potentially could replace the MacBook Air completely. After all, you could run all your regular office and designing chores with iOS versions of MS Office and Photoshop. The iPad Pro starts from US$799 (about RM3,462) for the 32GB WiFi model, while the larger 128GB unit is sold at US$949 (about RM4,112). For the all round connectivity with 4G LTE support, the 128GB WiFi + Cellular version is priced at US$1,079 (about RM4,700). The iPad Pro goes on sale in November just ahead of the Christmas shopping season. For more details, you can check out Apple’s  product page."
Alexander Wong,Want to get the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus? This is how much it will cost to buy one overseas,,"apple,Buy iPhone 6S,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia,iPhone 6S Plus Price,iPhone 6S Plus Pricing,iPhone 6S Price,iPhone 6S Pricing","Android,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"Let’s face it. Malaysia isn’t going to be in the first wave for iPhone releases anytime soon. So if you’re trying to get your hands on the latest  and , your best bet is to get from the first wave of countries which will commence pre-orders this Saturday, 12th September with stocks shipping on 25th September. This includes Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, United Kingdom and United States.If you got a friend or relative abroad, buying one overseas is better than getting an overpriced unit through enterprising scalpers. So how much does it cost to get one overseas? Head after the break to find out.In our current exchange rates,  and  are your best options right now with the iPhone 6S priced below RM3,300 for the 16GB version. Of course, 16GB won’t cut it for most power users so the 64GB iPhone 6S option is the next alternative but be prepared to fork out around RM3,800 for it. Surprisingly the iPhone 6S in 64GB, iPhone 6S Plus in 64GB/128GB are cheaper in Australia but do note that these are based on the today’s rates. If don’t mind paying more to be among the first to use it, you can start pre-ordering this Saturday at 3.01PM in Singapore or 5.01PM in Australia Eastern Standard Time. As the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus took about 2 months from its official announcement to arrive in Malaysia, the newer models could be launched here sometime in November. Looking at how Apple increased the price for several , getting the latest models would be an expensive affair but there’s always people willing to pay that extra premium for a shinny new Apple product."
Alexander Wong,The iPhone and iPad gets another price hike in Malaysia,,"Apple Malaysia,iPad,iPad Air,iPad Air 2,iPad Air 2 Malaysia,iPad Air 2 Malaysia price,iPad Mini,iPhone,iPhone 5C,iPhone 6,iPhone 6 Malaysia,iPhone 6 Plus,iPhone 6 Plus Malaysia,iPhone 6 price,iPhone 6 price Malaysia,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6S Malaysia Price","iOS,iPad,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"Shortly after the announcement of the latest ,  and , the Malaysian Apple Online Store has made some price revisions on its product line up. With no surprises, most of the current iPhone and iPad models are getting a price increase, no thanks to our weakening currency exchange rate. The iPhone 6 Plus costs as much as RM149 extra while the iPad gets price hike as much as RM459. Overall all models are getting an increase with the exception of the iPhone 6 16GB and iPhone 5S 16GB which have gotten a slight dip of a couple of ringgit. For the iPad range, the iPad mini 2 gets a slight reduction which is to be expected for an ageing model. Below is the current full price list with the  price. For the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, this marks the 3rd price increase since it went on sale late last year and the recent hike was when the  on 1st April. When the iPhone 6 Plus 64GB was initially launched, it was priced at RM3,149 and now it is sold at RM3,699. That’s RM550 more since launch which is about 17% increase after a year. Suddenly buying iPhones are looking like an investment if you bought one early. Apart from having the 128GB version discontinued, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus no longer has the Gold colour option.  So if you’re looking for gold, you need to look for the latest iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.  So for the newer iPhones, be prepared to pay more once they get here. From the looks of it, it would take probably another 2 months and we can only hope that our currency doesn’t slide down further against the dollar."
Alexander Wong,"iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus announced with upgraded specs, tougher materials and it’s thicker than before",,"apple,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s announcement,iPhone 6s launch,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia","Android,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"Apple has just announced its new  and the larger  phablet, and like every iPhone “S” model, it is an update over its previous model without having an all new design. This time around, it is more than just incremental performance upgrades. The new iPhone 6s uses tougher materials to silence its  critics and it incorporates its Force Touch and Taptic engine features from the . There’s also a new colour for the iPhone that’s called Rose Gold.This is possibly the biggest iPhone incremental “model update” since the .  Like the iPhone 6/6 Plus duo, the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus retains the same 4.7″ and 5.5″ Retina Display option. No changes in display resolution but underneath its metal unibody shell is an upgraded 64-bit A9 chip that promises up to 70% better performance over its previous A8 processor. The M9 motion co-processor that keeps track of your activities is now integrated onto the A9 chip, which helps to improve performance and battery life. Now it gets the additional ability to track your running as well as your walking pace in addition to steps, distance and elevation. While the overall design looks the same as the previous model, the iPhone 6s/6s Plus is actually slightly bulkier and heavier than its predecessor. This is probably due to its new use of material that comprises of 7000 series Aluminium, the strongest they’ve ever fitted on an iPhone and special dual ion‑exchange process glass which they claim to be the strongest in the smart phone industry. As a result, it adds 0.1-0.2mm to its thickness, width and length. The weight should be noticeably heavier with 14 grams extra on the iPhone 6s (6s: 143g, 6: 129g) and 20 grams more on the iPhone 6s Plus (6s Plus: 192g, 6 Plus: 172g). In terms of colours, Apple is still retaining the same Silver, Space Grey and Gold but it now gets a Rose Gold colour option which is a more feminine with a pink hue. Nothing has changed in terms of storage as Apple continues the same 16GB, 64GB and 128GB capacity options. Personally we wished Apple had killed the 16GB option and set 32GB as the bare minimum for a flagship. After toying around with Force Touch trackpads and watches, the pressure sensitive tech has finally made its way onto the iPhone as 3D Touch. This gives the multi-touch display another form of interaction as it is able to differentiate soft to hard presses. With a gentle touch, you can now preview links while hard presses bring up additional shortcuts and menus on iOS 9. From the home screen, you can jump straight into selfie or slow-mo videos by hard pressing on the camera icon. Alternatively you can jump straight to Inbox or New Message when you do the same on the Mail icon. In short, this is like having a right click function on a computer. Developers can also take advantage of 3D Touch as well with games making use of the finger pressure for additional controls. The iPhone 6s/6s Plus also gets a Taptic engine which gives a more immersive feedback as you force touch into the display. Like the Apple Watch, this gives you a sensation of a glass being tapped or pressing through the glass that feels more realistic than the conventional buzzing vibration. Speaking of touch, the Touch ID fingerprint scanner has been improved with its 2nd generation unit, promising quicker response time than before.As the competition  its camera capabilities, Apple has finally upgraded its iSight camera in pixel count from 8MP to 12MP with f/2.2 aperture. This is the first major camera upgrade since the iPhone 4S. It still gets dual-tone LED flash for more natural lit pictures while the 6s Plus has the additional feature of Optical Image Stabilisation. Finally 4K Video recording is supported and you can make ultra high resolution movies on the fly with its built-in editing tools.For Selfies, the front FaceTime HD camera has been upgraded from 1.2MP to 5MP f/2.4. To illuminate your face in the low light conditions, the new iPhones get Retina Flash, which basically increases the front display brightness by 3X as a light source.  Another neat feature is Live Photos where it starts shooting before the point of shooting a picture until after a few seconds after that. This gives you a short clip which actually consists of multiple shots and it is done automatically on every single photo that you take, which is kind of similar to HTC’s Zoe. To preview the Live Photo, just simply press harder onto a picture in the gallery for a quick playback. Only for the US, Apple has introduced its  where anyone can switch to the latest iPhone every single year. It works quite similar to  where you sign up for a 24 months installment plan with an added option to change phone every 12 months. According to Apple, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be priced the same as its predecessor at launch and they have reduced the price of its current models. The iPhone 6 Plus in the US carries the same contract price tag as iPhone 6s. With immediate effect, the iPhone 5C has been discontinued, making the iPhone 5S their new entry-level smart phone available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are still in the market but it is now limited to just 16GB and 64GB options. Colour wise, you’re limited to just Space Grey and Silver. So if you want to get a gold iPhone, you’ll have to go for the very latest model. Pre-order starts this Saturday on 12th September with official sales to begin on 25th September in first wave countries. As usual Malaysia won’t be among the early batch of countries but if you want, you can try your luck in , ,  and . When it gets here, we can only assume there will be another round of price hike due to our weakening Malaysian Ringgit against the dollar which currently stands at US$1 = RM4.34.

With the recent  in Malaysia, U Mobile appears to be the only telco selling the device outright on prepaid and it is a more affordable than the usual market price.With its U Mobile Prepaid bundles, the iPhone 6 16GB costs just RM1,982 and it calculates to just RM2,395.60 in total inclusive of the required top up and refundable upfront payment. That’s cheaper than the  asking price for the same unit without contract. Since U Mobile prepaid has no contract, you can leave at anytime but you’ll lose out the potential savings from the upfront payment rebates that goes into your credit balance over 24 months. Still, this is a better option than buying one outright.If you look at the iPhone 6 Plus offer, the largest 128GB is going for RM3,381 all in (inclusive of GST, upfront top up and payment). That’s cheaper than the iPhone 6 Plus 64GB  currently. Interested? You can head over to  and it appears that some models in specific colours are already out of stock.

With a V10 branding behind along with what looks like a textured backing, it seems that LG is considering the notion of releasing a successor to the LG G Pro 2. What’s most interesting about this just certified device is it carries a smaller display on top of its larger one, next to the camera and flash modules.Previously, its predecessor was considered to be LG’s answer to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 but this “ticker” display could possibly set it apart from other large phablets in the same category. This secondary screen could be used to display notifications and other information that would otherwise clutter the primary screen.Sharing a lot of qualities of the smaller G4, it seems to look the part as well – utilising the back-placed power buttons and volume rockers, as seen on the aforementioned smaller smart phone. Regarding the unannounced phablet’s power button, it looks like LG tweaked the design, making it rounder – could this redesign house a finger-print sensor for biometric security?Internally, it’s purported to carry the same Hexa-core Snapdragon 808 processor, mated with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage (expandable with a microSD slot). However, being a phablet, word from  goes to state that it’ll have a 5.7-inch QHD display. Camera optics supposedly will be powered by a 16-megapixel rear shutter (a great camera, from what we’ve seen on the LG G4) and a 5-megapixel sensor on the front.We’ve seen this concept before from its Korean competitors, ; though still unsure what this “innovation” could bring to the current market as it is. Sources say that we won’t have to wait too long, as the device should be announced sometime in October. What do you think the functionality of the second display could mean for the LG “V10”?[ ,  ]"

Improving over the current HTC One M9, the new device is purported to have a 2.5D curve edge screen at the moment, for a smoother feel around the edges. The screen is reported to be pushing Quad HD resolution and it is toughen by Gorilla Glass 4. In terms of camera, the new unit is said to be having a f/1.9 camera and hopefully it is a huge improvement over its current average HTC One M8/M9 shooters.If the image of the Aero above is real, it looks quite similar to the current iPhone 6 with its metal body and antenna band lines. Can this new flagship  around? Alongside the new HTC One A9 (Aero), the international variant of the  is expected to make its debut offering waterproof capabilities.

It also packs a 20.2MP Duo Camera at the back and a front facing 13MP shooter for higher resolution selfies.

Seeing this problem has placed smartphone manufacturers left to choose between mediating the overheating issue or omitting the infamous chipset all together. Weighing two sides of the coin, Sony has decided to take the riskier route.For one the Z5 Premium, it seemed that no other component would’ve been more appropriate to push its 4K screen. So how did Sony attempt to keep temps low? A teardown revealed that Sony has built a special dual heat pipe on the upper part of the smartphone’s frame to improve ventilation. In addition, they’ve also added thermal regulating paste underneath the processing chip to further regulate its running temps.Not a lot of news has surfaced regarding how Sony’s latest offering handles multitasking, gaming and larger processing extensive tasks, so it seems like there’s a lot of real-world testing to be done.

While the current Android Lollipop is gaining momentum taking up 21% (inclusive of Android 5.0 and 5.1), majority of Android devices are still running on KitKat which stands at 39.2%. What’s more surprising is that a substantial number of devices are still running on versions that are more than 2 years old. If you look at the chart above, a total of 31.8% of Android devices are still on Jelly Bean which covers Android 4.1 to 4.3, making it the 2nd highest used right after KitKat. Meanwhile the rest of the older versions including Ice Cream Sandwich, Gingerbread and Froyo stands under 5%, which mostly should be retired by now. While the upgrades from KitKat from Jelly Bean seems to be fast, the fact remains that most devices are still being left behind without much software updates. This is partly due to respective device makers that have ended software support for older models or are simply reluctant to make the switch to newer versions in favour of its own custom UI. Some brands especially from China have re-skinned the interface so much, it looks anything but an Android device. Of course, being an open platform, the adventurous ones can find a way to get the latest OS with the use of Custom ROMs. Unlike Apple or BlackBerry where its has better control over both hardware and software, the Android environment is quite vibrant which sometimes is seen to be fragmented.

Numbers which rose by 42% and 15%, in the two aforementioned categories, compared to the same half of 2014. Predominately, sales were geared towards makers from China and Taiwan for smartphones and the tablet space still leans towards global vendors.These numbers tell a different story, if you’ve been keeping tabs on the recent downward spiral of the Ringgit’s trading value, GST implementation and other of the country’s uncertainties. Seems like the rise in figures are tied to most mobile tech manufacturers adapting a wider ranger of devices that also cater to those looking for a more affordable option. Smartphones hovering around RM 500, pre-bundled with SIM plans and larger tablet slates going for less than RM 300, seemed to make a difference.Taking a look at who received the biggest slice of the pie, numbers by Apple and its Korean competitor Samsung fell opposed to past performances. When looking at the other makers from China and Taiwan, they’ve managed to scrap on by through maintaining their competitive stance on pricing and targeting the local market based on their needs.Nonetheless, Samsung still sits pretty at the top, with a huge majority of 40% – sales coming from their mid-rangers and lower-end models, the Galaxy J series and Galaxy V smartphone. Surprisingly, Samsung’s top of the line Galaxy S6 and S6 edge didn’t stir up a lot of figures.Other major players in the same league were, Asus (20%), Apple (15%), Lenovo (13%) and Huawei (12%). Asus had the ZenFone 5 and the Zenfone 2 to thank, keeping it as number two in an already competitive market segment. More premium in the eyes of the world, Apple held steadily in third position, while the last two let their more budget friendly options do the work: the A319 and A7000 for Lenovo and Huawei’s Honor series leading the way.Tablets, while still performed positively, didn’t have the same rapid adoptive rates, unlike smartphones. Fingers could be pointed that due to the devices costing more, buyers might reconsider purchasing as the larger screened devices don’t always boast a better spec sheet. In similar fashion, Samsung has the largest piece with 30% – sales mostly coming from the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0.The rest of the pie is shared by Lenovo, Apple, Asus and Acer; Lenovo shares the number two spot with Apple (27% each). Asus had about 13% driven by its 7-inch Fonepad 7, while Acer’s telco team-up, managed to get the Iconia Tab A1-713 rolling as well.Have you personally felt the pinch? Will you lengthen your product’s life and no longer upgrade as frequently as you previously did? Does it change how you’ll go about purchasing your mobile tech devices?

Arif Lee,Samsung Galaxy View could be a 18.4-inch (coffee) table(t),,"IFA 2015,IFA2015,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy View,tablets","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-09-04,"Mostly hush-hush on this purported tablet, Samsung thought it’d be a great idea to give us a look at the alleged 18.4-inch tablet. Going as the Galaxy View, it made its brief appearance at the end of the Samsung livestream during IFA 2015, earlier in the day.Looking like a propped up Microsoft Surface with its own kick-stand, the Galaxy View left us asking more questions as Samsung only hinted with a couple of phrases for us to put together: “think bigger” and “a new dimension of entertainment”. Oh and they mentioned that more information about this huge “tablet” will be out come October.If the device’s screen does indeed come at an 18.4-inch size, we’re left mystified as to why earlier reports state that it’ll only pack a 1920 x 1080 display (works out to about 119 ppi), a lowly resolution for a screen that size. In terms of processing it packs a bigger punch – thanks to an assumed Exynos 7580 processor, together with 2GB of RAM. The earlier report labels the device as For in-built storage the device apparently carries 32GB of internal memory that can be expandable through a microSD card. The report also mentions that the device carries an 8-megapixel rear shutter, while the front only gets a lowly 2.1-megapixel camera. Being quite a large display, the device will measure 451.8mm x 275.8mm x 11.9mm and feature a 5700 mAh battery powering it.Currently, Samsung’s largest tablet in their line-up is the Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and it runs a QHD (2560 x 1600) screen. Will Samsung let its latest multimedia consuming tablet only run at a 119 ppi? We’ll only find out in October. Then again the earlier reports are just rumours, so don’t think Samsung has dropped the ball, just yet."

Though, we’re likely to always go back to the circle, eventually. Samsung decided to do that very thing, leaving the square faced Gear S for its latest Circular UX Gear S2.Thanks to the circular bezel, it rotates to navigate – interaction with the screen without obstructing views on the 1.2-inch (360 x 360) screen. On the device, other than the rotating bezel navigation you’ll have a home button and a back button to help make your way around the OS.Tempting potential smart watch owners with two user focused designs: the quick detachable silicon band on the Gear S2 and the timeless 22mm leather band on the Gear S2 Classic – allowing buyers to choose based on their lifestyle preferences.Thin and compact at 11-4mm thin (non-3G), the aforementioned screen will allow you to view your notifications on its home-grown Tizen OS running a 1GHz dual-core processor. Utilising a 24-hour activity log, its functions include calendar, e-mail and news glances, as well as text notifications.For the first time ever, the Gear S2 will also come with an e-SIM option that runs on a 3G network.

Partnering with organisations will allow Samsung to offer a range of visual watch faces and watch bands, allowing you to fully customise your wearable to make it your own.Water resistant with a water and dust resistant IP68 rating across all variants, so the Gear S2 can be worn during any sweat earning activities and it’ll allow you to track your movements through its activity tracker (inclusive of an accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate sensor and so on).The 3 models differ in dimensions slightly and are listed below:All three will run the same aforementioned processor and come with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal memory. They’ll also be equip with Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 for the internet and pairing. Samsung brought great news to its wearable users as the new Gear S2 will now work with other Android devices (not restricted to its Samsung smart phones). Prerequisites for pairing are the smart phone runs Android 4.4 and above, as well as at least 1.5GB of RAM.Slated to go on sale from October onwards, this smart wearable will be  at 349 / approx RM 1,645 (Gear S2, non-3G) and  399 / approx RM 1,880 (Gear S2 classic) in Europe but no information has come to light on the price of the 3G version.

If you include GST, that comes up to RM1,788 outright and we are not sure if this is the 16GB or 64GB storage version. As comparison, the US pricing for the OnePlus 2 stands at US$329 (about RM1,418) for 16GB and US$389 (about RM1,676) for the 64GB version., so it is more likely we are getting the higher option. The current  with 64GB is priced officially at RM1,199 (excluding GST). For a more affordable way of owning the device, Maxis is also offering the OnePlus 2 on its  program from RM58/month. This comes up to RM1,392 across 24 months if you don’t plan to upgrade mid-way.

Powering the device is a larger 3,300mAh capacity battery which is non-removable. Some of the new features for the OnePlus 2 includes a USB Type C connector, one-touch fingerprint scanner at the front and a new notification alert slider on the left side of the device.

Since Maxis has launched its new , you now have a third alternative which is something worth considering if you hate to be tied down with 24 month lock-in periods that comes with nasty penalty charges. To refresh your memory, the Zerolution programme is a new way of owning a new smart phone and it comes with added device protection in a form of an insurance as well as the option to swap to a new phone after 12 months. There’s no hefty upfront payments and you can leave at any time without any penalty charges as long as you settle the remainder of your monthly installments in full.The Galaxy Note5 is offered at RM138/month while the Galaxy S6 edge+ can be yours at RM156/month. These installment figures are inclusive of its RM30/month early upgrade fee, which allows you to swap to a new device after 12 months and RM15/month for extra device protection which covers theft and all sorts of damages to your device. Note that for the early device upgrade to happen, you would need to ensure that your device is in pristine condition, hence they have recommended the optional device protection offer. If the device is returned in unacceptable conditions, a RM300 fee might apply when you make a swap.Even if you don’t plan to upgrade or need the extra device protection, the Galaxy Note5 effectively costs RM93/month, which in 24 months cost a total of RM2,232. That’s RM467 cheaper than the full retail price of RM2,699. The Galaxy S6 edge+ would effectively cost RM2,664 in the same calculation, which is a RM435 savings from its RM3,099 outright price.Of course, the catch is that you’ll need to subscribe to their  which starts from RM98/month. That comes with unlimited calls, SMS and 1GB of data. For every additional 2GB of data, it will cost you RM30/month extra.

During sign up, you’ll need to fork out between RM180 to RM1,300 as advance payment but this  if you pay by credit card with its EPP option.

Alexander Wong,Compared: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ Malaysian Telco Pricing,,"Celcom,Comparison,DiGi,Dual Sim,Maxis,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Price,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus price,samsung malaysia,Telco Comparison,Telco Price Comparison,U Mobile","Android,Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,Samsung,U Mobile",2015-09-04,"Want to buy the latest  or  but not sure which telco plan is the right one for you? We’ve compared the current postpaid contract offers in Malaysia, to assist you with your purchase decision. Outright, the Galaxy Note5 is priced at RM2,699 and the S6 edge+ is at RM3,099, inclusive of 6% GST. Buying one without a contract is probably the most convenient way to go but you could save some money with telco subsidies. At the moment, our 4 main telcos – Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile have started their contract bundle plans for the Galaxy Note 5, while the S6 edge+ is offered by everyone except U Mobile for now. Across the board, they are pretty much tied with 24 months duration with exception for Digi where it has a shorter 12 months option.As always, we recommend picking a plan based on your usage. So it is best to find out roughly how much data, calls and SMS you’ll need to avoid paying more than what you need. To calculate the cost of ownership of each plan, we add up the bundle price of the device together with the minimum subscription amount that you need to pay throughout the contract period. Below is the comparison chart which you can click for a larger view.
On Celcom, there’s just 2 choices. A FIRST Basic Plan at RM85/month that optimises between 5GB of data, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS or 2GB of data, 700 minutes of calls and 700 SMS. The next option of FIRST Elite comes with 2 SIM cards – one with up to 5GB of data, unlimited free calls/SMS and the 2nd SIM which gives you 3GB of data, 200 minutes of calls and 200 SMS. The amount of data and calls have been revised slightly with more data and calls than before.
Digi offers the widest choice from as little as RM78/month up to RM238/month on its SmartPlan. To cater for different type of customers, each SmartPlan has an option of having more Voice or more Data. As part of their current promo, all plans from SmartPlan 78 and above will get additional 1GB of data for 6 months (not included in the comparison table above). For Digi, they still charge advance payment but it can be waived if you pay by credit card with its 0% interest EPP offer. All plans come with 24 months contract with exception for SmartPlan 78 that also comes with 12 months duration. 
In terms of plans, Maxis is offering the Galaxy Note5 and the S6 edge+ through its Zerolution programme which allows you to pay for your phone on a monthly installment without penalties and upfront payments. This however is only offered for its new MaxisONE Plans that come with unlimited calls and SMS starting at RM98/month. The bundled price is the same across all plans and the only difference is the amount of data you need on each month. While unlimited phone calls and SMS is perfect for those making lots of calls, it is quite expensive for those who require more data. It offers the least amount of data per buck compared to its rivals. For the highest MaxisONE Plan 188, they are offering 1GB additional data but it is only for the first 6 months. For this comparison, we calculated based on the assumption that you will be keeping this device after 24 months. Therefore we are only considering the minimum monthly installment of RM93/month for the Note 5 and RM111/month for the S6 edge+, without the optional RM30/month early upgrade option and RM15/month device protection. If you look at the device price alone, the Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ isn’t getting as much subsidy as the other telcos, but the benefit is that you have the freedom to stop at any time without penalty charges. Just pay the remainder balance of the installments and you’re done. If you do plan to switch phones, the Zerolution RM30/month early upgrade option lets you do so after 12 months. So if the Galaxy Note 6 is out next year, you can just surrender the Note 5, and pay for the Note 6 installments for the next 12 months. Do note that you would need to return your old device in good condition, so it is recommended that you take up the RM15/month device protection offer. 
For now U Mobile is only offering the Galaxy Note 5 on contract and it is bundled with its Ultimate Device Plan that ranges between RM65/month to RM135/month. This is a more data centric plan with a couple of free calls thrown in. Despite not having unlimited phone calls, the rates are the lowest across the range at only RM0.10/minute. If only U Mobile offered its  as on option, they would definitely unbeatable in value. Similar to Digi, there’s also an advance payment but it can be waived if you pay by credit card with auto debit enabled for future bills. 
Considering the long contract period you’re signing up for, you should look beyond the cheaper device price tag. Cost comparison is just half the picture and there are also other areas to look at such as the network quality and customer service. Most telco contracts do charge early termination fees so it is best to stick to a telco that would satisfy your needs for the next 2 years without worry. If you spot any errors, feel free to highlight them in the comments below.To learn more about the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+, you can check out our recent posts:"

The former is the higher-end device, hence the name and it sports a FHD 1920 x 1080 resolution screen.Other specs includes dual-SIM 4G LTE support, 2GB of RAM and runs an Octa-core Snapdragon 615 SoC. 32GB is the standard for internal storage out of the box and is easily expandable through a microSD card.Lenovo’s PHAB Plus dons a 13-megapixel rear sensor along with a 5-megapixel front lens for your photo taking needs. To round off the internals, it carries a 3500 mAh battery to juice all the other components and weighs in at 229g.Moving on to the entry-level PHAB, unsuitably being the more affordable option, you’d expect it to smaller but this “phablet” maxes out at just a hair under 6.98-inches. Although, its screen gets a size step-up, it runs at a lower 1200 x 720 resolution and has less RAM (1GB) on board. Processor-wise it’s a mystery but it is an Octa-core Qualcomm chipset. Forgoing a lot when specs are considered, it does fortunately carry a bigger 4250 mAh battery to power its bigger display.Both phone/tablet/whatever you want to call it runs on Android 5.0 out of the box for its OS.

Available in 4 options (one yet to be released): the 46mm, 42mm (male version), 42mm (women’s collection) and the Sport (soon to be announced).Setting the bar apart from last year’s version will be Moto Maker – quoting Motorola, you’ll be able to have 300 distinctive combinations of its customisation that ranges from watch case colour, watch bezel colour and the band. That too plus they’ve added the aforementioned 42mm watch face, to the original 46mm size for females and the guys who prefer a less clunky smart watch. Repositioning of the sole hardware button is also apparent, moving it from a 3 o’clock position to the now more practical 2 o’clock – supposedly to prevent scuffing while moving and flexing your wrist around.All three options run the same 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 mated with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage. Its screen(s) come in a 1.56-inch for the 46mm (360 x 330 resolution), while the 42mm gets a 1.37-inch screen (360 x 325 resolution). The thickness of the models are all similar at 11.4mm but differ in battery sizes – 400 mAh (46mm); 300mAh (42mm).Differences on the Sport edition are basically it has an added GPS feature to track your runs and a non-removable 18mm rubber-like band, possibly appealing better to the more active folks. It’ll be a lot easier to view outdoors too, thanks to an AnyLight display that gels together a transmissive and reflective display.The entire line-up features a hot-swappable watch band that uses a distinctive locking mechanism; allowing you to choose from the list of watch band materials, whenever you need to – leather, silicon, leather and metal options.Motorola has kept some “flaws” with the infamous flat-tire making its way back again. The company claims that if you want smaller bezels, you’ll have to sacrifice this OCD-inducing pain black box-ish thing at the bottom of the display.Out of the box, it’ll run Android Wear 1.3 and be equipped with the existing gyroscope, optical heart rate monitor and ambient light sensor, though you’ll be able to have your watch on you if you’re taking a shower, thanks to the upgraded IP 68 rating.Price-wise, it’ll run you back $300 (RM 1,293) – $430 (RM 1,854), depending which personal combination of selections you put together when you pre-order your Moto 360 2 gen on Moto Maker.

This time it will be released in 3 sizes – a Z5 Compact, a mid-sized Z5 and a larger Z5 Premium version. Thanks to a , we now have a clearer look at the new Xperia flagships ahead of its official announcement. In terms of design, the overall shape hasn’t change since the early Z series with its omni-balance approach of having a flat slab with subtle rounded corners. Gone is the iconic chrome power button and it is replaced by a wider flat looking one which potentially could double up as a fingerprint scanner. The frame has a poly-carbonate looking material with matte finish, while the premium version seems to have a glossy look to it. We are not sure if the devices shown here is a final product but it looks more sturdy than the previous version.Retained also is the standard volume rocker and dedicated camera button, and the micro USB port is exposed just like its newer waterproof devices. On the left side, all 3 models has the word Xperia written and it still gets a flap cover which potentially still houses both Nano-SIM and microSD expansion. The back hasn’t changed since the beginning of the Xperia Z series and it is shown to carry a 23MP 1/2.3″ sensor, which is an upgrade over its current 20.7MP shooter on the Xperia Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z3+. In terms of specs, the Xperia Z5 Compact will get a 4.6″ HD 720p display, while the Xperia Z5 retains the similar sized 5.2″ Full HD display. For the Xperia Z5 Premium, it is said to be a larger 5.5″ screen that pushes a  4K display at 3840×2160. According to leaked , both Xperia Z5 Compact and Xperia Z5 will be running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 processor and it gets 3GB RAM for the Z5 and just 2GB RAM for the Z5 Compact. In terms of storage, the benchmarks suggest 32GB on-board for both models. They are also expected to receive a 23MP main and a front facing 5MP camera. Strangely the front camera is a notch below its current Xperia M5 and Xperia C5 Ultra that comes with a 13MP front shooter. So far there isn’t any indication on the Z5 Premium specs but it is likely to carry better specs with 4GB RAM being a possibility. The Xperia Z5 is expected to be announced early tomorrow morning and we will find out the full specs by then. Do you like what you see? Or did you prefer if Sony went bonkers with an all new design?[    ]"

The front also gets a larger 8MP f/2.4 shooter and it is illuminated with a front mounted soft LED light.  When the Huawei P8 was launched, they introduced its Knuckle sense interaction, allowing you to take a screenshot by tapping with your knuckle. In reality, that was quite gimmicky and it robbed the P8 of its double tap to wake feature. On the Mate S, they have upgraded its knuckle technology to 2.0 which allows you to perform gesture controls like drawing C for camera using your knuckle. On top of that, the fingerprint scanner at the back also doubles up as a touch pad where you can use it for scrolling vertically or horizontally.

According to the , the upgraded unlimited calls and 7GB of data are offered on a permanent basis, so you can enjoy this until you switch plans or when you port out. For SMS, it is still chargeable but at a low 3 sen/SMS within U Mobile and 8 sen/SMS to other networks. Can’t finish 7GB in one account? You are able to share this with up to 2 more SIM Cards with its supplementary  at RM10/month each. This is probably the best all you can eat postpaid offering right now unless you’re still into good old SMS. As comparison, the  starts from RM98/month and it offers unlimited calls and SMS but it comes with just 1GB of data. Additional data costs an incremental RM30 for every 2GB extra. If you’re an existing U Mobile P70 subscriber, the plan will be upgraded automatically and they won’t charge any fees to make the switch. For clarity of its unlimited call usage, according to U Mobile’s fair use policy, this covers all domestic calls within Malaysia excluding those premium numbers (e.g. 1300/1500/103). They reserve to the right to suspend the line if it is being abused for call centre usage, sim boxing and keeping the line on for hours. For more info, head over to U Mobile’s ."

A headache causing model line-up, that in the past has already been quite a mouthful.Sharing the same 13-megapixel sensor for its rear and front cameras; same goes for the dual-LED (Real Tone), while the laser auto focus makes its way only on the rear camera. Making this device, surely to be a pocket friendly point and shoot; though we haven’t had time to thoroughly test out the camera.Selling as a selfie centric device, ASUS has included some camera centered software features to let users take charge of their photography. You’ll see everything on a ZenUI overlay of Android 5.0, that as it is, quite heavily skinned. Adding to an existing slew of addware, the Zenfone Selfie has ZenMotion – a feature that lets you draw an “S” on the screen to open the front facing camera to snap your selfies.As more Zenfone models become a norm, it’ll be harder to differentiate their devices – at least in terms of aesthetics. Similarly, the Zenfone Selfie looks much alike the Zenfone 2, on the surface for the most part. Internally, it differs by being equip with a 64-bit Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory that’s expandable.The 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) device has its glass bolstered thanks to Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and supports Dual-SIM LTE networks for cellular connectivity. Battery-wise, it be powered by a removable 3000 mAh battery, that somewhat mediates the problem of lacking ASUS Boostmaster quick charging.Priced at RM 1,049 (w/ GST), the Zenfone Selfie will be available in 3 colour options: white, pink or blue and potential buyers can expect the device to go on sale sometime this week.Below are the on the left and the Zenfone Selfie on the right. As you can see, although both share the same screen size at 5.5-inch, the Zenfone Selfie is indeed longer; mainly the camera making up the difference."

Posts on the Chinese company’s official Weibo account announces a special event that’s to be held on the 8 of September, possibly announcing the Barcelona .Publications in China have been going off since the photo emerged with the Barcelona team pictured and the text “it’s my turn”. The R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition is purported to match the original R7 Plus, when considering hardware – though it’ll have some sort of Barcelona emblem on the back and pre-installed themes associated with the Catalan club.Recapping some specs of the R7 Plus, it features a huge 6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) AMOLED display and runs the 64-bit Octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor. Memory on the device sits at 3GB of RAM and for internal storage, you’ll get 32GBs (expandable to an extra 128GB via microSD card).If you make use of the aforementioned expandable storage, you’ll utilise the second SIM tray slot on this Dual-SIM 4G LTE enabled phablet. This thin smart phone measures at only 7.75mm thickness but packs a huge 4100 mAh battery that supports VOOC Flash Charging (75% in 30 minutes).The R7 Plus runs a 13-megapixel Sony sensor, which is readily equip with Phase Detection auto-focus and dual-tone LED flash; donning the front is a decent 8-megapixel selfie camera that provides ample amount of pixels to produce selfies. It’ll also feature a finger print sensor on its back under the mentioned camera module.Software is supported by version 2.1 of ColorOS, based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. Initially priced (in July) at RM 1,998 in Malaysia, we’re unsure that with the current specs, OPPO will still be able to market this Barcelona edition at the same price.No mention of pricing has cropped up yet for the Barcelona version but news floating around goes to say that the shipped unit will feature a packaging and accessories carrying the Barcelona name, leaving us to believe it’ll be a true representation of the La Liga giants.Would we see this device sold globally? Most probably, as it’d be foolish for OPPO not to take advantage of the global presence the football club carries. Are die-hard Barcelona fans willing to drop a chunk on the purported device? You tell us.[ ,  ]"

Flash-forward to the last day, which allowed us to see the new Zenfone 2 Deluxe and the Zenfone 2 Laser.As the name implies, the 2 Laser has a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear, that’s equip with laser auto-focus and dual-LED to boost its camera taking ability. Seems like ASUS wants put its Zenfone devices in smaller niche categories by making them differ in small aspects. However, we aren’t sure this is a great strategy to begin with. Nevertheless, the determining factor that sets the Zenfone 2 Laser apart from the Zenfone Selfie, is omission of the 13-megapixel sensor on the selfie camera, no dual-LED up front and tuning the internal specs a tad lower. It’s quite unfortunate that Malaysia will be getting only the mid-range model from the list of three Zenfone 2 Laser devices released.The Zenfone 2 Laser has an entry level 64-bit capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 410, coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Although, being a slouch in the processing department, the device is no slouch in the cellular connectivity department – LTE enabled dual-SIM support. Sporting a 5.5-inch display with only 720 p resolution, the smart phone is powered by a large 3000 mAh battery and runs on a ZenUI skinned version of Android 5.0 out of the box.Upping the stakes on its current Zenfone 2 series, ASUS also announced pricing of the Zenfone 2 Deluxe. An upscale model that redesigns the back to look like intricate polygons scales, purported to increase the grip of the device. That aside, ASUS also decided to maintain the Intel Atom Z3580 to 2.3GHz but double the internal storage to 128GB.Once you’ve considered the two, otherwise, the Zenfone 2 Deluxe is pretty much the same as the high-end Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) model. Packing 4GB of RAM and even a microSD slot for additional storage (up to 128GB), given that you’ve stuck out on your already existing 128GB of internal memory. It’ll also run the 5.5-inch IPS screen at FHD (1920 x 1080), that’s present on the ZE551ML. ASUS’s latest premium device supports 4G LTE on its Dual-SIM capable phone that has a 3000 mAh battery (fast charge enabled). Lastly, it runs the same ZenUI skinned Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system.Slated to arrive in retailers from the first week of September onwards, the Zenfone 2 Laser will run you back RM 799 (w/ GST), while the Zenfone 2 Deluxe will cost nearly double, at RM 1,599 (w/ GST) and the existing 64GB high-end ZE551ML Zenfone 2 costs RM 1,399 (w/ GST).

Sounds to be an exciting product so far but we’ve kept the best for last – it’ll “likely” have Force Touch on its large 5.7-inch display. Innovation in the area, could see better interaction with our devices, and beating Apple to their own punch (as the iPhone 6s is also rumoured to have this technology on its Retina display).Based on what we’re hearing so far about the MateS, it seems like the Honor 7 and the former share cues in the respective departments: processor, RAM, camera module and finger-print sensor.IFA 2015, in Berlin will be the place to be if you want to know more about this phablet from Huawei. Though, their tweet seems to confirm that the MateS will have Force Touch, Apple still might have a head start, even though they’re set to announce a week later – seeing that they’ve dabbled in Force Touch technology before in their MacBooks and Apple Watches.[ , ,  ]"

Outed as the void-filler in between the One M9 and its yet to be released successor, it looks pretty much like an iPhone if viewed from the back. The official HTC Weibo post states that we will be able to take a look at the device on the 6 of September, leaving us to only 4 days before we’ll see the latest HTC smart phone.Since the image’s text was posted in Mandarin, many are still unsure of its meaning – even after getting help from Google translate, which struggled to translate it to English. Supposedly, the text goes to say something along the lines of “the strength to fight bias” and “simple colour value”.Not giving away much, by any means, however, it’ll be a tough climb for the Taiwanese company, if the device they’re releasing doesn’t offer any visual distinction from its competitors (provided the Aero looks like how it does in the  leaks)Internally, that might differ, as the new HTC A9 is touted to be powered by an industry’s first tri-cluster Deca-core (10) MediaTek Helio X20 and a Mali-T880 MP4 graphics processor. It’ll also apparently carry a QHD display with Gorilla Glass 4, protecting it from any unwanted scratches and smudges.Notorious leaker @evleaks posted that this new flagship might carry the “One” title, with the HTC One A9 (Aero) but we’ll wait to see if September the 6confirms his speculation.The late rise of Samsung in the Android market, brought the demise of the HTC name, so we hope in earnest that their new handsome hero can bring back some good news for the company.[ ,  ]"

The LG Rolly keyboard tackles that by existing in an “impact-resistant” polycarbonate with ABS plastic – potentially increasing the experience of the tactile feedback.Roll it/fold it and turn it into a slim cuboid shape to carry around, increasing portability without sacrificing too much on the typing feedback. It’ll connect to your favoured device through Bluetooth 3.0 and can be paired to two devices at the same time and has an in-built stand (limited to tablets not more than 10 inches).LG probably took some cues from , which has the same two previously mentioned features but loses out to the Logitech’s ability to switch between 3 devices, not just 2. Though, you’re likely to prefer the rollability of the LG Rolly more, if it’ll be joining you on the daily.For a device powered by a single AAA battery, it’ll provide enough juice to last you 3 months – as quoted by LG. Scheduled to make an appearance during IFA 2015 in September, we’re hoping to see this thing in action and if it’s all it’s made to be.

The returns were minimal, although achieving sales through the high end Moto X, and lower end Moto G and Moto E. Lenovo decided that their portfolio was better suited if they capitalised on buying Moto’s presence in the Western market, giving them a better chance worldwide. Almost a year on, they’ve now decided to sell solely under the Motorola name, dissolving its Lenovo Mobile branding.A merging will see all future phones to be sold under the Motorola name, solving the problem of managing two separate companies, who sell the same type of product. In theory, both companies gain as Motorola has always had an issue with only having a limited model inventory, at least presently. Lenovo tops out in terms of its marketability, for the markets they’re not well known yet.All of this is speculation, for the most part – as no official English press release has been outed. So what happens to the latest Lenovo Vibe Shot and the Lenovo Vibe S1? It’ll likely be Lenovo’s last offerings, to match Motorola’s conspicuous design or could we see a more varied aesthetic language from the future Motorola devices?Back to the lack of worldwide mention on the subject; based on the lack of information coming from Lenovo, instead only coming from Xiaomi Times – we hope all customers take this information with a grain of salt.

Planned to be held at San Francisco’s Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, which seats 7,000 people – meaning it’ll be their grandest yet, leading many to believe there will be a lot to be talked about.We’re likely to see the internal upgrades of the and the , coming from the Cupertino natives. Subsequently, there’s a possibility that a fresh iPad and Apple TV might make an appearance during the event. Apple’s take on an iOS 9, OS X El Capitan and watchOS 2 are also stated to be released during the time.Word floating around goes to say that the displays on the new iPhones will sport the innovative Force Touch function. If you’ve haven’t heard of Force Touch, it’s basically a pressure-sensitive technology that enables users to access extended functions – that’s been available on the Apple Watch and their latest line of MacBooks.Do we think it’s absolutely necessary to have Force Touch on board? It’ll be negligible at best, with increased accessibility to functions; widgets, maybe? Nonetheless, Apple’s “innovation” has always been “revolutionary” like Siri (which people ended up forgetting about), so we’ll see if there’s anything to shout about while having this feature incorporated in the Retina Display of the new iPhones.Other hardware upgrades should also bring about 2GB of RAM, a new A9 processor chip, and a camera optics bump to 12-megapixels. In recent times, Apple has gradually slowed its ability to innovate, or at least innovate something that’s game-changing. A worrying trend that’s been faced by other manufacturers, as well.That aside, iOS 9’s features, has already been previewed in June and it’ll come in just a 1.3 GB package. This is a great improvement since iOS 8 required at least 5GB’s to unpack. A little late to the party, but the new OS will allow users to take advantage of iDevices with larger displays through multi-window. Other nifty improvements can be seen .Fortunately, Chinese tech site cnBeta gives us something to look at (since the device will look the same) with the purported packaging images. What you’re looking at is a stupendously pretty Butterfly Koi image on the said device.

So does printing a disclaimer save them from the backlash?As far as we’re concerned, when you fork out RM 2,699 for a phablet, you’re expecting something that has stood up to vigorous testing. How far along were they before they finally realised? Was putting up that 25 page in the user manual adequate? What actually causes the S Pen functionality to go bust? We aren’t entirely sure about the first two questions but we’ll help answer the third in this article.Blessed to have the guys from  and  who’ve dived into this whole mess by showing what it looks like on the inside of the Note5 when the S Pen inserted the wrong way. Looking closer at the photo, you’ll see levers that jut out in the silo: one controls S Pen detection and functionality, while the other secures the stylus from falling out the silo.The former/lever 1 sits in between the middle and the end of the silo, under the primary logic board angled upwards on the right of the S Pen; without this lever, you’ll lose two features – Screen-off memo and Air Command. However, lever 1 doesn’t cause the S Pen to get stuck – that’s caused by lever 2. Located a little further up the silo, towards the end is the lever that will be the doom of your stylus.An intricate writing tool of sorts, it’s designed to have two small cutouts near the writing end that holds it in firmly when slotted correctly, writing tip first. A positive design but here’s the deal – if it’s placed backwards or click side first, you’ll see it getting hitched after passing the second lever. Once you’re in this deep, you’re probably not getting it out, considering the lack of space following this mishap.If you’re lucky enough to get the backward S Pen passed the second lever, you’re gonna have to get past the first lever again. Removing the Samsung stylus after this could likely damage the other plastic lever that’s mounted inside an internal part soldered to the main board. Thin in nature, this plastic lever gives you the S Pen detection capability, thus making you disable S Pen Detection to get the stylus to work (that is if you’ve managed to get it out in the first place) – killing the two aforementioned features, delivering a bleak Note5 writing experience.Sympathising with current and future owners of the Galaxy Note5, all we can do is advise everyone to avoid this scenario (as unrealistic as it is) and don’t try to replicate this problem at all, you’ll regret even trying to do so. We’ve yet to see if Samsung will buckle from the feedback, probably offering some sort of replacement program, or have a software alert when the silo detects backwards insertion.Still excited about the Samsung Galaxy Note5?

If you’re wondering if you could take this for a swim, you would be pleased to know that it has IP68 water and dust resistance which they say is capable of being submerged under 10 metres of water for up to 30 minutes. In terms of battery life, the honor band does up to 3 days on a single charge. There isn’t much details on the full specs including the display resolution and battery size, and we are told that these units aren’t final for full commercial release. There are 3 colours available – Black, White and Khaki. For the European market, the band will be available sometime in Q4 2015 and it carries a price tag of 79 Euros or 59 GBP. That’s approximately RM370-RM380 in our current exchange rate. There’s no info on Malaysian availability just yet but we are told to stay tuned for future local announcements. If you’re just looking for something basic, the honor band could be your cup of tea. For those wanting more with a longer battery life, you could top up around RM50 extra and go for a Pebble smart watch that’s currently priced at US$99 (about RM415). Before you pass any judgement on the “honor band” name, they are actually running a naming contest from now until 27th September. If your suggested name gets picked, you will win the opportunity to use all honor products for the next 5 years.

Alexander Wong,Honor 7 First Impressions: Get more without busting your budget,,,,2015-08-28,"High performance and low price. That’s the name of the game with these online driven brands. Before the rise of Xiaomi in international markets, Huawei claims to be in the forefront of e-commerce with its honor smart phone line up. Although both Huawei and honor share the same roots, they are distinctively different in terms of positioning and for us consumers, the price tag makes a whole world of difference.During today’s event, “honor” was emphasised as a brand for the new generation and for those who are young at heart. Being a digital-native driven product, it goes directly to consumers, cutting out the middle man which results lower cost and a more competitive price tag.Last year, the honor 6 stood out as one of our favourite 4G LTE smart phones under RM1,000. With its in-house developed Kirin processor, it performed just as good as a flagship Galaxy S5 and yet it cost half the price of other similar flagship devices. For 2015, the new honor flagship isn’t just an improvement but it aims to move the goal post further.The honor 7 gets a slightly bigger 5.2” Full HD display encased in an all metal unibody design. It feels much better than the honor 6 which felt plasticky. The front looks virtually the same as the honor 6 but you’ll notice the changes as you turn to the sides. The back has a nice curve which makes it comfortable to hold, while the top and bottom ends have a plastic cover with some nice texture to it. You’ll find a large camera lens which protrudes slightly but you need not to worry about scratches as it uses sapphire glass. Also prominent is a new fingerprint scanner that’s quite similar to the Ascend Mate 7. On the right, you’ll find your usual power and volume rockers, while the left houses a SIM tray slot and a new Smart Key. At the top, it is no surprise with a typical headphone jack, a secondary mic as well as an infrared blaster.Looking at the bottom, it gets a pair of speaker and microphone grills on each side of the microUSB port, which is much better than the old one having the speaker placed at the back."

The new display is apparently 2 grams heavier than the display on the iPhone 6, but the brand is planning on compensating for the extra weight with a lighter rear cover. But will that solve the  issue or make it worse?For those not in the know, Force Touch is essentially a feature that’s currently available on the and the  which allows users to access functions based on pressure applied on the screen or trackpad.

The mobile device maker has also thrown in a special 50% off on any second purchase of a Galaxy Note5 but you’ve gotta be the first 100 in line for the Sunway Pyramid roadshow and the first 50 for both the Penang and Johor launch – making only 200 individuals lucky enough to snap up the Note5 at half its RRP of RM2,699.Basically you will be paying half price for a device that packs a 5.7-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) display that’s powered by a 2.1GHz Exynos 7420, mated with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. Other than that, it’ll have 32GB of internal storage; unfortunately, there will be no MicroSD slot on the Note5 that weights in at a mere 171g.Images are captured better thanks to a 16-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front-facing snapper – both sensors have an f/1.9 aperture, making low light shots a better experience. Samsung also decided to omit the hot-swappable battery, which stands at 3,000 mAh. With omissions, there are definitely new inclusions, as the device now supports Dual-SIM LTE slots.You’ll see the same specs on the Galaxy S6 edge+ too but it’ll differ in two aspects – the captivating dual edged display and no S Pen on board. Its definitely meant to be more of a screen upgrade from the original 5.1-inch Galaxy S6 edge and improve its rigidity by upping the aluminum to a 7000 series.Existing Note users won’t be left out either, as Samsung has let them upgrade through their  program. Below you’ll find the listing of value matched to the corresponding models.Still feeling unsure of buying a phablet? You’re in luck, cause Samsung also dropped the prices for the smaller Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, for the duration of the roadshow.

Almost a year after the release of its  in Malaysia, the new successor steps up with a premium build and enhanced features to close the gap with its flagship rivals. For those who are unfamiliar, Honor is Huawei’s sub-brand that’s digitally driven through its Vmall online stores. In China, the honor 7 did tremendously well with 200,000 sold online in just 2 minutes. To recap, the honor 7 is slightly larger at 5.2 inches and the IPS-Neo display pushes a Full HD resolution of 1920×1080. Under the hood is an updated 64-bit Octa-Core (4X 1.5GHz + 4X 2.2GHz) Kirin 935 processor that’s mated with 3GB of RAM. For the international market, it gets 16GB of on-board storage which can be expanded with microSD up to 128GB.The overall build of the honor 7 is pretty solid with its unibody metal back that comes with a slight curve for a more comfortable grip. On the right, it gets a power button in the middle and a volume rocker right next to it. On the left side, you’ll find a Smart Key button which can be customised to your reference and a SIM tray slot that supports dual-SIMs. The main speaker and microphones are placed at the bottom alongside its microUSB port, while the top comes with the standard headphone jack and an infrared blaster.  For photography, the honor 7 gets a much larger 20MP IMX230 sensor from Sony and a f/2.0 aperture lens. The new sensor comes with Phase Detection Auto Focus which provides an ultra-quick focusing time of 0.1 seconds. While the camera lens has a protruding bump, it uses sapphire glass to protect it from scratches. In terms of features, it supports a wide range of filters, slow-mo, time lapse and even light painting, a key feature that was introduced with the  flagship.At the front, it gets an 8MP f/2.4 shooter with soft flash. Over at the back, the honor 7 also gets a fingerprint scanner which unlocks instantly on a single touch. Like the Huawei P8, it also supports knuckle sense, allowing you to double tap using your knuckle to take a screenshot but at the same time, it still supports the standard double tap to wake while the screen is switched off. Keeping the lights on is an embedded 3,100mAh battery and it also support quick charge which does 0-50% in 30 minutes. Overall the honor 7 weighs 157 grams and has a thickness of 8.5mm.

Revamping the former and making the latter bigger but keeping the insides relatively the same; Samsung’s two updates will seek to cater to the market’s attraction towards bigger screened mobile phones.The latest Galaxy Note5 will set you back a cool RM 2,699 (w/ GST), while the bigger S6 edge+ will cost RM 3,099 (w/ GST). Both of the aforementioned devices will go on sale from the 4 of September onwards; the former will come in two colour options – Gold Platinum or White Pearl, as the latter will be available in either Gold Platinum or Black Sapphire.They are essentially hitting the market next Friday so be sure to check out any promotional materials from telco companies soon.Envisioning a market space that grew thanks to its humble beginnings with the Note series, the Galaxy Note5 is promised to be a worthy 5 year edition. Focused towards users who want to be more productive and have a larger screen real-estate, the S Pen will attempt to be an amazing writing companion. Designed to help people with its writing capabilities through the pen computing of the renowned S Pen, it’ll enable you to jot information down quickly with Screen-off Memo. Scroll capture is a great new edition to the S Pen’s features – allowing you to screen capture up to 22 pages for easy reference of conversation history or GPS directions while driving.We’ve talked about the Note5’s specs before but just to refresh your memory, this is a 5.7-inch QHD (2560 × 1440) screen device that runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. It’ll be powerfully equipped with an Exynos 7420 processor that’s clocked at 2.1 GHz, mated with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. Internal storage options currently only stand at 32GB but we’re sure bigger versions will make their way to out market soon. Weighing in at 171g, this device has a rear 16-megapixel camera sensor and a 5-megapixel camera sported on the front (both at f/1.9 aperture).Powering this phablet is a 3,000 mAh non-removable battery – surely disappointing fans of the old Note(s) that always had a battery that was hot-swappable. The same goes for the MicroSD slot, that used to live on the Note 4 and its predecessors but has been omitted from the newest Note5. Don’t be too disappointed though, as you’ll be pleased to know that the LTE capable device now has Dual-SIM support on board, allowing dual-wielding phone users to minimise the number of phones they need to carry.The other star of the show, is the Galaxy S6 edge+, and while it only differs in terms of the availability of the S Pen, the dual edged display and its aesthetic value, has the same specs as the Note5. Succeeding its smaller sibling in a big way, the 5.7-inch screen is larger to increase visibility, and improve its hardiness, with a tougher 7000 series aluminium – stronger than the S6 edge.Since we’re 10 days away, let us know what you think of the device so far and to recap our coverage of Samsung Unpacked you can check it out ."

We saw it first from  who replied to a tweet saying the HTC A9 (Aero) is to be out by Q4 of this year. Now we get to see fresh glimpses of the said device thanks to a leak in China.Struggling to stay afloat, the Taiwanese company is trying to redeem itself, since its less than stellar sales of its flagship smartphone. Sharing an uncanny resemblance to an iPhone from the back; only differing in terms of camera placement, this could mean HTC has lost all luster in the design department. We’ve seen it before with the M9, M8 and M7 – all sharing the same aesthetic appeal.Taking a look at the front, the huge HTC logo stays in place at the bottom being closely followed by the bottom Boomsound speaker, while topside there’s nothing much we can tell from the blurry photo, other than the top Boomsound speaker and a front-facing camera.Internally, the device purported will carry a QHD screen with Gorilla Glass 4 protecting it from scratches and smudges. The HTC A9 will have 2.5 D curved edges to help its ergonomics and come equip with a f/1.9 rear camera lens to handle those dim environments.Seems like there’s much more that’s yet to be leaked about this HTC smart phone but its rumoured to be announced in October and be on sale in some markets come November.[ , ,  ]"

By chance this does happen, you probably weren’t paying attention to your four figure device in the first place; sheer negligence on your part. Logically with the way you would handle the stylus, it’d make sense that after fiddling with it you’d put it in nib pointed first, otherwise it’d just be going against the natural way of things; then again, accidents do happen.The Korean company does warn you about this but chances are you skipped user manual for the most part. Owners can head over to page 25 on the user manual to read the details on the S Pen insertion. Ideally, it’s a two way street when concerning this issue, as Samsung could have probably designed the stylus in a way that it can’t possibly slide in backwards by accident.So let’s not try anything funny here, folks – cause Samsung isn’t gonna replace your stylus and the sensors inside the silo (at least not for free).

The  which is their thinnest smart phone at a mere 4.85mm has returned for a sequel in the form of the OPPO R5s. Nothing has changed in terms of design but it gets a new grey colour scheme that looks pretty slick.Under the hood, it gets some welcomed upgrades – a larger 3GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. As comparison, the current OPPO R5 has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Like the original R5, storage isn’t expandable with microSD.  The rest of the spec-sheet is the same as before with a 5.2″ Super AMOLED display that does full HD 1080p and it runs on an Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor. Unfortunately the embedded battery is the same paltry 2,000mAh unit but it can be replenished quickly with VOOC Flash charger from 0 to 75% in 30 minutes. The camera is still the same 13MP Sony IMX214 unit at the back with a front facing 5MP selfie shooter. Out of the box, it still runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat that has ColorOS 2.0 running on top. Just like the original R5, the R5s also lacks a headphone jack and you’ll need a micro-USB to audio adapter if you’re planning to plug in your head phones. The price of the OPPO R5s is quite surprising as it was listed at 199 Euros (about RM947). As comparison, the OPPO R5 in Malaysia is  at RM1,398, down from RM1,598 previously. For the specs, this is quite compelling for under RM1,000 but if only it has a bigger battery on-board. [  ,  ]"

Alexander Wong,All you need to know: 10 new features on MIUI 7,,"Android,Custom ROM,MIUI 7,MIUI 7 Features,MIUI OS,Xiaomi","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-08-20,"After 5 years running, Xiaomi has made its global announcement of  yesterday. With its humble beginnings back in 2010, the MIUI custom ROM has grown with over 150 Million users and is supported by a team of 750 people. While the interface looks the same as the current MIUI 6, the new version offers more customisation and it gets smarter with a several intelligent tweaks. Read on for the 10 new features after the break.Your smart phone is a personal device and MIUI has been known for its wide array of radical customisable themes. On MIUI 7, they are really pushing the themes up a notch with greater focus on design details. With Muse, a new theme creator, you can design new interfaces with animations including the lock screen like never before. And this is done without the complicated coding.Receiving phone calls can be made more interesting especially when it’s from your loved ones. Instead of having a static photo, you can change this to a 5 second looping video. If you have tons of instant message groups and social media accounts, your phone would always be demanding for attention. While you can always turn on silent mode before sleeping, MIUI 7 is making the DND mode automated with the help of a Mi Band. The Mi Band as an activity tracker knows when you’re asleep and will automatically turns on DND mode. Once you’re awake, it is also smart enough to disable DND mode so that you start receiving alerts right away. Especially for the elderly, viewing normal text size can be a strain. While you can easily bump up the text size, the execution isn’t always perfect with broken lines and ugly alignment. With MIUI 7, it now offers an even larger XXL size and it is done beautifully in any screen without breaking its original layout design. Data is core in every smart phone experience. Not everyone has a huge data plan and high-speed coverage could be limited especially in developing countries. To ensure an optimal internet experience, Xiaomi has incorporated Opera Max Data Saver which helps to compress data not only in browser but also in other internet connected apps. This helps to speed up loading and will also help to cut down consumption of your precious internet quotas. For those with kids, your smart phone is the best camera of capturing moments in any situation. If need to show photos of your baby, it can be a daunting task if your album is filled with random pictures. To make things easier, they now have a Baby Album which automatically creates a collection for your baby with the help of facial recognition. Similar to Huawei’s Magazine cover feature, you can have a different lock screen wallpaper every single day. There’s a selection of high quality images and this will be made available first in India before it is released for international markets.  Sometimes your kids might want to “steal” your phone for a short game or two. To keep your data private and phone settings intact from curious fingers, the Child Mode lets you pick which apps and features that are accessible to them.  Performance is always a concern of users and MIUI 7 has been tweaked to provide a faster experience. App start up times have been optimised by loading both data and animations in parallel and Xiaomi claims a 30% improvement in app response. According to Xiaomi, as much as 48% of battery life are consumed by background processes such as GPS, mobile data and WiFi. To squeeze more life from each charge, they have optimised its background usage as well as regulating app sync times to minimise consumption. As a result, this would give 10% better battery life which is equivalent of up to 3 hours extra each day. If you can’t wait to give it a go, MIUI 7 will be available as a beta release beginning 24th August on the . The Beta release will support Redmi 1S, Redmi 2, Mi 3, Mi 4, Mi 4i, Redmi Note 3G and Redmi Note 4G. To watch the full presentation, you can hit play in the embedded video below."

Flight is propelled by 4 low-torqued plastic blades shielded by guards to decrease chances of injury, if one were to come in contact with the flying robot.The aforementioned inspiration behind the creation of the Fotokite was Lupashin’s observations during protests stemming, due to the suspicious federal election that took place in Russia back in 2011. Thankfully, some of these occurrences were captured by drone photographers who were in the area, which gave us a good look at how the Russian people were reacting. Hence, it proved that drone journalism would be pivotal but the only obstacle would be the necessary knowledge to fly a drone in crowded areas – that’s where the innovative leash system would come in.Making use of the same technology in retractable dog leashes, Lupashin excluding the need of a well-versed drone pilot. Tethered in such a manner whereby the leash line sits just below the provided GoPro slot, it’ll ensure that the lens always stays pointed towards the individual manning the drone.Weighing only 12 ounces / 341 grams (including the battery and camera) the Fotokite Phi can fold itself to maximise space and is kept away in its packing tube. Twist gestures command the device to start-up and turning min-flight is manipulated by a button click and similar flick of the wrist, while the leash can be slacked to provide a wider viewing area for stills and video.If you’re in the market for something a little higher end, you can look at the Fotokite Pro – mainly the same as its more affordable sibling (15 minutes fly-time) except for the tether doubling as a power cable and a downlink transfer for uncompressed HD video, providing longer recording and flight-times.

Alexander Wong,Sony SmartBand 2 – The activity tracker that now tracks your heart rate,,"Activity Tracker,Fitness,Fitness Band,Sony,Sony SmartBand,Sony SmartBand 2,wearable","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2015-08-21,"Sony has just unveiled its new fitness wearable that now tracks your heart rate in addition to your day to day activities. Dubbed as the SmartBand 2, it is similar to the previous version with its discreet looking design that’s hidden underneath a plain looking band. With the inclusion of a heart rate sensor, you get more details out of your workout which includes your heart rate, stress and relaxation levels. By default it comes in either black or white straps which can be customised with their optional colourful straps. To ensure its usability in any situations, the SmartBand 2 gets a rather high IP68 waterproof rating. Sony reckons you can take it for a swim to not more than 3 metres deep in freshwater for up to 30 minutes. It also works as a notifications device with its 3 LEDs and vibration alert to help you differentiate calls and messages. It supports both Android and iOS and you’ll need to use Sony’s official Lifelog app. Weighing just at 25 grams, the SmartBand 2 is juiced up by a tiny 58mAh battery. According to its official , it can last up to 5 days on a single charge on stamina mode and up to 2 days in normal mode. With heart activity mode enabled, it is rated to last up to 10 hours.

Alexander Wong,OnePlus 2 is getting OxygenOS 2.0.1 update with critical fixes,,"Android,OnePlus,oneplus 2,OnePlus 2 battery life,OnePlus 2 Malaysia,OnePlus 2 OxygenOS,OxygenOS,smart phone,Update","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-08-21,": If you can’t wait, you can download the Full OxygenOS 2.0.1 ROM (1.1GB) or update file (40MB). Full instructions after the break.The self-proclaimed  is getting its first OxygenOS software update that aims to quash teething problems after its global debut. Just to recap, the OnePlus 2 comes in 2 flavours – HydrogenOS for the Chinese market and OxygenOS for international users.  The OTA update weighs 1.1GB and it will be rolled out first in India before it trickles down to the rest of the world. As you would expect, the latest update fixes the critical Stagefright issues and it addresses other stability and performance concerns on the new device. The changelog reads as follows:1. Download the latest Oxygen OS ROM or update file (if you’re currently running on Oxygen OS 2.0.0)2. Connect your phone to your computer via USB and copy the file to the root folder
3. Switch off your phone
4. Press and hold the (Volume Down) and (Power Button) Together until the phone starts
5. Select English
6. Select Install Upgrade File from SD
7. Select the file that you’ve copied and click OK
8. Reboot after upgrade is completed. You can read the full upgrade details .============If you’ve followed our  and , we shared that the OnePlus 2’s battery life leaves a lot to be desired. Despite having a massive 3,300mAh capacity battery, we managed to do an average of 17-19 hours on a single charge with 4 hours of screen on time. At that’s on a very light usage with no GPS disabled. Considering the OnePlus is still on a Full HD 1080p display resolution, that’s quite short compared to other flagship smart phones with higher Quad HD screens and smaller batteries.So far no issues on performance and we liked the stock-like nature of OxygenOS which feels very fluid. One of such bugs we’ve spotted is the Google Photos app. When you try to pinch and zoom, it automatically springs back to 100% width view and this is annoying. We ended up installing QuickPic viewing instead.At time of writing, the OxygenOS 2.0.1 update isn’t available on our unit yet and hopefully this would fix the problems we encountered so far. [ ,  ]"

With the use of glass, obviously it won’t play nice when the device meets a hard concrete floor. The guys over at PhoneBuff had conducted what appears to be the first drop test ever for Samsung’s latest flagship. While the metal frame helps to absorb impact from the sides, direct drops facing downwards will definitely cause some serious damage to the screen. Even when it was dropped with the back facing down from 1 metre height, the impact is strong enough to crack the protruding camera lens. It is interesting to point out that they rated the Note 5 to be more durable than the Galaxy S6 but it is still behind the predominantly metal iPhone 6 and HTC One M9.

Alexander Wong,OnePlus 2 tear down reveals modular internals and it is easy to repair,,"OnePlus,oneplus 2,OnePlus 2 Malaysia,OnePlus 2 Repair,OnePlus 2 Tear Down,tear down","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-08-19,"The  is heading to  soon. If you’re wondering how easy it is to repair, we turn to the dismantling experts at iFixit. Most unibody smart phones these days are quite complicated to dismantle and it is common to see them using tons of adhesive and proprietary screws that would require special tools. But not with the OnePlus 2. With its replaceable sandstone back cover taken out, the back plate is held together with standard Phillips screws. The non-removable 3,300mAh battery is kept in place with a little adhesive and it shouldn’t pose much problems if you need to replace it. The rest of the components such as the camera module and the USB Type C port are modular, making replacements an easy task.Probably the only difficulty would be the display as the IPS LCD is fused together with the glass. So if you’ve cracked your screen, you would need to replace the whole piece which can be quite costly. Overall iFixit rates the OnePlus 2 with a repairability score of 7/10, which is easier than the first OnePlus One that  5/10. As comparison, the Galaxy S6  4/10, while the HTC One M9  at just 2/10.

Happening from the 26 of August up till 1 of September 2015, the Unitysale promises to slash service and product prices up to 94%.The 5 said companies will be joining forces to provide a celebratory experience with their contributions towards users who sign up anew and also existing users who have used their platforms before. Akin to corroborate the Digital Malaysia initiative, the 5 e-commerce team up is purposed to leverage the 20 million internet users of Malaysia. By capitalising on the 66% of the population, online shopping has grown exponentially in the last two years and hands buyers a new medium to shop.Luca Barberis (Managing Director of ZALORA Malaysia) went on to say that it is through the partnership of the biggest e-commerce players the industry can strength itself. Echoing sentiments by his counterpart at Lazada, who said that “as more users use the service, more feedback will be received”, thus proving that through collaboration all 5 organisations will benefit.Improving platforms and customer service was also addressed at the event. To quote Lazada’s CEO, Hans-Peter Ressel said “the Unitysale will be a joint-campaign to benefit Malaysians together” and Lazada will push for better service through their larger warehouse that’s set to be in full swing come November or December of this year. They’re plans also extend to East Malaysia, by setting up a first warehouse there, to shorten delivery times by having inventory on-hand. Similarly, foodpanda is said to be facing the same qualms with complains of delivery times, so they’ve attempted to mediate that by creating smaller cluster areas to ensure all food is delivered in one hour.HappyFresh Malaysia’s Managing Director, Opal Wu also reiterated that time-saving will be one of the biggest advantages of e-commerce. Families can now spend less time going to the market and local grocery store by moving their foodstuffs purchases online.Saving time may be only one of the said perks of e-commerce, as with economic constraints both Uber and foodpanda agree that in trying times, Malaysians should try to save money. “With the cost of private transportation gradually going up, uberX aims to help riders save by using our technology to maximise efficiency”, said Leon Foong, General Manager of Uber Malaysia.Here’s a sneak-peak of the deals coming from the respective e-commerce sites:"

Not only you’re tied for 24 months but you would also need to fork out a huge sum of money upfront, which sometimes cost more in total than the actual phone itself. While there are some telcos offering zero waiver for upfront payments, you’re essentially still tied down to the same phone until your 24 months duration is up. Maxis wants to change the way you buy your smart phones by introducing the Zerolution program. It promises absolutely no payment upfront, no contracts and no interest fee over your monthly payments. Best of all, this isn’t an Easy Payment Plan that requires a credit card. Everything you hate about a phone contract be gone. Sounds too good to be true? Read on to find out. To get a phone through Zerolution, you’ll need to pick a new  that starts from RM98/month and then pick the phone you want. By default, the monthly payment is calculated over a 24 months period and if you decide to leave, you’ll just need to pay the balance without any penalty charges.For those that want to own the latest phones every year, there’s an early upgrade option at RM30/month. So after 12 months, you can surrender your current device and switch to a newer phone without any penalty or upgrade cost. Just pick a new phone and pay the new monthly payment. In order to upgrade, the device must be in good working order which means no cracked screen or serious dents on the device. If the device is not in good order, a RM300 fee will apply. For better peace of mind, they are offering a device protection at RM15/month that’s comes with 48 hours replacement. For now the Zerolution program covers 4 devices – the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, HTC One M9+ and the Samsung Galaxy A7. All new flagship devices will be available on Zerolution moving forward and gradually its existing line up including the iPhone 6 will be offered later. Considering the easy ownership and zero penalty charges involved, the Zerolution is a hassle free way of owning a device. This isn’t a leasing program as you do own the phone after 24 months. If you calculate the monthly payment over 24 months it is cheaper than buying the phone outright at full retail price. That’s of course without the optional early upgrade (RM30/month) and device protection (RM15/month) add-on. For those that change phones on an annual basis, this can be seen as a leasing programme as you can swap phones easily without the hassle of trading in. Once you’ve completed the full 24 months period, the phone is yours to keep. Below is one example of buying the Galaxy S6 on Zerolution versus a typical 24 months contract.For more info, head over to  page."

The 11street exclusive pre-orders will start shipping in early September. To recap, the Xperia C5 Ultra is not only their new phablet but it’s also their new contender in the selfie centric space. Not only it gets a huge 6″ Full HD display, it also features 13MP cameras for both front and back. To get the best out of your selfie shots, the front camera has a wider 22mm view and it gets a soft LED Selfie Flash for better illumination. With an ultra-thin bezel, the Xperia C5 Ultra looks almost bezel-less and the shorter width makes it easy to handle with a single hand. The internals however is similar to the current Xperia C4, with a 1.7GHz MediaTek Octa-Core Processor that’s mated with 2GB of RAM, along with 16GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD. With a 2,930mAh non-removable battery, it is rated to last up to 2 days and overall it weighs 187 grams.

It also gets 16GB of storage and a microSD slot that accepts up to 200GB in capacity. In the camera department, things get a little interesting. While the Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3+ still carries the same old 20.7MP shooter, the M5 features a newer 21.5MP IMX230 sensor that’s features Phase Detection Auto Focus. The result is clearer shots of moving objects thanks to its 0.2 seconds focus time. For the narcissists, they won’t be disappointed either as the front gets a 13MP camera just like the Xperia C5 Ultra.

From the photos you can tell quite a decent amount about the phone and it even has something that looks like an additional front camera sensor. However, @upleaks states that the Vibe S1 will indeed have dual-front facing cameras.HTC is not foreign to this concept, barring the differing placements (rear instead of front), with its Duo Camera technology but this could possibly be the first front facing dual camera set up in the world. Users who love bokeh effects might consider adding that extra touch to their selfie photos, seemingly the only plus point of having two shutters up front.Having said that, other internals include a 5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) screen, that’s functioning thanks to an Octa-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 615 processor. There will be 2GB of RAM and just 16GB of internal memory to take advantage of on the Vibe S1 but it does come with MicroSD expansion.Optics will be supported by a 13-megapixel rear snapper and a (at least one) 8-megapixel front sensor for those selfies.

No branding appears on the actual body of the phone but there is a white sticker with an LG logo on it, so we can safely assume this is LG’s Nexus and not the Huawei Nexus.Protrusion of the camera could mean that the phone’s design is very thin, giving LG not much to work with in terms of how much the camera sensor juts out. Accompanying the camera (purported 16-megapixel or 20.7-megapixel) will be what seems to look like laser focus technology and dual-LED flash.Some go on to claim the circular metal ring is actually a fingerprint scanner; a design differing from Android’s design cues but very much like Apple’s (differing placements). However, we advise all of this be taken with a large dosage of salt – mainly because LG has been fairly discrete about its Nexus, though it does match older renders . The majority believe Google will keep to its annual scheduled release of the Nexus(es) and Android M, which is due usually in October. Since there’s still 2 months to go, be sure to expect more rumours and leaks as autumm nears.[ ,  ]"
Arif Lee,Samsung’s Keyboard Cover wants you to type like a BlackBerry user,,"Android QWERTY Keyboard,evleaks,Keyboard Cover,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus keyboard,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung keyboard cover,Samsung QWERTY Keyboard cover,Samsung Unpacked 2015","Android,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"Rumours from the great  seemed to be true as Samsung actually released a proprietary snap on keyboard during its unpacked event in New York.

Vernon Chan,5 Top new Features of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5,,"Android,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Features,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,smart phone,Top 5 Features","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-18,"As expected, Samsung revealed its fifth generation flagship phablet – the  at the  event in New York. The new Note delivers a whole refreshed look, packs an amazing camera and an enhanced S Pen experience.Having had an exclusive  experience (you can read and watch about it ) I can tell you that from the offset, the Note 5 doesn’t seem do anything ground-breaking. The Note’s crown jewels were always the big format display and exclusive stylus experience. Having said that, it’s an evolution from the  with little touches that enhance productivity and overall user experience. Here are my favourite five top features of the Galaxy Note 5.Aside from the size of the big display, the Note 5 looks nothing like its predecessor. Gone is the faux leather and chromed frame. In fact, the Note 5 has more in common in terms of looks and build with the beautiful . In comes a premium build with an all-metal finish and beautiful glass curved back. What’s important to note is that, despite having a large 5.7-inch QHD AMOLED display, the Note 5 is actually smaller, thinner and lighter than the previous Note devices. If you loved the S6 and S6 edge, then you’ll appreciate the lines, curves and feel of the new Note 5Samsung has finally introduced a spring-loaded auto-eject mechanism to the infamous S Pen. So no more fiddling and using your nail to detach the stylus from the silo. It makes perfect sense, really, and something you’ll definitely appreciate. The S Pen itself features better build, and seems more durable and less plasticky than the previous versions. The S Pen is more responsive and the hand-writing recognition is better than ever, making writing and drawing as natural as doing it with a real pen. The Air Command is a Note special. Click the button on the S Pen and a pop-up menu shows up on screen. It gives you quick access apps and features. This is a much-loved feature of the Note series. With the Note 5, it gets even better. Now you can customise Air Command to modify and add up to three favourite apps to it. It’s really neat and a long time coming.This is one of those “Now why didn’t they think of this before?” features. Imagine this scenario. You need to quickly jot down something – a phone number, a message or a scribble. You’ll need to scan your fingerprint or unlock your phone, search for your app, fire up your app and then write your message.What if you can do it with a single step? Well, now you can. Just detach the stylus and write on the screen. There is no step two. And that’s brilliant. In smartphones, especially in the flagship Galaxy series, audio has always been something of an afterthought. Pretty strange if you think about it. Since we spend so much time on our phones listening to music, watching movies and playing games, why isn’t it made to deliver better quality sound?Audiophiles will love this. The Note 5 now has Ultra High Quality Audio (UHQA) support built in. That means you get up to 24bit/192kHz quality audio. A UHQA upscaler enhances existing MP3 music and make them all more listenable and enjoyable. The Note 5 includes a new UHQA-Bluetooth codec which means better quality audio streamed to your favourite Bluetooth headphones. And naturally, UHQA works perfectly with Samsung LEVEL.Samsung didn’t just adopt the best design and build elements from the S6 and S6 edge. It also brought one of my biggest loves about the S6 series – the amazing camera. We’ve raved about the  and even our . Make no mistake, the 16MP f/1.9 snapper with OIS is stunning, the best on any smartphone. It features an enhanced software-based OIS for smooth, shake-free video. Shoot high-resolution stills or 4K video. The only limit is your imagination. For taking selfies, the Note 5 gets a 5MP shooter, which is an upgrade from a 3.7MP unit on the Note 4. Performance is unmatched in low light and if you need fast autofocus and shutter, you’ve got the best in your hand. Photography is often spontaneous and unplanned, so simply double-click on the Home button to fire up the camera. All in under a second.So there you go, my 5 top features of the new Galaxy Note 5. I’m pretty sure you have your own favourite features, give us your thoughts below."
Alexander Wong,This is how much the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ could cost in Malaysia,,"Android,Dual Sim,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia Price,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus price,samsung malaysia,Samsung Singapore,Samsung Unpacked 2015,Singapore","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-17,": The Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+ have been . You can check out our  from the big 4 telcos. Samsung’s latest phablets the  and  were launched last week, both offering 5.7″ Quad HD displays and 4GB of RAM. For Malaysia, both devices are expected to arrive sometime in early September and if you’re curious about its pricing, we can gather some clues from our southern neighbours.The Galaxy Note 5 had went on sale in Singapore last Saturday, 15th August with two colour options Black Sapphire and Gold Platinum. Meanwhile the double edge Galaxy S6 edge+ will be available a week later on 22nd August with the same colour options.Just like the Galaxy S6/S6 edge, the Singapore market has the option for multiple storage options with 32GB and 64GB available. For easy reference, we’ve compared the launch prices of the past Galaxy flagships in Singapore below, which are inclusive of GST. As expected, the Galaxy Note 5 is priced slightly higher than the Galaxy S6, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ is a notch higher than the S6 edge. Based on the pricing in Singapore, we can roughly guess how much it will cost in Malaysia. With GST taking effect since April, you can expect to pay much more for the Note 5 compared to the previous RM2,499 price tag for the Galaxy Note 4. Assuming if GST was in effect back then, the Galaxy Note 4 would cost RM2,649 which is more than the Galaxy S6. Furthermore, the Note series is usually priced slightly higher than its compact Galaxy S series model.We are guessing that the Galaxy Note 5 could be priced around RM2,699 while the Galaxy S6 edge+ hovering around RM3,199. Take note that this is just an estimate and Samsung Malaysia could price them differently considering our depreciating ringgit and both phablets will be coming with Dual-SIM slots.

This is the same model that has been certified in our Malaysian SIRIM database carrying the model number SM-N9208. Let’s face it, the microSD slot is slowly disappearing from flagship smart phones these days. Performance is one of such reasons as there are different microSD standards and a slow card could hamper the overall user experience. This is more apparent as Samsung uses its high performance  and some alleged that unreliable external storage could hamper its overall performance. Samsung isn’t the only one singing the same tune as both  and Xiaomi too have omitted  from their flagship device.

An attempt at being Lenovo’s first camera smartphone crossover device, it’ll join the list of other devices that the company has  – upping their game from budget options to a more luxurious label.Built to look like a camera, albeit sporting a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display on the front, the phone features a camera button solely to improve usability for instant camera activation and photo taking.

Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy Note 5: Not bigger but noticeably better all round,,"Android,Dual Sim,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Dual SIM,samsung Galaxy Note 5 First Impressions,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 hands-on,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,samsung malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"Samsung has created a market for productivity phablets with its Galaxy Note series. With more players cashing in on the big screen phablet game, Samsung has to stay ahead beyond just having a bigger screen and better specs. The last Galaxy Note 4 was a great device but it faced stiffer competition with the likes of the iPhone 6 Plus. With an early announcement for 2015, the Galaxy Note 5 aims to secure its spot as the new king of the hill for the remainder of 2015. Read on for our hands-on experience to find out about this 5th generation productivity phablet.  Before that let’s talk more about the device. The overall build quality has been improved and you get the same premium look and feel as the Galaxy S6. Gone is the faux leather back that made its debut on the Galaxy Note 3 and it now gets a stylish looking curve glass at the back, that’s similar to the . This design somewhat makes the device to better to hold as compared to the Galaxy S6 edge which has little area to grip with its thin metal frame.The screen size of 5.7″ has been retained but Samsung has managed to make the Galaxy Note 5 thinner (7.6mm) and lighter (171g) than its predecessor. On-board the Galaxy Note 5 gets a choice of either 32GB and 64GB storage options. Like the Galaxy S6, there’s no expandable microSD card memory and you would need to rely on cloud storage for further expansion.The front Super AMOLED display still retains its Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440 and it pushes a pixel density of 518 ppi, which is still among the sharpest in its class. Powering the internals is a familiar 14nm process Exynos Octa-Core processor that’s mated with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. The decision of using the same processor as the Galaxy S6 isn’t a bad thing considering it performed well and it is still the best performing processors out there at the moment. From our brief experience, the processor and the generous 4GB RAM combo combined promises a buttery smooth experience for the hardcore multi-taskers. The S-Pen has been completely redesigned. Gone are the days where you need to pry the end with your fingernails as the Note 5 features an eject mechanism, popping up the end of the S-Pen with a light push. In the last Note 4, the S-Pen has doubled its pressure sensitivity to 2048 levels. On the new Note 5, Samsung claims to have improved the experience, making it as close to writing on paper.  Taking down notes is even faster on the Note 5 as you can start scribbling on the front display even while the screen is off. This saves time unlocking the device and finding the app to jot your notes down. The Air Command has been improved with more customisation and it allows you to add shortcuts to your favourite apps.As we move towards a digital office, there are some things that still require analog input. With the Note 5’s enhanced handwriting feature, you can now digitally sign PDF documents and have it sent out by email instantly. So you save time printing and re-scanning documents. Another neat feature is taking screenshots with its scroll capture. This allows you to capture a whole web page or a long chat message in a single action. For those that still prefer to type on a tactile keyboard, Samsung has also released a Keyboard Cover which lets you type on a full QWERTY keyboard. The case is surprisingly thin and it lays over the touch screen covering the bottom portion of the device. There’s no batteries or bluetooth pairing required and it connects directly on the touch screen display. When not in use, you can move the keyboard towards its back cover. The Galaxy Note 5 gets a 16MP f/1.9 main camera that’s assisted with optical image stabilisation and it is capable of shooting 4K videos. The front camera gets a 5MP f/1.9 unit, that’s also similar with the Galaxy S6. To launch the camera at any time, it is also triggered by double pressing on the home button. For great shots anytime, it has Auto HDR for both front and back cameras. In terms of features, it gets better stabilisation for video and now there’s also an option to broadcast your moments live on YouTube. This isn’t new for a flagship smart phone but nevertheless it is a good option to have especially when you need to share an important moment in real time. Just make sure you’re in a location with fast upload speeds on 4G. 
For high speed downloads, the Note 5 supports 4G LTE up to Cat 9 speeds, where available. It also gets 802.11ac WiFi with MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC. Surprisingly Samsung has dropped its Infrared blaster, which has always being a standard feature on its previous flagships. Health still remains one of Samsung’s key focus and it still retains a heart rate sensor module that also houses its camera’s LED flash. For the very first time in Malaysia, the Galaxy Note 5 will come with Dual-SIM slots, which is good news for globetrotters and mobile warriors that want to separate both personal and work lines. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery that supports both fast charging by cable as well as wireless charging. Using compatible adaptive fast charge, it takes 90 minutes for a full charge. The Galaxy Note 5 has also improved its wireless charging speeds, with 0-100% being accomplished in 2 hours. Like the S6, it supports both wPC and PMA wireless charging standards. The Galaxy Note 5 comes in four colours – White Pearl, Black Sapphire, Gold Platinum and Silver Titanium. US and Canada will be among the first in the world to get it starting next week 21st August, with the rest of the world to follow shortly after. Some might argue that the Galaxy Note 5 is just an incremental upgrade from the Galaxy S6 but the winning formula is more than just better specs and a larger screen. For those who have gotten hooked to the S-Pen, the Galaxy Note 5 is a direct upgrade path with the top notch specs crafted in a premium package. Want to get more things done with a bigger screen? The Galaxy Note 5 still offers one of the best multi-tasking features that have been perfected over the years. Granted that the previous TouchWiz were pretty bloaty, the new iteration is much lighter and certainly there’s still room for Samsung to improve. For those who are not convinced with the S-Pen in the previous model, you certainly should give this version a try."
Alexander Wong,Xiaomi’s affordable Redmi Note 2 phablet undercuts other flagships,,"Dual Sim,Redmi Note 2,Redmi Note 2 Launch,Redmi Note 2 Prime,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Redmi Note 2,Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 Prime","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-08-13,"Xiaomi has just taken the covers off its new , an affordable priced phablet for the masses. While the previous  is seen as a cheap and good, the new version has moved the Redmi series up to the flagship league while maintaining its affordable price of under 1,000 CNY (RM625). The Redmi Note 2 is much thinner, lighter and narrower than the previous Redmi Note thanks to its compact design and narrower bezels. It looks like a bigger  and it has a 5.5″ IPS display which now pushes Full HD 1080p resolution. Overall, it is 8.25mm thin and weighs just 160 grams. The Redmi Note 2 is definitely no slouch as it gets MediaTek’s 64-bit Helio X10 MT6795 Octa-Core processor, which is the same unit that’s powering the  and . It consists of True 8x A53 cores that can run simultaneously. There are 2 versions available – A standard Redmi Note 2 getting a 2.0GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB LPDDR3 RAM and 16GB of storage, while the Redmi Note 2 Prime has a higher clocked 2.2GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB LPDDR3 RAM and 32GB of storage. According to Xiaomi, the Redmi Note 2 Prime scores over 54K on Antutu which even surpasses its own  and  flagships. For taking pictures, it not only gets a 13MP f/2.2 camera but it comes with Phase Detection Auto Focus that boast an ultra-fast 0.1 focus speeds. For the front it gets a 5MP shooter with Xiaomi’s own beautify mode. Also new for a Redmi series is an Infrared blaster which can be used as a universal remote. The Redmi Note 2 also comes with a microSD expansion slot and it is juiced up by a 3,060mAh removable battery that supports QuickCharge 2.0. In terms of connectivity it has faster 802.11ac WiFi and it also supports dual-SIM cards with 4G LTE. At time of release, the Redmi Note 2 is still running on MIUI 6 but it will be upgraded to MIUI 7 eventually. The Redmi Note 2 is priced at 799 CNY (RM499) for its China only TDD-LTE+TD-SCDMA variant, and 899 CNY (RM561) for its TDD-LTE + FDD-LTE version. Meanwhile the high-spec Redmi Note 2 Prime which supports both TDD-LTE and FDD-LTE standards is priced at 999 CNY (RM624). This is probably the  right now. The only question is how soon will it take for Xiaomi to release it in South East Asia. For more info, you can check out the  product page."

Alongside the , they have revealed its Mi WiFi nano, a tiny little wireless router that fits on your palm. Measuring just 91mm x 95.2mm, it is roughly the size of a coaster and it weighs just 100 grams. Best of all, it is priced at only 79 CNY, which is less than RM50. The Mi WiFi nano supports 802.11n connectivity with speeds up to 300Mbps and it boast superior signal strength with its external PCB Antennas. This is good enough to cover a space of about 150 square metres. For ease of management and monitoring, the Mi WiFi is connected via a mobile app that comes with an easy to use interface. Even if you’re not at home, you can see who’s accessing your network and set permissions if required. At the back, it gets 1X WAN port and 2X LAN Ports for wired connectivity. Another neat feature is that it powers by a micro USB port. This makes remote usage possible as you can power the Mi WiFi nano router for up to 30 hours with a single 10,000mAh power bank. It is amazing how the Mi WiFi nano could do so much in a little package. During its announcement, it showed a tear down of other competing routers and it clearly shows that efficient PCB design has contributed to its compact footprint. Will we ever get this officially in Malaysia? It is unlikely to be anytime soon until Xiaomi releases an English version of its firmware. If you’re interested, the slightly bigger Mi WiFi is going for , while the  with 1TB storage can be yours at . Obviously they are imports and you would need to know Chinese to get started.

Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge gets a Plus for a bigger screen,,"Android,Curved Display,Dual Sim,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus first impressions,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus hands on,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"If you’ve always wanted to get an  for its dual curve display but held back due to its smaller 5.1″ size, the folks at Samsung has probably heard your prayer. Like the name suggests, the  is a larger Galaxy S6 edge with a phablet size display. The screen isn’t the only thing that has been upgraded as the the internals for both hardware and software have gotten plus size in their own areas. Underneath this familiar looking device, the Galaxy S6 edge+ is an identical Galaxy Note 5 underneath minus the productivity S-Pen. Strangely Samsung didn’t release the successor of the , but instead they have upgraded an existing Galaxy S smart phone it into a phablet device. The Galaxy S6 edge is a beautiful looking thing but holding it isn’t as reassuring as the flat edged Galaxy S6. On the bigger Galaxy S6 edge+, it is no different. The front has curved front glass that slops onto its thin frame. If we have both the S6 edge+ and Note 5 side by side, the Note feels more reassuring to hold with its thicker sides and a curved back glass that’s more natural to hold.The rest are identical, from the placement of its volume and power buttons down to its headphone jack, micro USB port and speaker grill. Looking at the top, you’ll find a SIM tray slot and that’s when you notice that it lacks an infrared blaster that used to be located in the middle. The front display is a Note category 5.7″ display that does a similar Quad HD resolution (2560×1440) with a pixel density of 518 ppi. Overall, it is a tiny bit thinner at 6.9mm (S6 edge: 7.0mm) and it is 21 grams heavier at 153g (S6 edge: 132g).  Although it shares the same Octa-Core Exynos processor, the Galaxy S6 edge+ gets 4GB RAM, which is 1GB more than the standard model. For storage, it has the same non-expandable 32GB or 64GB storage options using Samsung’s speedy Universal Flash Storage 2.0 solution. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery, which is 400mAh more than its smaller brother. While it gets the same native wireless charging, the Galaxy S6 edge+ like the Note 5 now supports faster wireless charging which does 0-100% charge in 2 hours. Compared to the Galaxy Note Edge, the S6 edge curved display doesn’t offer as much features due to its reduced curvature at the sides. Instead of a permanent “edge” panel, the edge display that’s customisable for either left or right was mostly used for People Edge, a customisable bar with 5 of your closest contacts. In addition, Samsung wants you to reach out to your contacts in a more emotional manner. So in addition to the typical call, SMS and email, the People Edge lets you send sketches, emoticons and video. As mentioned in our , we prefer if Samsung adds the option for instant message considering it is the main communication channel these days. While the screen is off, you still can take a peek on your notifications and infostream when you rub from left to right on the edge. In addition, they have introduced “Apps Edge” which offers additional 5 edge shortcuts for your favourite apps. Since the S6 edge+ shares similar underpinnings as the non-plus model, we reckon Samsung could be extending these additions for its current S6 edge models. Another nice touch is that the edge features are now accessible on any screen. As comparison, it could only be triggered on the home screen and you can’t toggle it if you’re running other apps. 
The rest of the S6 edge+ remains unchanged. You get the same excellent 16MP f/1.9 OIS camera at the back and a front facing 5MP f/1.9 camera at the front for better lit selfies. Similar to the Note 5, it does get Live YouTube Broadcast from the camera app as well. Nope, the battery isn’t removable and despite us getting a dual-SIM version in Malaysia, there’s no microSD expansion for the S6 edge+ either. So would you pick this over the Galaxy Note 5? They are identically the same underneath and the only difference is the curve display and productive S-Pen that sets them apart. The edge display to us has always been a technological showcase and it is hard to justify to pay a lot over a non-edge device for the sake of having a fancier screen. So the question of whether to get a Note 5 or an S6 edge+ really depends on whether you want something you can do more with or having a device that’s good to look at."

Touted to be the first tablet with customisable functional back covers, ASUS is adding the ZenPad 7.0 (Z370CG) into its tablet line-up and it joins its entry-level .

Those consuming media could be interested in the DTS-HD front speaker that the ZenPad 7.0 is equip with – touted to offer premium sound by ASUS. As a portable media device, the tablet will be considered quite light; 272g. It should be noted that the screen to body ratio is 72% and the dimensions are 189 x 110.9 x 8.7mm – considered light and compact for its dimensions, probably due to the plastic body that still has an upmarket feel, thanks to the leather-looking texture.Given the device’s affordable nature, it doesn’t come with 4G LTE and we’ll only get a 3G model that supports a single SIM. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’ own Zen UI.

Samsung’s unpacked event in New York today finally confirmed rumours and debunked some in the process, so say hello to the new  and the .Home-grown Exynos processors make an appearance and have been leading the way to better performance of our Samsung portable devices. Samsung might prove doubters wrong that every new generation, beckons the need for better performance; justifying the similar Exynos 7420 making a reappreance. Reusing the same processor as the old guard isn’t a totally horrible idea, as it continues to top AnTuTu benchmarks with over 67,000 points.The Galaxy S6 edge’s double edge display now gets a +, stretching the screen to phablet stardom at 5.7-inches. We might have a bigger screen but the other innards are all the same, except for a bigger battery. When the Galaxy S6 edge was first introduced, it came with a couple of features including a People’s Edge which brings your 5 favourite contacts closer to you. With the S6 edge+, they have enhanced this further with Apps Edge which allows you to put 5 app shortcuts within a thumb’s reach. In addition, the edge features are now accessible in any screen interface, instead of being limited to just the home screen.Even though internally it is very much the same but the introduction of the new Keyboard Cover accessory further enhances the typing experience on a large smart phone – giving it a more ergonomic feel that could possibly please die hard BlackBerry users.The Galaxy Note 5 is a similar device with the Galaxy S6 edge+, offering a 5.7″ Quad HD display and a similar Exynos Octa-Core processor with 4GB of RAM. The S-Pen is the key differentiation in the Galaxy Note series and already in its fifth generation, we’ve seen a steady progression of innovation. From AirView during the beginning to an extension of features which includes Action Memo, Screen Write and increasing pressure sensitivity. The Note 5 promises to bring a stylus experience to another level – touting it to be a close second to writing on paper.Accompanying the S-Pen’s housing silo which now has a push to eject mechanism will be the standard micro USB charging port. But if you’re not into cables, you could make use of its built-in wireless charging properties of the device which is similar to the Galaxy S6. You’ll get a 0% to 100% charge with the cable in 90 minutes with Adaptive Fast Charging, while wireless charging takes a little longer – 120 minutes for a full charge.Optimisation of the TouchWiz will be influential in keeping the lights on the 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED screened phablet that pushes a pixel density 518 ppi. That latest battery-friendly Exynos processor and 4GB RAM might help and hopefully won’t stump the 3,000mAh battery too much as the older Note 4 survived quite well on a battery larger by 220mAh.Encased in metal and glass, the Note 5 will be thinner and among the lightest Note ever, weighing just 169g. For imaging we’ll see a familiar 16-megapixel sensor on the back with Optical Image Stabilisation coupled with a 5-megapixel front camera. Moving on to another sensory experience, the Note 5 will return with UHQ audio capabilities which helps to upscale low bit audio to a higher quality. Probably the biggest omission on the new Note would be a microSD slot and a removable battery, a trend which is slowly disappearing with flagship smart phones today.Both phablets will be making their way to our shores with dual-SIM enabled, catering to those who prefer to have one mobile devices for work and their social life. Also included as standard is its signature heart rate sensor and a capacitive home button that doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. In terms of availability, it is expected to go on sale in Malaysia as early as first week of September.

soyacincau,Compared: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 versus Galaxy Note 4,,"galaxy note 5,S Pen,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note 4,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Malaysia,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,stylus","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"Nearly a year has gone since the  and flash-forward to the present with the arrival of the much anticipated  is a reality. Today we aim to pit the old against the new and discuss the main differences, mainly positive but some questionable.The mobile tech giant has made some brand-new features both in hardware and software. Mentioning the former first, the processor gets an upgrade from the Exynos 5433 (SM-N910C) / Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 (SM-N910S) to the chart-topping AnTuTu scorer, the Exynos 7420. Samsung’s newest phablet also gets a 1GB bump in the RAM department compared to the Note 4 (3GB), adhering to the current industry standard for new flagships.Furthering connectivity speeds is the Note 5’s latest LTE Cat 6/Cat 9 pushing the older Cat 4 enabled Note 4 out of the water, with blistering future-proof speeds once telecommunication infrastructure is done catching up. Moving to the camera, we’ll see a similar 16-megapixel main camera, but the front shutter is now 5-megapixels from the previous 3.7-megapixels. Samsung has said to make the camera interface zippier as launching speeds have improved from 1.1 seconds to 0.6 seconds. Audio advancements are now up scaled to support an ultra-high-quality listening experience – couple that with Samsung Milk Music and you’ll be set to enjoy yourself.The star of the show of course will be the spring loaded eject-able S-Pen that will no longer chip anymore finger nails. Samsung has promised that the feeling of writing will be as close as to writing on paper but hasn’t mentioned raw specifications of increasing pressure sensitivity as for now. Hardware aside, it’ll also be enhanced to Scroll Capture long screenshots with Screen Write: a sure favourite for long direction instructions and conversations. Air command will now always appear on-screen to assist you with your S-Pen functionality.Off-screen notes can be easily written with the S-Pen just by simply tapping on the screen with the stylus while in standby. PDF annotations are also easier with the S-Pen, giving users the means to simply sign a PDF document using the stylus and sending it off to be printed for your business needs.Design language also takes a turn with the latest iteration of the Note series. Gone are the days of plastically backs and in comes a more superior built product. Comparing the old and the new side by side and you’ll be able to tell them distinctively apart, especially so when you take a look around the edges and rounded backing of the Note 5. Placement of the camera and audio speakers have been adjusted to make the device better to look at and change the listening experience a little. Making up the bottom is now the moved speaker, and audio jack, while the positions of the S-Pen and micro-USB port remain. The phablet is now lighter too, weighing in at 171g, opposed to 176g (Note 4) and comes in a smaller footprint – 153.2 x 76.1 x 7.6mm compared to the slightly larger Note 4 (153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5mm)Samsung has addressed some qualms – mostly related to its stance on premium materials and removable batteries. Seeing a change of trend towards users who prefer a more luxurious feel, the Korean manufacturer has decided that it was time to exclude removable batteries in replacement of a metal encased design From the S6 series to the current Note 5, we’re now seeing a more streamlined aesthetically pleasing device with more metal and glass. Although, there will always be trade-offs and this time it’s no exception, as the glass will pick up finger prints and smudges quite easily. The battery also takes a hit, now only 3,000mAh battery housed in non-removable fashion due to the unibody design, which dips from the old Note 4 – 3,220mAh.Worry not, as the Note 5 will be helped along by fast charging the device from 0% – 100% takes 90 minutes, 9 minutes quicker than its predecessor. If cables is not your thing, you’ll be happy as the newer Note even supports fast wireless charging, although charge times are nothing to shout about (0% – 100% in 120 minutes). Other than the removable battery omission, we’re also seeing an exodus of MicroSD support from the Note 5 – unsure why they decided to go down this route, seeing as dual-SIM trays usually are hybrids, allowing users to choose two SIMs or use one + a MicroSD card. Lastly, seemingly seen as an odd decision, Samsung decided to leave out the infared blaster seen on older released devices.To cap-off, the Note 5 has made refinements in these categories:and sacrificed some features in the process, as well:We’ll see how the Note 5 fares when it goes on sale in selected regions, while it’ll make an appearance sometime in September for our local market.[  ]"

Seeing much success in this area, the people behind Znaps, the Magnetic Adapter have envisioned the same but for your mobile devices.Consisting of two magnetic parts: the adapter (plugs into your existing cable’s connector) and the connector (stays in your device’s charging port). A simple solution that will attempt to lessen fraying, tripping and fiddling with your cables. Built initially for Micro USB and iOS’ lighting adapter only, the company has added a stretch goal of future-proof USB Type-C. All aforementioned goals have already been reached, with the company raking up an excess of $2.5 million Canadian Dollars so far in funding.One would wonder why Apple didn’t bother capitalising and licensing this technology much earlier but the folks at Znaps have refuted claims of patent infringement and possible suing – saying that this is why they didn’t create a cable mechanism, instead deploying custom adapters and connectors.Znaps aims to provide support for Quick Charge 2.0 giving it future-proofing factors in the long run. The nifty add-on will also let data transfers to function normally, as per usual cable and is seemingly compatible with other devices that use a Micro-USB, lighting and USB Type-C ports (power banks, laptops using USB Type-C, and other peripherals that require charging/data transfers)Cross-cable swapping (if that’s even a term) will be made easy – so basically you won’t be dictated by what cable you have, simply as long as you have the right adapter and the right connector to your device. Their pledging system has been plagued with complains, so Znaps has come up with a custom pledge calculator that’ll do the work for you. Prices will be reflected below ($1 CAD = RM 3.01)Delivery of the said product is estimated to arrive in November 2015 but as Kickstarter projects have flopped and been delayed before – like these cases: , , .

If you’re looking for better specs without the phablet size, the R7 will be available starting tomorrow 12th August at RM1,598. But you’ve got to hurry since there’s only 2,000 units to go around for now. The OPPO R7 slots in between in the R7 family and it features a 5″ Full HD AMOLED display with a 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor and 3GB of RAM. It gets 16GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD, a 13MP main and a large 8MP front camera for higher resolution selfies.Keeping the lights on is a 2,320mAh capacity battery which supports VOOC Flash Charge and overall the R7 is only 6.3mm thick. Despite having an all metal build, the R7 is lighter than its ultra-slim  at just 147 grams. In terms of design, the OPPO R7 is identical to its R7 Lite and the only way to tell the difference is the display, since the Lite version pushes just HD 720p resolution. Another difference is the operating system where the OPPO R7 still runs on Android 4.4 KitKat. This is surprising since its R7 Lite and R7 Plus are already running on Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Nevertheless OPPO Malaysia promises that a Lollipop software update will be made available for the R7 soon. Like the rest of the family, the OPPO R7 series supports 4G LTE and Dual-SIMs, with the 2nd slot doing double duty as a microSD expansion if required. For those that pre-ordered the R7 Plus, it will be available starting this Friday, 14th August. If you’re one of them, OPPO will be contacting you soon on collection details. For the R7 Lite, there’s no firm availability details yet but OPPO Malaysia is targeting by end of August."

No mention if these will be the same variants that make it to Malaysia but it’ll be a rough indication what to expect.Aside from all the cellular and internal memory differences, all 3 share a Kirin 935 processor that has 8 cores: 4 high powered running at 2.2GHz and 4 efficient cores clocked at 1.5GHz. While, those on a strict budget can opt for the more affordable 16GB dual-SIM LTE model but make use of the MicroSD slot that is available on all variants.Camera bugs who emphasise on pixels will be pleased with a 20-megapixel Sony sensor protruding out of the back of the smart phone, while a decent 8-megapixel shutter makes up the front. The Honor 7 will also come with a fingerprint scanner for biometric security functionality. 3GB of RAM gives the device ample memory to handle multitasking on the distinctive EMUI 3.1 overlay of Android 5.0 Lollipop. To cap off, juicing all these internals will be a 3100mAh battery that is non-removable.Do let us know if you’re excited about likeliness of the Honor 7 coming our way in the comments below.Thanks to  for pointing out the SIRIM listing and Facebook post to us.[  ]"

The first details are about the graphical performance and the new image signal booster (ISP). They unfortunately haven’t given out anything else about the 64-bit chip, like its running temperature.The Adreno 530 GPU has a leg up on its predecessor, the Adreno 430 GPU that was in the Snapdragon 810 with the aforementioned 40% increase in graphic capability according o benchmarks. It also has a nice 40% decrease in power consumption too, thanks to power gating that lets the GPU go faster to idle modes and save power.

Like the current S6 edge, there’s no removable battery but some are speculating that the dual-SIM slot might offer a hybrid microSD/2nd SIM card option.

Blass goes on to state that Huawei will go on to launch this device during IFA 2015, on the 2 of September.Based on the design language and timing of the launch, this could very well mean that their latest device will take over the current 6-inch  phablet but conflicting reports say otherwise. Media correspondents from China are claiming this could be Huawei’s stab at a smaller screened device. Slated to include a 4.7-inch screen that pushes 1920 x 1080 pixels, the device will run a Kirin Octa-core processor and have a Mali-T624 graphics on-board – based on information from AnTuTu’s benchmark site.If the aforementioned specs leave you quite disappointed, you’ll be happy to hear the opposing rumours of the latest device. Considering that the Mate 7 utilised the latest and greatest processor at its time of release, if it were to be the Mate 8 that arrives, it’ll potentially feature a yet to be seen Kirin 950 processor. The processor in question will be capable of clock speeds that max out at 2.4GHz, which is promising. This means it could definitely give the Snapdragon 810 and the Exynos 7420 a run for its money.All of this numbers are only in theory, nothing has be shown in practice yet but the 64-bit processor will support 4K video, USB 3.0 transfers, LPDDR4 RAM , and a i7 co-processor for sensor hub and security processing. Audio-enthusiasts will also be awed at the processor’s dedicated DSP audio co-processor (Tensilica Hi-Fi 4 DSP).However, don’t jump the gun yet, as they are only rumours and leaks. As IFA draws closer, surely more information will come to light and we’ll have to see whether it’ll be a Mate 7 Mini or the beastly Mate 8.[ , , ,  ]"

A much anticipated refresh of the  series will be unveiled tomorrow. Taking place in the Big Apple itself, it’ll also feature the newer and bigger . Introduced , the Galaxy Note series had created a whole new phablet category, promising a tablet-like experience in a smart phone form factor. With a 5.3″ screen, it was considered quite huge during its time and most flagship smart phones are at least 5.5 inches these days. Can Samsung maintain its phablet king status in its 5th generation?Here’s the stuff we know about the Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ and it’s quite a mouthful.Practically everything has already been leaked but the weight of this information should always be taken with a grain of salt to ensure no disappointment. For the Note 5, we’ve seen mock-ups, , benchmarks and even the ! Not short on building the hype for the actual device, which is assumed to carry either a 64-bit Exynos 7420 Octa-core processor or a better Exynos 7422 with an all-in-one chip solution. Screen size will stick to the 5.7-inch footprint and utilise its own Super AMOLED display technology with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 (Quad HD).Performance will be helped along with an ample amount of RAM at 4GB and internal storage will cap off at 32GB. Some will be put-off by omitting the microSD option but will take comfort in the S-pen being improved to auto-eject through a spring loaded mechanism. Some sources go on to say that the device will be as heavily skinned as previous iterations, as TouchWiz and S-pen apps will be taking the load from the 4GB, leaving probably about only half left to be used.Snapping photos will be made using a 16-megapixel rear shooter that takes advantage of OIS feature and the front will be a decent 5-megapixel sensor, similar to its current Galaxy S6. In terms of battery capacity, the Galaxy Note 5 is said to be having a 3,000mAh capacity battery that’s non-removable. Just like the Galaxy S6, the battery is smaller than its predecessors but Samsung reckons that its frugal Exynos processor and Universal Flash Storage would sip less power.  Skimming only halfway through, we’ve yet to mention the Galaxy S6 edge+. Design aesthetics will not be much to rave about for the S6 edge+ will retain the same design as the S6 edge, just a slight increase in its width and length (obviously being a 5.7-inch display). The processor is likely to be the same Exynos 7420 powerhouse but it gets 4GB of RAM just like the Note 5. The battery is expected to be similar with the Note 5, housing a 3,000mAh capacity unit that’s embedded into its unibody form. The double edge display will also be  with more features so you can use it for more than just contacting your 5 favourite contacts. For better productivity, Samsung is expected to introduce a  accessory which turns the S6 edge+ into a full QWERTY typing machine. A  indicates that the keyboard add-on would cost 60 Euros, or approximately RM263 when converted directly. For those juggling between 2 mobile plans, the new Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ are very likely to come with  support as spotted recently on our SIRIM certification database. While there’s no microSD expansion slots, there are those who are hoping that Samsung might allow you to pop-in a microSD card onto the 2nd SIM slot just like its current .Though all this information has come out, we’ve yet to hear anything about the price range of the two devices. Based on past launch prices of these devices, we’ll attempt to speculate the range of Samsung’s newest additions:Looking at how Samsung priced their previous models and considering GST has kicked in, we reckon that the Galaxy Note 5 could be priced around RM 2,699, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ hovers above the RM 3,100 mark. Definitely they are not going to be cheap but it is still more affordable than the iPhone 6 Plus that’s priced at RM3,126 for its base 16GB model. With 2 new flagship phones, we expect Samsung to slash prices of its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge by about RM200-300 and this is  worldwide. In terms of availability, the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+ could go on sale as early as end of this month. For Malaysia, we reckon both models could go on sale in . Leaks were abundant with the two devices but Samsung has also teased us with the  with a mysterious third device.

One of which is its new inclusion in ; a new company who will be managing Google and all it associated products.This means that there will be an extra eye on Google as a company and Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies and according to Google the move was meant to make their operations cleaner and more accountable as they push new technologies like their glucose detecting smart contact lenses and.This of course, will be affecting users on a more subtle level for now, but the new company wants to make a real difference in the long term view. So we might be seeing changes in the way Google operates (as they say this new Google is “slimmer” than it used to be) and perhaps even more growth as they are going to be focusing on pushing on potentials they already have.Alphabet Inc. will be replacing Google Inc. as will Google shares convert into the same number of shares for Alphabet, essentially making Google a wholly-owned subsidiary of said company. But don’t worry, all the apps we know and love will be staying the same for now. In terms of leadership, co-founder Larry Page will be the CEO of Alphablet Inc while Sergey Brin holds the President position. Meanwhile Sundar Pichai which used to head Android has now been appointed as CEO of Google Inc.  What do you think this big change will bring for Google?[]"

This looks like a  for the iPhone, that was short-lived due to lawsuits by BlackBerry.The keyboard covers up the bottom portion of the device and it offers the typical 3 Android buttons for Recent Apps, Home and Back. It does look interesting but the overall solution does look bulky considering this is a phablet category device. Furthermore with the attachment in place, we wonder if there’s another fingerprint sensor on the add-on keyboard since the home button has been covered fully. If you love the tactile feel of a physical keyboard, this may be your cup of tea and it has been a long time since we saw a new Android device with a full keyboard. But we are not too sure about the size though and already we felt that the BlackBerry Passport is too huge for our liking. [ ,  ]"

With the release of the , they have renewed its partnership with the latest range of Atom processors including its 2.3GHz Quad-Core Z3580 processor that comes with an epic serving of 4GB RAM.At yesterday’s Zen Festival event in New Delhi, ASUS has announced a new Zenfone 2 Laser line up that runs on Qualcomm’s processors instead. To make it stand out from the current Zenfone 2, it gets an extra Laser AF feature, hence the “Laser” moniker. This allows the camera to focus onto subjects as quick as 0.3 seconds especially under low light. Meanwhile the design is still unmistakably a Zenfone 2 with a curve back and a rear mounted volume rocker. Typical of ASUS, the Zenfone 2 Laser comes in 4 different variants with various screen size ranging from 5 to 6 inches.It starts with the ZE500KG and ZE500KL that comes with a 5″ HD 720p display.

Another difference is the battery where it is listed to come with either a 2,070mAh unit or a larger 2,400mAh option. These models would compete directly with the likes of the  that are priced under RM500.Moving up a notch is the 5.5″ Zenfone 2 Laser which is likely to be the popular choice. The front display is a larger 5.5″ size with a HD 720p resolution and accompanying it is a generous 3,000mAh capacity battery. Under the hood, it is the same story with a Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. It also comes with the same 13MP f/2.0 and 5MP f/2.0 camera combo, dual-SIMs with 4G LTE and a microSD slot supporting up to 128GB cards.For those wanting a bigger screen like the former , there’s also a 6 inch variant and it gets beefier specs with a Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. Unlike the previous models, the 6″ ZE601KL gets a Full HD (1920×1080) display for greater clarity. Apart from these upgrades, the rest of the device is the same including its 3,000mAh capacity battery.

In terms of performance, the Intel Z3580 processor has  than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 801 processors. Since the Zenfone brand is often associated being cheap and good, the price would be the main deciding factor. The obvious compromise is its lower HD 720p screen resolution especially on the 5.5″ Zenfone 2 Laser model but ASUS tries to make up for it in the imaging department by fitting a Laser AF.

We also expect the Galaxy Note 5 to support wireless charging natively without extra cases, just like the S6. To recap on the specs, the Galaxy Note 5 is predicted to carry the same Exynos 7420 Octa-Core processor as the Galaxy S6, but it gets 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM along with storage options starting from 32GB.

The Galaxy Note 4 was launched in Malaysia at RM2,499 and judging from the Galaxy S6 RM2,599 retail price, do expect to fork out more for a Note 5 this year.

In comparison with its higher-spec  (now priced at RM569 with GST), the ZenPad C 7.0 gets a newer processor but it only offers 1GB instead of 2GB RAM that’s being offered on the FonePad 7. If you take photos on a tablet, the FonePad 7 would be better as it has higher 8MP PixelMaster main camera while selfies are taken by its 2MP front camera. The ZenPad C 7.0 is quite light at 265 grams and has a thickness of 8.4mm. At time of release, it runs on a newer Android 5.0 Lollipop along with its custom ZenUI.

With about a week left to its , case maker Spigen has started offering a wide range of protective covers for the Galaxy Note 5 and the Galaxy S6 edge+. This yet again confirms what we’ve seen in the  and it doesn’t stray away from the Galaxy S6/S6 edge design language. If you’re definitely putting your money on one of these new flagships, you can now order your case from Spigen with shipping expected to start from 1st September for selected models. Just to recap, both phablet models are expected to run on the same benchmark topping Exynos 7420 processor with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM with the Note 5 retaining a 5.7″ Quad HD display. Following the S6, both the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ are almost certain to come without any expandable microSD slot and the unibody design also means that the battery is also non-removable. The cameras from the S6 are likely to be retained, which includes a 16MP camera with Optical Image Stabilisation, while the front keeps its 5MP selfie shooter that supports wide selfie. There won’t be any “Note Edge” this time around. If you’re looking for a device with a unique screen to show off, you’ll have the S6 edge+ which is basically the phablet version of the curent S6 edge. With a larger screen, both Note 5 and S6 edge+ would pack large battery capacities but word has it that it would be just 3,000mAh, that’s smaller compared to its previous Note series.If you’re interested to get a case, you can check out Spigen’s  and  product rage.

Arif Lee,Another OnePlus phone will arrive in December 2015,,"A2003,Brightstar Malaysia,Maxis,maxis oneplus two malaysia,OnePlus,oneplus 2,OnePlus 2 Malaysia,OnePlus 2 Maxis,OnePlus Malaysia,oneplus two,OnePlus Two malaysia,oneplus two maxis,OxygenOS,SIRIM,USB Type C","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-08-04,"Fresh on the launch of the , OnePlus’ co-founder Carl Pei was just recently quoted by USA Today that one of the potential models that cropped up during the  (SIG) listings, could hit the market just in time for Christmas holiday shopping.Here’s a quick recap of the timeline of events that lead-up to OnePlus’ industry first grand VR launch as follows:
So following the VR launch, we only saw one device but at two different capacities, 16GB and 64GB. While this conflicts with earlier reports from Carl Pei, himself, this could just mean it wasn’t time yet for this particular OnePlus smartphone . Although, it’s confirmed that there is a OnePlus mini on the way, where the phone could be completely redesigned and more aesthetically focused as opposed to just being internally powerful.Mr Pei, went on to iterate that he was very close to choosing this upcoming device over the OnePlus 2 and it’ll be hard for users to decide between the two, so maybe those interested in picking up their new OnePlus toy should wait around Christmas to compare the two before making a purchase.During the interview, Pei also hit back at criticism behind omitting NFC from the OnePlus 2. He said that “Very few people are using NFC, so we cut it. It’s as simple as that”. He then went on to say most users keep their devices at a 12 to 18 month life-cycle, so by that time, there might be a reason to put it on OnePlus’ next phone.The current OnePlus 2, will likely come to Malaysian shores in the next couple of months. As SIRIM certification has been completed it won’t be too long before a partnership between distributor, Brightstar and Maxis lets us pick up the phone in stores.A short specs recap of the OnePlus 2 for those interested – the OnePlus 2 is equipped with a 5.5” Full HD display that is capable of a 1500:1 contrast aspect ratio, the infamous but revamped Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Octa-core processor mated to 4GB of RAM. The camera gets a bump too with a 13-megapixel shooter, which is accompanied by Optical Image Stabilisation technology and Laser Auto Focus, while the front dons a 5-megapixel sensor. Powering all this is a larger 3,300 mAh battery that will be charged using the newest USB Type C connector and the “2” will also support dual Nano-SIMs that are 4G LTE enabled. The 16GB version of the “2” retails at US$329 (approx RM 1,256), while the 64GB variant goes for US$389 (approx RM1,485).[ , ]"

China’s uprising brand Xiaomi will be having an event of their own which focuses on the software side of things. As shown above, it will be their MIUI 7, their latest iteration of its custom ROM. It has been a year since MIUI 6 was  with a clean and flat interface, which looks heavily inspired by .The current MIUI 6 was originally based on Android 4.4 KitKat and most recently it supports Android 5.0 Lollipop on their new  smart phone. While it is Lollipop underneath, it doesn’t feature any of the Material Design elements that came as standard on most devices. Looking at the “7” teaser, Xiaomi might just incorporate some of the flat Material Design appearance this time around and it will be likely based on the current Android 5.1.1. With  expected to go live by end of this year, Xiaomi seriously needs to look beyond just Lollipop. In terms of availability, their current flagships like the Mi Note and Mi 4i could be among the first to get it before it trickles down to the rest of its Redmi family.Will Xiaomi announce a new device? It might be possible but we are not expecting a Mi 5 flagship anytime soon, at least for this quarter.   [ ,  ]"

Announced  last month, the Galaxy Tab S2 is their thinnest and lightest tablet yet at 5.6mm and it weighs from just 265g (Tab S2 8.0 WiFi). The local tech media will be invited for a preview this week but retailer SenHeng has published its retail price along with its bundled freebies.The Galaxy Tab S2 comes in 2 sizes – a compact 8.0 incher and a full size 9.7″ version, both of which are now having a 4:3 display aspect ratio, that’s similar to the iPad. For the Malaysian market, we are getting only the 4G LTE versions. Compared to the previous Galaxy Tab S, the new version gets a dip in display with a Retina Display-like 2048×1536 pixels resolution, instead of a Quad HD 2560×1600 resolution. Under the hood, it gets an Exynos 5433 Octa-Core (Quad 1.9GHz + Quad 1.3GHz) processor mated to 3GB of RAM, which is the same powerhouse as the Galaxy Note 4. In terms of storage, we are getting 32GB on board which can be expanded with microSD up to 128GB. Don’t expect anything fancy with the camera as it gets a 8MP main unit and a front facing 2.1MP shooter. Out of the box, it runs on a more current Android 5.0 Lollipop and keeping the lights on is a 4,000mAh capacity battery for the 8 inch version, while the bigger 9.7″ tablet gets a 5,870mAh capacity unit. In terms of price, it is quite similar with the previous version with the Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 going for RM1,699, while the Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 is priced at RM1,999. Based on SenHeng’s listing, they are throwing in 12 months free  subscription, Milk Music streaming service and a free Bluetooth Speaker worth RM129. Stocks are said to be available by mid August. It is also worth mentioning that the new Tab S2 comes with 32GB of storage, which is double of what was  on the first gen Galaxy Tab S. Like the previous version, the Tab S2 also supports telephony functions such as calls and SMS. [  ]"

There are couple of Chinese brands that tried to do something different like the / series with a rotatable camera and a rather odd  that has a flip out camera lens.Huawei is up to something as well and a new Honor device has been spotted on China’s TENAA database with a rather interesting camera design. Both front and rear cameras are placed onto a sliding module which can be popped-up when required. A large physical button is spotted at the sides, which could be used to spring the camera into action. The rear camera is always visible no matter what position its on but the front camera remains hidden until the slider is popped out. While it looks out of the norm, we simply don’t see any benefits of such approach considering the lens are still having a fixed position. At least on the OPPO N3, the rotating camera module is motorised, allowing you to take a hassle free panorama shots in either vertical or horizontal. Perhaps the front of the smart phone looks cleaner this way but seriously nobody is complaining if there’s a selfie camera placed upfront. There’s no word on its full specs and if this aims to be a super camera phone, they should put more emphasis on its camera sensor, optics and its UI. Do you see any real benefits of a slider camera lens?[ ,  ]"

Previously, when we ran the  we thought it would be the end of that, well other than the articles about the WiFi Sense feature. We were wrong.Microsoft has announced since  that Windows 10 would be free to upgrade, within one year of its launching for those running Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. One can draw a conclusion that their new strategy would be bombarding Windows 10 users with targeted ads.Verging on intrusive to say the least, Microsoft’s Windows 10 has fairly distrustful monitoring that includes watching your locational movements, any info from messages, calendars and even going through your contact list. Anyone who wants to dig deep into the  and , feel free to do so but to simplify things, the OS will associate you to a unique advertising ID that is tied to your e-mail address. In turn, tailoring ads specific to your usage of your device.Usage of Cortana will further intensify the harvesting of your personal information. Though, the likeliness of you ever noticing this breech of privacy will be low, as it’ll appear in Windows Store apps – a newly launched venture that hasn’t picked up much traction, yet. As sinister as all this is, there are a handful of settings you can tweak to limit the amount of personal data leaking out on the inter-webs.
Officially, it’ll take a lot of tweaking and reading to fully understand what settings will exactly serve what purpose but if you’re absolutely sure about not wanting anything to get out, you can just set everything to “no”. The case is much easier for those who have yet to install Windows 10, just ensure you decline the “Express setting” and take your time to set the options yourself manually. Do ensure you refuse the OS or apps to access your location and turn off Cortana search. To those who went express and have Windows 10 already installed, just follow the easy how-to below.  Go to Settings > Privacy and individually go through the 13 tabs on the left. The “General” tab will have the most important settings to look at, while users should consider the calendar option, based on their intentions to use syncing of birthdays, scheduled appointments and so on.
Cortana isn’t readily available in Malaysia yet but those who listed United States as their current location will have the feature enabled. As mentioned earlier in the article, Cortana will be one of the huge culprits when it comes to capturing information about you, so users should think wisely whether they truly need this application.
The following step is the most important one that affects your browser(s). Funny thing though, it’s located on an  under settings. It won’t be hard to miss but no one would expect Windows to add a hidden toggle switch in a place away from your computer settings. Just set both options to “Off”. It is a must to create a Microsoft account/use an existing one when setting up Windows 10, and the fact that you’re constantly signed on when using the OS. 
The last step is quite extreme and it is only for those who are paranoid of anything going up to the cloud. You can opt to remove your Microsoft account entirely from Windows 10 and instead, use a local account. This action will limit features of the following:-synchronisation of settings across all PCs using the same account
-authorisation from Windows Store and OneDriveTo do so go to Settings > Accounts > select local account.For further reading on the subject head on over [ ]"
