2016-02-01,2016 Toyota Rush updated in Indonesia – 7-seater TRD,"The Toyota Rush, which  in March last year (), is set to get an update for 2016. These images, from a sales-oriented website in Indonesia, show a refreshed TRD Sportivo version of the budget SUV. According to local reports, Toyota will be giving the Rush TRD Sportivo 7 and a new range-topping Rush TRD Sportivo Ultimo three rows of seven seats, while the Rush G from a rung below will continue in two-row/five-seater form. The latest TRD Sportivo gets a red highlight strip above the grille as well as decals on the shoulder line and spare wheel cover. The Ultimo seen here sports new wheels. Apparently, there will be a TRD Sportivo suspension set (shocks and springs) that will be softer and more comfortable than the standard suspension. It goes against the convention of TRD Sportivo = sporty = firmer, so it should be something unique tailored to Indonesian carbuyer requirements. This reconfiguration could be Toyota Astra Motor’s response to . The first batch of the latter, a seven-seat SUV version of the Mobilio, is currently being delivered to customers. Since January 23, over 1,000 units of the BR-V have been handed over.",Danny Tan
2016-01-29,"New G11 BMW 7 Series launched in Malaysia – 2.0 turbo 4cyl 730Li and 740Li, from RM599k","The new BMW 7 Series has been officially launched in Malaysia. Munich’s limo and flagship saloon, now in its sixth generation (check out this nice ), will provide competition to the , ,  and . The G11 (we only get the long-wheelbase variant, so it’s G12 technically) is available here in 730Li and 740Li forms.The long-wheelbase 7 Series has a larger footrpint than before, at 5,238 mm long (+19 mm), 1,902 mm wide (unchanged) and 1,479 mm tall, with a 3,210 mm wheelbase (also unchanged). To compare, the LWB W222 S-Class is 5,246 mm long and 1,899 mm wide, with a 3,165 mm wheelbase. So, the BMW is 8 mm shorter overall, but has a 45 mm longer wheelbase than the Merc.While it might not look worlds apart from its predecessor, the new 7 Series is all-new and high-tech underneath. BMW’s Carbon Core construction – with tech gleaned from  development – utilises a combination of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), magnesium, aluminium and steel, resulting in increased strength and rigidity of the passenger cell  weight savings of up to 130 kg compared to the F01. Core aside, the use of aluminium for the doors and (for the first time) the bootlid also contributed to the weight loss. BMW says that unsprung mass has been cut by 15%, centre of gravity made lower and 50:50 weight distribution maintained. The 740Li is powered by a 3.0 litre inline-six engine with 326 hp from 5,500 to 6,500 rpm; and 450 Nm of torque from 1,380 to 5,000 rpm. The B58 twin-scroll turbo unit is from a new engine family and its crankcase, cylinder head and oil sump are all made from aluminium. The turbo features an indirect system of charge air cooling that is incorporated into the intake manifold, and this water-to-air intercooler provides a shorter route for the air. BMW claims better efficiency and response than the old N55 motor, which has 320 hp/450 Nm.Paired to a ZF eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission with Steptronic, the 740Li is capable of 0-100 km/h in a swift 5.6 seconds, on to a limited top speed of 250 km/h. Claimed combined fuel consumption is 6.6 litres per 100 km.The  is powered by a hero of a downsized motor, a 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder tasked to haul a big limo. This entry-level petrol engine for the 7 Series puts out 258 hp from 5,000 to 6,500 rpm; and 400 Nm of torque from 1,550 to 4,400 rpm. The B48 is a relatively new engine and has been seen in the , BMW / sisters and , but we’re seeing the most powerful version of it in the G11. Using an eight-speed auto, performance is far from shabby, with the benchmark 0-100 km/h sprint taking just 6.3 seconds. Top speed is at the regular 250 km/h mark, while fuel consumption is rated at 5.8 litres per 100 km, 0.8 l/100 km better than the 740Li. Not sold here, the  also uses this engine, but with an electric motor and lithium-ion battery in the mix., but the big cat’s 240 PS, 340 Nm and 7.5 seconds pale in comparison. Also weaker is the outgoing 730Li – powered by a NA 3.0 litre six-pot, it does 258 hp, 310 Nm and 7.5 seconds. No reason to fear downsizing, then.Both variants ride on air suspension (both axles) and 19-inch alloys (different styles) with 245/45 front tyres and fatter 275/40 rear ones. There’s also Dynamic Damper Control, and the 740Li adds on a new Executive Drive Pro “active chassis” system with electromechanical active roll stabilisation. The fancy  with LCD colour display and touch control panel (one can turn on the lights, open/close the windows, check fuel level and schedule the climate control, among other things, Remote Control Parking not available here) is standard across the board, as is the Design Pure Excellence package, which is basically an exterior chrome trim pack.Also standard are a four-zone auto air con, head-up display, Surround View, Welcome Light Carpet,  (Intelligent Emergency Call, Teleservices, Concierge Services and Remote Services), BMW Gesture Control for the infotainment system, Navigation System Professional with 10.25-inch touch display and HDD, plus a rear seat entertainment system with two 10-inch screens. The latter is controlled via the BMW Touch Command seven-inch tablet housed in the rear centre console. The removable tablet is made by Samsung.Speaking of rear seats, the big shots at the back can enjoy eight massage programmes including the Vitality programme, which allows one to engage in active physical exercise for recuperation purposes. Comfort seats at the back for 730Li, front and back for 740Li. Note that right-hand drive cars do not get the Executive Lounge Seating option featured in our  story until the second half of 2016. Both variants get a panorama glass roof, but only 740Li occupants get to enjoy the “Sky Lounge”. When it gets dark, the light emitted from side-mounted LED modules is directed evenly onto the glass surface, where it hits an imprinted graphic for a starry sky effect. Also exclusive to the 740Li is a 600w Harman Kardon sound system with nine channels with 16 speakers. The 730Li comes with a 205w “HiFi” system with 12 speakers. Not available here is the 7er range topping 1400w Bowers & Wilkins Diamond audio with 10-channel amp and 16 speakers.The 740Li also gets BMW Laserlight headlamps, which can be identified by a central blue-tinted horizontal bar. These top shelf items have a range of 600 metres in high-beam mode – twice the range of the LED headlights of the 730Li.The 730Li receives BMW Driving Assistant, a safety pack that includes Approach Control and Person Warning with light city braking, rear collision prevention, lane change and lane departure warning and rear cross traffic warning. BMW Driving Assistant Plus on the 740Li adds on stereo cameras and a radar for steering and lane control assist, lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection, traffic jam assistant for semi-autonomous driving, front/rear rear cross traffic assist, and Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go. Eight airbags are standard. Trim wise, the 740Li is lined with Nappa leather with diamond-pattern stitching and Poplar Grain Grey wood trim, with real leather dash top wrap, while the 730Li makes do with Dakota leather and Fineline wood. Both leather types can be had in Black, Canberra Beige or Cognac.We finally come to the price, which starts from  OTR without insurance for the 730Li and  for the 740Li. Decent pricing by BMW Group Malaysia for CBU imports (the  benefits from CKD hybrid tax exemptions), but the figures quoted are “exclusive prices” in conjunction with BMW’s 100-year anniversary, valid until further notice or while stocks last. Add RM100k to both numbers for the regular RRP (RM698,888 and RM888,800 respectively).",Danny Tan

The range of increase is from RM312 to RM2,021 depending on model, although the new price list will only be released at a later date, according to the company.The national carmaker says that the move to increase prices is due to the impact of foreign exchange and that “many raw materials are purchased in foreign currency.” The weaker ringgit affects Proton’s operating costs and the entire eco-system chain, Proton said in a release. The company adds that it has put in efforts to reduce operational cost and rationalise operations where necessary, to cushion the impact on its bottom line. This has been going on since August 2015. Despite these efforts, the depreciation of the ringgit continues to put pressure on Proton and affects the industry as a whole, the company reasons.In view of this, Proton is urging buyers to take advantage of , which include interest rates of 2.8% and a special graduate scheme with monthly instalments starting from RM258 a month.

2016-01-22,"Proton-badged Suzuki Ertiga MPV rendered, 3 versions","Now that  that there will be a Proton-badged Suzuki Ertiga, we commissioned rendering whiz Theophilus Chin to come up with renderings of the “Proton Ertiga”. The tiger-badged MPV won’t be called Ertiga, of course, and there’s a chance of Proton giving the donor car a different face, so this serves as merely an idea of what to expect. Theo delivered three sets with Proton badges – one of the  that surfaced in 2012, one based on  that debut at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show (GIIAS) 2015 show in August 2015, and another of the range topping  (below left), which has a completely different (and rather bizarre) face from the standard car. Also included is a pic of the Ertiga’s  with Proton’s emblem on the steering boss. What do you think? Should the national car company just keep it simple as seen here, or should a “more Proton face” be used?  The confirmation of the Ertiga as a fruit of Proton’s collaboration with Suzuki . News reports from the republic quoted local Suzuki arm PT Suzuki Indomobil Sales (SIS) saying that the Ertiga will be exported to Malaysia in knocked down form, from the second quarter of 2016.SIS will export 1,500 units of the Ertiga to Proton per month, which translates to a significant 18,000 units per year. Production of the knocked down kits headed for Malaysia will start at SIS’ factory in Cikarang from May this year. Proton had previously announced that the first Proton-Suzuki joint model will . Presently, Suzuki exports the Ertiga from Indonesia to various Asean countries such as the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Brunei in CBU form.

2016-01-28,"Jaguar XE debuts in Malaysia – 2.0, 3.0, from RM341k","The new  has finally been launched in Malaysia. Here to rival the ,  and , the premium compact sedan is available in three variants. As listed below, prices, ranging from RM341k to RM582k, are OTR without insurance and inclusive of GST.The compact XE’s arrival completes Jaguar Land Rover’s sedan range, joining the  and . It is also the first model to be underpinned by JLR’s new modular architecture, featuring an aluminium-intensive monocoque which allows the XE to shed weight whilst retaining a robust structure.The car measures 4,672 mm long, 1,850 mm wide and 1,416 mm tall. Its wheelbase chimes in at 2,835 mm long. To help you put that in perspective, a F30 3 Series is 48 mm shorter, 39 mm narrower and 13 mm taller than the Jag, while giving away another 25 mm at its wheelbase.Each of the three XE variants offer different levels of power output. At its base, the XE Prestige gets a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbocharged Ford EcoBoost engine that’s rated at 200 PS at 5,500 rpm and 280 Nm of torque between 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The mill allows the XE to complete a zero to 100 km/h sprint in 7.7 seconds, and have a top speed of 237 km/h. All variants feature a ZF-sourced eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission.The mid-range XE R-Sport gets the same 1,999 cc four-pot turbo, but has its output increased to 240 PS at 5,500 rpm and 340 Nm from 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The added power equated to a quicker 6.8-second century sprint and a top speed of 250 km/h. Note that this variant has a “25t” badge at its rear which signifies the 2.0 litre engine’s higher state of tune.At the top of the range sits Jaguar’s 3.0 litre V6 twin-vortex supercharged engine, residing in the top-shelf XE S. The engine is good for 340 PS at 6,500 rpm and 450 Nm at 4,500 rpm, giving the range-topping XE a zero to 100 km/h time of 5.1 seconds, and a top speed of 250 km/h. Interestingly, the engine is also featured in the base-spec variant of the brand’s F-Type sports car.Outside, the base Prestige variant offers bi-function HID xenon headlamps with LED daytime running lights and high-intensity LED tail lamps which have been inspired by the F-Type. It gets 17-inch “Turbine” 10-spoke sparkle silver alloy wheels as standard, and has its front radiator grille in black with a chrome surround.The R-Sport variant adds slightly sportier looks, courtesy of the R-Sport body kit – this adds an R-Sport front bumper, body-coloured side sills, satin chrome side power vents and a rear spoiler. The variant also gets 18-inch “Star” five-spoke alloy wheels as standard. Note that the R-Sport pictured here is equipped with the optional 19-inch “Venom” five, twin-spoke alloys in black.The XE S is by far the most aggressive variant in the line-up. On the outside, it features enlarged air intakes on the front bumper, side sill extensions, a rear spoiler, a gloss black rear valance and brake calipers painted in red. As standard, the S gets 18-inch “Templar” five, twin-spoke alloy wheels, but optionally, buyers may specify a set of 20-inch “Propeller” alloy wheels.Inside, the three variants feature very similar equipment and features – only trim and upholstery options appear to be different between them. A three-spoke multi-function steering wheel is standard across the board, while the centre console features a rising gear selector dial.The InControl Touch infotainment system introduces an eight-inch touchscreen display with a new graphical interface. Media options range from USB and auxiliary sockets to iPod and Bluetooth connectivity.As standard, all XE variants get a basic 80-watt, four-channel, six-speaker sound system. Optionally, buyers may spec-up the audio to a 380-watt Meridian sound system, specifically designed for the XE – audio reproduction here is via a greater 12-channel, 11-speaker system.Moving towards specifics of each variant’s interior, the base Prestige 2.0 starts things off by offering Taurus leather upholstery with contrasting stitching – based on your preferred colour theme. The signature Jaguar Riva Hoop that spans across the door trim and dashboard is in brushed aluminium, while the steering wheel is wrapped in soft grain leather.The R Sport adds to the above a set of Sport Perforation seats with Taurus leather upholstery and mesh fabric inserts. The Riva Hoop and door finishers are in etched aluminium, with additional “R-Sport” badges on the steering wheel and tread plates to remind you of your RM365k purchase.The S variant’s cabin is the sportiest of them all. With suede cloth inserts on the Taurus leather seats, this variant also gets a generous serving of gloss black trim. The steering wheel and tread plates get “S” badges, and the Riva Hoop and door trim here feature a dark mesh aluminium material.There’s a decent amount of driver assistance systems in the XE. The JaguarDrive Control allows you to switch the vehicle’s performance characteristics on the fly, offering Normal, Eco, Dynamic and Winter driving modes that modify the XE’s throttle and steering characteristics.The XE is also the first Jaguar model to be offered with an electric-powered steering. Officially known as the Speed Proportional Electric Power Steering, the system claims to accurately optimise steering feel to match your demands. A Torque Vectoring by Braking system is also on deck, designed to mitigate understeer situations. Notably, only the R-Sport variant appears to feature a Sports-tuned suspension.Another world debut for the brand is its All Surface Progress Control, which gets its first application in the XE. The traction management system functions similarly to a low-speed cruise control and gives the rear-wheel driven XE better all-weather capabilities. Typically used to optimise grip in the snow, the system functions between 3.6 km/h and 30 km/h and provides maximum take-off grip in slippery conditions – not that we’ll ever be driving in snow, anytime soon.For safety, the all XE variants get on nicely with six airbags as standard. Active safety features include Hill Launch Assist, Emergency Brake Assist, Dynamic Stability Control and Traction Control.To recap, the Jaguar XE is priced from RM340k to RM580k, with three variants available. The prices include a five-year or 150,000 km warranty and three years roadside assistance. The Prestige 2.0 and R-Sport 2.0 variants come with a five-year or 80,000 km free scheduled maintenance package, while the S 3.0 variant gets the same deal under five-year or 65,000 km terms.Early buyers will also get the XE Launch Accessories kit worth RM10,000 for free. The package includes illuminated tread plates up front, aluminium red-painted paddle shifters, a specially-designed gear selector with a premium dark leather top and a rubber bezel with a soft-touch grip and unique tyre valve caps which are available in four designs.On top of this, there are also several items for buyers to add on, including a chrome front splitter (RM1,538), aluminium gearshift paddles (RM3,559), an iPad Mini holder (RM1,504) and a headrest-mounted coat hanger (RM337).

2016-02-01,Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport Lightweight coming?,"Here’s something interesting – according to a high-ranking official, Volkswagen has built a lightweight version of the  (pictured here),  reports. While it may already be ready, sitting at the company’s facility in Germany, it seems that Volkswagen is contemplating as to whether such a sporty car should be introduced at this point in time due to the ‘’ scandal.Billed the Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport Lightweight, the front-wheel drive hatchback is claimed to be inspired by the Porsche 911 GT3 Clubsport. The model is a road-legal car that’s aimed at those who want to enter track-day events, motorkhanas and hill climbs. The model will also see the EA888 turbocharged 2.0 litre four-cylinder engine revised as well.While it’s the same mill as the standard Golf GTI Clubsport, said revisions include increased turbocharger boost pressure and a higher ignition cut-out. With this, the Lightweight version will deliver a total of 300 PS.“We’ve increased the threshold so it delivers a permanent 300 PS, which is only achieved momentarily on the overboost in the Golf GTI Clubsport,” the source said. Torque however, will stay put at 380 Nm. As for the gearbox, the hatch will come paired with either a six-speed manual or a dual-clutch automatic transmission, with an electronic differential.As for weight, the company has employed less sound deadening materials to bring the standard car’s kerb weight (1,375 kg) down. Currently, the Golf GTI Clubsport does 0-100 km/h in a matter of 5.9 seconds, it is claimed that the new version will outdo that time. Interior-wise, there will be modifications as well, including a different seat in the back.Production of the Lightweight version is still on the fence as the final verdict lays with the newly-elected supervisory board. The board is said to be apprehensive about the message that the model will send in light of the ongoing investigations. That said, the model may be unveiled at Wothersee before a final decision is made. If it does get the go-ahead though, it is said that less than 100 units will be made.",Graham Chin

During an exclusive interview with , Proton chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa has said it should be lower than the current CamPro engines.He stated that the engines, which are slated to come into the market in 2018, will have a longer service interval. “The service interval will be double than the current VVT engine and I believe the technology has matured for this, that the components’ life cycle is longer, quite reliable,” he said.Rashid said that Proton is targeting to extend the service cycle of the new GDI engines from 10,000 km as on the Preve, Suprima and Iriz to 20,000 km, per service. “But of course you need to check other things in the engine,” he said. “Sometimes, people get confused when high technology is used. It’s not only necessary to check the engine oil, there are other things to monitor about the engine depending on your usage.”“[The service costs] will be [lower] definitely. I think those are the strengths of the engine as well,” he added. The  in the engines should also lower maintenance costs.Rashid mentioned that the new engines’ focus isn’t sports car-like high-performance. “I’m not saying superb performance, but good performance, low maintenance. Performance doesn’t necessarily mean horsepower. Performance also relates to fuel efficiency, emissions, and others as well,” he said. He also said that, like safety, there are three tiers to conducting maintenance on the engine – protection, prevention and prediction. The first tier of maintenance is the protective kind, whereby the car protects itself from further damage such as in the case of overheating. The second level, preventive, concerns routine maintenance that helps prevent engine damage altogether, such as fixed service intervals. It’s the final tier, predictive or cognitive maintenance, that Proton is looking to implement into its future vehicles – Rashid said that the company is future-proofing the new engines to be able to adopt Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). With this method, the car will analyse its actual condition to determine when to change the engine oil, rather than relying on fixed cycles.Rashid gave an example of stop-start driving, which can shorten the interval between oil changes, as the engine will continue to run even though the car spends less time moving. The technology has already been implemented by companies such as BMW, and Rashid said Proton wants to bring this level of maintenance to the masses.",Gerard Lye
2016-02-01,Steel plant explosion halts Toyota Japan production,"Toyota Motor Corporation today issued a press statement that it will be stopping production at its Japan domestic plants from February 8 to 13 due to an explosion at a facility belonging to Aichi Steel Corporation on January 8.A Toyota spokesman said in a  report that it had enough inventory to keep the Toyota plants running till February 8, and that all overtime and weekend shifts had been cancelled. In a separate statement, Aichi Steel said the explosion at its Chita plant in central Japan had halted the production of special steel parts and it planned to resume operations on March 8.This unplanned shutdown may have an impact on Toyota’s Japan production plan of 4.13 million vehicles this year, of which approximately 46% are exported.

2016-02-01,Hublot MP-05 LaFerrari Sapphire – an updated tribute,"Since 2013, Hublot has been paying tribute to the  hypercar. In partnership with the brand, the watchmaker has unveiled an updated version of the MP-05 model. Called the MP-05 LaFerrari Sapphire, the mechanical timepiece comes with a sapphire case (hence the name) and only 20 pieces will be made.Pieced together over a period of 18 months, the case was carved out from seven blocks of sapphire, requiring over 600 hours of work. The 3D construction of the case middle in sapphire gives off a unique setting for the movement, which can be seen from all angles and looks as though it’s “suspended in mid-air.”Within the 53.5-gramme encasing, a total of 637 components and a suspended vertical tourbillon have been carefully fitted. The seconds are shown on the transparent cylinder on the suspended tourbillon cage. As for the hours and minutes, they’re situated to the right of the barrels, while the power reserve is on the left – shown via transparent cylinders too.The mechanical art comes attached with a transparent silicon strap with a clasp that also features pieces carved out from sapphire. To get the clock ticking, the watch is wound by a mechanism that requires a miniature power drill. This concept is inspired by the tyre-changing tool in Formula 1. No prices quoted here, but seeing that the first LaFerrari MP-05 was priced at USD$300,000 (RM1.2 million) this should cost more.As for the hybrid hypercar, at the heart of it, sits a naturally-aspirated 6.3 litre V12 engine that churns 800 hp at 9,000 rpm and 700 Nm at 6,750 rpm. It’s matched to a Hybrid Kinetic Energy Recovery System () with a 163 hp electric motor. Combined, the LaFerrari churns out 950 hp and 900 Nm of torque. The engine is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission.",Graham Chin

2016-02-01,Proton’s new engine line-up – why so many variants?,"When Proton announced its new engine family, a total of six engines were listed, including VVT, GDI and TGDI mills. Some have questioned why there is a need for so many engine variants to be introduced, especially when they share close capacities. According to Proton chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa, this is to allow for variable vehicle packaging for different market needs.As a brief refresher, these are the  that are currently in Proton’s pipeline:Rashid stated the new engines utilise a modular design, whereby the 1.3 and 1.5 litre four-cylinder units use the same bore of 75 mm, but with different strokes to achieve the desired capacities. The 1.0 litre and 1.2 litre mills meanwhile, are a result of one cylinder being cut off from the above-mentioned engines. The new engines also uses  obtained earlier, ensuring lower development costs. By comparison, all six engines cost RM600 million to engineer, compared to the two CamPro engines that cost RM450 million to develop.“The engine will be for small cars, even though it’s a 1.3 litre four-cylinder, the engine is too big to be inserted into the engine room for an A-segment car, for example. That’s why we need the 1.0 or 1.2 litre three-cylinder, which is smaller to be packaged into the car. So, it’s not just about the size of the engine but the packaging consideration, that’s why they are so close in proximity in terms of capacity (1.2 and 1.3 litre) but differ in purpose,” Rashid said.“In fact, I ask this question about other OEMs as well. Why they have 1.4 and then 1.5 litre engines. I think one of the considerations by other OEMs is related to packaging as well. So, in Proton’s case, it was meant and intended for smaller car. To achieve better fuel efficiency, it’s not just about the engine, we need to make the car lighter, more aerodynamic for better fuel economy,” he added.When the Proton Saga was brought up, Rashid mentioned, “the current Saga can fit a four-cylinder engine. The  may not fit the four-cylinder engine. This means that the three-cylinder engines will only be introduced beyond the new Saga that will be introduced this year, because the new engines will only be ready by 2017.”When asked if the next Saga will be smaller to make room for the , Rashid replied saying it depends on market needs. As these engines are modular in design, it provides Proton with options to produce the appropriate engines without excessive cost. It’s also allows the flexibility to package the required powertrain. “Looking at Malaysia’s TIV, Perodua’s Axia 1.0 litre car is commanding nearly 10,000 units per month, so there is a big opportunity for Proton to participate in this area,” he added.Rashid also touched upon Proton involvement in the total value chain of automotive business, which includes operating its own casting, engine machining and assembly plants, as well as mould and die-making (via Miyazu). These early investments stretch back many years and have a role to play in Proton’s future.“Because we are a small volume player, we have to find a means on how to produce these small numbers economically. The only way to do that is by having modular engine design, so we can communalise maximum possible part and components, be it three- or four-cylinder engines,” he said.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-29,GALLERY: BMW 7 Series classics – E23 to F01/F02,"At this morning’s , BMW Malaysia took the opportunity to line-up all of the model’s predecessors for a photo opportunity. Lighting at the display wasn’t at its best for photos (nor was I any good behind a camera), but we couldn’t miss out on the chance to catch all six generations of the 7er in one outing.With the new, sixth-gen model displayed separately, here are the first five generations of the  – beginning from the original E23 from 1977, to the fifth-gen F01/F02 model which first appeared in 2008.What started off as just a large BMW sedan, the first-ever 7 Series was born in 1977. Its production run spanned a respectable 10 years before it was succeeded by the E32 in 1986. The second-gen notably offered a fax machine, an integrated telephone and even a wine cooler as optional equipment – imagine that, in 1986. The E32 is also known to be the first vehicle that featured a 12-cylinder engine in the post-war era.The third-gen E38 7 Series cleared a path for itself by being the first to emphasise rear-seat luxuries as much as driving dynamics. Satellite navigation and an onboard television were included as optionally available items, but not forgetting an Alpina sports suspension and Dynamic Stability Control too. The E38 also famously starred in movies like The Transporter and James Bond’s Tomorrow Never Dies.And then came the Bangle-era 7er, the E65. Popularly known for its “Bangle Butt,” the fourth-gen 7 Series’ design faced tough criticism. The  even included the model in its list of “50 Worst Cars of All Time.” Even still, it was one of the most technologically advanced BMW vehicles of its time, introducing items such as Active Roll Stabilisation, a self-levelling air suspension, the world’s first application of electronic adaptive headlights and more.The F01/F02 BMW 7 Series arrived in 2008, and needless to say, design critics were a lot easier on the fifth-gen model. The list of “firsts” for this 7er included having its entire line-up powered by turbocharged engines (bar minority markets’ availability of N/A engines, like our 730Li), having an eight-speed auto transmission and being the first 7er to feature an electric motor (ActiveHybrid7).The F01/F02 was also the first BMW model to feature the “F” designation in its codename, and now, the sixth-gen model repeats this honour by being the first model to feature the “G” designation. Which leaves us at today, where we find ourselves at the launch of the G11/G12 BMW 7 Series. And just in case you’ve missed it, .",Chris Aaron
2016-01-29,"Uber, Grab drivers need commercial insurance – gov’t","It has been announced that drivers of ride-sharing services will soon have to buy commercial insurance if they want to continue operating their businesses legally. According to the , deputy transport minister Datuk Aziz Kaprawi made the announcement and said that further details will be revealed in due time.Taxi operators have long been subject to having commercial insurances which offer a degree of protection to their customers in the event of an accident. Uber and  drivers been operating as private vehicle owners that offer “rides” for a fee.But soon, it looks like the government will make it compulsory for Uber and Grab drivers to buy commercial licenses in order to continue their operations. The move is seen as one that will better regulate these services.“We want to regulate the industry so that these vehicles are safe for people to ride in. We also want to legalise the industry as the number of phone apps will continue to grow. Malaysians find these apps very convenient in terms of securing public transport,” said Kaprawi.As , the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD), the Transport Ministry and several representatives from ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Grab, are in the middle of discussing the outcome of these ride-sharing services.It was also reported that while Uber and Grab’s operations , it will have to adhere to several key terms – many of which regular taxi drivers typically encounter.

2016-01-29,SPIED: Next Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe spotted,"Now that the , it’s time to turn our attention to the other body styles that are expected to join the sedan in the model’s line-up. This time, it is the coupe version of the W213, which our spy photographers managed to capture as it undergoes winter testing.As you can tell, Mercedes-Benz has gone to great lengths to wrap the entire car in heavy camo, as well as adding on false body panels to ensure no design element of the coupe is revealed prematurely. Based on what we can see on the test mule, the new E-Class Coupe appears to feature the same hood design as found on the sedan, and will most likely carry over the same front end with minor revisions to project its more sporty persona. Along the side, the coupe element is clearly apparent with a raked roofline that starts from the B-pillars and continues on to the rear of the vehicle. Based on these images, the E-Class Coupe does appear to have a smaller window area as a result.The roofline extends towards what looks to be a spoiler element, although given the amount of camo, and how awkward-looking the fixture is, we reckon it will be reworked for the final production version.At the rear, a small part of the W213’s tail lights can be seen, but it is uncertain if they have been revised in terms of size to accommodate the reworked roofline of the vehicle. The same can be said of the tailgate as well, though it appears unchanged from the sedan.As for the other elements that weren’t covered up, the E-Class Coupe retains the same side mirror design found on the sedan with built-in indicators. The blacked-out roof also appears to mask a sunroof based on what we see.At the time of its reveal, the W213 E-Class was offered with just two engines – one diesel and one petrol, with more to be introduced in the future. Both 2.0 litre mills are paired to the latest 9G-Tronic torque converter automatic transmission. The coupe E-Class is expected to follow suit as well.",Gerard Lye
2016-01-29,VIDEOS: Porsche 718 Boxster gets a set of new ads,"The  was revealed to the world just days ago and now, the brand has released a set of videos for the revamped roadster. While we know that the new name draws upon the , but how do you illustrate that importance? Well, a couple of videos should address that question.In essence, the 718 moniker dates back to the year 1957, when turbocharged flat-four engines won the brand many races – including the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Targa Florio. The glory years of the Porsche 718s continued on into the 1960s and that’s how it all came about. Of course, the biggest change would be the swapping of the  to turbocharged four-cylinder units. In the new 718 Boxster sits a turbocharged 2.0 litre flat-four mill that makes 300 hp and 380 Nm. The 718 Boxster S, gets a turbocharged 2.5 litre flat-four that produces 350 hp and 420 Nm. Top speed is 275 km/h for the Boxster and 285 km/h for the S.Both engines are mated to a six-speed manual gearbox, while a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transmission can be had as an optional extra. Also detailed in the video, the Boxster with with the PDK and launch control (Sport Chrono package) does 0-100 km/h in 4.7 seconds, 0.8 seconds faster than before. The Boxster S with the same mechanical items does it in 4.2 seconds (0.6 seconds faster).",Graham Chin

An agreement has been reached between both companies, where a unified strategy for the small car segment will be employed for the purpose of developing better cars. In addition to that, the share exchange is set to add more value to both brands. With the shared strategy, it will enable both Toyota and Daihatsu to overcome obstacles that they may face in the future. This includes resource-intensive activities like the development of next-generation technologies and the entry into business areas that have growth potential.In detail, the agreement will see Toyota and Daihatsu combine their base of operations, which will have them share expertise in various areas. In turn, this will allow for the two entities to develop more appealing products that are competitive on a global scale. Three key areas have been underlined, the first, being small cars. Here, Daihatsu will lead in developing products offered within the small car lineup of both brands. It will continue to maintain its focus on developing vehicles where the brand already has a strong presence. On top of that, it will sharpen its expertise and processes related to product planning and tech development for mini vehicles.The second area, will be technology. Both will share development and deployment strategies for new technology from early stages. Toyota will focus on technologies associated with the environment, safety, user experience and comfort. Daihatsu, on the other hand, will turn technologies into packages and will lead the development of cost and fuel efficient technology. Further to that, Daihatsu will contribute to the development of next-gen tech with a focus on cost-efficiency and down-scaling said tech. Manufacturing expertise will be shared amongst the Toyota group with the aim of achieving better cost competitiveness of larger vehicles.The third area, will have both companies utilising each other’s base of operations in developing markets. Daihatsu will lead in elevating efficiency as well as adaptability in development, procurement and production. Across Japan, Toyota’s sales expertise and infrastructure will be shared by both to strengthen Daihatsu’s branding and profitability at that.“This is an opportunity for us both to stop feeling that we need to go it alone and trust each other to take full advantage of our respective strengths. In other words, we can now focus on our core competencies.

2016-01-29,Proton new GDI and TGDI engines – why timing chain?,"One of the big new additions to Proton’s upcoming new engine family is the adoption of a timing chain, replacing the belt that has been used since the national carmaker started out rebadging Mitsubishis. We’re aware of those of you who have been clamouring for Proton to use a timing chain for the longest time, but what is exactly so great about it, and why only now?The reason why it has taken so long, according to Proton’s chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa, is that Mitsubishi – which Proton had learned how to design and build engines from – had used timing belts for its engines until a few years ago, and as such, Proton followed suit as well. But Rashid admitted that market demands and technology trends have influenced the company to do the switch.As for the advantages, Rashid said that they were as much about actual reliability and serviceability – timing chains tend to last the life of the engine with very little maintenance – as the perception of reliability. He added that the public has been very critical of Proton for certain decisions, like continuing to use timing belts – even though other brands use it too – and that the company needed to do things perfectly under the scrutiny of the public eye.",Jonathan Lee

2016-01-29,"Proton new GDI and TGDI engines detailed – modular design, higher compression ratio, future-proofed","In an exclusive interview with , Proton chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa has shared some key details regarding the national carmaker’s highly-anticipated  –  – which will utilise direct injection and will be offered in both naturally-aspirated (GDI) and turbocharged (TGDI) variants.Firstly, the development of the new engines were driven by regulatory and market requirements, as Proton wants to be a competitive global player – and with the European market now requiring all new cars to meet the stringent Euro 6 emissions standards, the company needs the new mills (which are designed to meet Euro 6c regulations coming into effect in 2018) if it ever wants to return to the lucrative Continental market.Rashid said that Proton needs to change and upgrade its capabilities to be more competitive. He admitted that the company was late in introducing variable valve timing (VVT) technology – which only came onto the market with the  at the tail end of 2014 – but added that the company is catching up to established players.As was revealed during the official announcement, the new engines are modular, with commonalities both in design and the components used. The 1.3 litre and 1.5 litre GDI and TGDI engines are four-cylinder engines, sharing an identical bore but differing stroke measurements; the 1.0 litre and 1.2 litre VVT engines are three-cylinder versions of those four-pot mills.The engines feature a higher compression ratio of 12:1 on GDI engines and 10.5:1 on the TGDI engines – these compare favourably to 10:1 on the Iriz’s VVT engines and 8.9:1 on the 1.6 litre CamPro CFE/Turbo engine. Also incorporated is a split engine cooling system that enables the cylinder head and block at different temperatures for optimised efficiency. On TGDI engines, a single-scroll turbocharger is used, with the most powerful 1.5 litre TGDI projected to be capable of producing 180 hp and 250 Nm.Elsewhere, the fuel injectors on the GDI and TGDI engines are capable of spraying fuel at 200 bars of pressure, compared to just 2-3 bars in a standard port injection system. The technology used on the new GDI engines are based on the  when it  in 2012, some of which are shared with development partner Ricardo.The engines are also designed to be future-proof, with features like cylinder deactivation (using a collapsible roller finger follower), mild hybrid operation (through the use of a belt starter-generator), a Miller cycle and spray-guided direct fuel injection able to be added on.The workings of a Miller cycle engine would require a separate article to be explained fully – but essentially, in such an engine, the intake valve is left opened for part of the compression stroke, which pushes some of the air/fuel mixture back into the intake port. This reduces the effort required to compress the remaining mixture, aiding efficiency.On the other hand, spray-guided direct injection, which uses injectors mounted at the top of the combustion chamber to spray fuel downwards – rather than from the side against a walled chamber in the piston in traditional systems – results in improved fuel efficiency. The aim, according to Rashid, is for the engines to eventually achieve a thermal efficiency of almost 40% – the same as on the newest hybrids like the  and .Rashid said that while Proton isn’t a technology leader, it wants to bring these technologies down towards a more affordable level – as it has done in terms of safety. “The technologies aren’t cheap, but we are contributing significantly in making them more affordable,” he said.",Jonathan Lee

The Road Transport Department (JPJ) will hold a joint operation with the police, Department of Environment and the Immigration Department during the Chinese New Year period,  reports.A total of 100 enforcement officers from JPJ will go undercover on express buses to weed out law-breaking motorists. At the same time, the officers will also inspect buses for roadworthiness before they embark. An emphasis however, will be placed on motorcyclists as 60% of fatal road accidents involved riders, according to Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai.In relation to errant motorists, the JPJ will be keeping an eye out for red light dodgers, vehicles driving on the emergency lane, queue jumping, overtaking at double lines, hand phone usage while driving and failure to use safety helmets and seatbelts – labelled as the “seven big sins” by the JPJ director-general, Datuk Seri Ismail Ahmad.“The undercover officers may take a ride on a bus from Alor Setar to Kuala Lumpur and monitor them if they are using their handphones or overtaking along stretches they are not supposed to,” said Ismail. “The errant drivers will be issued with on-the-spot summonses when they arrive at their destinations,” he added.As for bus roadworthiness inspections, a certificate will be issued before buses are allowed to embark. “We will also be carrying out random checks at 82 express bus depots and 29 bus terminals nationwide to check on the drivers and condition of the buses. A certificate will be issued to allow the buses to leave the terminal or depot after clearing the inspection,” Ismail stated.Additionally, Liow stated that over ten thousand road accidents were registered during the Chinese New Year period in 2014. “During the Chinese New Year period last year, a total of 17,632 road accidents were recorded, of which 186 resulted in 199 deaths,” he said, an average of 13 deaths a day.

2016-01-29,Will Proton’s new GDI/TGDI engines run on RON 95?,"Proton’s recent announcement of its new  is certainly a statement of intent for the national carmaker. While the engines’ technical specifications and performance certainly does hold a lot of promise, it is also dependant on the type of fuel that goes into the combustion chamber. So the question is, will the current fuel grades in Malaysia be compatible with Proton’s upcoming engines?Gasoline (petrol) direct injection technology is generally more sensitive towards fuel quality. The use of lower-quality, higher sulphur fuels will pollute the more advanced catalytic converters used on newer GDI engines – required as modern lean-burning direct-injection engines inherently produce higher nitrous oxide (NOx) pollutants – which will “poison” them, rendering them useless.In Malaysia, consumers have access to three separate types of petrol – Euro 2M RON 95,  and . With a large majority of Malaysians preferring the more affordable of the bunch – Euro 2M RON 95 – will its usage have any adverse implications on Proton’s new engines? According to Proton’s chief technology officer Abdul Rashid Musa, who spoke exclusively to , the short answer is no – Euro 2M RON 95 fuel will work fine with its new engines.Proton is also in continued discussions with its development partner, Ricardo on the RON requirements for the engine in different markets. Given that Proton’s GDI/TGDI engines are Euro 6c-compliant, exporting their cars is certainly part of their plans.Rashid added that in some markets with even lower fuel quality, the company will continue using the current VVT engines. “That’s why we’re still maintaining our VVT engine,” he said. “Even some markets in the Middle East are still using RON 82.”“Markets are so diverse. Developing countries might not have that quality of fuel so we might not be able to put a high technology engine in that market – even in Malaysia as well. But currently, our engines can go as low as RON 88, and up to RON 105,” he added.In conclusion, should you be worried? Well, no. Apart from the fact that the engines are capable of running Euro 2M RON 95, the first production application of the new engines is only slated to come into the market in 2018, while Euro 4 RON 95 is gazetted to go on sale in Malaysia from October 2018. Therefore, the new engines shouldn’t be an issue to consumers.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-29,"New G11 BMW 7 Series launched in Malaysia – 2.0 turbo 4cyl 730Li and 740Li, from RM599k","The new BMW 7 Series has been officially launched in Malaysia. Munich’s limo and flagship saloon, now in its sixth generation (check out this nice ), will provide competition to the , ,  and . The G11 (we only get the long-wheelbase variant, so it’s G12 technically) is available here in 730Li and 740Li forms.The long-wheelbase 7 Series has a larger footrpint than before, at 5,238 mm long (+19 mm), 1,902 mm wide (unchanged) and 1,479 mm tall, with a 3,210 mm wheelbase (also unchanged). To compare, the LWB W222 S-Class is 5,246 mm long and 1,899 mm wide, with a 3,165 mm wheelbase. So, the BMW is 8 mm shorter overall, but has a 45 mm longer wheelbase than the Merc.While it might not look worlds apart from its predecessor, the new 7 Series is all-new and high-tech underneath. BMW’s Carbon Core construction – with tech gleaned from  development – utilises a combination of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), magnesium, aluminium and steel, resulting in increased strength and rigidity of the passenger cell  weight savings of up to 130 kg compared to the F01. Core aside, the use of aluminium for the doors and (for the first time) the bootlid also contributed to the weight loss. BMW says that unsprung mass has been cut by 15%, centre of gravity made lower and 50:50 weight distribution maintained. The 740Li is powered by a 3.0 litre inline-six engine with 326 hp from 5,500 to 6,500 rpm; and 450 Nm of torque from 1,380 to 5,000 rpm. The B58 twin-scroll turbo unit is from a new engine family and its crankcase, cylinder head and oil sump are all made from aluminium. The turbo features an indirect system of charge air cooling that is incorporated into the intake manifold, and this water-to-air intercooler provides a shorter route for the air. BMW claims better efficiency and response than the old N55 motor, which has 320 hp/450 Nm.Paired to a ZF eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission with Steptronic, the 740Li is capable of 0-100 km/h in a swift 5.6 seconds, on to a limited top speed of 250 km/h. Claimed combined fuel consumption is 6.6 litres per 100 km.The  is powered by a hero of a downsized motor, a 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder tasked to haul a big limo. This entry-level petrol engine for the 7 Series puts out 258 hp from 5,000 to 6,500 rpm; and 400 Nm of torque from 1,550 to 4,400 rpm. The B48 is a relatively new engine and has been seen in the , BMW / sisters and , but we’re seeing the most powerful version of it in the G11. Using an eight-speed auto, performance is far from shabby, with the benchmark 0-100 km/h sprint taking just 6.3 seconds. Top speed is at the regular 250 km/h mark, while fuel consumption is rated at 5.8 litres per 100 km, 0.8 l/100 km better than the 740Li. Not sold here, the  also uses this engine, but with an electric motor and lithium-ion battery in the mix., but the big cat’s 240 PS, 340 Nm and 7.5 seconds pale in comparison. Also weaker is the outgoing 730Li – powered by a NA 3.0 litre six-pot, it does 258 hp, 310 Nm and 7.5 seconds. No reason to fear downsizing, then.Both variants ride on air suspension (both axles) and 19-inch alloys (different styles) with 245/45 front tyres and fatter 275/40 rear ones. There’s also Dynamic Damper Control, and the 740Li adds on a new Executive Drive Pro “active chassis” system with electromechanical active roll stabilisation. The fancy  with LCD colour display and touch control panel (one can turn on the lights, open/close the windows, check fuel level and schedule the climate control, among other things, Remote Control Parking not available here) is standard across the board, as is the Design Pure Excellence package, which is basically an exterior chrome trim pack.Also standard are a four-zone auto air con, head-up display, Surround View, Welcome Light Carpet,  (Intelligent Emergency Call, Teleservices, Concierge Services and Remote Services), BMW Gesture Control for the infotainment system, Navigation System Professional with 10.25-inch touch display and HDD, plus a rear seat entertainment system with two 10-inch screens. The latter is controlled via the BMW Touch Command seven-inch tablet housed in the rear centre console. The removable tablet is made by Samsung.Speaking of rear seats, the big shots at the back can enjoy eight massage programmes including the Vitality programme, which allows one to engage in active physical exercise for recuperation purposes. Comfort seats at the back for 730Li, front and back for 740Li. Note that right-hand drive cars do not get the Executive Lounge Seating option featured in our  story until the second half of 2016. Both variants get a panorama glass roof, but only 740Li occupants get to enjoy the “Sky Lounge”. When it gets dark, the light emitted from side-mounted LED modules is directed evenly onto the glass surface, where it hits an imprinted graphic for a starry sky effect. Also exclusive to the 740Li is a 600w Harman Kardon sound system with nine channels with 16 speakers. The 730Li comes with a 205w “HiFi” system with 12 speakers. Not available here is the 7er range topping 1400w Bowers & Wilkins Diamond audio with 10-channel amp and 16 speakers.The 740Li also gets BMW Laserlight headlamps, which can be identified by a central blue-tinted horizontal bar. These top shelf items have a range of 600 metres in high-beam mode – twice the range of the LED headlights of the 730Li.The 730Li receives BMW Driving Assistant, a safety pack that includes Approach Control and Person Warning with light city braking, rear collision prevention, lane change and lane departure warning and rear cross traffic warning. BMW Driving Assistant Plus on the 740Li adds on stereo cameras and a radar for steering and lane control assist, lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection, traffic jam assistant for semi-autonomous driving, front/rear rear cross traffic assist, and Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go. Eight airbags are standard. Trim wise, the 740Li is lined with Nappa leather with diamond-pattern stitching and Poplar Grain Grey wood trim, with real leather dash top wrap, while the 730Li makes do with Dakota leather and Fineline wood. Both leather types can be had in Black, Canberra Beige or Cognac.We finally come to the price, which starts from  OTR without insurance for the 730Li and  for the 740Li. Decent pricing by BMW Group Malaysia for CBU imports (the  benefits from CKD hybrid tax exemptions), but the figures quoted are “exclusive prices” in conjunction with BMW’s 100-year anniversary, valid until further notice or while stocks last. Add RM100k to both numbers for the regular RRP (RM698,888 and RM888,800 respectively).",Danny Tan
2016-01-28,2016 Harley-Davidson CVO Pro Street Breakout and Low Rider S cruisers launched at X Games Aspen,"Harley-Davidson (HD) introduced two new models in its range of motorcycles, using the most powerful engine in its line-up, the Screamin’ Eagle Twin Cam 110, at the X Games in Aspen, Colorado. The newcomers – the Custom Vehicle Operations (CVO) Pro Street Breakout and Low Rider S – are aimed at the young urban rider, and a sign that HD is serious about consolidating its share of the US large-displacement motorcycle market – currently at almost 50%.Featuring a muscular stance patterned after drag racers, the limited edition CVO Pro Street Breakout features a new, darker look with twin-disc front brakes and custom paintwork. The inverted forks add to the brawny look, and the 240 mm width rear tyre reinforces the drag bike ethos.Both motorcycles use the Twin Cam 110 engine which displaces 1,801 cc. In the case of the 2016 Low Rider S, the engine is mated with a Screamin’ Eagle Heavy Breather performance intake and Fat Bob-style two-into-two exhaust that lets the V-twin mill put out 156 Nm of torque at 3,500 rpm. This makes the Low Rider S the most powerful non-CVO motorcycle HD has produced. This trimmed-down cruiser also features premium suspension and brakes as part of its performance package. It joins the Fat Boy S and Softail Slim S in its ‘S’ series of 2016 bikes.The 2016 Harley-Davidson Low Rider S will retail for USD16,699 (RM70,300) while the CVO Pro Street Breakout will sell for USD25,699 (RM108,400) in the US.

2016-01-28,"MyTeksi and GrabTaxi rebranded, now known as Grab","– which is known regionally as GrabTaxi – has been rebranded, and is now known as Grab. The unveiling of the new name was made today in Singapore, where it was also announced that all of the company’s services will simply be known as Grab.Essentially, its core services, namely taxis (GrabTaxi), private car services (GrabCar), motorcycle taxis (GrabBike), social carpooling (GrabHitch) and last mile delivery (GrabExpress) will now operate under one umbrella brand.The rebranding exercise also saw the introduction of a new logo, which the company says has been designed with freedom at its core. Design-wise, the dual lines are apparently inspired by roadways, and represent the endless road of possibilities.“We’ve grown over the years, and we’re now much more than a taxi app. This new brand is an important evolution that represents our goal to outserve our customers. We are not only providing passengers with a transport service, we are saving them time and ensuring they have a safe ride,” said Grab’s co-founder Anthony Tan, who is also the group CEO.“Grab aims to make transportation accessible to everyone in Southeast Asia. We have set the benchmark in the industry, with the most number of transport services that cater to all price points, all available in one app. We have something for everyone, and are committed to delivering the best possible user experience,” he added.The company said that since its , it has evolved from a humble taxi-booking app to Southeast Asia’s largest land transport company. As of 2015, notable stats include 200,000 drivers, with its range of services available in 28 cities over six countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam).The company also said it had 1.5 million app bookings a day last year, and its app had been downloaded on to 11 million mobile devices around the region. In terms of market penetration, Grab said it had 95% market share in terms of third-party taxi-hailing apps as well as more than 50% of the market share in the private car segment, covered by GrabCar.Since mid-2015, the company said it has experienced a 35% average monthly growth in GrabCar rides and a 75% average monthly growth in GrabBike rides across the region.Last December, Grab had announced that it had  with China-based Didi Kuaidi, India-based Ola and United States-based Lyft apps, where these services will collaborate to collectively cover “nearly all of South East Asia, India, China and the US,” with joint partner products rolling out early next year.To usher in the rebranding, the company will be holding a Grab Freedom Day this week in the capital cities of the six countries it operates in. During this event, over a hundred Grabbers – including the management team across the region – will spend a day as Grab drivers. Passengers who book vehicles driven by Grabbers will ride for free, and the value of the ride will be donated to charities across the region.  In Malaysia, the beneficiary is Persatuan Mobility Selangor dan Kuala Lumpur (Mobility Association of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur), where the main objective is to operate a “door-to-door” transport service for wheelchair users. In KL, Grab Freedom Day will take place on January 30.",Anthony Lim
2016-01-28,"Grab rebrand introduces new app, with added features","Aside from a unified name and logo,  – formerly known as  in Malaysia (and GrabTaxi in other markets) – also introduced a more user-friendly Grab app at its rebranding event in Singapore today. The updated app is said to be lighter and provide even faster access to ride bookings.“The updated Grab app is about improving the core experience – we want to make it as simple as two clicks to book a ride,”  said Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling. She explained that pick-up and drop-off points will now be pre-filled based on a user’s favourite places. Preferred locations will be ranked by the day, time and users’ physical location, which will enable bookings to be made faster.She also said that the registration process for new users had been simplified. Android users can now sign up more quickly for Grab using their Facebook profile – the app will automatically confirm the user’s identity and mobile phone number. The feature will be rolled out to iOS in the near future.Other enhancements include a better estimation of pick-up times in the app’s live driver tracking function. With real-time driver tracking on the map, users can better estimate the arrival time of their driver. The app also has an “auto-retry” feature, which minimises repeated booking attempts if a passenger does not get a vehicle within the first attempt, without having to manually go through the booking process again.A feature called Flash has also been introduced  – now, with the touch of just one button, Flash searches all of the closest taxis and GrabCars to find the best vehicle for users across both services, meaning there will be more choices available to consumers at any single time. Flash is already available in Singapore, Philippines and Vietnam, and will be rolled out in Malaysia on January 30. It will be available to Thai users next month.There’s also GrabPay, which offers multiple credit card support. Users still retain the freedom to choose between cash or cashless option as and when they like, but will be able to use multiple credit cards and easily toggle to choose which to use.GrabPay is available in Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia, and multiple credit card support is currently available in Singapore, and will be available in and Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia in February. GrabPay will be introduced in Thailand and Vietnam sometime in the first half of 2016. Finally, there’s GrabWork, which allows business rides to be charged separately, and is available to users across all six markets. New in-app features include the expense code and trip detail fields for tracking and expense claims purposes.With multiple credit card support, users can add a corporate card and easily toggle between personal and corporate payment options, and business users can login online to Grab Passenger Hub (hub.grab.co) to download their consolidated business or personal statements for claims submission purposes.  The Grab app is available for free in Google Play and Apple App Store for Android and iOS users respectively. Existing GrabTaxi and MyTeksi users will automatically have their apps updated from today, if auto update is enabled on their mobile devices.",Anthony Lim
2016-01-29,PJ one-way loop system to be completed in August,"The Petaling Jaya one-way loop will be completed in August this year, according to the Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ). At this moment in time, the first phase of the loop is 95% completed, while 80% of the  has been completed,  reports. Meanwhile, motorists and pedestrians will have to cope with the conditions of the roads and sidewalks until then.The third phase will have covered walkways built in Jalan Selangor and sections of Jalan Utara. Petaling Jaya City Council public relations officer, Zainun Zakaria noted that the council was optimistic that the entire project would be finished by the end of August.Since the project began in October 2014, the council has received scores of complaints regarding the poor condition of the roads, sidewalks and the confusion that the loop is causing.In relation to the poor road conditions, over the past year, Ismail said that eight stop-work orders have since been issued to contractors who did not perform road repairs properly. That said, the construction needed to be carried out nonetheless as the council wanted to complete the project as soon as possible.A new system has been implemented where patrols will be conducted every two days, to look out for any potholes, according to Ismail Shafie, engineering department director of MBPJ. He noted that traffic congestion could not be avoided due to the project.Illegally parked vehicles are also partly responsible for the traffic congestion.“There are many buses and cars parked illegally along the stretch of these projects that are also contributing to the traffic problem,” Ismail said.To assist pedestrians, the council will create temporary walkways along paths currently under construction. “There are six pedestrian crossings at traffic lights and three pedestrian bridges that can be used to cross the road,” Ismail said, adding that temporary lights are also in place as well.",Graham Chin

It should not take more than three months.” In his speech yesterday on the , Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said regulations and procedures applicable to free duty vehicles on the two islands would be tightened, but would not affect residents.Under Clause 21A of the Customs Duty Order (Exemption) 1988 allows for imported vehicles registered on the islands to be brought to the mainland, provided it is not for more than 30 days on a single visit, and up to a maximum of 90 days in total per year.However, it is known that many such luxury vehicles brought to the mainland never return to the islands, according to Khazali. “The current system has been abused by some quarters who owe millions in unpaid duties. To curtail this, we are reviewing the tax free status (of imported vehicles) for Langkawi,” he said.A large number of luxury vehicles have been seized on the mainland for unpaid duties and taxes, after a rise in the number of registrations of such vehicles on the islands was noticed. The cars included Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Porsches and the amount of unpaid duty amounted into the millions. In some cases, the duty-free prices of these brands are openly quoted at launches.The cars were registered on the islands with the JPJ using false addresses and permission obtained from the Customs to leave the island for the mainland for 90 days.  However, the vehicles never returned to the islands. Offenders can be fined up to 20 times the value of the vehicles or face three years’ jail, or both, upon conviction.In a move to curb such abuse, Labuan Customs and the Road Transport department (JPJ) introduced the e-Vehicle system to monitor the movement on Labuan-registered vehicles, targetting those with unpaid summonses, compounds, taxes and duties, and those which exceeded the 90-day mainland visit.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-29,Proton CFE oil cooler hose issue – CTO speaks up,"During a recent interview with Abdul Rashid Musa, the Proton chief technology officer also touched on a recent issue relating to the automaker’s CFE engine. A number of Proton owners reported on social media not too long ago regarding an issue with the engine’s oil cooler hose, which broke prematurely.He said, “oil cooler hoses are subject to high temperature and humidity, but sometimes the failure is not because of the cycle (mileage). For rubber materials, it’s normally because of time and life. Like tyres, even though the threads is still present, after two years, cracks may appear on the tyre surface because the rubber has degraded.”“In our service manual – I believe other OEMs also mention – rubber parts are not subject to cycle (wear) only. Normally we do our testing of 100,000 km cycles, and subject the part to a certain number of cycles. Rubber parts are definitely not just affected by cycle, but by time (as well),” Rashid said.“Proton is addressing the issue. Consumers are advised not to change or modify the component on their own. Please come back to us, get original parts from us. Custom jobs can void the car’s warranty,” he added. The custom job referred to in this case is the use of braided metal hoses to replace the original rubber items on the oil cooler unit.On its official Facebook page, Proton has officially acknowledged the issue, and said that it’s currently working on a fix. Stay tuned to  for updates on this matter.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-28,Bosch spins off motorcycle division into new company – 2016 debut for cost-effective ABS10 braking system,"As a world-leader in vehicle electronics, sensors, engine management and safety systems, Bosch has gone into the motorcycle systems business in a big way in 2016 by creating an independent supplier company for the industry. To this end, Bosch is pushing forward its next-generation ABS10 braking system, a hub-mounted electric motor for e-scooters and a slew of electronic riding aids for motorcycles.Some studies have suggested that the global motorcycle market will expand by 160 million units a year till 2021, and 90% of those bikes are expected to be produced in Asia. Called the Two-Wheeler and Powersports division, the company is based in Yokohama, Japan, with branches in the US, Europe, India and China.“Bosch technology for more efficiency and safety should be part of any car and in the future the same will go for motorcycles,” said Bosch management board member Dr. Dirk Hoheisel. “We are aiming to become a leading supplier in the motorcycle market, too. The portion of the market relevant for Bosch which covers driving safety systems, powertrain technology and infotainment systems will double over the next five years.”Setting the pace with a proposed 2016 introduction is the ABS10, complemented by the MM5.10 inertial measurement unit, its famed Motronic engine management system and other sensors. Safety aids such as Side View Assist and Vehicle Hold Control are also on offer, all in an effort to make motorcycles safe and controllable under various road conditions.The ABS10 is not meant to supplant Bosch’s previous generation ABS9, but to complement it. The ABS10 system was developed for bikes up to 250 cc, being 30% lighter and 45% smaller. It is offered in front wheel only and two-wheel (front and rear) versions. An eye was kept on costs during development, especially important for developing countries where the cost of safety can be prohibitive to potential buyers.Another intriguing development from Bosch is the wheel hub motor, an electric powertrain offered exclusively in the China market. It can be used in most twist-and-go scooters and mopeds by simply substituting the conventional rear wheel.Producing just 2.4 hp, it has an electronically controlled boost function that should provide lively take-offs. The eScooter motor is equipped with a controller module that can be programmed with specific functions such as detecting whether the seat is occupied, before activating the electric motor.",Mohan K Ramanujam

We should have it ready by early next year.” Only just making its global debut last September at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, the managing director explained that it’s just a matter of formalities, but a launch in the first quarter of 2017 would be realistic.Like the XF and XE that was just launched here, the F-Pace will be fully-imported (CBU) from the UK. There, prices for the F-Pace start from 34,170 pounds (RM210k) for the very base-spec, 180 PS, 2.0 litre RWD diesel variant. The new XF’s prices start from 32,300 pounds (RM195k) for the 163 PS, 2.0 RWD diesel.Considering the high prices of the brand’s XE range, we asked the managing director if local assembly would ever be on the cards for JLRM. He said, “It depends on our principal. It’s their decision. There has been some discussion, but we don’t know what the outcome will be yet. Generally, we should and would definitely like to have locally assembled models – that would make us a lot more competitive. But, we need the volume to come in first.”",Chris Aaron

2016-01-28,SPYSHOTS: 2016 Proton Perdana shows off LED DRLs,"This is probably the best set of spyshots of the  so far, with front and rear three quarter shots plus a side profile view of the large sedan. Some of the pics also show us the Perdana’s “eyes” for the first time. Thanks to reader . Daytime running lights are a must have these days, even if many want it purely for the flash factor. Blame the likes of Audi, which started the stylised LED DRL trend. The 2016 Perdana doesn’t miss out, and we can see the big Proton’s LED daytime running lights sitting above the main beams, like eyebrows. As seen in , it’s an LED bar instead of a row of individual LEDs. Also seen is the location of the signal lamps, which are placed in the inner edge of the headlamp cluster. The wing mirrors also house indicators. On the topic of lights, check out the new Perdana’s .Another takeaway here is the size of the Perdana, illustrated by the side profile shot with occupants. The  donor car is already one of the biggest D-segment sedans on the road today, but Proton will pushing the envelope with its flagship – at a hair under five metres long (4,999 mm), the Perdana is 150 mm longer than the Accord, with most of it going to the rear end. To be built at Proton’s Medium Volume Factory in Shah Alam (current  is made by Honda Malaysia in Melaka), the 2016 Perdana is expected to launch in the first quarter of this year, retaining the Accord’s 154 hp/189 Nm R20A3 2.0 and 177 hp/222 Nm K24Z2 2.4 litre i-VTEC engines and five-speed automatic transmission.A revision is slated to arrive by the end of 2017, with the Perdana set to receive a , based on the Petronas E01 mill . The engine is expected to be available in both , both featuring direct injection.Also being considered is , claimed to be able to produce 180 hp and 250 Nm. Whichever powertrain ends up being slotted in, a new CVT automatic should become standard fare come end-2017.",Danny Tan
2016-01-28,"Jaguar XE debuts in Malaysia – 2.0, 3.0, from RM341k","The new  has finally been launched in Malaysia. Here to rival the ,  and , the premium compact sedan is available in three variants. As listed below, prices, ranging from RM341k to RM582k, are OTR without insurance and inclusive of GST.The compact XE’s arrival completes Jaguar Land Rover’s sedan range, joining the  and . It is also the first model to be underpinned by JLR’s new modular architecture, featuring an aluminium-intensive monocoque which allows the XE to shed weight whilst retaining a robust structure.The car measures 4,672 mm long, 1,850 mm wide and 1,416 mm tall. Its wheelbase chimes in at 2,835 mm long. To help you put that in perspective, a F30 3 Series is 48 mm shorter, 39 mm narrower and 13 mm taller than the Jag, while giving away another 25 mm at its wheelbase.Each of the three XE variants offer different levels of power output. At its base, the XE Prestige gets a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbocharged Ford EcoBoost engine that’s rated at 200 PS at 5,500 rpm and 280 Nm of torque between 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The mill allows the XE to complete a zero to 100 km/h sprint in 7.7 seconds, and have a top speed of 237 km/h. All variants feature a ZF-sourced eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission.The mid-range XE R-Sport gets the same 1,999 cc four-pot turbo, but has its output increased to 240 PS at 5,500 rpm and 340 Nm from 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The added power equated to a quicker 6.8-second century sprint and a top speed of 250 km/h. Note that this variant has a “25t” badge at its rear which signifies the 2.0 litre engine’s higher state of tune.At the top of the range sits Jaguar’s 3.0 litre V6 twin-vortex supercharged engine, residing in the top-shelf XE S. The engine is good for 340 PS at 6,500 rpm and 450 Nm at 4,500 rpm, giving the range-topping XE a zero to 100 km/h time of 5.1 seconds, and a top speed of 250 km/h. Interestingly, the engine is also featured in the base-spec variant of the brand’s F-Type sports car.Outside, the base Prestige variant offers bi-function HID xenon headlamps with LED daytime running lights and high-intensity LED tail lamps which have been inspired by the F-Type. It gets 17-inch “Turbine” 10-spoke sparkle silver alloy wheels as standard, and has its front radiator grille in black with a chrome surround.The R-Sport variant adds slightly sportier looks, courtesy of the R-Sport body kit – this adds an R-Sport front bumper, body-coloured side sills, satin chrome side power vents and a rear spoiler. The variant also gets 18-inch “Star” five-spoke alloy wheels as standard. Note that the R-Sport pictured here is equipped with the optional 19-inch “Venom” five, twin-spoke alloys in black.The XE S is by far the most aggressive variant in the line-up. On the outside, it features enlarged air intakes on the front bumper, side sill extensions, a rear spoiler, a gloss black rear valance and brake calipers painted in red. As standard, the S gets 18-inch “Templar” five, twin-spoke alloy wheels, but optionally, buyers may specify a set of 20-inch “Propeller” alloy wheels.Inside, the three variants feature very similar equipment and features – only trim and upholstery options appear to be different between them. A three-spoke multi-function steering wheel is standard across the board, while the centre console features a rising gear selector dial.The InControl Touch infotainment system introduces an eight-inch touchscreen display with a new graphical interface. Media options range from USB and auxiliary sockets to iPod and Bluetooth connectivity.As standard, all XE variants get a basic 80-watt, four-channel, six-speaker sound system. Optionally, buyers may spec-up the audio to a 380-watt Meridian sound system, specifically designed for the XE – audio reproduction here is via a greater 12-channel, 11-speaker system.Moving towards specifics of each variant’s interior, the base Prestige 2.0 starts things off by offering Taurus leather upholstery with contrasting stitching – based on your preferred colour theme. The signature Jaguar Riva Hoop that spans across the door trim and dashboard is in brushed aluminium, while the steering wheel is wrapped in soft grain leather.The R Sport adds to the above a set of Sport Perforation seats with Taurus leather upholstery and mesh fabric inserts. The Riva Hoop and door finishers are in etched aluminium, with additional “R-Sport” badges on the steering wheel and tread plates to remind you of your RM365k purchase.The S variant’s cabin is the sportiest of them all. With suede cloth inserts on the Taurus leather seats, this variant also gets a generous serving of gloss black trim. The steering wheel and tread plates get “S” badges, and the Riva Hoop and door trim here feature a dark mesh aluminium material.There’s a decent amount of driver assistance systems in the XE. The JaguarDrive Control allows you to switch the vehicle’s performance characteristics on the fly, offering Normal, Eco, Dynamic and Winter driving modes that modify the XE’s throttle and steering characteristics.The XE is also the first Jaguar model to be offered with an electric-powered steering. Officially known as the Speed Proportional Electric Power Steering, the system claims to accurately optimise steering feel to match your demands. A Torque Vectoring by Braking system is also on deck, designed to mitigate understeer situations. Notably, only the R-Sport variant appears to feature a Sports-tuned suspension.Another world debut for the brand is its All Surface Progress Control, which gets its first application in the XE. The traction management system functions similarly to a low-speed cruise control and gives the rear-wheel driven XE better all-weather capabilities. Typically used to optimise grip in the snow, the system functions between 3.6 km/h and 30 km/h and provides maximum take-off grip in slippery conditions – not that we’ll ever be driving in snow, anytime soon.For safety, the all XE variants get on nicely with six airbags as standard. Active safety features include Hill Launch Assist, Emergency Brake Assist, Dynamic Stability Control and Traction Control.To recap, the Jaguar XE is priced from RM340k to RM580k, with three variants available. The prices include a five-year or 150,000 km warranty and three years roadside assistance. The Prestige 2.0 and R-Sport 2.0 variants come with a five-year or 80,000 km free scheduled maintenance package, while the S 3.0 variant gets the same deal under five-year or 65,000 km terms.Early buyers will also get the XE Launch Accessories kit worth RM10,000 for free. The package includes illuminated tread plates up front, aluminium red-painted paddle shifters, a specially-designed gear selector with a premium dark leather top and a rubber bezel with a soft-touch grip and unique tyre valve caps which are available in four designs.On top of this, there are also several items for buyers to add on, including a chrome front splitter (RM1,538), aluminium gearshift paddles (RM3,559), an iPad Mini holder (RM1,504) and a headrest-mounted coat hanger (RM337).

2016-01-28,"Suzuki Ignis unveiled for Japan, on sale in February","The new  has been unveiled in its home market, Japan. The compact crossover will go on sale by mid-February and is available in three different variants, the Hybrid MG, Hybrid MX and top-range Hybrid MZ. As it goes in Japan, all models can be had in either two- or all-wheel drive form.A 1.2 litre K12C Dualjet four cylinder engine with Mild Hybrid technology (similar to the new ) is the primary mill that powers all the Ignis variants, which are also paired solely to a CVT gearbox. In total, the engine produces 91 PS and 118 Nm of torque, while the Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) gives the engine an extra 3.1 PS and 50 Nm of torque.Under the JC08 cycle, fuel consumption for the Ignis is rated at 28 km per litre for the two-wheel drive model and 25.4 km per litre for the all-wheel drive variant – partly because the top-of-the-range MZ in two-wheel drive form (880 kg) weighs less than the four-wheel drive variant (920 kg).Features that the Ignis receives include regenerative braking, automatic LED headlights with auto levelling function, LED fog lamps and 16-inch aluminium wheels. On the inside, features include keyless entry and push start button, heated front seats, a Bluetooth-enabled headunit with Apple CarPlay connectivity and UV and IR cut glass.Safety equipment that comes with the Ignis includes dual front, side and curtain airbags, ABS with EBD, lane departure warning, ESP, as well as hill-hold assist and hill descent control.

This time, the rival to the Audi A3 Sedan and Mercedes-Benz CLA is seen in a shade of red, and though it still wears the same camo as an earlier test mule that was . The only difference here is the single exhaust tip, instead of two, which perhaps points to a lower-spec variant.Currently, BMW has yet to clarify on whether the F52 BMW 1 Series Sedan will be sold as a global model or as a China exclusive. The model was officially previewed during the 2015 Guangzhou Auto Show, where the Bavarian automaker introduced the , described as a vision for a “four-door sedan for the compact segment.” Rumours are rife that the decision to launch the concept in China was an indicator of the 1 Series Sedan’s target market.BMW has also kept mum on the details of the F52 BMW 1 Series. However, it is widely known that the car will be built on the same UKL architecture. The platform is utilised by several MINI models, as well as front-wheel drive BMWs like the 2 Series Active and Gran Tourer, and the . Curiously, the test mule here appears to be wearing MINI wheels.This will make the F52 BMW 1 Series Sedan the first-ever BMW sedan model to feature front-wheel drive. Expect engine options that will power this endeavour include the 1.5 litre turbo three-pot from the current F56 MINI Cooper, and the B48 2.0 litre turbocharged four-pot in the Cooper S and the . A six-speed manual or eight-speed Steptronic gearbox should be employed as well. As BMW’s xDrive is available for the X1, the all-wheel drive system may find its way here as well.Recently, BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA), a joint venture between BMW and Brilliance Auto, announced that it will open a brand new engine plant with a light metal foundry in Shenyang. The new plant will be responsible for producing BMW’s TwinPower Turbo three- and four-cylinder engines, which does co-relate to the above-mentioned item. Considering the fact that the 1 Series Sedan’s rivals are available globally beyond just one market, we reckon BMW will want to introduce its compact sedan in various markets as well. However, we’ll have to await official word from BMW before anything is remotely concrete. In any case, wouldn’t a BMW 1 Series Sedan be a tempting proposition?",Gerard Lye

Aside from the standard car, the Corolla Altis can also be had in ESport and ESport Nurburgring Edition versions as well.  Unlike here in Malaysia, the Thai-spec  Altis is not available with the 3ZR-FE 2.0 litre Dual VVT-i four-cylinder petrol engine (145 PS, 187 Nm). Instead buyers there have the option of either a 1.6 litre or 1.8 litre four-cylinder Dual VVT-i petrol engine. For the latest model, the previous 1ZR-FE 1.6 litre mill has been updated to now provide more power – 125 hp at 6,000 rpm (122 hp before) and 157 Nm at 5,200 rpm (154 Nm before), and configured to run on E85 gasohol. These changes are accompanied by a new engine model code as well, with the 1.6 litre engine being designated as the 1ZR-FBE.Meanwhile, the larger 2ZR-FBE 1.8 litre engine continues to serve up 141 PS at 6,000 rpm and 177 Nm at 4,000 rpm. The engine can also run on E85 gasohol like the 1ZR-FBR, and is fitted on both the ESport variants of the Corolla Altis. Toyota’s Super CVT-i transmission is fitted on nearly every variant of the , save for the entry-level 1.6 litre model that gets a five-speed manual. Turning our attention to the exterior features, the standard car remains largely unchanged from before, aside from the addition LED projector headlights with LED DRLs, automatic folding side mirrors and maybe Adam Levine. The ESport variants also receive their fair share of exterior updates. The  soldiers on with a TRD body kit, now with the addition of front fog lights. On the other hand, the ESport Nurburgring Edition gets a completely new body kit that is less aggressive but curvier than the one fitted on the standard ESport. The body kit is accompanied by sporty 17-inch wheels and Nurburgring Edition badging as well.Inside, the Corolla Altis gets a new instrument cluster featuring new graphics, repositioned indicator lights and multi-info colour display (similar to that found in recent Toyota/Lexus models). Other cabin updates include a new leather steering wheel, rear seats that can now be reclined and a new Nanoe water-coated ion technology for the air-con system, which provides moisturising to occupants’ skin and hair and even deodorises the cabin. The Corolla Altis ESport Nurburgring Edition meanwhile, gains a few additional interior touches to differentiate it from the standard car, including black leather seats with red highlights and “ESport” embroidery, red trim, leather steering wheel, new shift knob, black-red floor mats and an uprated infotainment system featuring DVD playback and navigation functionality.  Prices for the new Toyota Corolla Altis in Thailand start at 779,000 baht (RM92,290) for the 1.6J entry-level variant, and go up to 1,079,000 baht (RM127,597) for the top-of-the-line 1.8 V Navi variant.

2016-01-27,"Toyota retains No.1 automaker crown with 10.15 million vehicles sold in 2015, beats VW and GM","Toyota has retained its status as the world’s top-selling carmaker for the fourth year running. The Japanese giant sold 10.15 million cars in 2015, beating not just expectations, but Germany’s Volkswagen and USA’s General Motors to the crown. VW sold 9.93 million vehicles and GM did 9.8 million to complete the podium. Hyundai-Kia managed 8.01 million. Nissan, which just released figures, said sales hit a record 5.42 million units in 2015. Add in sales from French partner Renault, and the Alliance’s 8.22 million combined sales puts it in fourth.Toyota, which sold 10.23 million cars in 2014 to top the league,  this year. In fact, VW had been leading the sales race in the first half of 2015 before the  emissions scandal derailed Wolfsburg’s bid to oust Toyota.  Toyota profited from strong North American demand, as . While Toyota is facing sluggish sales in Thailand and Indonesia, a Japanese consumption tax hike planned for next year could spark a rush in buying in 2016. Toyota is likely to keep the crown for at least another year, although a slowdown in China could hurt numbers, analysts said.Toyota first tasted life at the top when it broke GM’s decades-long stranglehold in 2008, but lost it three years later to the Detroit firm when an earthquake-tsunami disaster struck Japan in 2011. Toyota regained top spot from GM in 2012 and has remained there since.  reports that Toyota had stopped building new plants for several years, and turned its focus to quality rather than sales volume.

Both Daihatsu and Suzuki specialise in compact cars and are direct rivals in Japan.The report notes that full control of Daihatsu could help Toyota leverage the lower-cost brand better and cut procurement costs for the former, while capital ties with Suzuki would help the the big T make inroads into India, where Suzuki commands around half the passenger car market via .Toyota-Daihatsu ties started in 1967 and the giant took a majority stake in Daihatsu in 1998. It currently owns 51.2% of the compact car maker, and taking Daihatsu private would cost Toyota US$3.2 billion at current market prices. Daihatsu shares jumped 20% today in reaction to Toyota’s statement.“We are constantly considering a number of possibilities relating to Daihatsu, such as partnerships or business restructuring, including making the company a fully owned subsidiary,” Toyota said in a statement, adding that no decisions had been made.As for the links with Suzuki, Japanese business daily  reported that Toyota and Suzuki were discussing ties from various angles, including the possibility of cross-shareholding as they look to take capitalise on demand for compact cars in India and other emerging markets.“I can easily see the Daihatsu brand used in the same way that VW uses , or Renault uses , or Nissan uses  as a low-cost, sub-premium brand to the core brand,” said CLSA senior research analyst Christopher Richter. “That could be a very effective weapon against Suzuki in places like India. If I were Suzuki that would sound like a risk to doing business with Toyota,” he added.Others noted that a Toyota-Suzuki partnership could be win-win. Suzuki has an unrivalled distribution network in India that Toyota can benefit from, while Suzuki would be getting a stable shareholder, plus access to Toyota’s hybrid,  and other next-gen tech geared towards future vehicle electrification, JP Morgan analysts noted.However, Suzuki is expected to tread carefully with any potential tie-up with a giant carmaker after its previous capital alliance with Volkswagen soured, leading to a lengthy legal dispute that only ended last year with the unwinding of their cross-shareholdings.

2016-01-27,Opel/Vauxhaull GT Concept – minimalist MX-5 rival,"Vauxhall and Opel are bringing out the avant-garde GT Concept, which will debut at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The minimalistic concept is inspired by many motor vehicles, such as the 1966 Vauxhall XVR and 1965 Opel Experimental GT. Apart from that, it’s an evolution of the  that was first seen in 2013. The GT Concept appears to be a  rival seeing that it weighs less than 1,000 kg and a similar front-mid engine, rear-wheel drive layout. The lightweight GT Concept is designed by British designer Mark Adam and it showcases his philosophy of ‘Sculptural Artistry meets Technical Precision.’ Its name comes from the 1964 GT Concept, produced by the Vauxhall Design and Engineering Centre in Luton.Exterior design of the GT Concept is described as “pure, minimalistic, yet bold and uncompromising” –  like the vehicles that it draws its inspiration from. As for the red strip that streams across the car, the brand says that it’s a signature line that “splits the vehicle body horizontally and proportions it.” The windscreen flows towards the top, acting as a glass panorama roof as well. Those red Hankook rubbers are wrapped around rims with a ‘roller-skate’ design. It’s a reference to the 1920 Opel Motoclub 500, which had red-coloured tyres too. The long bonnet, central dual exhausts and lack of a boot lid is shared with both the Vauxhall XVR and the Opel Experimental GT Concept’s design. To add to that, the exterior has some pretty smart features as well.These include integrated headlamps and indicators that’s based on Vauxhall/Opel’s IntelliLux LED matrix lighting. Utilising “ultra-modern” projection tech, the headlamps have a 3D beam that provides for glare-free high beam driving. Down the back, the rear lamps are in a three-dimensional design, the company says. As for the doors, they’re electric, with integrated windows that appears as a “seamless transition from glass to painted surfaces.”The doors are opened by pressing a touchpad integrated into the red line on the roof. Employing patented mountings, they open into the front arches and allows for wide opening angles in tight parking spaces. There are no exterior mirrors too, as two cameras behind the wheel arches are in their places. Said to allow for better visibility during urban drives, images are transmitted to two monitors on the left and right sides of the cabin.As for power, the GT Concept features a front-mid engine configuration to keep the centre of gravity low. Underneath the hood is an all-aluminium turbocharged 1.0 litre three cylinder engine that makes 145 PS and 205 Nm of torque. A six-speed sequential transmission operable via paddle shifters, sends power to the rear wheels. It will sprint from 0-100 km less than eight seconds and it has a top speed of 215 km/h.",Graham Chin

Good news – an updated Brutale 675 will follow later in the year. Bad news – the 2016 Brutale 800 has gained a little weight and lost some power to Euro 4.The 2016 Brutale 800 is probably the worst kept secret since charitable donations, so let’s gloss over it and move on the to interesting stuff.

The 320 km/h (200 mph) F-Type SVR will make its world debut at the Geneva motor show in March. The first Jaguar SVR car is developed to exploit the two-seat aluminium F-Type’s full potential while retaining day-to-day usability.

It is also one size smaller than the brand’s .As revealed last November, the latest-gen Kia Cadenza features a whole new look. For the first time, the brand’s signature tiger nose grille is curved inwards, while new wraparound LED headlamps are seen underlined by a chrome strip that extends from the front grille. The brand’s signature four-point LED daytime running lights are also present.The side profile of the car reveals the K7’s typically long bonnet and sloping roofline. The variant pictured here also appears to feature 19-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels, wrapped in 245/40R19 rubbers. New, wider tail lights are also featured, with squared-off twin exhaust tips finishing off the exterior’s bold new look.Spec-wise, the Korean site reveals several key highlights of the new Cadenza.

2016-01-27,Banting-Taiping West Coast Expressway 5% complete,"The West Coast Expressway (WCE), a 232 km highway that will span from Banting to Taiping in Perak along Peninsular Malaysia’s west coast, is now 5% complete. The WCE, or Lebuhraya Pantai Barat, was  and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The concession period for WCE is 50 years.Concession holder Kumpulan Europlus Bhd (KEB) will be calling for tenders for the remaining six packages for the RM6 billion WCE in the next few months,  reports. The six packages are worth RM2.2 billion. Earlier, KEB awarded five packages worth of RM2.8 billion to IJM Construction via a direct award as per the terms of the concession agreement.“The progress of these packages comes to 20%,” CEO Datuk Neoh Soon Hiong told reporters at KEB’s EGM yesterday, adding trhat as a whole, the WCE is now 5% complete. Neoh does not foresee an increase in construction costs for the highway despite the weakening ringgit, which has made imported building materials more expensive. “So far until today, it is still within the budget (of RM5 billion purely for construction costs),” he said.KEB’s head added that the company is not interested in bidding for upcoming highway projects such as the  and , as the WCE will keep it busy for the next few years.

An ambitious-sounding volume target has also been dropped,  reports. According to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ revised plan for Alfa Romeo, the Italian brand will still launch eight new models including the Giulia, but instead of now till 2018, the time frame has been extended to 2020. So it’s eight new models from now until 2020.The original plan was for global Alfa Romeo sales to reach , but FCA’s new plan has no volume indications for Alfa and Fiat Chrysler as a whole. In a presentation on FCA’s website, the company said that its commitment to Alfa’s overall brand and product strategy “remains in place.” Alfa’s 2015 global sales are expected to be 65,000.In line with the current economic climate, the revised Alfa plan will focus mainly on Europe and , with reduced expectations for China where the premium car market is slowing down along with the general economy. The original forecast had annual Alfa sales in North America and Europe at 150,000 units each by 2018. China was expected to contribute 80,000 to the total despite Alfa not having any history in the Middle Kingdom.What’s going on with the Giulia, you ask. Alfa has delayed the launch of the BMW 3 Series-rival due to technical problems. The high-performance , unveiled to much fanfare in June 2015, was due to launch in Europe by the end of last year to kickstart things, but the muscular sedan is now expected to reach European showrooms in June. The  tasked to bring in the numbers is set to make an appearance in Geneva in March, but it is not yet clear when it will arrive in dealerships. FCA boss Sergio Marchionne has gone on record to say that Giulia production will begin in this quarter.FCA’s latest business plan also touches on the other planned models. , which will be based on the Giulia, will launch in Europe by late 2016 or early 2017. US launches for the Giulia and “Giulia SUV” will follow the European debuts by three to six months.

Apart from identifying foreign vehicles that evade settling summonses, he added that the VEP will help the JPJ to “control” and “combat” .“When the VEP is implemented, all vehicles coming into the country from Singapore must be registered,” he said, noting that this will help tackle the cloned car matter. According to him, most clone vehicles are purchased with cash as there are no financial institutions willing to give out loans, seeing that the vehicles in question have no documents.“We urge the public not to be fooled by such attractive offers to own a luxury vehicle at low prices. I am sure half of these buyers are aware that they are clone cars, but they still buy them, because the prices are appealing,” he said. Ismail further stressed that owning a cloned vehicle is an offence under the Road Transport Act 1987 and also the Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009.",Graham Chin
2016-01-27,2016 Yamaha Xabre 150 launched in Bali by Rossi,"Yamaha Indonesia launched the Xabre naked sport motorcycle in the resort island of Bali yesterday, officiated by none other than “The Doctor”, multiple MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi. This single-cylinder brings the number of Yamaha offerings in the 150 cc market segment in Indonesia to three, the other two being the V-Ixion and the R15.This fuel-injected 149 cc single is liquid-cooled, and drives a six-speed gearbox, all housed in the Yamaha ‘Deltabox’ frame.

2016-01-27,SPIED: 2017 Porsche Panamera with all-touch buttons,"We’ve known for some time now that  for its first-gen Porsche Panamera. We’ve even shown you  to disguise its new curves. Here, however, we bring you the best look at the car’s interior we’ve ever seen yet.Snippets of the cabin from a distance have been uncovered before, but here, the next-gen Panamera’s centre console, steering and parts of its dashboard are in clear view. Notably, the centre console is one area that stands out.Look closely, and it appears that Porsche has dropped its previous button-heavy arrangement for what looks here like a fully touch-sensitive panel that surrounds the gear lever. All of the car’s controls which previously had dedicated switches or buttons have been replaced by a far simpler layout.We reckon that some of the car’s controls have even been shifted to the dashboard-integrated touchscreen display. This could be a new route for Porsche models in the future, so do take note of what you see here.The three-spoke steering wheel is also new to the Panamera, and like other new Porsche models, is inspired by the . The five-binnacle instruments are familiar, and while the top half of the dashboard is completely covered up, we do spot that the air-conditioning vents have been relocated, and that all buttons that used to surround the multimedia display screen have been removed.Outside, these spy photos don’t show us anything we haven’t already seen. The front end of the car is sculpted as you’d expected it, but it is the rear that has drawn some attention. While the first-gen Panamera’s rear end was a bit ungainly to some, the next-gen model seems to have been heavily revised in the area.We also know that this Panamera will be underpinned by Volkswagen’s new Modular Standard Platform (MSB). To be applied in all high-end Volkswagen Group models, such as the future  range, MSB will bring about weight significant shavings as well – said to be up to 100 kg, in the case of the new Panamera against the old one.Few changes are expected in the next-gen model’s powertrain department, with it likely carrying forward the current range of V6 and V8 turbocharged units.

2016-01-27,TMJ’s stunning purple LaFerrari makes an appearance,"It’s no surprise that the Johor royal family has an exquisite car collection. If you need a refresher of that,  to witness the Tunku Mahkota Johor, Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, as he toured Kuala Lumpur while being accompanied by a bevy of exotic machinery. Now however, we’re being introduced to the latest addition to that impressive fleet, a stunning purple LaFerrari. Several photos of Ferrari’s latest and finest were uploaded to the Johor Southern Tigers official Facebook page. In the photos, we see His Royal Highness TMJ arriving at the Tan Sri Dato’ Haji Hassan Yunos Stadium in the rare supercar, of which only 499 will ever exist.One third of the so-called holy trinity of hybrid supercars, which includes the Porsche 918 Spyder and , “The Ferrari” packs a potent hybrid powertrain within its carbon-fibre body. The main element here is the Ferrari F140 6.3 litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine that produces 789 hp at 9,000 rpm and 700 Nm at 6,750 rpm.The engine is supplemented by Ferrari’s 161 hp HY-KERS system, which provides short bursts of extra power. The F1-derived system brings the total system output to 950 hp and a combined torque of 900 Nm. Transferring all the power to the rear wheels is the job of a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. All that power is used to propel a car that weighs (1,585 kg) less than a Toyota Camry Hybrid (1,600 kg) at the kerb. This is partly because of the extensive use of carbon-fibre in the car’s construction, including the monocoque structure that is claimed to offer 27% more torsional rigidity and 22% more beam stiffness than the Enzo.LaFerrari is equipped with carbon-ceramic Brembo discs on the front (398 mm) and rear (380 mm). It also rides on double wishbone suspension in the front and a multi-link suspension in the rear, with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres that measure 265/30R19 at the front, and a massive 345/30R20 at the rear.The car’s grunt is equally matched by its brains. There’s no shortage of electronic controls to keep things in check here, including EF1-Trac F1 electronic traction control, Ferrari’s third-gen E-Diff electronic differential, SCM-E Frs magnetorheological dampers and active aerodynamics.As is the case with most LaFerrari purchases, the buyer can partake in Ferrari’s Personalisation Programme, where a wide variety of customisation options are available. As you can tell, TMJ has opted to bypass the classic Rosso Corsa for a deep shade of purple, matched with a black roof and wheels. No images of the interior were uploaded but we expect more personalisation to take place there.Quite a stunner then. And if you’re lucky enough to see the car up close and live, it’ll certainly be an experience to remember.",Gerard Lye
2016-01-27,Porsche 718 Boxster revealed – turbo flat-four engines,"The facelifted Porsche Boxster has been officially revealed ahead of its debut at the Geneva motor show in March. The mid-engine roadster is armed with a new name and turbocharged four-cylinder engines that phase out the .The 718 in the name refers to the  that won numerous races back in the 1950s and 1960s, among them being the legendary Targa Florio and Le Mans. Porsche had last used a four-cylinder engine in the 968 from the early 1990s. Plenty of torque on tap. The Boxster’s 2.0 litre turbo makes 300 hp and 380 Nm of twist, available from 1,950 to 4,500 rpm. That’s a huge gain of 100 Nm compared to the outgoing 2.7 litre flat-six. In the new Boxster S, a 2.5 litre flat-four develops 350 hp and 420 Nm of torque, available from 1,900 to 4,500 rpm, a 60 Nm boost from today’s S, which uses a 3.4 litre flat-six. The bigger engine uses a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry. Porsche says that it is the only manufacturer to offer VTG in production cars with petrol engines, both in the  and the 718 Boxster S.Both cars are faster than before. The 718 Boxster – with PDK and the Sport Chrono package – does the 0-100 km/h sprint in 4.7 seconds, which is eight tenths faster than before. The 718 Boxster S with the same equipment completes this sprint in 4.2 seconds, 0.6 seconds faster. Top speed is 275 km/h and 285 km/h, respectively.The reason for the move from six to four is efficiency, and the 2.0L turbo delivers with NEDC fuel consumption of 6.9 litres per 100 km, a significant 1.0 litre per 100 km less. The 2.5L turbo does 7.3 litres per 100 km, which is 0.9 litres less for every 100 km travelled. Both 718s come with a six-speed manual gearbox as standard, with Porsche’s seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic as an option. The PDK has new “fuel-saving virtual gears”, which are supplemental virtual intermediate gears that reduce engine speed during constant cruising when the next higher gear would reduce engine speed too much. This function is achieved by partially engaging two adjacent gears simultaneously while slipping both clutches slightly to achieve an effective added ratio. When one steps on the gas, the PDK downshifts out of this mode. Porsche says that as its DCT is bathed in oil, this new virtual gear function does not bring added wear. The PDK also has enhanced stop-start which shuts off the engine when coasting to a stop. Additionally, the coasting function disengages the clutches when coasting at speed, leaving the engine at idle and the car in neutral. This boosts cruising economy.Other drive-related changes include a retuned chassis that enhances cornering performance, a 10% more direct electromechanical steering system, the optional Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) with a 10 mm lower ride height (20 mm lower in the S) and an Individual programme in the optional Sport Chrono pack. A Sport Response button has been added to PDK cars.Not too hard to tell a 718 apart from the pre-facelift. The front end has a wider appearance with larger air intakes, and there are new design bi-xenon headlights with integrated LED DRLs. LED headlights with four-point DRLs are optional. New wings and side sills, plus larger air inlet panels with two fins, can be found on the flanks. New 19-inch wheels are standard on the Boxster S and 20-inch rims are on the options list.The redesigned rear gives a wider impression due to the accent strip with integrated Porsche badge between the new tail lights,  which feature three-dimensional LED technology and four-point brake lights.Inside, a newly designed dash panel frames the Porsche Communication Management (PCM) unit with mobile phone preparation, audio interfaces and Sound Package Plus with 110 watts of audio power.

2016-01-26,SPIED: 2016 Honda Accord facelift for China market,"The China-market 2016 Honda Accord facelift has been revealed through a set of spyshots published by . Based on these images, the large sedan will be available with two distinct faces in that market, neither of which matches that of the officially-unveiled . Both looks feature a large gaping “mouth” with black inserts – similar to the current  – topped by a wide chrome wing that extends into the headlights. The new-design chrome grille is also featured prominently on the USDM model.  The rear, meanwhile, is as per the North American model, with the addition of twin rectangular exhaust pipes neatly integrated into the bumper. Don’t read to much into this, though, as the current China-market Accord (above) already had similar items. And before you get carried away, it has to be said that what you see here is unlikely to be the same exact model that the Malaysian market will receive. China’s Accord has always had a bolder front end compared to what we get, and ours usually mirror the American model rather closely. Still, what do you think of this look?",Hafriz Shah
2016-01-26,Jaguar F-Type SVR brochure leaked online – 575 hp,"Remember the  that we loved (and still do) so much? Well, German website  has a brochure of a Jaguar F-Type SVR (said to have been leaked online unintentionally by a German importer). The new SVR receives a slight power bump, along with added agility and cosmetic improvements. It will be available in both coupe and convertible body styles. In the brochure, we can see that the supercharged 5.0 litre V8 mill and the eight-speed transmission have been retained. The SVR makes a tad more – 575 hp and 700 Nm of torque – thanks to a few tweaks. As a refresher, the F-Type R, with the same engine, makes a total of 550 hp and 680 Nm of torque, while the , currently the most powerful edition, makes 575 PS and 680 Nm of torque.The F-Type SVR, to be offered exclusively with all-wheel drive, will achieve the century sprint in just 3.7 seconds. To top it off, the SVR coupe will have a top speed of 322 km/h and the cabriolet with 313 km/h. As a comparison the F-Type R reaches 100 km/h this in 4.2 seconds in rear-wheel drive form, and 4.1 seconds with all-wheel drive.Outside, the SVR will sport a new front bumper with bigger air intakes, a front splitter, a ventilated hood and a speed-retractable rear wing. A lightweight titanium exhaust system with quad pipes and 20-inch forged aluminium wheels (providing 10 kg worth of weight savings) shod in Pirelli P Zero tyres, are standard too.The SVR is set to get an adaptive sports suspension, an electronic differential, while lightweight carbon ceramic brakes are an optional extra. The brakes are said to weigh 21 kg less than the standard set. Inside, the interior remains largely the same, save for aluminium trim and quilted performance seats with an Argyle-inspired design.As for its release, the F-Type SVR will go on sale in the Netherlands in May, while a debut at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, happening in March, can be expected.

2016-01-26,F1 drivers demand closed cockpits by 2017 – report,"Formula One cars could see the adoption of a closed cockpit design as early as 2017 if the Grand Prix Driver’s Association (GPDA) has its way, according to .Racers are reportedly clamouring for increased head protection against accident debris, despite the rules of car design being revised for this year – including raising the cockpit’s side protection by 20 mm and strengthening the area to withstand a force of 50 kilonewtons (up from 15 kN last year) – for improved safety.The news comes in the wake of the death of Jules Bianchi last year – the Frenchman suffered severe head injuries in a collision with a tractor crane during a rainy 2014 Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka, which ultimately turned out to be fatal. Just over a month later, former F1 driver Justin Wilson also passed away after being struck by a large piece of flying debris during an IndyCar race.Former F1 driver and GPDA president Alex Wurz told the BBC that he saw no reason for closed cockpits not to be introduced in time for the 2017 season.
“Obviously structural changes are required to the chassis but, with almost a one-year lead time, I don’t see any technical person speaking against such substantial safety improvements, especially given the last big accidents in open-wheel racing involved head injuries,” he said. “So all the drivers, and I, hope that passing the additional head protection will be a formality.”Closed cockpit designs have been seen before on concept cars that envision the future of F1 racers, including fighter jet-style canopies on the Red Bull X2010, X2011 and X2014 in the  video game series, as well as the more recent . However, tests conducted by the FIA on these designs have exposed strength and safety issues that could hamper their chances of being implemented.On the other hand,  – featuring two protective arms above the driver’s head, joined by a central support ahead of the driver – has apparently emerged as a favourite following further tests.“The research the FIA experts have done is very thorough and the process has brought forward a clear solution,” Wurz added. “Now the drivers feel it’s time to implement the extra protection at the latest in 2017.”",Jonathan Lee

2016-01-26,Ducati shows Scrambler Sixty2 specials at Verona,"The Ducati Scrambler is a bike that easily lends itself to personalisation and customisation, and three iterations thereof were shown at the Verona Motor Bike Show on January 22. Called Peace Sixty2, Revolution and Artika, the trio were presented at the Ducati display called “Land of Joy”.Starting with the new model in the Scrambler range, the Sixty2, the Peace Sixty2 is a 60s-styled cafe racer by Verona-based custom bike builder Mr. Martini. The fairing of the Peace Sixty2 harks back to the days of the bevel-geared twins and Pantahs. The single-seat tailpiece with hand-crafted leather seat, coupled with the Termignoni exhausts, are combined with design details and graphics that convey a sense of Ducati’s racing heritage.Officine Mermaid is responsible for the Revolution, a full bobber-style Sixty2. Stripped of everything that is not necessary, the Revolution shows designer Dario Mastroianni’s sweeping changes to the low-slung bike, including 17-inch wheels front and rear, new fork yokes and the leather single-seat. The exposed Desmodromic belt-drive further emphasises the stripped-down nature of the Revolution.Last in the list is the Artika by Dario Lopez Studio. Taking its cue from the Ducati Pantah ice racer of the late ’70s, currently on display in the Ducati Museum in Borgo Panigale, the Artika is designed to be ridden when the weather gets cold and the snow starts falling. The florescent yellow body and bright blue trim could be seen by a blind man, and would make the bike hard to miss in a parking lot.Also on display at the Ducati stand at the Verona Expo is the complete range of accessories and customisation options for the Scrambler Sixty2, showing how easily a rider’s Scrambler can be modified to suit almost any taste or style.The Ducati Scrambler is sold in Malaysia by Naza.

2016-01-26,Ferrari California T gets Handling Speciale (HS) option,"Maranello has announced a new handling package for the . The option is called the Handling Speciale (HS), featuring enhanced vehicle control, revised F1-Trac logic, a new exhaust system and some aesthetic bits for the 2+2 convertible. The HS package will be showcased at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show this year.Handling improvements are made possible through specific calibrations and a set-up that’s particularly noticeable in the manettino’s Sport mode. With the pack equipped, the California T gets new damper settings along with modified springs. The front set of springs are stiffened by 16% and the rear set by 19%.An enhanced Sport mode is also claimed. This is thanks to a new strategy laid out for the SCM3 magnetorheological dampers – it increases the speed of the damper’s response and improves its efficiency. Furthermore, the F1-Trac logic also provides for better acceleration at corner exits and bumpy road surfaces.Apart from that, the gear-shift logic in Sport mode, both in automatic and manual, have been modified. The California T receives faster, sportier gear engagement in both up- and downshifts. The HS pack also comes with a new exhaust system with silencers, featuring two primary pipes with a new geometry design.Said exhaust was developed in tandem with the engine and gearbox control software. It also provides more rapid response and improved sound and volume. Ferrari says that the new exhaust system gives a fuller, richer and more involving note at all speeds in all driving situations, further adding that it’s instantly recognisable at the push of the Start button.As for cosmetic upgrades, opting for the HS package will have the California T sporting a new front grille in Grigio Ferro Met colour and a rear diffuser that comes in the same scheme albeit with matte black fences, complemented by matte black tailpipes.

It comprises of some five million vehicles with potentially defective airbags supplied by Takata,  reports. With that, the number of airbag inflator recalls will have ballooned to 28 million (over 24 million vehicles affected) according to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).The death of a driver in an American-market 2006 Ford Ranger pick-up back in December 2015 in the US, along with new tests performed on suspected faulty airbags, are factors which triggered the recall. Brands affected for the first time include Audi,  and Saab. Other car brands that will also be taking part in the new recall include , Honda and . Of the total number, five million vehicles in the new recall are related to the driver-side airbags, and about one million in the new recall have inflators similar to those in the Ranger, according to the NHTSA. In addition to that, Honda vehicles that shared the same inflators as the Ranger has been recalled as well. Some four million other vehicles will be recalled for additional testing of Takata driver-side airbags – brands include Honda and . In November last year, the agency said that tens of millions vehicles with inflators that contain the  will be recalled by 2018 – if Takata cannot prove that the inflators are safe.“This is a massive safety crisis,” said Gordon Trowbridge, spokesperson of the NHTSA. Trowbridge added that the fatality brought about a reassessment that needed “immediate action.” The death, which happened in South Carolina, was the ninth case in the US and the first of which occurred in a vehicle not made by Honda. Interestingly, the NHTSA noted that before the incident, tests were conducted on 1,900 inflators in the Ranger. The outcome of these tests showed that there were no issues whatsoever.“(It) sheds light on the risks of having a supplier be the source for so many cars across so many companies,” said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan.

Even then, some design details still manage to shine through the copious camo.Starting from the front, the Megane Sports Tourer (ST) retains the hatch’s front fascia, along with the distinctive C-shaped headlights. However, the LED 3D-effect positioning lights appear to be covered by the camo. Other elements that are carried forward include the corner intakes/fog lamp enclosures and alloy wheel design.The vehicle’s side profile is where the majority of the distinctions take place. Aside from the obvious added overhang to accommodate more cargo space at the rear, the Megane ST gets its rear doors reworked as well. They now appear to feature a more vertical trailing edge, accompanied by a flatter roofline, and as a result, a straighter window line as well. At the rear, only a small portion of the LED tail lights are in view.

2016-01-26,Ford to completely pull out of Indonesia and Japan,"Ford says it will be pulling out of the Indonesian and Japanese markets this year, stating that it saw “no reasonable path to profitability” in both countries, where the brand has long struggled to gain any significant purchase. According to , the news of the exit came in the form of an email from Asia Pacific president Dave Schoch to all employees in the region, which the news agency said it viewed. In both countries, the moving out will be complete – it will close not just its offices but all dealerships as well, and stop the sales and imports of Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Another news report states that the brand will make its exit from both markets before the end of 2016, but will honour its commitment to existing customers with regards to vehicle servicing, parts replacements and warranty claims. Ford entered the Indonesian market in 2002, and sells its vehicles through 44 franchised dealerships. In 2015, the brand shifted just 6,000 vehicles, which was 0.6% of the total new car market in the country, which is struggling from an economic slowdown. It currently employs 35 staff in the republic.“In Indonesia, without local manufacturing, there’s just really no way that automakers can compete in that market, and we do not have local manufacturing,” a Shanghai-based Ford spokeswoman told . Its withdrawal from Indonesia follows in the footsteps of General Motors, which  last June. The decision to shut its Bekasi, Indonesia plant resulted in terminating about 500 jobs in the process, but GM at least continues to maintain a presence in the market, as a national sales company.As for Japan, the Blue Oval began operations there in 1974, and presently has 52 dealerships in the country and a staff count of 292. The company has had a tough time selling its Fiestas, Mustangs and Explorers in the market, and only managed to shift around 5,000 vehicles last year, which was about 1.5% of the imported new car market volume. Ford said that product development carried out in Japan will be shifted elsewhere.“Japan is the most closed, developed auto economy in the world, with all imported brands accounting for less than 6% of Japan’s annual new car market,” Ford spokesman Neal McCarthy told  in an email. He added that the advent of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in its current form will not improve the brand’s ability to compete in Japan.",Anthony Lim

IFTTT waits for “Triggers” to happen and performs the appropriate “Action”. Your BMW will be able to provide both Triggers and Actions to IFTTT.Imagine the possibilities – using your BMW as a Trigger for example, the outside lighting of your home as well as your living room’s air conditioning can be configured switched on automatically when their BMW approaches it, assuming your lights and air conditioning is hooked up to a smart home system that supports IFTTT.Another possibility is for you to set your BMW exceeding a certain speed limit as a Trigger, and get IFTTT to send you an SMS or email as an action, so you’ll know immediately if your child is speeding in your BMW. If you want to add some drama to your life, perhaps get IFTTT to change your Phillips Hue living room lights to red as a warning whenever it happens.Your BMW can also perform Actions for IFTTT – for example, your car’s iDrive can display a notification whenever your Samsung SmartThings motion sensor detects movement.Check out the full list of suggested “Recipes” . Unfortunately it’s not supported in Malaysia at the moment – you’ll have to be in Australia, France, Germany, Spain, UK or the US to use IFTTT with BMW iDrive.",Paul Tan

This is it then, the , which comes all the way from Mazda’s Hiroshima plant (CBU Japan), and which made its launch debut here back in December 2015.Currently, the sole 2.0L variant offered to Malaysians retails for RM131,218 (on-the-road without insurance), a whooping RM13,285 more than the RM117,933 (OTR without insurance) HR-V 1.8L V, though there are murmurs that the model could be , just like the HR-V, which should make its price more competitive.So, it’s late to the party (from overseas), and comes with a price tag that exceeds its closest rival. Certainly doesn’t sound like a promising start, does it? Even so, does the Mazda CX-3 bring something to the table to make it a stand out from the crowd?If you’re talking looks, then yes. Certainly not one to shy away from the camera, or a pair of eyeballs, the CX-3 is quite the looker, especially in this Soul Red Metallic paintjob. If Mazda’s trademark colour isn’t to your liking, you get to choose from  – Crystal White Pearl, Jet Black, Meteor Grey and Deep Crystal Blue. As is the case with current Mazda models, Kodo is word of the day when it comes to the CX-3’s design.At the front, the wide five-point grille receives a chrome frame surround, which extends to the pair of signature headlights. The headlights themselves are slimmer than those found on the 2, and are of the LED variety, as opposed to the halogen reflectors of the 2. They come with an automatic on/off function, adaptive front lighting system that “lights up” a corner while you take it, auto-levelling and LED daytime running lights. Just below the main headlights, you’ll find the LED fog lamp and signal indicators, and below that, a lower matte black trim piece that extends down the sides of the car.The Kodo influence on the CX-3 is also seen on the strong defining body line that traces its way from the front of the hood to above the wheel arches, over the side mirrors (with indicators), and down the sides of the car. This sporty and active outlook is further accompanied by matte black wheel arch trim pieces originating at the front , surrounding the large 18-inch five twin-spoke alloy wheels (fitted with 215/50R18 Toyo Proxes R40 tyres). They are joined by a matte black trim piece with silver accents located near the door sills to the link the front and rear.That’s not all. When viewed from the side, you’ll spot the CX-3’s “floating roof” design, with a blacked out C-pillar to create the illusion, a nice touch. You’ll also spot comparatively smaller side windows that lend a low-profile look to the crossover. In terms of dimensions, the car measures 4,275 mm long, 1,765 mm wide, 1,535 mm tall, with a wheelbase of 2,570 mm. By comparison, the HR-V measures 4,294 mm long, 1,772 mm wide, 1,605 mm tall, with a wheelbase of 2,610 mm. That makes the CX-3 a much smaller car when compared.Moving on to the shapely rear, more LEDs are located within the tail lights, themselves slimmer than those on the 2. The small rear hatch hosts a release button for easy access to the boot, and the reverse camera. The earlier  mentioned matte black plastic trim piece tnow comes full circle here, containing the rear fog lamp/reflector and two chromed exhaust tips.The CX-3 certainly is quite striking, and to my eyes, looks better when compared to the HR-V . It also features enough visual distinctions on the outside to not be called a jumped up . The interior though, speaks a different tone. Step inside, and you’ll think you’ve just entered a 2. This is unlike the HR-V, which  gets a more bespoke interioreven with its origins traced to the Honda Jazz hatchback.The layout in the CX-3 is nigh identical to the 2, from the position of the buttons to the air-con vents, steering wheel, instrument cluster, heads-up display, faux carbon-fibre bits and even the seats. At this point, you may feel a little short changed given the amount you have paid. However, that realisation will come to pass once you start looking a little deeper, and you’ll soon get a grasp of where the premium you’ve paid has gone into.In the driver’s seat, you’ll realise that your body is coming into contact with leather-suede combo upholstery instead of the leather-fabric ones from the 2. The same is said for the other passengers (front, rear) in the car as well. Additionally, small applications of suede are found on the doors as well, along with a gunmetal trim piece near the door handle, akin to that on the Mazda 6.Next, the steering wheel (with paddle shifters) has gained a few additional buttons to control the car’s cruise control function. Other functions gained here are automatic wipers and lights. Meanwhile, the seven-inch coloured MZD Connect touchscreen infotainment unit is unchanged from the 2, along with the same single-zone, three-dial automatic air-con system. Tracing your way down the centre console, which houses the Commander Dial linked to the MZD system, you’ll spot knee bolsters that are made of soft-touch materials wrapped with red leather instead of black ones found in the 2, The same trim piece can be found on the door handles, along with gunmetal door handles from the larger facelifted Mazda 6.Look above and you’ll find a place to stow your sunglasses, and if you’d like to invite some sunlight in, the controls for the sunroof too. The sunroof comes with a one-touch open function, but not the other way round, strangely. It is also something that can’t be found on the Honda HR-V, unless you buy one in Thailand.Under the hood, you’ll find a 2.0 litre SkyActiv-G petrol engine that outputs 154 hp at 6,000 rpm and 204 Nm of torque at 2,800 rpm. Direct injection and Mazda’s i-Stop engine idling stop system are all present here to encourage efficiency. By comparison, the HR-V’s smaller capacity 1.8 litre SOHC i-VTEC engine, churns out 142 hp and 172 Nm.The SkyActiv-G engine is mated to a SkyActiv-Drive six-speed automatic gearbox, sending drive exclusively to the front wheels. Through the drive selector located near the gear selector, the gearbox can engage its Sports mode that holds the gear for a longer period. Alternatively, you can assume control with the manual mode, cycling between gear using the selector or paddle shifters.On the safety side of things, the CX-3’s suite doesn’t leave you wanting, and is pretty comprehensive. Here, you get DSC electronic stability control, traction control and ABS with EBD and BA all standard. The crossover also gets the same number of airbags as the 1.8L HR-V V, six (dual frontal, side and curtain), along with hill launch assist and emergency stop signal are also part of the package. No i-ActivSense suite (Smart City Brake System, Rear View Monitoring, Lane Departure Warning etc.) here, as it may have pushed the price point even higher.Now that you’ve gotten up to speed with the specifications of the Mazda CX-3, it’s now time to answer a few questions. Number one, what’s it like to drive? Number two, what’s it like to live with? And the most important question of all, how does it compare to its rivals, chief among which is the Honda HR-V?Well, Mazda has been hard at work promoting its new campaign, “Be a Driver.” Naturally, the CX-3’s main purpose is to cater to the driver and provide him or her with a good time behind the wheel. This driver-focused approach is very apparent when you sit in the car, with most of the controls placed close by and within easy reach. While this bodes well to lend a “cockpit” feel, it certainly feels like a snug fit.However, there is a lot more headroom here when compared to the 2 (trust me, I own one), so it does feel a little bit roomier from a vertical standpoint. This is due to the increased height of 1,535 mm against the 2’s 1,495 mm (sedan)/1,470 mm (hatchback). As for human cargo, there is adequate headroom at the back for regular-sized adults, although some might be left wanting for legroom, should you have a long-legged driver and passenger up front.The packaging of the CX-3’s interior also doesn’t allow for many everyday items like your SmartTag, access card and keys to be stored in one centralised area due to the limited stowage space because there simply isn’t a large central stowage space that you can just chuck items in, unlike that big hole in the HR-V’s centre console. As a result, you may need to cleverly organise your items in whatever stowage area is available that makes it easy to reach for them if required. One such spot can be found just ahead of the gear shifter. However, should you plug in a USB stick for your songs while using the 12 V/120 W power point to charge up your phone, that space is diminished. Alternatively, you could reassign the cupholders in the centre console for storage duties, with your bottled drinks now being placed at holders located at the door instead.  There is also a small slot just beyond the cupholders, although it is quite a reach to get items from there.At the back, the CX-3’s boot space is rated at 350 litres, which is significantly less than the 437 litres on the HR-V. However, that figure jumps to 1,260 litres when the 60:40 rear split-folding seats are folded flat, exceeding the HR-V’s 1,032 litres. Although it boasts a larger volume, even with its smaller dimensions, the CX-3 still loses out the practicality contest against the HR-V thanks to its rival’s Magic Seats and various configurations. Where the Magic Seats can be folded down or up easily, the CX-3’s seats will only fold down, so if you’re thinking of transporting potted plants in it, make sure  they’re short ones. On the plus side, the boot lip is positioned nicely to allow for bulky items to enter and exit the car without excessive straining required. Also, the boot is lined with nifty coil mats that are easy to keep clean, a nice touch.So, practicality isn’t the CX-3’s strongest suit. However, it makes up for it with impressive driving dynamics. Although the 2.0 litre SkyActiv-G engine is nearly as powerful as the one found in the larger CX-5, it propels less heft, with a kerb weight of just 1,211 kg. Off the line starts may be a little sluggish but once it get going though, the crossover is certainly pretty brisk. Power delivery is smooth and the engine does deliver a pretty exciting exhaust note as well if you really floor it. The SkyActiv-Drive six-speed ‘box responds works well when left to its own devices for the daily city run, though it is a little sluggish in the lower gears, with more favour being placed in the higher, fuel-saving ratios. To overcome this, you can engage the car’s Sport mode, which makes the transmission hold onto a gear longer, and shifting down quicker at the slightest provocation of the accelerator pedal. However, it is certainly not something you’d use on the daily drive, as it is quite aggressive.Paddle shifters are also at your disposal, allowing for temporary override of gear selection in auto mode, or total override in manual mode. The car however, will step in if it feels that your control of the transmission isn’t in sync with you the vehicle’s speed.  If for instance you’re cruising in sixth gear and suddenly decide to depress the accelerator completely, the car will downshift a few gears on its own without requiring your input. It does the same as you’re approaching a stop and forget to downshift.Through the corners, the MacPherson struts (front) and torsion beam (rear) suspension setup on the CX-3 is very competent to keep the crossover planted through the bends. Turn-ins are sharp with minimal body roll, and even though the steering is electrically assisted, it isn’t devoid of feel. As you hit the raggedy edge though, the car does exhibit some mild understeer. However, I doubt you’d want to hit the limit all the time, nor do I think it is a necessity for a good time behind the wheel.Simply put, you don’t have to go absurdly fast to enjoy the car. I suppose this is what Mazda’s “Be a driver” campaign is all about. In essence, it allows anyone to jump into a Mazda, and drive up to the best of their abilities, with the car ensuring that they have a good time and a smile on their face, regardless if they’re taking a corner at 60 km/h or more. It certainly is something that needs to be tried to be believed in all Mazda cars.However, not everyone is going to go on a drive along Malaysia’s B-roads daily. More confined to city driving duties, the car has pretty good visibility, in spite of the small windows. Blind spots are easily within sight, and the side mirrors are certainly much larger than that on the 2 as well. As it the case with other cars, the CX-3 also needs to cope with the daily occurrences on Malaysian roads, where hitting a bumpy patch of road is nearly as common as traffic.While the suspension might be geared towards supplying driving fun, it does tend to feel a tad firm as a result. It isn’t bone-breaking uncomfortable though, as the CX-3 does stay pretty compliant to dampen effects of road irregularities, maybe slightly better than the HR-V, which shares the same suspension setup. I do get the feeling that maybe, with slightly smaller alloy wheels and thicker rubbers, it will help soften the ride further, although when they look that good…I think I can compromise.On a day-to-day basis, the CX-3 does come equipped with some nice features that makes driving more convenient. The LED headlights provide excellent illumination and helps to light up a corner as you turn in, and there is a automatic function for the lights and wipers as well. The heads-up display fitted means you don’t have to peer down at the instrument cluster to see you current speed. Its functionality is also linked to the cruise control function, and if you have the RM1,270 option navigation SD card installed, will display turn-by-turn instructions as well. There are some features that I would have liked to have seen on the CX-3. Unlike the HR-V, there isn’t an automatic brake hold function in the CX-3, so you’re going to have to do the “put in N, pull handbrake” routine at long stops at the traffic lights. Also, an auto-dimming rearview mirror would be helpful for night-time driving, especially when you have a car behind you that’s been illegally fitted with lights that are as bright as the sun itself.For those concerned about how thirsty the CX-3 is, throughout my time with the car, I managed an average combined (city and highway) fuel economy rating of about seven litres per 100 km, according to the trip computer at the time. However, frequent highway travellers can find that number being reduced by a significant amount, if you’re careful with your accelerator. In summary, the Mazda CX-3 is a great crossover. It certainly pushes nearly all the right buttons – it’s a spritely and eager city car, with striking good looks and an interior that looks reserved for cars further up the price range, a capable powertrain and driving dynamics that embodies the “Be a driver” philosophy. However, its questionable practicality and a price tag that is beyond that of its rivals may put off buyers in the market for a crossover.However, Mazda buyers have never been one to be put off by Bermaz’s pricing game (just look at the number of Mazda 2s on the roads now). Nor are they put off by the “lack of space”, according to some. For them, they value the other things (driving experience, looks, materials) beyond just practicality. And if that comes at a premium, so be it.Then again, what about those who aren’t returning Mazda buyers, namely the newcomers? Well, it depends on your priorities. I will not say outright that the CX-3 is better than the HR-V or vice versa. Both crossovers have their strong points and each has a comprehensive kit list of their own, along with their fair share of shortcomings. Personally, if you’re looking for an engaging drive with arresting looks (inside and out) that puts a smile on your face, the CX-3 is no doubt the car to pick. But if you want an affordable, practical, handsome-looking family hauler that gets you from A to B, the HR-V is the one to have.",Gerard Lye
2016-01-22,Volvo pledges zero fatalities in all its cars by 2020,"It may be quite a gamble, but it’s one that Volvo has pledged to achieve nonetheless. According to a report by , Volvo has made a promise, declaring that by 2020, there will zero fatalities or serious injuries in all Volvo cars, including its SUVs.In the same report, it highlights that to live up to this promise, the brand will employ three steps. The first, to make vehicles as safe as possible in the event of a crash. Step two, to add in more safety tech than one can even imagine. A few of these technologies include adaptive cruise control, auto lane keeping assist, collision avoidance, as well as pedestrian,  and sign detection. The final step involves , a car that can completely drive itself. “If you meet Swedish engineers, they’re pretty genuine. They don’t say things when they don’t believe in it,” said Lex Kerssemakers, CEO of Volvo Cars North America. Interestingly, Volvo is reportedly monitoring and keeping track of the number of fatalities that involve Volvo vehicles. Reason behind this is so that engineers can gauge how much safer their vehicles have become, each time a new crash-prevention technology has been rolled out. In addition to that, it also helps the company predict how much safer its cars can become with every single piece of safety tech development.“With the development of full autonomy we are going to push the limits of automotive safety,” said Erik Coelingh, a safety engineer at Volvo. “Because if you make a fully autonomous vehicle you have to think through everything that potentially can happen with a car,” he added. Previously, Hakan Samuelsson, Volvo CEO noted that the Swedish brand remains . “Safety is going to come back into the focus, especially with autonomous drive. Safety will be a very exciting area to be within and we will do that,” he said. It’s not too farfetched seeing as how things are turning out; the  scored 100% for safety assist technologies and 97% for adult occupant protection, achieving the , as revealed by Euro NCAP.

2016-01-22,Tesla Model S 85 manages KL-Kedah on single charge,"An update on  (GreenTech Malaysia) . The company took one of its s on a road trip up north to Kedah last week – the journey, from its office in Bangi up to Kulim, was made on a single charge, as was the return leg, GreenTech Malaysia CEO Ahmad Hadri Haris told .The journey began just after 5 am on January 13, when the Midnight Silver S 85 (the same car as , the other being a ) departed the Greentech office in Bangi on a full charge, the battery capacity reading 491 km of range. Travelling on the PLUS (E1), the car ran according to speed limits utilising its traffic-aware cruise control function, which slows and accelerates the car according to traffic conditions.By 8.30, the car reached Sg Perak R&R, where the battery range capacity indicated 212 km. Just before 11 am, the S 85 arrived at the First Solar factory in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, having travelled a distance of 383 km, with the battery capacity indicating 53 km of range still available.A quick aside on First Solar, which is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film solar panels – the company has a manufacturing facility in Kulim Hi-Tech park, employing a workforce of 4,000, all Malaysians. The Tesla Home Charger was temporarily installed at First Solar to recharge the Model S, the power being derived from solar energy provided by the company, which translated to zero cost, Hadri said. Delivering 32A at 240 volts single-phase, which was able to recharge the car’s battery at a rate of at 41 kWh, the full charge was completed at around 10 pm, with 494 km range available.On January 14, following demo ride sessions at First Solar, the car made its way to Penang, where it was recharged overnight using a three-pin socket (13A, 240V), giving a 10 kWh charging rate. The next day, the S 85 made its way from Penang to Serdang, Kedah, where Kedah Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir launched a 12 kW solar PV system by First Solar at a mosque. He later viewed the S 85 and test drove the car for a while.The vehicle was then recharged overnight at First Solar, again using the temporarily installed Tesla home charger, to achieve a 497 km range capacity. The journey back to KL on January 16 saw 390 km of travel, and by the time the Tesla rolled back into the GreenTech office, the readout stated an available range of 18 km left, having consumed power from the battery at a 187 Wh/km average.The drive, Hadri said, covered a total distance of 1,267 km at virtually no cost, the car having being recharged twice via the Tesla home charger with electricity from solar energy, and once with a three-pin socket with grid electricity from TNB. More importantly, it showed the ability of the S 85 to provide tangible long range usability, in the process also putting to rest the range anxiety associated with EVs.Read our  for a more complete view of the car.",Anthony Lim
2016-01-22,Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) fault free run tests begin today on phase two of the extended Ampang LRT Line,"The six-car Light Rail Vehicles (LRV) will begin its fault free run (FFR) tests today on a new track of the extended , between Kinrara BK5 and Bandar Puteri stations,  reports. The FFR tests are being conducted as preparation for its opening, scheduled at the end of March. The tests will be carried out under the watch of the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD).According to Datuk Zohari Sulaiman, CEO of Prasarana Rail and Infrastructure Projects (Praise), the FFR test is a comprehensive one that could stretch up to 24 hours. “We will take all adequate measures to minimise any discomfort and inconvenience to the residents,” he said, adding that it is an endurance test that LRVs have to undergo to certify and qualify them as fit for operation. The FFR test run will go through IOI Puchong Jaya, Pusat Bandar Puchong and Taman Perindustrian Puchong stations before it makes way to the Bandar Puteri station and onward to the pocket track where it will perform a U-turn. Said stations constitutes as the second phase of the Ampang Line, expected to open by March 31, stretching up to Putra Heights.“Under the test, the trains would need to reach 1,500 km without any major failure on the light rail vehicles system such as train signalling, propulsion, braking, door. If any major fault were to occur, miles of the tested light rail vehicles will be reset to zero,” Zohari explained. Nine six-car LRVs (called Amys) had completed the tests, including seven others that are now in operation.A total of 50 of the six-car train sets have been acquired by Prasarana from CSR Zhuhou Electric Locomotive Company (ZELC). Twenty sets will be for the Ampang LRT Extension Project (LRP), while the other 30 sets are to replace the current fleet of six-car trains that have been in operation since 1998. Prasarana have received already received 24 sets since.",Graham Chin

2016-01-22,"Brabus tunes the Merc C450 AMG to 410 hp/570 Nm, and confirms the Mercedes-AMG C43 badge?","Brabus, the German tuner with a passion for Mercedes-Benz models, has revealed its latest upgrades for the . By fitting on its plug-and-play PowerXtra B30-410 tuning module, the car now delivers 410 hp ad 570 Nm of torque.Interestingly, if you haven’t caught it already, Brabus specifically mentioned the Mercedes-AMG C 43 model. It also lists the C 450 AMG Sport alongside this, but its decision to mention the C 43 is a little bit suspicious.Only recently, we speculated that  for cars like the C 450 and , opting instead to position them more closely to their range-topping AMG 63 cousins. This would mean that the C 450 we know now would be renamed as the Mercedes-AMG C 43. Likewise, the GLE 450 would become the AMG GLE 43.Could Brabus’ doing be just a coincidence? Or is it cheekily revealing a little bit more than Mercedes-Benz would like it to right now? Your guess is as good as ours.Moving along, the Brabus tuning package does introduce an extra 43 hp and 50 Nm of torque to the C 450’s original 367 hp and 520 Nm. As mentioned, this amounts to a total of 410 hp at 6,100 rpm and 570 Nm of torque at 3,700 rpm. The 7G-Tronic seven-speed torque converter auto transmission is maintained.On the outside, the Brabus C 450, or C 43, if you will, gets a set of tailor-made monoblock 19-inch five-spoke alloy wheels, a new front spoiler and a rear diffuser. Additionally, Brabus recommends that buyers also specify the naked-carbon rear spoiler and the electronically-controlled quad-tip sport exhaust system.The interior is highly customisable, according to Brabus. It lists custom accessories such as aluminium foot pedals and high-quality floor mats and scuff plates with a backlit Brabus logo.

2016-01-22,"Proton-badged Suzuki Ertiga MPV rendered, 3 versions","Now that  that there will be a Proton-badged Suzuki Ertiga, we commissioned rendering whiz Theophilus Chin to come up with renderings of the “Proton Ertiga”. The tiger-badged MPV won’t be called Ertiga, of course, and there’s a chance of Proton giving the donor car a different face, so this serves as merely an idea of what to expect. Theo delivered three sets with Proton badges – one of the  that surfaced in 2012, one based on  that debut at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show (GIIAS) 2015 show in August 2015, and another of the range topping  (below left), which has a completely different (and rather bizarre) face from the standard car. Also included is a pic of the Ertiga’s  with Proton’s emblem on the steering boss. What do you think? Should the national car company just keep it simple as seen here, or should a “more Proton face” be used?  The confirmation of the Ertiga as a fruit of Proton’s collaboration with Suzuki . News reports from the republic quoted local Suzuki arm PT Suzuki Indomobil Sales (SIS) saying that the Ertiga will be exported to Malaysia in knocked down form, from the second quarter of 2016.SIS will export 1,500 units of the Ertiga to Proton per month, which translates to a significant 18,000 units per year. Production of the knocked down kits headed for Malaysia will start at SIS’ factory in Cikarang from May this year. Proton had previously announced that the first Proton-Suzuki joint model will . Presently, Suzuki exports the Ertiga from Indonesia to various Asean countries such as the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Brunei in CBU form. However, exports to the four markets are at the rate of 400 units per month combined, which pales in comparison to the Proton deal. Suzuki also produces the , a rebadged Ertiga, for the Indonesian market. The Suzuki Ertiga is a three-row, seven-seater MPV that shares a platform with the  and SX4.

2016-01-22,"PLUS uses anti-skid pavement, improves corner safety","In a continous effort to improve safety on its highways, the North-South Highway Project (PLUS), today held a media briefing at the Kajang interchange on the anti-skid pavement it has applied in certain areas. Mohammad Fuad Khusairi, chief operating officer of PLUS, said, “we have applied the technology at 10 accident hotspots since 2010 such as the slip roads at Rawang, Bangi, Kajang, Bertam, Ayer Hitam, Yong Peng and others.”According to Fuad, the application of the pavement has helped reduce accidents in those critical areas by 50%. PLUS has spent RM5.5 million thus far on applying the anti-skid pavement. The pavement increases friction between the pavement and tyre, increasing tyre grip and reduces skidding at bends and corners.The anti-skid pavement comprises of a layer of anti-skid aggregate that is applied on top of the existing road surface. A layer of resin and silicon carbide is then applied on top of the aggregate to seal it in. Fuad said the coating will last approximately five years before reapplication is required.The coating is applied overnight, and takes three to four hours to dry before the highway is re-opened to traffic. Fuad said oil spillage from accidents will damage the coating, requiring reapplication.“Although the coating appears as if it is slippery and oily, it actually increases grip and prevents vehicles from skidding,” said Fuad. In the briefing, Fuad explained that normal roads, without the coating, have a skid resistance value (SRV) of 45. This is increased to above 65 SRV after application of the anti-skid pavement.The anti-skid pavement originates from Germany, and is widely used in applications such as bridges and airport runways. “PLUS would like to remind highway users that although the anti-skid pavement has a positive impact on highway safety, users should adhere to the speed limits at slip roads. Users are also reminded to ensure their tyres are in good condition at all times,” said Fuad.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-22,2016 Toyota Fortuner debuts in Indonesia – RM139k,"The new  SUV has . The second-generation Hilux-based seven-seater SUV, which has been redesigned for a sleeker look, a more premium interior and a new range of engines has been confirmed to have a starting price of 422 million rupiah (RM139k).A total of six variants have been made available for the , with prices ranging from 422 million rupiah (RM139k) for the 2.4 G 4×2 manual variant, leading all the way up to 631.5 million rupiah (RM199k) for the top-spec 2.4 VRZ 4×4 automatic.Five of the six available variants will feature Toyota’s new 149 PS/400 Nm 2.4 litre 2GD-FTV turbo diesel engines. On the other hand, just one variant of the six will get the brand’s new 163 PS/242 Nm 2.7 litre four-cylinder Dual-VVTi petrol engine.Only the base Fortuner variant gets the six-speed manual transmission with rev-matching technology. The remaining five all offer six-speed torque converter autos with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. Four variants here are equipped with rear-wheel drive configurations, leaving just the two top-spec 2.4 VRZ and 2.4 G with four-wheel drive systems.On the outside, the lower-spec 2.4 G 4×2, for example, settles for basic items such as front projector headlamps with halogen bulbs and 17-inch alloy wheels, but still benefit from electric folding wing mirrors with LED turn signals, a rear spoiler and a shark fin antenna.The higher-spec variants, such as the 2.4 VRZ 4×4 get LED headlamps with daytime running lights, larger 18-inch alloy wheels and even a powered rear liftgate with a memory function.Inside, lesser variants get brown fabric upholstery, but still have a reverse camera and a multifunction steering wheel with audio, telephone and voice control buttons. At the upper end of the spectrum, variants like the 2.4 VRZ 4×4 enjoy the additional dark brown leather upholstery, Easy 4×4 Switch, a 4WD Indicator, engine start/stop button and more.The VRZ and SRZ variants also get an entertainment system equipped with navigation. The central display screen offers Air Gesture control, a web browser, smartphone and HDMI connectivity and voice command controls. The two variants also get a rear-seat entertainment system in the form of a roof-mounted screen.Safety-wise, the four 4×2 variants get ABS and EBD braking systems and Isofix child seat anchors. The top-spec 2.4 VRZ 4×4 is the only variant here with the full suite of safety options. This includes Vehicle Stability Control, Hill-Assist Control, Emergency Brake Signal, A-TRC anti wheel-slip control and Brake Assist. Additionally, the top-spec Fortuner gets dual front, side, knee and curtain airbags for a total count of seven. The rest settle for just the dual front airbags.",Chris Aaron
2016-01-22,VIDEO: Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza teaser bares it all,"Barely any time between the company’s first teaser image of its new  and now, a very revealing video of the coming model was loaded on its official Youtube page. Bar any previous spyshots, this has to be the best look at the new B-segment SUV we’ve had yet.Set to debut at the 2016 Auto Expo in India, the Maruti Suzuki SUV was only recently teased via a design sketch. Earlier today, the company revealed just one tightly-cropped image of the coming Indian-market vehicle, but this new video has a lot more to show us.With this, the front end of the Brezza has fully been uncovered now, featuring a prominent chrome grille running across the central Suzuki “S” badge. Projector lamps are also clearly visible, underlined by LED daytime running lights.The full face of the Brezza doesn’t come into view here, but it does appear to have a very muscular front bumper with integrated fog lamps. Several other details make brief appearances in the 16-second clip, such as the five, dual-spoke alloy wheels and wing mirrors with turn indicators.There’s also a view of the car’s side profile, but only as it is covered by a cloth. The short promotional clip doesn’t reveal much else, but concludes by affirming the model’s imminent Indian debut.Inside, several reports suggest that the compact SUV will feature a cabin similar to the current Maruti Suzuki Swift. It has also been tipped to feature key items such as dual airbags, ABS, and EBD, as well as a few other highlights. A touchscreen infotainment system, keyless entry with a push-start button and a multi-function steering have been named before.Local reports from India claim that the Brezza will offer several powertrain options, too. These include a 1.2 litre K-Series petrol engine and a Fiat-sourced DDiS 1.3 litre diesel mill. Transmission options may range from a five-speed manual to a CVT auto box.Prior to this, we’ve reported that the Vitara Brezza has been independently designed and developed by Maruti’s very own research and development team. However, the model’s name is derived from the Italian word for “breeze.” And, while the model features the Vitara nameplate, it is clearly a very different being from its larger SUV cousin.The sub-four-metre SUV will contend against the likes of the Ford EcoSport and Mahindra TUV 300 for India’s affection. It is also said that it will be revealed alongside the Maruti Ignis and Baleno RS Concept at the coming Indian auto show.",Chris Aaron

2016-01-21,DRIVEN: 2016 Audi Q7 3.0 TFSI quattro in Malaysia,"official arrival into the country could not be more marked than with the launch of its flag-bearing SUV, the Audi Q7. Since the  at the end of 2014 to take over the reins from former franchise-holder, Euromobil, we’ve seen it  and  here, as well as introduce the country’s first official S model, the .The local transition took place around the same time Audi AG was busy marking a rather significant milestone for itself — globally unveiling the . And, with the first-gen SUV serving a full 10 years as a highly-capable people mover, the new one undoubtedly had some big shoes to fill for the start.At a glance, the new Q7 is pinned on a new platform, has shed 325 kg and has been treated to the Ingolstadt-based car maker’s latest and greatest tech. It was also given a gleaming makeover, which as you can tell, features a far more chiseled look than its All seemed well on paper for Audi Malaysia, and so it . A fine prospect, and competitively priced, it was — the ageing first-gen Volvo XC90 was a dying threat, and the comparable  price tag and appeal was as good as matched, pound for pound.That was until the second-gen, top-spec , and wailed its tax-exempted RM453,888 price tag about, spoiling things a bit for the segment.But given all that we know about the revolutionary Q7, we’re certain that it still deserves a fair bit of your consideration whilst shopping for a premium SUV. To clarify, the  does put in a reasonable bid for your attention, but do note that it is only available as five-seater, and unlike the new generation Q7, X5 and XC90, , which is a few years old now.The all-new Q7 is underpinned by the brand’s latest MLB-Evo platform and featuring a significantly higher amount of high-strength steel that forms its body, the Q7 doesn’t only offer a more protective cocoon, it is also now the lightest model in its class, at 2,030 kg.With a smaller wheelbase (12 mm) than its predecessor, overall, the Q7 is also shorter (37 mm) and narrower (15 mm) than before. It measures 5,052 mm long, 1,968 mm wide and 1,740 mm tall. Even still, its sheer size in-the-metal doesn’t appear to have been reduced in any capacity – the large SUV maintains its commanding presence on the road.A quick recap of what’s on offer reminds us that the base price includes key exterior items like full LED headlamps and tail lights, as well as 20-inch, 10-spoke wheels. But being that our test unit was equipped with the full S line kit, the front and rear bumpers have been swapped out for more aggressive ones, while a sportier-looking set of 20-inch, twin five-spoke wheels are featured instead.Inside, the additional S line package adds leather/Alcantara sports seats with S badging on the backrests (regular leather seats are standard), perforated leather S line gear knob, S line steering wheel and a black headliner. Remember, all in with the optional RM13k S line package, the Q7 you see here is priced at RM602,900.As first impressions go, there’s no questioning the Q7’s handsome appeal, inside and out. The chiseled body is far more appealing than the previous model’s curves, to this writer at least. Call it over the top, but I’m also a fan of the new Singleframe grille with its jagged horizontal bars and bold chrome surrounds.Inside the cabin, you’ll come across nothing short of properly impressive Audi craftsmanship. The brand’s meticulous efforts toward quality is one thing, but the classy execution of those efforts makes this new Q7 more special.Every inch of the cabin, from its brushed aluminium trim to soft-touch surfaces and unique Audi-esque button “clicks” set segment benchmarks. The only setback is the lack of a leather-covered dashboard. The layout of it all is also a vast improvement on the previous model, which didn’t slack on quality, just ergonomics, we feel.The dashboard and centre console isn’t cluttered and is far more intuitive to use. For example, previous right-hand drive Audis had their engine push-start button . In the new Q7, designers addressed this inconvenience by positioning the button in a more conventional location, behind the steering wheel.Even the new MMI navigation plus infotainment system and its controls address old bugs. The outgoing interface’s four-corner logic that is still featured on current models like the A6 has been replaced by a new two-corner system, which makes it far easier to navigate. However, this writer maintains that the BMW iDrive system is still unrivalled.While I don’t personally take to in-car navigation systems, the MMI touch pad and integrated Google Maps changed that for me, personally. Spelling out addresses hasn’t been easier than with the large touch pad available on the centre console and Google Maps is as accurate a tool to use as anything out there.Maps and several other infotainment and vehicle control systems are displayed within the 8.3-inch rising central display screen, and also on the . And, if we haven’t said it enough already, the 12.3-inch instrument panel is a remarkably convenient.The Virtual Cockpit screen lets you customise views to suit your needs, so you can easily call upon a primary view of the navigation while the instruments are visible on a lesser scale. Likewise, you could swap displays around to suit your needs, ranging from those of your music folders to trip data and more.Clearly, the  undertakes a completely , eliminating all but eight physical buttons on the dash and relying on a tablet-like screen to do the rest. We wouldn’t attempt to say that one approach is better than the other, but if tangible buttons are what you’re after, it doesn’t get better than it is in the Q7 — style, ergonomics and quality considered.Great at looking the part, the Q7 does shed a few points with this writer where space is concerned. The driver’s seat felt a bit tight for this six foot tall driver – both my knees brushed up against the centre console and door card. As for the rear bench, reclining it further than its normal position increased comfort – a feature of the second-row seats that taller folk will appreciate. That said, the seats themselves do offer good cushion support in the Q7, anywhere you sit.Audi could learn a trick or two from the , where the slim seats freed up up a load of legroom and the centre console and door cards are shaped to avoid contact with your knees.Another observation in the Q7 was that the driver’s seat couldn’t be lowered enough for me to find a seating level I liked. Likewise, the steering couldn’t rise high enough. To be honest, I do find it very strange that a large German SUV wouldn’t be able to accommodate my size, given the average height of the average European person. Your mileage may very with this as everyone is built differently, so give the Q7 a try at the showroom to see if it suits your physique. Moving along, and apart from the amazing tech and quality, where the Q7’s cabin impressed me the most is with its flexibility to accommodate passengers and/or cargo. You get full electric control over the third-row seats via control panels positioned in the boot and one on each side of the middle row seats.The middle row seats are a 40:20:40 split folding type bench which can slide fore and aft to vary legroom between the middle and third row, while the third row has a 50:50 split. Both seat backs are adjustable to multiple angles for you to cater to the amount of passengers or cargo you have.Access to the rear-most seats isn’t the easiest. Once you’re in, you’ll quickly notice that the space wasn’t made to accommodate full-size adults comfortably – a 30-minute journey would easily become a gruesome affair for someone like me. Getting out of the third row is a challenge on its own.All five seats from the second and third rows offer Isofix child-seat anchor points, which allows parents to be very flexible in where they want to install their child seats. However, given the limited space in the third row, don’t get your hopes up on fitting larger rear facing child seats there.With all seven seats occupied, 295 litres of usable cargo space is available. Set in its five-seater mode, there’s 770 litres to use, while a total of 1,955 litres can be had if you sacrificed the middle-row seats as well.Back to the driver’s seat, and we can tell you that the driving position is far more car-like than it is an SUV. High seating is a given, but your legs are stretched further forward as they would be if you were driving a sedan.Visibility from the driver’s seat is surprisingly good as well, and keeps the sensory intimidation of driving a large SUV at a minimum. For more accurate, low-speed manoeuvring around tight spaces, in a parking lot, for instance, there is a 360-degree surround-view camera with helpful guidelines that boost confidence. For power, the Q7 is only available with a 3.0 litre TFSI supercharged V6 mill. Rated for 333 hp at 5,500 rpm and 440 Nm of torque between 2,900 and 5,300 rpm, there’s more than enough power on tap here to motivate the two-tonne SUV. Audi claims that the powertrain makes the Q7 capable of a 6.3-second zero to 100 km/h sprint.Comparatively, the Q7 3.0 TFSI is 1.6 seconds quicker than its relative predecessor. Looking across the table, it’s also quicker than the comparable BMW X5 xDrive35i which manages the century sprint in 6.5 seconds. On paper, however, the hybrid-powered XC90 comes out tops, performing the dash in just 5.6 seconds – a testament to its 407 hp and 640 Nm.Even still, this writer felt little need for more power in the Q7. It’s got acres of the stuff across the rev range, and the seamless-shifting, ZF-sourced, eight-speed torque converter auto transmission keeps the power coming nicely all the way up to speed.The Q7 is equipped with a four-corner, adaptive air suspension system as standard. As a result, general ride comfort is adaptable to your needs. The Audi Drive Select system provides seven driving modes here, being Auto, Comfort, Dynamic, Efficiency, Allroad (25 mm ride height lift), Lift/offroad (60 mm max ride height) and a customisable Individual option.In Comfort mode, the SUV’s ride is surprisingly floaty. It doesn’t take much for the body to pitch left and right under cornering forces or be unsettled by typically uneven Malaysian roads.When you do find a smooth section of road to brave the Q7’s acclaimed handling, you’ll find that even in Sport mode there’s a certain softness to the way the Q7 goes about its thing. You feel the chassis stiffen and level out beneath you as you dive into a corner with pace, but its body still floats awkwardly, unsettling your confidence.Generally, the Q7 is best used to cruise, but we know all too well about the car’s off-road capabilities, thanks to its quattro all-wheel drive system and barrage of all-terrain technologies. Although, without Audi Malaysia’s supervision, I wasn’t quite willing to put the Q7 through its off-road paces given that our test unit was actually worth a lot more than the house I live in.All things considered though, it’s actually quite difficult to single out the Q7 as a something you should pass on. If you have demands for comfort yet sporty driving, and at the same time functional practicality and general good looks, the Q7 does score a lot of points in my book, save for an excessively floaty ride and cramped third-row seating.Its price is negligibly higher than the comparable BMW X5 xDrive35i’s RM579,800. But then, of course, you have the market-breaking Volvo XC90, which is RM136k cheaper than the Q7. Even still, opt for the Q7 and its immaculately-built interior, and at least this writer, and many others, would perfectly understand why the Audi would be your choice.",Chris Aaron

2016-01-22,Shelby Terlingua Racing Team Mustang sports 750 hp,"Shelby American has announced a new special edition Terlingua Racing Team Mustang, based on the . It’s a tribute to the Terlingua Racing Team (TRT) of the 60s, headed by Carroll Shelby and Bill Neale. Only 50 models will be made, and it carries with it a price tag of USD$65,999 (RM287,150).Outside, it’s fitted with a new grille with mesh inserts and Terlingua Racing Team badges. Moreover, it’s decked with carbon-fibre parts, including a front splitter, side skirts and a rear spoiler. As the introduction of the Terlingua Mustang has been rather discreet, from the looks of it, there’s a carbon-fibre bonnet added into the mix as well.Down the back, the limited edition muscle car gets a Borla exhaust system with black tips. The car sits on 20-inch Weld Racing wheels, while a Brembo Big Brake kit provides stopping power. Handling is enhanced by adjustable coilers and an exclusive Shelby by Eibach sway bar.  Power-wise, as this is the Mustang GT, underneath the hood is a 5.0 litre V8 engine. However this guy here is fitted with a Whipple supercharger. The combination allows the Terlingua Mustang to churn out over 750 hp, which is obviously way more power than the 435 hp in the standard Mustang GT. Other notable features include axle shafts and a short-throw shifter from Ford Performance. To complete it, the Mustang also receives a specially autographed plaque with signatures from Carroll Shelby, Bill Neale (one of TRT’s founders and designer of the team’s insignia) and 1967 Trans Am Champion driver, Jerry Titus.",Graham Chin

2016-01-21,2016 Ducati Scrambler Italia Independent unveiled,"Ducati has teamed up with eyeglass designer Italia Independent to launch the Scrambler Italia Independent. Limited to a production run of 1,170 units worldwide, this design collaboration was first shown at the contemporary art exhibition “Art Basel” at the Setai Hotel, Miami, Florida late last year.Taking Ducati’s interpretation of its retro, 70s-inspired Scrambler, the bike has been given a special matte-black finish with “Night Copper” accents. The heart of the machine is still the 803 cc Desmodromic V-twin, descended from the 796 cc Monster engine.Rated at 75 hp and 68 Nm of torque, the engine suits the laid-back nature of the Scrambler Italia Independent, where image is possibly more important that performance. The V-twin mill is coated black and accented with machined cooling fins, while the all-black exhaust pipes terminate in a pair of Termignonis.Each 2016 Ducati Scrambler Italia Independent comes with a laser-etched plate carrying each bike’s edition number. Other add-ons are the copper-coloured trellis frame and wheels along with a ‘shorty’ front mud-guard and diminutive nose fairing.There are also five models of eye-wear from Italia Independent that are inspired by the motorcycle. The Ducati Scrambler Italia Independent edition retails for approximately 9,377 pounds sterling (RM58,253) in the UK.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-21,SPYSHOTS: Next-gen BMW X5 out testing on ice,"and then , it looks like the  already has its successor being prepared to take its place. The fourth-gen BMW X5 Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) has recently been spied testing on icy grounds.However, reports do suggest that we’re still a long way away from the model’s reveal, which is said only to be in 2018. Between then and now, a facelift of the current X5 is expected as well. So yes, the current model is still top dog, for now.As such, the test mule here is very heavily camouflaged. We also doubt that anything visible through the camo is reflective of the production model itself. The prototype may feature tech, chassis and body components of the new X5, but we reckon they’re all very well tucked away from open view.That said, we can still make several observations about the prototype here. For one, it has got a much flatter hood design than the current version’s contoured look. The front grille does appear to have grown larger as well, and it appears that this mule is a little bit smaller, overall, than the current-gen X5.The front and rear lighting are clearly exclusive to this test mule – so too are the roof-mounted lights, of course. Based on current BMW design trends, sharper, horizontally-shaped  LED lighting for the front and rear are almost a given.Other expectations for the next-generation X5 are for it to include carbon-fibre reinforced plastic components that will form a lighter, more rigid body – similar to that one the . Tech wise, the next-gen SAV should also learn several tricks from the flagship limousine, too.It’s still very early days for the fourth-gen BMW X5, making it very hard to pin down further specific details just yet. You could say, for now, that it will be largely influenced by the , from a technological and design perspective, at least. But beyond that, we’ll have to wait a while longer for more details to surface.",Chris Aaron

2016-01-21,Volkswagen reorganises its vehicle development process to avoid major scandals like Dieselgate,"German automaker Volkswagen has announced a significant change in the organisation of vehicle development. Previously, responsibilities for technology, quality, cost, deadline compliance and cost-effectiveness were distributed across various divisions and differentiated into individual models groups. The change will effectively see these responsibilities “lay in one hand.”“We have to ensure that the corporate responsibility for each vehicle project is clearly assigned. We expect these changes to yield an acceleration boost in development,” explained Dr. Herbert Diess, CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars. He also added that the teams will allow for the creation of a “robust product portfolio fit for the future.”“This step represents a core element of ‘New Volkswagen,’ the new strategic direction of our brand,” said Diess, who is also chairman of the board of management. In addition to that, the move will also see cross-functional collaboration strengthened as well. From the concept to the end of life-cycle for any model, responsibilities will be tasked to four series groups.In charge of the small vehicles group, which comprises of vehicles such as the ,  and sedan cars as well as  in the future, will be Klaus-Gerhard Wolpert. Wolpert has led product management for the Volkswagen brand and group since 2010.Secondly, compact, which is also known as the “-class group,” includes hatchback, notchback sedans, estate cars and SUVs. This team will be headed by Karlheinz Hell, who was group purchasing manager for electrics/ electronics at Volkswagen since 2014.Thirdly, is the mid- and full-size group. This will include vehicles like the  to the  and future mid-size SUVs to the . This group will be led by Dr. Elmar-Marius Licharz, who was in charge of product controlling at Volkswagen AG since 2014.The fourth group, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), includes the ,  and all other electric vehicles including the  showcased at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. This team will be headed by Christian Senger who was previously from Continental AG, overseeing the automotive systems and technology division.Another newly-formed strategy and products division, will act as a partner to support each manager in the four series groups. This division’s responsibilities include the definition of life-cycles and coordination of major product events. While not stated outright, the new group structure is quite likely due to the recent events that have been troubling the German brand.

2016-01-21,"MAA releases 2015 Total Industry Volume (TIV) sales figures for Malaysia – 666,674 units is the highest ever","The Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA) has released the official total industry volume (TIV) figures for 2015, and it appears that despite last year being a challenging one for the Malaysian car industry, it has managed to match and slightly surpass 2014 figures. The total of 666,674 units sold in 2015 is 0.03% higher than 2014’s 666,487 units, and is the highest TIV ever in Malaysian history. “In spite of the various issues and challenges, and in contrast to the expectation expressed by some analysts, the local automotive industry remained resilient and had performed relatively well in the year under review,” MAA said in a statement. The matching of 2014 figures was due to a late surge. Sales volume in December 2015 was 23.7% or 13,309 units higher than the previous month (November 2015), and was by far the highest monthly total in 2015. According to MAA, the strong December performance was attributed to aggressive promotional campaigns by industry players which had their financial year ending December 31. Of course, it was also in conjunction with the Christmas and New Year festive season where retailers provide incentives to achieve their annual sales target.Another unique factor was that consumers were buying forward in anticipation of higher car prices in 2016.

2016-01-21,VIDEO: 2016 Kawasaki ZX-10R unveiling in Barcelona,"The 2016 Kawasaki ZX-10R was unveiled in Barcelona, Spain, in October last year, and Kawasaki has released a video of the bike’s unveiling along with feedback from its World Superbike championship (WSBK) riders and engineers. The 2016 ZX-10R incorporates more racing superbike technology than the previous model, and the Kawasaki Racing Team is intending to take the fight to its competition after narrowly missing out on winning WSBK in 2012 and 2014.One of the biggest changes made to the 2016 ZX-10R is a heavily-redesigned cylinder head. The inlet tracts have been realigned to provide the intake charge a straight shot into the combustion chamber. The chamber itself has been redesigned to improve combustion efficiency.The exit has also been reworked, with the exhaust ports polished and enlarged, mated to titanium exhaust headers. The intake and exhaust valves are now made out of titanium, and the new-for-2016 cams provide more power at the top-end of the rev range. The new electronic throttle bodies also contribute to the quest for more power, at the same time keeping the engine Euro 4-compliant for the road version.A lower moment of inertia has been machined into the crank, with a reduction of 20% in the amount of power needed to spin it up or slow it down. This was apparently at the request of the WSBK boys, and the engineering change has made the transition to the road bike.Working in conjunction with the 998 cc liquid-cooled inline-four DOHC 16-valve engine, the six-speed gearbox now comes with cassette gears that allow for changing of gear ratios without having to drain the sump. The gear ratios are a lot closer, minimising rpm jumps between gears, and providing better acceleration and less intrusive engine braking.Kawasaki also brings a whole slew of electronics to the game. This includes a new 32-bit ECU that works with a Bosch inertial measurement unit (IMU), measuring the ZX-10R’s movement in six-axes. The new electronics suite now brings the bike on par with its rivals – the Yamaha R1, Ducati 1299 Panigale S and Aprilia RSV4 RF.Other rider aids on the 2016 ZX-10R include Sport-Kawasaki TRaction Control (S-KTRC), three-mode launch control, Kawasaki’s KIBS ABS, and an electronic Ohlins steering damper. Also included are a quickshifter and engine braking control.Showa provides the ZX-10R with its brand-new Balance Free forks, the first installation on a production motorcycle. The fork uses Showa’s Damping Force Chamber, which uses an external chamber outside the fork legs filled with pressurised nitrogen to adjust compression and rebound damping. This is claimed by Kawasaki to improve suspension movement and increase traction.Braking is looked after by a pair of Brembo M50 4-pot monobloc calipers in front, similar to the units used on the , coupled with braided steel lines. The bodywork looks similar to the previous model, but is actually slightly wider to provide more protection from the wind.The 2016 Kawasaki ZX-10R is claimed to put out 200 hp – 210 hp with Ram-Air – and 113.5 Nm of torque at 11,500 rpm.  Weight is 206 kg, with a fuel capacity of 17 litres. The Malaysian launch of the ZX-10R is supposed to be scheduled for the middle of this year, after completion of track re-surfacing works at Sepang International Circuit.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-21,"MAA forecasts 2.5% drop in 2016 vehicle sales, due to tighter hire purchase guidelines, smaller loan amounts","The Malaysian Automotive Association has revealed its forecast for 2016’s Total Industry Volume (TIV) for vehicle sales. With 2015 marking a record high of 666,674 vehicles registered, the authority believes that there are several factors which will hamper this year’s outcome.Last year’s (2015) performance was a 0.03% (187 units) improvement on the year before that (2014), which itself saw 666,487 vehicles sold. However, MAA estimates that 2016 will see just 650,000 vehicles move – marking a decline of 2.5% against 2015’s run.The decline is set to begin in January 2016 itself, with MAA claiming that December 2015’s figures were boosted by excessive year-end offers by car companies. Datuk Aishah Ahmad, president of MAA, said that banks will also continue enforcing more stringent hire purchase loan approvals, which will affect January’s outcome, as well as the rest of the year.“Individual banks themselves are tightening these processes. Even the loan amount itself, you will not so easily be able to get a 90% loan now, it’s more likely to be 65 to 70% – you’ll have to come up with a bigger downpayment. The repayment period is also being shortened to seven years, and not the nine years as before,” she said.The 650,000 TIV estimate consists of 575,250 passenger vehicles and 74,750 commercial vehicles. The dip against 2015’s figures has been pinned on several factors. On top of the stringent hire purchase loan approvals, these include the continuing state of our weak ringgit,  subdued global economy growth, the uncertainties surrounding the declining crude oil prices and more.With the general cost of living in the country also going up, MAA also predicts that consumers may also hold back its expenditures on “big ticket items”. Likewise, lower income groups will be affected by banks being more hesitant to approve loan applications. “The rejection rate (for hire purchase loans) could be as high as 30 to 50%, depending on the credit worthiness of the customer,” Aishah said.Even still, MAA’s TIV estimation for 2016 is still set to mark the industry’s seventh consecutive year of registering more than 600,000 vehicles. Contributing factors to this positive note include the introduction of several large infrastructure projects, such as the improvement and development of new highways nationwide.The automotive authority also believes that strong and competitive promotional campaigns by car companies keen to maintain and grow their market shares will contribute to the industry’s performance in 2016. It also predicts that new-car models will be very exciting this year, which will also contribute to its overall figures.The Malaysian Automotive Association also provided a brief forecast for years 2017 to 2020. Without precise clarification,  the authority believes that the Malaysian automotive industry will continue to grow consistently beyond 2016, at rates between 2.2% to 3.0% each year.If accurate, the Malaysian TIV for vehicles sold will break the 700,000 mark in 2019, and will continue that high-performing run into year 2020.",Chris Aaron

With a financial backing of USD$11 billion that will see the entire range turned over by 2019, Volvo hopes to increase sales by twofold in 10 years to approximately 800,000 units. It is said that a large contributor to that figure will come from China. In the years to come, new S (sedan), V (wagon) and XC versions of its 60 and 40 will be launched. Coupe models, however, will not be on the list until all the core models listed are introduced in the market. On top of that, Volvo remains committed to being a safety leader with a prime focus on . “Safety is part of our heritage and it would be very unwise not to be building on that,” he said, adding, “it is definitely not boring. Safety is going to come back into the focus, especially with autonomous drive. Safety will be a very exciting area to be within and we will do that.”",Graham Chin

Rumour has it the Ninja 250R will come with a two-cylinder engine. The current Malaysian market Kawasaki Ninja 250 has a parallel-twin engine, while the 250SL has a single-cylinder thumper with both engines running EFI.Given that its prime competitor in the  market is the Yamaha R25, which contains a parallel-twin, this isn’t that surprising.  The , the CBR250RR, is also said to be carrying a two-cylinder engine.If this is a case, the current Kawasaki Malaysia line-up of the Ninja 250, and Ninja 250SL, might be superceded come 2017. However, going by past practice, Indonesia and Thailand tend to get the new models first, with Malaysia being between six months to a year late, sometimes more.The Kawasaki Ninja 250SL retails for around RM17,689 without GST while the Yamaha R25 has an official retail price of RM20,206 inclusive of GST. The Honda CBR250R retails for RM19,999 for the standard Trico & Black and RM20,499 for Repsol – both without ABS.

2016-01-21,JPJ Selangor and Perlis seize cloned Singapore cars,"Buyers of cloned cars, . The Selangor Road Transport Department (JPJ) has seized 65 cloned vehicles in the state since 2015,  reports.“These vehicles are smuggled (into Malaysia) from Singapore by syndicates, which also operate via the social media, especially Facebook, following requests from buyers here. Cloned vehicles are offered at a much cheaper price, for example RM4,000 to RM5,000 for a Toyota and the price offered is different for every brand and type of vehicle,” said Selangor JPJ director Nazli Md Taib, who added that cloned cars seized until yesterday include BMWs, Volkswagens, Subarus and Toyotas.Nazli said the vehicles have no valid documents, and that they use vehicle registration numbers already registered in Malaysia. “Some of the registration numbers used by these cloned vehicles are still active and valid on the road. There are also some registration numbers used which are not active or have been disposed of by the owner,” he said.The JPJ man said the department will cooperate with police and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to identify individuals involved in car cloning syndicates. He urged those who own cloned cars to hand the vehicles over to JPJ because possessing a one is an offence under the Road Transport Act 1987, although we can’t imagine many heeding the call. The war against the clones is also happening up north in Kangar. In just three weeks from December 30, Perlis JPJ has seized 13 cloned cars. The haul included a Honda Civic, Honda Jazz, Toyota Vios and pricier cars like the BMW 7 Series and Nissan Fairlady Z. All were smuggled in from Singapore except two, which were from Thailand. “Initial investigations revealed that the syndicate smuggling the vehicles sold them directly to consumers between RM4,000 and RM70,000 each. The smuggling in of these vehicles is believed to be masterminded by the syndicate which previously distributed them in the Klang Valley or in the south,” said Perlis JPJ director Zulhasmi Mohamad. He added that the seized vehicles had unaltered chassis numbers, but were on existing Malaysian registration numbers. The cars were using false road tax and had no insurance coverage, Zulhasmi said.Last week, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) said that it is  involved in cloned vehicles. “We opened 34 investigation papers between 2012 and 2015, as we suspected there were elements of corruption in the cloned vehicle syndicates,” said MACC deputy chief commissioner of operations, Datuk Seri Mohd Shukri Abdul, who added that 21 people have since been arrested.The JPJ is also looking at embedded smartcode radio frequency identification  to combat cloned vehicles, which  and burdens the owners of the original cars.

2016-01-20,2016 DS3 gets revamped with new tech and engines,"The 2016 DS3 facelift officially makes its debut in Paris today, packing a significant amount of changes that covers not just its looks, but also the technology and mechanicals that go into the premium compact car. Available either as a hatchback or cabriolet, the DS3 also comes in a new Performance version, which echoes hints of the outgoing DS3 Racing. On the styling front, the DS3 has been redesigned to follow the new DS corporate identity. This sees the introduction of the “DS Wings” hexagonal grille with chrome surrounds. Just beside the grille are two chromed-finished wings that extend towards both the xenon/LED headlights (with three jewel-like modules) and LED fog lamps. The rear lights are now LED items, with an updated 3D pattern.With the majority of the visual changes taking place at the front, the rest of car appears to retain its styling with the floating roof design, two-tone body/roof colours and the side body line. For customers who are looking to make their DS3 stand out further, a personalisation programme allows for 78 body/roof colour combinations and four canvas roof choices for the DS3 Cabrio, with the latter capable of being operated at speeds of up to 120 km/h.Not enough customisation for your liking? Allow me to continue. There are ten roof decals, ten rearview mirror housings, 15 alloy wheels and two interior design schemes (Basalt black Dinamica or Topaz brown) to choose from. According to DS, there are more than three million possible combinations when you put them all together, so no two DS3s would look the same, right?In any case, the DS3 still retains its familiar dashboard layout, although its 7-inch colour touchscreen multimedia unit has been revamped to provide easier access to the vehicle’s functions. The new unit also does away with 20 buttons, reducing the clutter on the centre console in the previous model.Additionally, it also introduces a myriad of connectivity options – Apple CarPlay, MirrorLink and a MyDS smartphone app. The connectivity options are further expanded with the DS Connect Box that features the SOS & Assistance, Monitoring, Mapping and Tracking packs. The entry-level model also gains a bump in its safety suite, with the Active City Brake system now coming as standard. The system is capable of applying the brakes if it detects potential risks at speeds of up to 30 km/h to avoid a collision or limit the consequences of one.Moving on, the list of engines available for the DS3 total seven, starting with three 1.2 litre PureTech naturally-aspirated/turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engines rated at 82 hp/118 Nm, 110 hp/205 Nm and 130 hp/ 230 Nm. Next up are the two 1.6 litre THP turbo four-cylinder petrol mills rated at 165 hp/240 Nm and 208 hp/300 Nm, with the latter reserved for the DS3 Performance variants.Fans of oil burners will be provided a choice of either one of two 1.6 litre BlueHDi four-cylinder turbodiesel engines in 100 hp/254 Nm and 120 hp/285 Nm varieties. The engines (petrol or diesel) are available with two transmission options, a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic.On the mention of the DS3 Performance, the hot hatch gets a few high-performance-oriented bits to cope with its significant bump in power. A Torsen limited slip differential has been added to its inventory, along with a wider track (by 26 mm at the front and 14 mm at the back), lowered ride height by 15 mm and larger brakes (323 mm front discs, 249 mm rear discs). The DS3 Performance also gains more distinct design highlights with a special twin tailpipe, carbon side mouldings, a new sill panel strip, and matte black wing extenders.

It also appears to benefit from 19-inch wheels and the Design Pure Excellence package. Under the hood of the 740Li, there is a 3.0 litre turbocharged straight-six petrol engine paired to an eight-speed Sport Automatic transmission.As for the grey 7 Series (seen only from the front), the wheels appear to differ in terms of design, which could indicate one of two things. One, Malaysians might have the option of a lower spec 740Li. Or two, this could signal the imminent arrival of the 730Li, a model that was rumoured to be .The G12 730Li is likely to feature the same B48 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbo mill that be found in the 740Le. In its PHEV configuration, the combustion engine alone produces 258hp and 400 Nm, a couple of more horses and 50 Nm more than the 330i, but less than what can be obtained from the 740Li’s 326 hp and 450 Nm straight-six.Should this come to be true, it will certainly be good news for premium sedan buyers who are looking at a more affordable 7 Series variant to choose from, should the 740Li be a little too much for their needs.Beneath the metal of BMW’s latest flagship lies its new Carbon Core skeleton, where a combination of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), magnesium, aluminium and steel is used, resulting in weight savings by as much as 130 kg from its predecessor.BMW Malaysia has already begun teasing the arrival of the all-new BMW 7 Series with a .

2016-01-20,Renault Captur recalled following emissions tests,"Following emissions testing carried out at the behest of the French government, Renault has issued a recall for 15,800  SUVs to fix a faulty emissions filtering system. The automaker, while acknowledging that there was a difference between test results and real world emission levels, denied any wrongdoing in the matter, according to news reports.The Captur model being recalled is a 110 PS 1.5 litre DCi 110 diesel variant. In it, the faulty filter system is only activated between 17 degrees and 35 degrees Celsius – the contention is while the temperature range follows closely on that for testing (20-30 degrees Celsius), average temperatures in Paris are generally lower for a good part of the year, and so the system was not properly eliminating nitrogen oxides and sulphur.The recall, which began last month, will see the filtration system on these cars being corrected to run in both hot and cold weather. The fix will take about half a day to complete per vehicle.The automaker also announced it was planning a voluntary software upgrade to its emissions systems in its diesel engines, a move that could see up to 700,000 vehicles being updated. The upgrade applies only to Euro 6-compliant engines.Following Volkswagen’s , the French government initiated a probe to verify if vehicles sold in France had equivalent devices installed. An independent technical committee was formed, with emissions testing being carried out by the UTAC (French Homologation Authority). The exercise involved a total of 100 models from various manufacturers, including 25 from Renault.Last week, it was reported that the French General Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) had , visiting its headquarters, the Renault Technical Centre in Lardy and the Technocentre in Guyancourt.Renault isn’t the only carmaker affected.

2016-01-20,MINI Clubman ALL4 – driving fun with all four wheels,"The  Clubman now comes with ALL4, MINI’s all-wheel drive system that promises more driving fun from this premium compact hatch. Designed to maximise traction and handling in all weather and road conditions, the ALL4 runs off a power take-off bevel gear on the front axle differential.This is connected to a dual-section propeller shaft and a rear axle differential with an electro-hydraulically controlled hang-on clutch. The system is interconnected with MINI’s Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) to enable distribution of drive torque between front and rear wheels, with the system adapting precisely to the road conditions.Under normal conditions, the DSC powers the front wheels, as is typical of MINIs. Depending on speed an road conditions, the DSC can activate the ALL4 system to power the rear wheels. It does this by powering an electrohydraulic pump that locks the hang-on clutch.Power is transmitted through a dual-section tubular shaft with joints that permit component movement at the front and rear of the MINI. At the front, the shaft connects to the front differential bevel gear and the hang-on clutch at the rear differential.For locking of the differentials, the ALL4 system uses Electronic Differential Lock Control (EDLC), optimising traction when taking corners through the use of selective braking. Should DSC be turned off, this prevents spinning of the front wheel on the inside of the bend and transmits drive power to the outer front wheel instead.ALL4 is activated whenever necessary, with the correct amount of drive directed to the rear wheels in equal amounts. Differing wheel rotation speeds are compensated for in the normal way between the front and rear differentials. Should the DSC detect wheel slip, selective braking is applied till equal rotational speed is achieved.DSC permanently calculates the ideal power distribution between front and rear wheels, taking into account wheel rotation speeds and the current longitudinal and lateral acceleration figures. Readings are also taken for road speed, accelerator position, engine torque and steering angle as well as the settings of the driving dynamics system and the optional MINI Driving Modes. ALL4 is now available on the MINI Cooper S Clubman and the SD Clubman. In the Cooper S, the ALL4 is powered by a two-litre, four-cylinder turbo petrol with 192 hp at 5,000 rpm and 280 Nm at 1,250 rpm, while the diesel SD uses a two-litre four-cylinder diesel with a variable turbine turbo that puts out 190 hp at 4,000 rpm and 400 Nm torque between 1,750 to 2,500 rpm.",Paul Tan

In addition, advanced seat belt reminders are fitted to all seats, while autonomous emergency braking (AEB) is also a standard piece of safety tech on-board the RX – missing on local-market models.The RX scored an 83% score for adult occupant protection and an 82% score for child occupant protection. As for pedestrian protection, the RX did pretty well in this section, scoring a total of 79%. As for safety assist, the SUV attained a 74% mark – brought down slightly by the autonomous emergency braking (2.7 out of 3), as it had reduced performance at low speeds, according to ANCAP.“The RX joins a competitive SUV market and offers a range of safety assist technologies as standard, including AEB, lane support system and reverse collision avoidance,” said ANCAP CEO James Goodwin. In regards to pedestrian protection, “it’s encouraging to see the Lexus achieve the highest pedestrian protection rating of ‘good’, scoring maximum points for the protection provided to pedestrian’s legs and pelvic region,” Goodwin added.He further noted, “in the frontal offset test the passenger compartment of the RX held its shape well and all doors remained closed and there was good protection for the driver in the side impact test.”",Graham Chin

However, the government says that it will consider public feedback on the matter,  reports.“We welcome the feedback and suggestions from the public so that we can do better,” Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai told reporters yesterday, adding that he has directed the Road Transport Department (JPJ) to conduct a survey.Liow said that traffic fatalities is a main concern of the ministry, with almost 7,000 road-related deaths in more than 500,000 traffic accidents every year in Malaysia. “We want to implement AES because it is an effective ways to reduce traffic accidents in the country,” he said.The minister said that he had received feedback from road users admitting that they would slow down whenever they see an AES camera. “Areas with AES installed have recorded a reduction in traffic accidents. Implementations in other countries have also shown that the system is effective. Unlike what many people claim, AES is not to punish the rakyat by issuing summons and fines. We want to save lives,” he said.The two-pronged approach will include the Kejara demerit points system, which will see drivers who accumulate a certain amount of points have their licenses revoked. “As for how many points to deduct for each traffic offence, we want feedback from the rakyat. We are willing to listen to their views,” Liow said.In a separate function, Deputy Transport Minister Datuk Abdul Aziz Kaprawi told  that the ministry was looking at enforcing an improved Kejara system by March and JPJ had submitted three key proposals during a meeting with the ministry last week. The proposals are: separate demerit points for commercial vehicles and those for private use; demerit points will not be removed even if a traffic offender settles the fine; and motorists who maintain a clean record for at least two years will get their accumulated demerit points reduced by half.Under Kejara, 20 demerit points will earn one a warning, 40 points will get your driving licence suspended and 60 points, cancelled. Abdul Aziz said the ministry was expected to green light the proposals soon and forward them to the Cabinet for approval by February.The AES system was initially supposed to start in 2012, but came under public objection. In December 2013, the Dewan Rakyat adopted a motion to allow the Government to take over the system from the previously appointed private operators, and  are now in the picture. In May 2015, the government announced that  in the second phase, with cameras being installed at traffic light intersections in stages at 262 locations nationwide.Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (Miros) chairman Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye said the body supported the government’s move to revive AES and Kejara. “Most accidents happen because of speeding and what better way to track these traffic offenders than installing AES cameras and enforcing the Kejara demerit system,” he said.

For one, those headlights appear a little longer and it looks to flow inwards, converging towards  the kidney grille. With that being said, the kidney grille does seem to be somewhat larger than before.Apart from that, the 3 Series seems to have retained most of its physique from the looks of it – no thanks to the swirly wrap and artificial body panels. Expected to be lighter, the new BMW 3 Series will likely utilise a mix of aluminium, carbon-fibre and high-strength steel – in short, it will probably get a variation of the G11 7 Series’  architecture.What may be of further interest is that the new 3 Series might be a little bigger than the F30 BMW 3 Series. It will reportedly be wider and come with an extended wheelbase so as to provide for a larger, more spacious interior. Furthermore, a host of additional safety tech can be expected too. As for power options, the new 3er will likely get a choice of a turbocharged three-cylinder, four- and six-cylinder petrol and diesel units.

2016-01-20,"2016 Mitsubishi Attrage on sale in Thailand – new safety systems, improved 23.3 km/l fuel economy","The  has been updated, and the 2016 model is now on sale in Thailand. The sedan sister of the Mirage doesn’t get , but there are new features, first in class safety technology and improved fuel economy. The MY06 Attrage is now equipped with the Radar Sensing Misacceleration Mitigation System – Forward (RMS-Forward) and Forward Collision Mitigation System – Low Speed Range (FCM-LS) in the GLS and GLS-LTD trim levels (the other is the base GLX). FCM-LS alerts the driver of possible forward collisions with audio and visual warnings, while RMS-Forward can cut engine power when the driver unintentionally accelerates into obstacles. Both are good in preventing fender benders and are previously unheard of in this segment.Other safety systems previously in place include dual airbags, ABS/EBD/BA, stability control, hill start assist, pretensioner seat belts and a reverse camera. Visuals from the latter are shown on a 6.5-inch 2DIN head unit with navigation on the GLS-LTD or a 6.2-inch touchscreen HU on the GLS and GLX. The audio system is linked to steering wheel buttons with voice command and a USB port in the glove box.Other available interior features include leather with red stitching, piano black trim across the cabin, a “semi high contrast” meter panel, auto air-con, keyless entry with push start and MMC’s Electronic Time and Alarm Control System (ETACS) which can be manipulated to activate things such as auto door lock, welcome lights, coming home lights and emergency stop signal, among other things.No exterior changes except for dark chrome trim on the grille and 15-inch alloys, for the GLS-LTD.The Attrage continues to use the 3A92 1.2 litre MIVEC engine, paired to either a five-speed manual (GLX only) or a CVT. The three-cylinder Euro 5 unit makes 78 PS and 100 Nm, lower than the current Malaysian car’s 80 PS/106 Nm. The previous claimed fuel economy figure was 22.2 km/l, but Mitsubishi now claims 23.3 km/l and C02 emissions of 99 g/km, which conforms to Thailand’s Ecocar II rules. The updated MY06 Attrage is available in six body colours (Wine Red is new) and a wide range of optional accessories. It is priced from 456,000 baht (RM55,062) to 594,000 baht (RM71,726) in the Land of Smiles.The Attrage’s unique selling point is its fuel economy, which is 21 km/l in the European NEDC driving cycle, as claimed by Mitsubishi Motors Malaysia. We’ve managed to surpass that by consciously being lightfooted, but even in normal driving, the Attrage is very fuel efficient. Read  for more.",Danny Tan

Both prices are on-the-road inclusive of insurance, a five-year/100,000 km warranty and three years’ free service.The XV gains minor exterior changes for 2016, including a redesigned hexagonal grille, a new front bumper design with L-shaped LED positioning lights, an aluminium finish on the roof rails as well as a slightly revised turbine-like design for the distinctive 17-inch two-tone wheels.Malaysian cars also now get clear LED tail lights from the , along with arrow-shaped LED indicators embedded into the door mirrors, the latter only on the 2.0i-P. Six colours are available, including Pure White, Ice Silver Metallic, Desert Khaki, Tangerine Orange Pearl, Dark Grey Metallic and Obsidian Black Pearl.Inside, changes are limited to a revised three-spoke steering wheel design from the new  and , LED illumination under the head unit and orange interior stitching. There has also been a change in terms of equipment – the DVD navigation system, Bluetooth connectivity, six-speaker sound system and reverse camera are no longer standard, reserved for the 2.0i-P; the 2.0i gets a Kenwood 2-DIN radio instead.Also new for the 2.0i-P is keyless entry, push-button start, power-adjustable seats, a new instrument cluster with a larger multi-info display (controllable via new steering-mounted buttons), a monitor for the all-wheel drive system on top of the dashboard, a cargo cover and alloy pedals. Front and rear fog lights, cruise control, reverse sensors, steering wheel shift paddles and automatic air-conditioning remain standard.Elsewhere, nothing has changed, so under the bonnet the XV retains the familiar FB-series 2.0 litre DOHC naturally-aspirated flat-four petrol engine, making 150 PS at 6,200 rpm and 196 Nm of torque at 4,200 rpm. Drive is sent to Subaru’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system – retaining a 60:40 split front-to-rear – via a Lineartronic CVT with six virtual ratios.Safety-wise, dual front airbags and a driver’s knee airbag remain standard fare – this despite Japan now getting side and curtain airbags as standard.

2016-01-20,No change in B10 biodiesel plans despite low oil price,"The slump in global oil prices hasn’t altered the Malaysia’s plan to raise its biodiesel mandate to 10%, with the government saying it remains committed on this front despite tumbling crude oil prices having made palm oil twice as expensive as its fossil fuel alternative,  reports.According to Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah Embas, while current oil prices have had an impact on proceedings, price is not the government’s only consideration. He said this in response to a question posed by reporters at an industry seminar, which asked if low oil prices would result in a change of plans for the B10 biodiesel programme. “There are various considerations and the sum of that will guide the government’s biodiesel utilisation. Biodiesel helps us to stabilise (the) price, enables us to reduce stock by increasing domestic consumption, which has an impact on palm oil. We have committed to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions in the country by using biodiesel,” he said.He added that the government is in the final stages of consultation with stakeholders on the B10 programme, and a Cabinet paper on the subject is set to be submitted by the end of February.In February 2013, the government announced its decision to upgrade its existing , which had , to B10, a blend of 10% palm-based biodiesel and 90% petroleum diesel. Following a , B10 was supposed to have been , a move that Uggah said would result in raising domestic consumption of crude palm oil by one million tonnes per year.The  report adds that industry officials and producers say Malaysia – as well as Indonesia – may have to curb plans to channel more palm oil into biodiesel, given the slump in crude oil prices. Analysts expect Indonesia to at best achieve a 10% mandate in 2016 and Malaysia’s blending level to likely fall below its 2015 goal of seven percent, the news agency stated.Last year, following the news of B10’s impending introduction, a number of car companies announced that the  with regards to its use in their diesel engines, with BMW, UMW Toyota, Isuzu and Volkswagen Malaysia issuing similarly-toned statements on the matter.",Anthony Lim

2016-01-19,REVIEW: BMW R1200R – iron fist in an iron glove,"Manufacturers with iconic engine designs sometimes rue the day when their creation takes on a life of its own.  One case is Porsche’s flat-six.  When Porsche wanted to retire the 911 in favour of the 928 back in 1980, Porsche purists howled with dismay and refused to let the engine, and the car, die.This happened to BMW in the same time period. Having reached what they thought was the end of the design lifespan of the nearly 70-year old flat-twin, they came out with the flat-four ‘K’ in 1984.  You could hear the gnashing of teeth and rending of cloth from Munich to Melbourne.The 2015 BMW R1200 R is today’s prime example of what some consider to be an obsolete engine design, ill-suited for motorcycles, that soldiers on into the future, and does a pretty damn good job of it. The ‘R’ is BMW’s classification for the boxer engine, going all the way back to 1923 with the R32. While the twin is pretty much a mainstay with the GS adventure touring crowd, sports riders and those who favour ‘normal’ motorcycles tend to be eclectic in their engine choice. V-twins, fours, triples, there’s almost everything and the kitchen sink to choose from. The R1200 R is BMW’s take on a standard motorcycle that riders can use as they wish. Coming as a naked, various customisation options are available for the bike to be configured as the rider wishes. The boxer goes against other nakeds like its sibling the S1000R, the Ducati Monster, MV Agusta Brutale, Yamaha FZ-09, Aprilia Tuono, Triumph Street Triple, Kawasaki Z1000 and KTM Superduke.Approaching the R1200 R, two things stand out. The massive boxer engine, and the red trellis frame. The humped 18-litre tank adds to the overall impression of direct, functional brutality, perhaps a result of Teutonic engineering efficiency.Now, ‘naked’ in BMW Motorrad parlance does not actually mean stripped down to the bone.  The R1200 R we tested came fully-loaded with all sorts of riding and semi-active suspension aids, coupled with BMW’s motorcycle ABS that is the best in the business.  GS riders will testify to this.Let’s start with initial riding impressions. The R1200 R comes with Keyless Ride as standard for this market. Working like Comfort Access for BMW cars, Keyless Ride allows the rider to unlock and start the bike with the key fob in the pocket. Access to the fuel filler cap is also keyless, and the switchblade style key is only needed if the seat is to be removed.While the physical size of the R1200 R may look intimidating, getting on allowed a 170 cm tall rider to get his feet flat on the ground. BMW offers two optional seats – high and low – that raise or lower seat height by about 20 mm. Pushing the start button lit the instrument cluster up like a Christmas tree, and the engine settled into the familiar boxer rumble. The rocking effect was a little noticeable, due to the engine now being a stressed member in the frame.The most significant change between the 2015 R1200 R and the previous model is the weight loss. The bike went on a diet, and BMW engineers made it lose 45 kg along the way. This make the R1200 R belie its 231 kg wet weight.Riding the R1200 R revealed the very torquey nature of the twin. A misjudged twist of the throttle in third gear was enough to hoist the front wheel. Professional rider on a closed course, no animals were harmed in the writing of this review, etc.Riding was done on a mix of highway and trunk roads, with a foray up Fraser’s Hill to put the R1200 R’s handling to the test. On the highway, the R1200 R was fast enough to get way up the speedometer with no issues, the 125 hp and 125 Nm torque providing all the necessary grunt and urge. Talking about torque, the curve is about as flat as a tabletop. Roll-on acceleration in the top three gears from about 80 km/h revealed no signs of stumbling or hesitation from the bike, just a smooth, almost turbine-like, surge of power.The biggest change to help develop all the R1200 R’s 125 horses is a change in the traditional induction and exhaust layout of the boxer. The throttle body is is located above the cylinder, and the inlet drops vertically. Likewise, the exhaust port is now located below the cylinder and leads away under the engine.Speaking of smooth, a noticeable buzz was felt in the handlebars a slightly over legal highway speed. It was there, and it was annoying, because the R1200 R feels most comfortable riding somewhat above the national speed limit.  Increasing the throttle opening made it go away, as did closing it down, but this is something BMW Motorrad should inspect.Being a naked, of course, meant wind protection was at a minimum. The small chin screen mounted above the headlight provided some shelter from the wind-blast when tucked in, but suffice it to say the rider’s arms and shoulders would soon tire out.High-speed shenanigans isn’t the prime reason for the R1200 R’s existance though. Where this bike shines is in its capability to handle anything the rider wants it to do. A short foray strafing the corners at Fraser’s, at medium speeds, showed another facet of the R1200 R. With the low-down urge of the 1,170 cc engine, taking the sharp hairpins at Fraser’s was simply a matter of leaving the six-speed gearbox in third, and using the right wrist.This was helped by the Gear Shift Assistant Pro. This clever piece of tech isn’t quite a quickshifter.  What it does is automatically adjust engine speed to enable down-shifting, with no need to pull in the clutch or close the throttle to double-declutch and prevent grinding of the gears. Just tap down with your foot, the gears engage and engine braking kicks in.The R1200 R encouraged a slightly ‘cut-and-thrust’ riding style up and down the hill roads, letting the bike handle the engine and gearbox, while the rider concentrated on the line. All this two-wheeled entertainment was looked after by a clever bit of wizardry called Dynamic ESA (Electronic Suspension Adjustment).Dynamic ESA is standard for the Malaysian R1200 R that monitors the optional semi-active suspension and sets the riding modes. The two basic modes are ‘road’ and ‘rain’ and two more options, DSC and Custom. In DSC mode, lean angle is also monitored, and the ride and engine response becomes a little more … aggressive. Custom mode lets the rider configure suspension settings individually, but if you think you can do better than BMW Motorrad’s engineering department and dedicated team of test riders, please feel free.This suspension trickery counts for nothing without the forks and rear shock. Up front are a pair of USD 43 mm Marzocchi gold-anodised forks and a Sachs unit at the rear, all wired into the Dynamic ESA system. As the rider twists the throttle and brakes, the ESA adjusts the damping on-the-fly to suit what is going on, and keep the rubber to the road. If incipient wheelspin or lockup is detected, the throttle is retarded and brakes applied to bring things back into line.For an experiment, the ESA was was set to DSC, and throttle gunned in second gear.  The rear wheel stepped out, as expected, but for barely a fraction of a second and not violently, with everything brought back under control in less time than it took to read this sentence.All this capability lets the rider take to the roads with confidence, and the nature of the bike allows it to do many things. BMW Motorrad provides a long list of options for the R1200 R, including hard cases, top box, tank bag, Akrapovic silencers and navigation system. The optional hard touring cases for the R1200 R are RM1,209 for the small top case, and RM1,471 each for the left and right side cases. Prices exclude GST and installation.The 2015 BMW Motorrad R1200 R comes in Thunder grey metallic, Cordoba blue and Light white uni (as tested). The version tested by  included Keyless Ride, windshield, engine spoiler, Dynamic ESA and Navigator V mount as standard for the Malaysian market.Price for the 2015 BMW Motorrad R1200 R is RM98,900, while the RS model retails for RM101,900 and the RT with fairing goes for RM128,900. A rider wanting a bike in the litre-plus class that can commute, handle sporty riding on back roads, highway jaunts and simply cruising could do worse than giving the 2015 R1200 R a close look.",Mohan K Ramanujam

These photos come from Chinese website , and when compared to , the crossover seen here appears just as you’d expect it to.The low-slung profile is still present here, along with generous application of Mazda’s Kodo design language. The Koeru/CX-4 also gets a four-bar grille, plus slimmer signature head- and tail lights. Other production-ready highlights include the addition of front and rear fog lamps, and redesigned exhaust tips.

Although out of view, Mazda’s MZD Connect touchscreen is fitted as well, linked to the Commander Control knob on the centre console. Bright-coloured leather is also a standout here.The Koeru/CX-4 is rumoured to be a sportier SUV in Mazda’s line-up, similar to what the BMW X6 is to the X5. This has lead to suggestions that the car will be referred to as the CX-6 instead of the CX-4, but that’s all up in the air for now.The Koeru concept from the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show shares the same 2,700 mm wheelbase as the CX-5. However, it is 4,600 mm long, 1,900 mm wide and 1,500 mm tall, versus the CX-5’s 4,555 mm (L), 1,840 mm (W) and 1,670 mm (H).

2016-01-19,Hyundai files patent in the US for a foldable city car,"Korean automaker Hyundai has just filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patent, filed just a few days ago, states that the invention is a “new-concept foldable vehicle that occupies a minimum space by folding when parking and can be converted into a complete vehicle when it unfolds.”In detail, the foldable car, as elaborated by Hyundai, comprises of a front floor coupled with front wheels, and a rear floor coupled with the rear wheels. The “floors” can then increase or decrease the wheelbase of the car, by sliding over and under each other. Hyundai states in its patent that while foldable vehicles currently exist, they would still occupy large spaces. It explains, “because it is difficult to change their wheelbases, and the overall length cannot be minimised because the roof or the rear side cannot be fully folded.”In addition to that, the other issue involves height. “Even if their roof or rear side can fold, the overall height increases instead when they fold, so it is difficult to park the vehicles in a parking space with a small height and their external appearances are unnatural,” the patent notes. This, then, is Hyundai’s solution to this “problem.” What do you think of it?",Graham Chin

What is a surprise is that Malaysia has been listed as one of the countries the Agera RS will be headed to.Considering the fact that only , as announced by Koenigsegg during the vehicle’s debut at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, that makes it incredibly rare, and probably an incredibly expensive acquisition for one fellow Malaysian.The Agera RS is a culmination of technical know-how gained from the previous Agera R and Agera S, the latter of which was . It also integrates lessons learned from the “most extreme Koenigsegg” ever, the One:1. Powered by a 5.0 litre twin-turbo V8 engine that is paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, the Agera RS has 1,160 hp and 1,280 Nm of torque at its disposal. The 0-100 km/h time is said to take just 2.5 seconds, while the top speed is estimated to be around 402 km/h.Furthermore, it packs more aerodynamic enhancements than the “regular” Agera S, with a dynamically active rear wing providing up to 450 kg of downforce at 250 km/h, and a new front splitter, winglets, side skirts and side air outlets.Quite a machine then, and we can’t wait to see one on Malaysian roads in all its carbon-fibre/kevlar glory.

2016-01-19,Foreign brands again outsell Proton-Perodua in 2015,"It was mostly good news at  event this morning, where the company revealed that it had sold a record 213,300 vehicles last year, translating to an estimated 32% market share. That slice of the pie (up 3%, highest since 2007) also means that P2 has topped the Malaysian auto sales chart for a full decade. After-sales and accessories divisions also broke internal records. However, one slide in the presentation stood out because it had a dipping line. Pictured above, it shows that foreign brands have outsold national makes for the second year running, and the share is split 53:47 in favour of the non-nationals, according to Perodua’s estimates (official 2015 sales figures from the Malaysian Automotive Association are not out yet). The  is no sudden phenomenon, and is largely due to Proton’s fortunes as Perodua has been relatively consistent in holding around 30% share, and pole position. Proton controlled over half of the domestic market back in 2001, but now commands less than a third of what it used to enjoy. Put together, the local players’ share of the market has seen a steady drop over the years, but the point where they surrendered the lead to the non-national makes . Couple this trend with the  (now the leading foreign brand ahead of Toyota) and you get a shrinking national market share that not even  can arrest. Observers would say that it’s the inevitable effect of liberalisation. But this trend is not good for the local automotive ecosystem, Perodua argues. “While we understand the government’s intention to liberalise the automotive industry in the near term, we believe that the country’s automotive eco-system, consisting of local vendors and dealers, as well as original equipment manufacturers like Perodua, has yet to reach a point where we can fairly compete with other established global brands,” P2 chairman Tan Sri Asmat Kamaluddin said the  last week.“This is because we have yet to reach the level of maturity, in terms of economies of scale, cost competitiveness and even quality, which other established global brands. If the percentage continues to slide to below 45% then many of the local dealers and vendors may have to cease operations and this will have a negative impact on the economy as a whole,” added Asmat, who is also the group chairman of Perodua stakeholder UMW Holdings Berhad.The point was reiterated by P2 president and CEO Datuk Aminar Rashid Salleh today. He also revealed that Perodua purchased a whopping RM4.9 billion worth of parts and components from local vendors in 2015, up 26% from 2013, although the total is expected to fall slightly to RM4.6 billion in 2016. All of Perodua’s current models – ,  and  – have a localisation rate of over 90%. Perhaps the outspokenness of Perodua’s top brass on this matter stems from the increased “responsibility” on the company to support the local vendors as Proton flounders. Something that isn’t very welcome in the current climate, where forex has impacted the remaining 8-10% of imported components (Axia engine components in USD, Myvi/Alza parts in JPY), negatively affecting profitability by 25-30%. Also, consumers are increasingly opting for lower end variants, where margins are thinner.",Danny Tan

A five-speed manual transmission is reserved for the Mobilio S, E and RS, while a CVT finds its way into the E CVT, Prestige and RS CVT.As you can (or cannot) tell, the most noticeable exterior changes on the Mobilio are the new-design 15-inch alloy wheels for the non-RS variants.

The Mobilio also appears to sport the City’s rectangular air-con vents that sit just above the 6.1-inch touchscreen multimedia unit (lower variants get a single or double DIN radio unit instead). The Mobilio’s previous three-dial air-con controls have also been replaced with a touch panel (with automatic operation), which allows Honda to offer more storage space where they used to be. Elsewhere, the instrument cluster ditches the three-pod setting from before. In its place is a simple instrument layout with blue highlights and white font. However, the steering wheel appears to be the carried over from the previous Mobilio.As for its safety suite, front ventilated brake discs and rear drums are fitted on all Mobilio variants, with the inclusion of dual front SRS airbags as well.

2016-01-19,"Proton not looking to build diesel engines, hints Tun M","has hinted the national carmaker is not looking at building diesel powertrains anytime soon, as Europe – once having an overwhelming preference for oil burners – is starting to reconsider the use of the technology in the wake of the .When asked about whether the company was looking at building diesel engines, the former premier responded: “Diesels were the preferred engines in Europe, but now they have different ideas – you know what happened to the records of the performance of the diesel engines recently. So now, people have to rethink whether it is better to have diesel engines or petrol engines.”The remark likely referenced VW’s emissions cheating controversy, in which Wolfsburg deceived lawmakers not once, but twice. In the United States, it was revealed that the company had  which deliberately manipulated emissions control systems to pass strict emissions tests conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but turned them off outside of the labs.As such, the diesel models had better performance and fuel efficiency in everyday driving than with the control systems switched on, but were .Shortly afterwards, VW admitted to a separate scandal, in which engineers  – including overinflating tyres and mixing diesel into the cars’ engine oil – to meet internal targets and obtain lower taxes imposed on its cars in Europe. Put them together and you can begin to see why Proton is hesitant about building diesel engines.That’s not all – there has been a steady movement in Europe away from diesels, before the VW scandals even came to light. Customers have long been swayed by the low CO2 emissions and superior fuel efficiency of these powertrains, which suit the tax structures typical in countries in the continent, making diesel-powered vehicles cheaper both to buy and run.But diesels generally produce higher NOx than equivalent petrol engines, and the push for oil burners in countries like the United Kingdom have seen emissions there  – estimated to be contributing to thousands of deaths annually. As such, European regulators are clamping down on NOx and other emissions, such as particulate matter, linked to the combustion of diesel fuels.The new Euro 6 emissions standard, which all new cars sold in Europe have had to comply with since last year, restricts diesel-powered vehicles to producing just 0.08 grams of NOx per kilometre, compared to 0.180 grams per kilometre for Euro 5. By contrast, the limit for petrol engines has stood at 0.06 grams per kilometre since Euro 5.Legislators have also been promising incentives for owners to move away from diesel power, with  – something Proton has also been working on with the .It has to be said, however, that while Proton may have ruled out building its own diesel engines in the foreseeable future, it might still be looking to acquire them from other carmakers – in 2014, chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa said that , although it is unclear whether this is still the case.In any case, Proton appears to be sticking to its guns when it comes to petrol engines – it has recently announced a  in both naturally-aspirated (GDI) and turbocharged (TGDI) forms.

2016-01-19,Lotus Elise with Petronas E01e engine on display,"This Lotus Elise Series 1 was put on display at Proton’s Centre of Excellence during the company’s announcement of . Unlike the standard car, the Elise seen here packs a , which is said to form the basis of the NE01 engine that is due on the .Pop the hood of this Elise, and you’ll find a E01e 2.0 litre in-line four-cylinder petrol engine that features an aluminium block, continuous control variable valve timing (VVT) and double overhead camshafts (DOHC). Power is rated at 204 PS at 7,300 rpm and 203 Nm at 5,300 rpm.The E01 engine has had a long history, with the project first kicking off in March 1997. With applied knowledge gained from Petronas’ experience in Formula 1, the engine was first fired up on February 20, 1998. Shortly after, the engine made its way into two test mules, a Proton Waja and a Satria GTi, before the Elise received its own.In 2012, it was reported that Proton had acquired all of Petronas’ engine technologies along with other patents for RM63 million. This gave Proton ownership of a family of normally-aspirated engines and turbocharged engines. The engines were meant to be configurable in three displacements (1.8, 2.0 and 2.2 litres), although the E01e was the only engine revealed to date.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-18,"Gasoline Direct Injection engine (GDI and TGDI) – what is it, what does it promise and what are its drawbacks?","Proton Holdings today held a  at the Ricardo works in the UK. So, what is GDI and TGDI, and what does it mean in terms of engine design?GDI stands for Gasoline Direct Injection, and the T denotes Turbo.  In terms of Proton’s engine development, this means a move away from multi-point injection (MPI) where the injectors shoot fuel into the inlet tract to the more efficient GDI, with injectors firing directly into combustion chamber.It differs from other forms of fuel injection in that fuel is delivered at a much higher pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The advantage of this is fuel is able to be more accurately controlled in terms of volume and timing, resulting in more hp from a given engine capacity.The development of GDI is not new, having made its first appearance in aircraft engines over 120 years ago. The 1990s saw a rebirth of GDI, with Mitsubishi including it into its 4G93 engine. Other automakers followed suit through the 2000s, with BMW even trying out a low-pressure GDI in its V12.According to Proton, its GDI engine will give a fuel savings of 25% over the previous VVT engine in the Iriz. Typically, a GDI engine will work in one of three modes. In normal running, the ECU will set the GDI to as close to the stoichiometric ratio as possible, which in theoretical terms is 14.7:1 of air to petrol by mass.While perfect combustion is never achievable in the real-world, the engineering push towards this goal will result in better fuel efficiency and controlled emissions. For Proton’s new engines, this means working towards the forthcoming Euro 6C standard.At low engine speeds, where the engine is turning at or near idle, the ECU sets the engine up for an ultra lean burn.  While Proton didn’t say anything about how far they were going to push the limit, some engines from other manufacturers go as far as 65% lean, right on the verge of detonation. For wide-open throttle, GDI goes the other way, enriching the mixture to ensure that power is available, and a little left over for cooling. In TGDI applications, the fuel-air mixture can be optimised to suit boost pressure, and any changes in barometric pressure – which turbos can be sensitive to – that might affect the engine’s performance.The GDI path has the benefit of putting the fuel mixture in optimum position for the spark to propagate the flame front in the most efficient manner. This means the maximum amount of fuel is burnt during the combustion cycle for the maximum amount of power for piston speed. While MPI can do this, it is to a much lesser degree, and efficiency is subject to the porting of the inlet.So, if that’s the way it works, and the benefits, what are the drawbacks?  One is complexity. Instead of having injectors in the manifold or inlet tract, the injectors are shooting fuel directly into the combustion chamber.This means one injector per cylinder, sometimes two, depending on design. The cylinder head has to be redesigned to accommodate this. The other is that fuel delivery is under much higher pressure. The fuel delivery system has to be upgraded to suit, and this also means high pressure hoses and fittings.Also, GDI injectors are also more sensitive to contaminated fuel, or fuel containing too high a percentage of after-market additives in the wrong ratio. Sludging of the injectors and carbon build-up is a real possibility, since the injector orifices are much finer than in MPI.Because fuel is no longer sprayed on the back of intake valves, it is possible for build-up to occur on the intake ports. Stratification of the fuel mixture could also lead to carbon build-up on the chamber walls, with carbon contaminants blocking injectors and lodging in catalytic convertors, causing local hot spots and leading to the failure of the convertor. Some engine designers get around the problem of stratification and carbon build-up by using both GDI and port injection. The ECU in such engines, such as in the Toyota D-4S and VW’s EA888, is programmed to use either, or both, injectors, depending on load and engine state. All this costs money, and Proton says it spent RM600 million to develop the new range of engines. This complexity is somewhat off-set by the inclusion of diagnostic software to troubleshoot errors in the GDI.For Proton, the numbers it is looking for in the , already much higher than MPI 1.6 CFE, 138 hp, 205 Nm and 25% more efficient. In the short-term, GDI engines promise better fuel efficiency and more power per litre of fuel, while in the long-term, the reduced emissions will benefit the environment.",Mohan K Ramanujam

Does a move to the global market beckon?The current car is marketed more as a budget B-segment sedan with value-added features taking precedence over higher-quality trim, materials and gadgets. The repositioning would perhaps enable the Saga to be even more affordable, with a more competitive pricing structure.The move is said to be part of a larger effort to streamline Proton’s slightly confusing model range, with the upcoming lineup being wider in spread to promote a clearer separation between the models – and, we presume, to prevent  buyers from cross-shopping with the cheaper Saga, for instance.Harith also said that the Saga is a likely recipient of Proton’s upcoming three-cylinder VVT engines, displacing 1.0 litres and 1.2 litres. “In the future, the Proton Saga will be moved to the A-segment, or A+ segment, so the 1.0 litre engine would be suitable for that application,” he said, adding that the company is also at work on a turbocharged version of the 1.0 litre mill.Do note, however, that the new engines are not due to enter production before the end of 2017, so the upcoming 2016 Saga, to be launched later this year, could either use the 1.3 litre VVT engine from the Iriz or soldier on with the 1.3 litre IAFM+ mill from the current Saga.On the other hand, when quizzed on the future of the existing CamPro engines, Harith said that for certain markets, where emissions and fuel economy requirements are not as tight, Proton may continue using the older, cheaper powertrains. So question is this – would you pay extra for a more advanced engine in the next Saga?",Jonathan Lee

The company offers vehicle warranties for used, reconditioned and where required, new vehicles.Likewise, EWP Services has offered a similar service to its customers, but arrived to the market in 2013. The impending merger, which is set to be finalised before the end of January 2016, will see both companies operate under one roof, with a total of 200 workshops nationwide under its belt.“We don’t just pay lip service when we offer our warranties. Opal Warranty is a legitimate enterprise aimed at giving owners of older and reconditioned vehicles that all-important safety net which covers major repair bills,” said David Lee, the newly-appointed CEO of Opal Warranty.Those interested in Opal Warranty’s services may soon be able to visit the company’s new website, which is under construction at the moment. The company also highlighted that in the future, everyone, including non-Opal Warranty customers, may use the online site to book a vehicle service at any of the 200 panel workshops listed.A new mobile app has also been developed in conjunction with the merger.

He said that the engines will also undergo a comprehensive round of testing at Lotus and Ricardo, vendors for calibration and local Proton engineers.Collectively, the engines will be tested at 25 dyno test centres, encompassing around 250,000 hours of testing. That roughly translates to 4.8 million km on the road, to ensure the engine are stressed to their limits. The engine development project has a capital expenditure amounting to RM600 million alone.From the six engines presented, the 1.5 litre TGDI is stated as the most powerful of the bunch, with around 180 hp and 250 Nm on tap. No numbers were provided for the other engines presented, although they are claimed to offer 20% higher performance compared to previous Proton engines.Alternatively, we were told that the engines require at least RON95 fuel to function, and will be paired with a new torque converter CVT transmission as well. Proton say that the new transmission (said to be from Jatco) will be more efficient than what is currently offered, and they are in the final process of packaging the powertrains for future models.Both the GDI and TGDI engines are said to have a modular architecture, consisting of a cast iron block. “The engines have a modular design, so we can chop off one cylinder (from the four-cylinder engine) to make it a three-cylinder engine,” said Proton CEO Datuk Abdul Harith Abdullah.Proton is currently in the midst of optimising its current facilities, so the new engine family will stick to a cast iron block. “When the time is right, we will introduce a new aluminium block, which will reduce the weight of the engine,” said Proton vehicle development and engineering head, Amrizal Abd Majid. “As it is, the new family already utilises aluminium cylinder heads,” he added. Harith chimed in, saying that it is normal to pay a little bit more for new tech, but Proton will continue to manage its costs to stay very competitive in the market.The Euro 6C-compliant engines are said to feature a belt-driven starter generator, start/stop functionality, integrated exhaust manifold, Dual VVT and a timing chain. They’re said to have longer service intervals too. On the efficiency side of things, Proton is targeting a CO2 emissions level below 99 g/km. For the 1.0 litre, a fuel economy rating of 5.0 litres/100 km was cited, with 4.0 litres/100 km on the cards with some add-on tech.This is certainly an exciting time for Proton as its upcoming engine line-up will find its way into its new models. However, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon, as the engine’s development will only make its way to Malaysia in September 2016. Therefore, end application of the new engines are said to include end-2017 Proton models.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-18,Continuation of Open AP system in line with NAP’s goal to strengthen bumiputera participation – MITI,"The government’s decision to  is in line with the major goal of the National Automotive Policy 2014 (NAP 2014), which is to strengthen bumiputera participation in the national economy,  reports.“The continuation of an Open AP system will allow the participation of new bumiputera companies in the industry. It will provide the mechanism to strengthen and enhance bumiputera participation and the current 36% bumiputera equity in the sector,” Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) told the English language daily.The email statement said that a certain amount of the fees collected from the continuation of the Open AP system will be allocated to implement measures that have been outlined in NAP 2014 to increase the competitiveness of bumiputera companies in technology, human capital and supply chain development.According to , other concerns raised included the negative impact on the image of brands owned by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), investment by OEMs, government income in terms of taxes, implication on other supporting industries and services sectors, Malaysia’s international commitment in World Trade Organisation and free trade agreements, and investments made by current AP holders.MITI insisted that no one was left out during the review done by its consultant. “The consultant appointed for the study had consulted associations that represent various groups in the automotive industry such as assemblers, franchise holders and used-car dealers. Several major OEMs were also consulted. Thus, views and concerns of the industry were taken into consideration in the study/review,” the ministry said.MITI revealed some of parties consulted, including groups such as the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA), Kuala Lumpur & Selangor Car Dealers and Credit Companies Association and Persatuan Pengimport dan Peniaga Kenderaan Melayu (Pekema). The ministry said it also met with OEMs such as BMW Group Malaysia, Honda Malaysia, Mercedes-Benz Malaysia and UMW Toyota Motor. Views from NGOs such as the Consumers Association of Penang (CAP), Majlis Tindakan Ekonomi Melayu and Yayasan Kepimpinan Perdana were also noted.The AP system was introduced in the 1970s to encourage bumiputera participation in the used-car industry. It came into the spotlight a decade ago when it was revealed that a handful of individuals received the lion’s share of APs issued, and the “AP Kings”, as they were dubbed, monopolised the grey import industry. MITI issues two types of APs – Franchise APs for official franchise holders of car brands (Honda Malaysia, Bermaz Motor and BMW Malaysia, for example) and Open APs for bumiputeras to import cars of any brand and type.  says that latest figures by MITI showed that there are currently 100 companies holding Open APs and 22 companies given Franchise APs.Previously, there were plans to phase out the system. The 2009 NAP mentioned that Open APs would be terminated by the end of 2015, and Franchise APs by end 2020. In NAP 2014, the government said that it would appoint a company to do an  on bumiputera participation in the automotive industry. On December 23 last year, days before the system would have been ended according to the original timeline, MITI announced that the  but with improvements to the current system. The improvements, which are yet to be disclosed, will take effect from January 1, 2017. “The government will (also) launch a programme to use a portion of the open AP fees to enable the public to directly benefit from this new policy. The details of this programme will be announced later,” MITI said.“The research team opined that the current Open AP system gives opportunities to the public to purchase used imported cars at a competitive price. They also found that the distribution and importation of used cars industry contributed significantly to the automotive industry and the country’s socio-economic development,” it added.The ministry explained that the Open AP system’s contribution to supporting business and service sectors such as banking, insurance, shipping and logistics was estimated to be in the region of RM450 million per year, besides RM2 billion worth of taxes and fees to the government per year. The system, which the , also directly provided jobs to 3,800 high- and medium-income earners and makes up 5% of the 36% bumiputera equity in the automotive sector, it is claimed.“If the system were (to be) discontinued, there would be no more used imported cars allowed into the country and this would deny many people the opportunity to buy such cars. Also, the percentage of bumiputera equity participation in the automotive sector would reduce to 31%,” MITI warned.",Danny Tan

Inside, standard features such as electric seats, a tan leather interior and rear park distance control are also present.According to the company, the custom G-Wagen here was created for a TV series, so it’s definitely a one-off. It has clocked up some mileage too, all-in-all 66,948 km in total. It’s definitely not cheap despite that, as the Military Edition here is on sale for £46,995 (RM295,850).So all you TV buffs, do you recall seeing this army-themed G-Wagen in any TV series?

One of the weirder mainstays in the Japanese race series is the Toyota Prius GT300 entered by APR Racing, and with the arrival of the , so has the race car moved to the new shape.And what a shape it is. If you thought the old Prius racer was outlandish enough as is, the new car – adopting Toyota’s Keen Look design language, high-mounted arrow-shaped headlights and full-length tail lights – looks like a  race car from the future. That massive wing on the slammed rear end, sitting at the same height as the rear deck of the standard car, is absolutely ridiculous and ridiculously awesome all the same.As before, that shape (along with a small number of common components) is all that links the racer to the road car. And while the engine is now front-mounted instead of in the middle like before – thanks to new regulations requiring engineers to retain the standard engine placement – that engine remains the same fire-breathing RV8K 3.5 litre racing V8, used, among others, in Rebellion’s Le Mans prototypes.What’s more, to retain the “hybrid” bit, the racing Prius uses the same electric motor, battery and other gubbins as the standard car, which we imagine would be akin to using a motor from an electric pencil sharpener to propel an Airbus A380.The 2016 Super GT Championship is set to kick off at the Okayama International Circuit on April 9 to 10, and if APR Racing’s past experience is any indication, you can bet your bottom dollar that this little Prius will rough it out with the best of them.",Jonathan Lee

Only this one has dedicated itself to take on the harshest winter conditions, with its own modifications to do so. To ensure that snow will not trouble the Nissan Rogue (or  to us), it gets a full heavy-duty snow track system, with tracks measuring 76 cm in height, 122 cm in length, and each individual track measuring 38 cm in width. The installation of the tracks now results in a ground clearance measuring 58 cm.Obviously this doesn’t just involve swapping out the standard alloy wheels, which is why Quebec-based Motorsports in Action (MIA) not only had to make adjustments to the Rogue’s suspension, but also modify its bodywork and apply custom snow guards. Everything else on the Rogue however, remains stock. This includes the SUV’s all-wheel drive powertrain, which includes a 2.5 litre four-cylinder petrol engine with 170 hp and 237 Nm. Even the brand’s Xtronic CVT continues to feature in this concept. Has any of this worked? Well, judging by the accompanying video, the Nissan Rogue Warrior looks to be unstoppable as it trudges its way through the snow. According to Nissan, the concept has a top speed of 100 km/h, and is capable of scaling a 45-degree grade in groomed snow. Unfortunately, a vehicle like this wouldn’t have much of a purpose here, seeing how winter isn’t part of our annual seasons.

2016-01-18,Joining TPP pact will enable Malaysia’s automotive sector to compete against Thailand and Indonesia,"Joining the  agreement will be a positive move for Malaysia’s automotive sector, according to consulting firm . As  reports, the company says that being part of the 12-nation trade pact will allow the country to have a competitive advantage as an export hub for auto parts in the ASEAN region. Speaking to the news agency, Frost & Sullivan’s vice president of mobility Vivek Vaidya said that while Thailand was ahead of Malaysia on free trade agreements (FTAs), with several of these working well for it, the TPP is a ticket for Malaysia to gain back ground.The TPP would help Malaysian companies gain market access, create opportunities for skills, transfer technology as well as promote transparency and clarity to the industry, he said. The trade pact will enable industry players to enter into countries under the TPP – which account for 40% of global gross domestic product (GDP) – without being subjected to tax or custom barriers.“These players will find that they have an edge over Thailand,” he said, but added that a change in mindset was also needed. “Local players need to adapt to the ways in which other markets work. They need to be competitive. They cannot just carry on business as usual, they need to change,” Vivek explained.He added that brands like Mercedes-Benz, Honda and other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and component manufacturers that have production or manufacturing plants in Malaysia will gain by operating from here. “When Malaysia is part of TPP, the strategic attractiveness of Malaysia actually enhances because of market access to TPP member states,” he said.The results won’t be seen immediately though – Vivek said the agreement, which is expected to be signed in February, will not have any impact on the auto market this year or even the next. “It kicks in after 2018, but for the automotive sector, the tax reduction and excise duty elimination will only start from 2020,” he said.He added that another regional player that has an advantage from the TPP’s automotive point of view is Vietnam. “Vietnam is likely to benefit the most because it is more competitive in terms of labour rates,” he stated.Last November, it was reported that the TPP and other FTAs would , but some parties had , at least in the immediate future.

Earlier, we reported on , with the charge led by the  as well as the all-new .A stronger push towards diesels is also being explored, as shown by the debut of the GLE 250 d 4Matic, and so it was only natural for us to ask MBM’s vice president of marketing, Mark Raine, about potential developments on the hybrid front during the conversation we had with him at the launch of the three SUVs.Given that the company has been , the question was obviously if MBM had any plans to expand the product portfolio beyond the two models it is currently offering, namely the Mercedes-Benz  and , both of which are locally-assembled at its plant in Pekan.Raine said that since the company now had the assurance of that extension from the government, it was looking into further plans for hybrid models. “At the moment, we’re just looking at our strategy and product portfolio to see where hybrid models makes sense, and look at how we can expand our production plant capability even further,” he said.The news about the  for the domestic market prompted us to ask if the model was being considered for Malaysia. At the  last year, MBM had said that there were no plans to introduce the car here. Had its arrival in the Kingdom altered that view? It turns out that it has. “We’re exploring the possibility of the C 350 e Plug-In Hybrid, as well as other models,” Raine said. The car has to be locally-assembled to obtain the necessary tax reliefs, but the proximity of a production base close to these shores has undoubtedly helped pitch that possibility along. “Throughout Southeast Asia, we have local CKD production (in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia), and we have a close affiliation between all the components in the network. One of the things that we look at as a company is if we do go ahead and introduce something as a localised product, will it be easier for the other markets (in the region) to follow? Thailand having the C 350 e Plug-In Hybrid is a good basis on which we can build on, and so, yes, it makes it easier,” he stated.He added that any plans involving PHEVs needed to be meticulously explored. “It’s not just about briinging the car in. The crucial element is the infrastructure in the country, whuch we only have limited input on, and so that needs to be carefully thought out. We of course have a wallbox for customers to install in their home, but an infrastructure beyond that is needed.”The particular W205 C-Class variant is powered by a M274 DE 20 AL 2.0 litre petrol engine with the same output tune as the regular C 250, with 208 hp and 350 Nm for numbers. Working together with an 80 hp/340 Nm electric motor, combined power output for the car is 275 hp and 600 Nm.A high-voltage lithium-ion battery with a total capacity of 6.38 kWh provides the C 350 e with an all-electric range of 31 km. The battery can be recharged from an external power source in around 1.5 hours via a wallbox or through a 230 volt/16 ampere 3.7 kW single-phase public charging point.Alternatively, it can be tanked up via a domestic power socket, with a charge time of around two hours running off a 230 volt/13 ampere 3.0 kW single-phase supply. The engine can also juice up the battery to its maximum while on the go, though the commute has to be long enough to do so.",Anthony Lim

The XV facelift also sports slightly revised 17-inch two-tone machine-finished alloy wheels.Inside, the XV facelift retains the familiar layout of the current model, with the addition of a new 6.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system (or a double-DIN unit), keyless entry and start, 4WD, alloy pedals, multi-info display, additional steering controls and electric powered seats. Contrast stitching is also expected to feature in the XV as well. Under the hood, the familiar 2.0 litre DOHC four-cylinder boxer petrol engine soldiers on, developing 150 PS at 6,200 rpm and 196 Nm of torque at 4,200 rpm. Power is still transmitted through a six-speed Lineartronic CVT, with drive sent through the brand’s iconic Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive (SAWD) system (60:40 front/rear power split).The Subaru XV facelift is confirmed by Glenn Tan, executive director of Tan Chong International, to make its Malaysian debut in January 2016, and with this sighting, eager customers of the model need not wait much longer.

2016-01-18,Mercedes-Benz GLC to be locally assembled in Pekan?,"Mercedes-Benz Malaysia (MBM) has hinted that its new  may soon be locally assembled. The , alongside the  and , forming MBM’s new range of SUVs in the country.At the event, we quizzed MBM’s vice president of marketing, Mark Raine, about on the possibility of its SUVs being assembled locally in Malaysia. “Yes, it is definitely a possibility. Especially the GLC,” he answered.“We are seriously looking into that. Everyone knows that our  has come from our local production and local product portfolio which includes the ,  and . We’ve invested a lot and we strive to invest further, and obviously, as we expect the sales volume for these models to be quite considerable, we’re seriously looking into making them local as well,” Raine added. Clearly, the GLC is the first model on the VP’s mind. Reasonably, the larger SUVs, the GLE and GLE Coupe, may not be as heavy volume sellers just yet, giving reason to the company to test the waters with its most affordable SUV first.However, Raine explained that adding the GLC’s assembly to its current production plant is significantly easier said than done. Rather than just have to retool a production line at its , the company would have to make room for a whole new line alongside what’s already there.Unfazed by the idea, Raine remains optimistic about it instead, reflecting on a successful 2015 which he credits its assembly facility for. “We’re also looking at how we could expand our production plant even further because that allowed us to sell as many cars as we did in 2015. We increased our volume by 120% that year,” he concluded.No timeline was revealed by the MBM VP, but it almost looks certain at this point that the company would, at the very least, be locally-assembling its GLC SUV. As to which variants may make the cut, well, that’s anyone’s guess for now, too.",Chris Aaron
2016-01-17,"Ural sidecars coming to Malaysia – from RM80,000","Ural motorcycles is a Russian company that makes sidecars. Based on the BMW R71, the design was licensed to Russia in 1939, after Russia decided to modernise its army. Today, Ural makes 750 cc two-cylinder sidecar rigs that are decidedly retro in design, and is now being imported into Malaysia by Reed Motorcycle Company, with the first batch arriving in March 2016.Based in Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur, Reed Motorcycle decided to expand their motorcycle import business by bringing in Ural sidecars. The rational for doing so was to sell a unique product, and expand the involvement of the rider’s family and friends, especially those who don’t ride, and are intimidated by standard dual-purpose motorcycles.Mohamed Nik Faisullah Reed, managing director of Reed Motorcycle, said, “we first had the idea of importing Urals in 2014. After speaking to the Russians, and performing due diligence, we began the process of certifying the sidecar design with JPJ and obtaining the brand AP from the Ministry of Trade.”According to Nik, the process has almost been completed, and Reed Motorcycle is currently awaiting the approval letter from the ministry before shipment is despatched from the Ural works in Irbit, Sverdlovsk Orbast. The JPJ type approval for Ural sidecars is as a motorcycle, and Nik said anyone with a full ‘B’ license can ride one of these rigs on the road legally.The entire range of Ural sidecars is being shipped in, in both one-wheel and two-wheel drive forms. The price will range from RM80,000 to RM140,000 depending on model and specifications. Ural does not make solo motorcycles after finding demand did not justify production.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-15,RON 100 fuel in Malaysia – what does it mean to you?,"The launch of  in Malaysia has raised the interest and curiosity of many drivers. Aside from the price, which has attracted its own set of supporters and detractors, many have asked about the possible benefits, and curiously, the drawbacks of using RON 100 on a regular basis.Among the many questions are whether the increased octane number will harm the engine, or the engine needs re-tuning. The answer, as with many things car related,  is both simple and hard.Let’s go back to chemical engineering 101 for a moment. RON stands for Research Octane Number.  This number represents the ‘knock-resistance’ of the fuel. Knocking is the car world’s slang term for premature ignition or detonation.This is when fuel in the combustion chamber ‘explodes’ before it is supposed to, giving rise to a ‘knocking’ or ‘pinging’. This is not a good thing in combustion engines, especially those running on petrol. A holed piston is the usual result, with the expensive overhaul that follows.High performance engines, running high compression ratios, are prone to detonation when using low RON fuel. It might also be surprising to learn that older, low compression engines are also prone to detonation, but the reasons why they happen are different.Most modern engines, with Programmable Fuel Injection (PGM-FI), are able to run on RON numbers as low as 88, and as high as 103. But, if the manufacturer classifies the engine as high performance, with high-compression pistons or a turbocharger, a minimum RON will be specified to prevent detonation, and damage to the engine.For an older engine, running on carburettors, detonation occurs with low RON fuel because carbon build-up in the combustion chamber allows ‘hot-spots’ to develop, creating conditions where detonation can occur, especially on a hot day and under load.The ECU will take readings from the knock sensor when detonation occurs, and retard or advance the ignition timing accordingly. There is a limit to the level of adjustment, of course, hence most manufacturers will put a little sticker on the inside of the fuel-filler cap saying the minimum fuel the engine will take.Another thing is the calorific capacity, or the energy contained in the fuel and released when it is burned, is specific. Hence, the amount of power available from burning the fuel is a finite number, and RON has no bearing on that.What is intended with high RON numbers is the ability to run the engine at high compression ratios and advanced ignition timing. However, a high compression ratio usually means a very small combustion chamber volume, which leads to detonation.So, does a normal, normally-aspirated, four-cylinder family sedan require RON 100 petrol? Probably not, because the cost of fuel will outweigh the the possible benefits of the possible power increase. Not all modern turbo engines will require high RON fuel either, because the boost pressure, sized for efficiency rather than performance, does not need it.Will the ECU need re-flashing or the engine re-tuned because there’s RON 100 in the fuel tank?  Again, probably not, because the ECU will advance the ignition to the brink of detonation, and no more. Once it reaches the limit of advance, the rest of the RON 100 will simply be blown out the exhaust as un-burnt fuel (which is another bad thing in and of itself).The benefit of running RON 100 is primarily for very high-performance engines, or performance motorcycle engines, where heavy loads are placed on the high-compression engine that allow it to produce huge hp figures.While using a lower RON fuel in a high performance engine may cause reliability issues in the long run or a loss of power, what will not happen is damage to the engine because of using RON 100 fuel or any higher RON than what is recommended. Nor is there any necessity for engine tuning, unless running a highly-modded engine, or the engine’s manufacturer calls for it.The long and short of it is, high performance engines  benefit to a higher degree from using fuel with a higher RON number, while the perceived increase in performance will not be as noticeable in a less powerful engine.As for those who think using RON 100 will damage your engine, science says otherwise.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-15,DRIVEN: Mercedes-Benz GLC250 – Star Utility Vehicle,"As noted in recent , the shift towards SUVs and crossovers from the traditional sedan and hatchback is real, and very strong. Not endemic to a particular region, it’s a worldwide phenomenon, from China to the USA.  and  that latched on early to the trend have profited greatly. None more than BMW, which came out with the X3 way back in 2003. The E83 had challenging looks, but together with the original X1 (which wasn’t a looker either) that surfaced in 2009, the duo enjoyed a lion’s share of the mid-size and compact SUV market for the best part of a decade. Audi hopped on the gravy train in 2008 with the Q5, and the successful model still looks pretty fresh for a . The  and  are just around the corner.Where was Mercedes-Benz in all of this? It wasn’t absent. Stuttgart had the  based on the previous-gen . The reason we’re unfamiliar with the  is because it was never made in right-hand drive due to technical reasons. But even if it was, this writer suspects that the GLK wouldn’t have had the upper hand against its German rivals. Enter the , launched this week in Malaysia. Armed with a new name, newfound curves and riding on the three-pointed star’s purple patch; the X253 is gunning for the title from the get go. We get acquainted with the segment’s fresh face over a weekend.While the GLK looks as if it was drawn solely by ruler, the GLC is all curves. The design is unmistakably modern Mercedes-Benz, a look that has won new fans for the core sedan range of C, E and S; as well as the compact . The GLC’s face could be mistaken for any of the above, but items such as the hollowed two-a-side louvres and the four chrome “teeth” below the bumper distinguish the SUV.Mercedes-Benz Malaysia (MBM) has elected to sell the GLC exclusively in AMG Line, and the chrome bits on the “sump guard” are part of this trim level. That’s mirrored in the rear apron, sandwiched by pipes on each side, but without chrome and in a pack of three. The AMG Line also brings an aggressive front bumper with prominent finned side “air intakes” (no holes, for aesthetics) and just a light dose of chrome. To these eyes, it looks significantly better than , which has rounder edges and liberal portions of the shiny stuff. Ditto the rear bumper, which gets a slim chrome strip as accent. MBM added one item that’s not on the AMG menu; the side running boards beef up the profile and visually link the front and rear chrome strips.     The GLC wears eye-catching jewellery in the form of LED headlamps, C-Class-style single-stroke LED daytime running lights and positioning lamps seemingly made up of many tiny light studs. The rear lamps get two LED bars each.A special mention for the lovely 20-inch AMG alloys that contribute greatly to the GLC’s appearance. The multi-spoke rims, the largest available for this model, fill the arches nicely and is a dead ringer for the wheels on the W204 C 63 AMG in our office carpark. Matches perfectly with our grey tester, which in my opinion looks a lot better (classier, lines stand out more) than  displayed at the launch event, but I could be . Equipped as such, the GLC is a good looking SUV with a sporty character, although the rear end – like the  – is too organic and pear-shaped for my liking – Audi’s Q SUVs do a better job of emphasising width.     Speaking of which, the GLC is 8 mm narrower than a Q5, and wider than the X3 by the same margin. At 4,656 mm, the Merc is as long as the BMW, but we’re not looking at big footprint differences here. What’s significant is the GLC’s height of 1,639 mm, which is 16 mm lower than the Q5 and 39 mm lower than the X3. The lower roofline, combined with a long wheelbase (33 mm longer than the  at 2,873 mm; X3 2,810 mm, Q5 2,807 mm) and minimal overhangs could be what gives the GLC its sleek profile. Combine the dimensions with the styling direction and you get a nett effect that’s rather distanced from the X3, which is more upright and rugged in image. Your pick.The GLC looks pretty slippery for its kind, and Mercedes says that its Cd value of 0.31 and total aerodynamic drag of 0.794 is best in class. Shape aside, measures to improve aero include the sealing of the radiator and headlamp surrounds, a radiator shutter, the extended roof spoiler and a smoothened underbody.Reducing weight was also on the agenda. The use of hot-formed high-strength steel in the structure and aluminium for the front wings, roof, bonnet and suspension has cut mass by 80 kg over the GLK, which was smaller in size. The use of a new compact transfer case as an add-on module and magnesium transmission housing saved 12 kg over the previous model. Although Mercedes has done a good job in making the GLC look like a stand-alone model, it’s based on the C-Class, like how  is related to the A-Class. This is effectively the C-Class of the newly-named SUV range, which includes the GLA, GLE and the , with Coupe variants to take on even-numbered BMW X models with sloping roofs.Under the GLC 250’s long hood sits the M274 2.0 litre engine with 211 hp at 5,500 rpm and 350 Nm of torque available from 1,200 to 4,000 rpm. This turbocharged four-cylinder is the same unit powering the . But unlike the sedan, which has seven forward gears, the GLC uses a nine-speed 9G-Tronic torque converter automatic transmission. The powertrain combo is good for a 0-100 km/h sprint time of 7.3 seconds and a top speed of 223 km/h, predictably slower than the lighter saloon, which does 6.6 seconds and a capped 250 km/h. The GLC’s acceleration time beats the X3 xDrive 20i’s (184 hp, 270 Nm, 8.2 seconds), but not the 225 hp/350 Nm Q5 2.0 TFSI’s 7.1 seconds. The brand’s 4Matic permanent all-wheel drive system is standard, with a basic drive torque split of 33:67 front-rear. It works together with ESP, ASR and 4ETS dynamic handling control systems, with a multiple-disc clutch in the centre differential assisting in very low grip situations, such as on snow or ice. A basic locking force of 50 Nm between the axles provides a significant increase in traction with the same high level of stability, Mercedes says. The GLC is certainly fast and grippy enough, and I suspect that its reserves will be deeper than most typical owners would probe. Unlike the stereotypical Malaysian GLC, Merc’s GLC is agile and the standard sports suspension keeps a tight control on proceedings. It corners flatly and resists understeer well, which surprised me the first time around. Ride comfort on the sports suspension is on the firm side in big bump absorption with not a lot of travel – you’d want to avoid those potholes and slow down for speed bumps, but it never gets uncomfortable or jarring. Very decent actually, when one considers that it rides on 20-inch wheels. No heavy price to pay for those fancy shoes.The GLC’s steering is quick and direct, if ultimately lacking in road feel compared to . Not a deal-breaker in any case, and most SUV shoppers would not even notice, this writer suspects. The SUV’s Dynamic Select system has a couple of preset modes – Eco, Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and Individual – that one can tweak and customise (Individual). I don’t have a fetish for heavy steering and usually avoid Sport in selectable systems, but the GLC’s Sport steering mode is friendly enough at low urban speeds while adding a dollop of weight at speed. Good enough as a default, whether in C or S. Note that Dynamic Select does not alter damper settings. The 2.0 litre turbo engine is a known quantity, and it performs as expected to give the GLC a decent turn of speed. M274 has a new partner in 9G-Tronic, but the experience isn’t worlds apart from the old combo, save for perhaps cruising economy, which we did not measure.What we can tell you is that the GLC is a great cruiser thanks to a well-insulated and refined drivetrain. It’s even possible to waft around in town and flow with traffic off-boost. Driven in such a manner, in Comfort mode, the gearbox is similarly relaxed with delayed response. The drivetrain’s Sport mode hurries things up but isn’t too aggressive – shifts are fast and overlap smoothly. Nine speeds is a bit of an overkill if you ask this dinosaur, but you don’t really feel it in practice, which is good.Good as the GLC’s drivetrain is, it doesn’t expose the X3 and Q5 as slow and clumsy old geezers. That’s where the Merc’s cabin comes in. It’s all C-Class in here, which is no bad thing. The dashboard layout is typical modern Mercedes, characterised by three central round AC vents and an iPad-style screen in the middle. An AMG interior styling package has been specified, and it includes Artico leather, a flat-bottomed three-spoke steering wheel and open-pore black ash wood trim. The latter looks fabulous and brings about a warm, rich feel to the cabin; the opposite effect of tacky piano black. Go ahead and touch it, just don’t tap it, as the hollow sound response will be anticlimactic. Audi, in the , does dark wood much better.Yours truly is pretty much a “free size” guy when it comes to cars and rarely have issues with ergonomics, but I found the GLC’s centre stack intrusive, restricting my left knee. Could be just me, though, as colleagues who took the car for short spins did not report the same. The driver’s seat could do with more thigh support, but the extendable seat base is good.  Nitpicking aside, the cabin is a classy effort, highlighted by details such as the texture of the AC buttons and the 13-speaker Burmester surround sound system’s elaborate speaker grilles. Even if you’re not an audiophile, it’s sure to impress your mates. What won’t is the basic Audio 20 system and its 7.0-inch screen with thick bezel, plus the lack of a . The C 250 has the latter, linked to a COMAND Online multimedia system and a larger . Audio 20 is packaged with a Garmin Map Pilot navigation system, which doesn’t look the sleekest. That aside, the GLC 250 is very well-equipped. In addition to the above-mentioned AMG exterior and interior packages, and Burmester audio, MBM’s mid-size SUV also comes with a panoramic glass roof, three-zone air con (rear vents with fan speed and temp control), Active Parking Assist and a 360-degree camera with bird’s eye aerial view. The latter stitches together images from cameras located below the wing mirrors, under the front three-pointed star and above the rear license plate, to further aid parking.There’s more convenience in the form of an electric tailgate with Hands-Free Access, which lets one open the tailgate by swiping his/her foot under the rear bumper. That, and the push button folding rear seats – which expands the boot capacity from 550 litres to 1,600 litres – are practical features for weekend trips to Ikea. Stylish it may be, but the GLC is a good family SUV as well. The Mercedes-Benz GLC may have been late to the party, but it arrives at an opportune time, riding on the brand’s fantastic current form. Despite the age of the BMW X3 and Audi Q5, the GLC doesn’t quite obliterate them in the driving department like a young athlete would – but the Merc’s repertoire of refinement, style, a classy interior and showroom appeal puts it ahead of the pack. And if you’re not entirely convinced, the attractive price of RM328,888 should help with the decision making.",Danny Tan
2016-01-15,SPYSHOTS: Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate All-Terrain,"Following the  in Detroit recently, the S213 E-Class Estate was spotted undergoing cold-weather testing in Sweden. , the estate here appears to be wearing the same amount of camouflage as before, not revealing any more than we’ve already seen.Or, does it? Take a closer look at the front bumper of this, and if you look closely it appears that this E-Class estate has a bit of a protective skid plate. Everything else about this vehicle appears to be the same as the one we spied before, except for that one curious protective panel, which is very likely an indication that this is a lot more than your ordinary E-Class Estate.What we’re looking at here is the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate All-Terrain – a proper rival for  and  types. Coincidentally, current rumours have it that Mercedes-Benz is planning to reveal two versions of its S213 E-Class – one a conventional estate and the E-Class All-Terrain seen here.There’s very little that is publicly known about the vehicle, but we expect it to feature a higher ground clearance and additional protective plates (as seen above) than the regular model. While a 4Matic all-wheel drive system is sure to be included, we suspect that Mercedes-Benz may also equip its All-Terrain with an Off-road Engineering Package to aid excursions of the sort.The E-Class Estate is expected to make its global debut in September 2016, saving a potential date with the Frankfurt Motor Show. A similar look and feel to the car is almost certain, save for its extended cargo capacities. Powertrains should equally mirror what the W213 has at hand along with a few more engine variants that haven’t been launched yet.Speaking of which, don’t be too surprised to see the return of a new,  Estate either. With the E 63 itself poised to be revolutionary, the addition of the estate’s capacities will be the the icing on the cake for European markets where hot estates are typically in hot demand.",Chris Aaron
2016-01-15,"Mercedes-Benz Malaysia outlines strategy for 2016 – A-Class facelift soon, W213 E-Class before year-end","Exciting news, folks! It has been confirmed that Mercedes-Benz Malaysia (MBM) will next be introducing the  here in the country, with the  set to follow suit before the end of the year.At the recent launch of MBM’s new line of SUVs, the ,  and , we caught up with its vice president of marketing, Mark Raine, for a quick chat about his company’s plans for 2016.The enthusiastic VP, gleaming with confidence from a , was understandably unwilling to reveal too much details just yet, but did confirm the arrival of said models and outlined a strategy of what else we could see from MBM this year.Raine confirmed that the arrival of the  would happen sooner rather than later, but  didn’t say when exactly. Hearsay, however, suggests that it would be some time in Q1. More interestingly, when we asked him about the possibility of there being a diesel-powered A-Class in the new line-up, Raine said, “yes, that’s definitely on the cards.”MBM’s confidence in diesel power has been steadily growing. He said, “launching the , the  and now the , our third diesel model, it’s a clear testament that we believe that there’s a certain potential in the diesel market in Malaysia. With , this obviously also encourages us to bring more diesel products here.”It didn’t take long for us to divert our conversation with Raine towards the new , with the most obvious point of interest being, “when?” Clearly excited about the prospect himself, the VP said, “at the later part of the year, we will be introducing the new E-Class. We’re currently preparing for it and we’re very much looking forward to it.”“I believe the new E-Class is a fantastic product. It’s got so many highlights, ranging from the interior value perception to the amount of new features the vehicle has. It is just mind-blowing,” he exclaimed. But rather than focus on specific models only, Raine explained that MBM will also be looking into adding more “depth” to its range of products.He said, “over the last 12 to 18 months or so, you’ve witnessed our product offensive. We carefully drafted a strategy that included the , ,  collection, and now, the SUVs.”“With the launch of the SUVs completing our four pillar segments, throughout the year, we will be launching new vehicles for each of these segments – not just new vehicles, but new variants, like the CLS 250d for instance,” said the VP.Clearly, the move is something we’ve already begun to take notice of, seeing as how MBM recently added an , and as Raine mentioned, the CLS 250d being added alongside the existing CLS 400. We also hear that a CLA 250 and possibly a C 300 variant may be on the cards for the near future as well.“We’ve got the width from our product portfolio that we’ve wanted to have, now, we have to get the depth and quality right – in terms of having the right setup for Malaysia. I believe that giving customers a bigger variety and more options by optimising our products to meet their needs is crucial and we will continue on that path,” Raine concluded.",Chris Aaron
2016-01-15,MINI John Cooper Works Convertible – drop-top fun,"The F56 MINI John Cooper Works which debuted in December, 2014, is a . However, there are those who longed for an even more exciting version of the hot hatch. Therefore, MINI has answered those demands with the introduction of the new MINI JCW Convertible.With the driver now able to expose himself/herself to the elements, it should make for a whole lot more thrilling ride, right? Anyways, the soft-top version of the MINI JCW retains much of the go-fast bits from the hard-top. Under the hood, the B58 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine still produces 231 hp at 5,200-6,000 rpm and 320 Nm at 1,250-4,800 rpm, sent to the front wheels.When paired with a six-speed manual or six-speed Steptronic auto, the JCW Convertible will accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 6.6 seconds (0.3 seconds slower than the hard-top) and 6.5 seconds (0.4 seconds slower than the hard-top), respectively. The top speed also receives a downgrade from the hard-top’s 246 km/h to 242 km/h in the manual variant, and 240 km/h for the auto variant.The main visual distinction is of course the fully-electrically-powered soft-top. According to MINI the folding operation now operates at a lower decibel count, and takes just 18 second to open or close. The sliding roof function is available at any road speed, but if closing and opening the roof can only be done below 30 km/h. Oh, you can specify the roof with a Union Jack graphic as well.Beyond that however, everything remains nearly unchanged from the hard-top JCW. The 17-inch John Cooper Works Race Spoke light alloy wheels are still here (with optional 18-inch ones), along with LED head- and tail lights, large air intakes in place of the fog lamps and new front apron. For those looking to add a bit more style, JCW hood stripes as well as exterior and interior components from the John Cooper Works Pro design line are available.Inside, the cabin can be specified with a host of optional equipment, including a MINI heads-up display, two-zone automatic air-conditioning, a navigation system with MINI Touch Controller, any many more. Standard equipment include JCW sports seats, fully integrated rollover protection bars, MINI Connected in-car infotainment and a JCW leather steering wheel.As for safety and driving assistance systems, the JCW Convertible comes with Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) as standard with DTC (Dynamic Traction Control), EDLC (Electronic Differential Lock Control) and Performance Control. A Dynamic Damper Control is also available for the convertible as an option.With both models of the MINI John Cooper Works now out in the open, which one do you fancy most? The hard-top variant is  for RM288,888 (OTR without insurance), and we should expect the convertible to make its way here as well.",Gerard Lye

Both the Ioniq and the Prius lay claim to featuring an internal-combustion engine with the world’s highest thermal efficiency at 40%, so it’ll be interesting to see which one actually comes out tops.In any case, Hyundai’s mill is mated to a 32 kW (43.5 PS)/170 Nm permanent magnet synchronous electric motor, a lithium-ion polymer battery and a six-speed dual-clutch transmission – as such, total system output is rated at 141 PS at 5,700 rpm and 265 Nm of torque in first gear, and 235 Nm in all other gears.The electric motor was specifically designed for world-class efficiency, with optimisation measures including up to 10% thinner core components (electrical steel sheet) and rectangular-section copper wire for reduced core and copper loss. The motor enables the Ioniq to run in pure electric mode at speeds of up to 120 km/h.Meanwhile, the aforementioned DCT is claimed to feature best-in-class transfer efficiency through the use of low-friction bearings and low-viscosity transmission oil. It also features Sport and Eco modes – the former holds on to lower gears for longer, while the latter shifts up earlier to higher gears for maximum fuel efficiency.Built on a new dedicated platform, the Ioniq benefits from a number of weight-saving measures, including the use of an aluminium bonnet and tailgate, cutting as much as 12.4 kg off an equivalent steel version. The material is also used on a large proportion of suspension parts to save around 10 kg, including total of 4.6 kg off the front lower arms and 7.14 kg off the rear lower arms. Even the cargo cover on the Ioniq is around 25% lighter than on other Hyundai models thanks to lightweight components and a more compact optimised build.Under the skin, a multilink rear suspension system with dual lower arms enhances ride comfort, while the steering has been tuned for clear and precise response and feedback, with an increased steering gear ratio adding to a sportier character. As with most hybrids, the Ioniq is fitted with low rolling resistance tyres for improved efficiency, while models fitted with 17-inch wheels come with silica tyres for better performance.The brakes have also been optimised to maximise regenerative braking performance. A third-generation energy recuperating stopping system, Integrated Brake Assist Unit (iBAU) and Pressure Source Unit (PSU) reduces noise and friction, contributing to increased energy recuperation and efficiency. Outside, the Ioniq has been designed to efficiently manage the airflow around the exterior. Flexible body panels, front wheel air curtains, external active air flap, rear spoiler and diffuser, side sill mouldings, floor undercover and closed wheel design contribute to a class-leading drag coefficient figure of just 0.24 Cd.The interior is dominated by a 1280×720-pixel seven-inch TFT LCD instrument display that shows a range of digital gauges in high resolution, including a number of hybrid-specific displays like the current system operation or status. There’s also an infotainment system that supports both  and  connectivity, along with a Qi wireless induction smartphone charger.Other features include a memory function for the driver’s seat, heated front and rear seats, a climate control system with efficient operation and driver-only modes and an Eco-Driving Assistant System (ECO-DAS) that assesses the driving route and enables the most efficient battery charging or extra motor assistance as required by the predicted road conditions, as well as encouraging efficient coasting.Space is freed up through the efficient packaging of the hybrid components, including the location of the battery under the seats to ensure uncompromised passenger and cargo area usability. Boot space is claimed to be class-leading, with the rear seats folding flat to extend the cargo capacity to 750 litres.Comfort is key, so the Ioniq comes with in-dash insulation to minimise engine noise, while floor panel damping, enhanced A- and B-pillar fillings, thicker window glass and noise-cancelling windscreen film further reduces NVH. The suspension has also been specially tuned for superior ride quality.Eco-friendly and recyclable materials find their way onto a Hyundai for the first time, such as interior door covers made from recycled plastic and powdered wood and volcanic stone, trimming 20% of mass compared to conventional materials. The headlining and carpet also feature raw materials extracted from sugar cane, while eco-friendly paint with soybean oil ingredients produce metallic finishes on some components.Safety-wise, the Ioniq’s body utilises 53% advanced high strength steel for superior rigidity, improving handling and safety with high impact energy absorption and minimised distortion. Body structure improvements also ensures strength and durability in the event of a crash, complemented by a high-strength fiber-reinforced rear bumper. Up to seven airbags are available, including one for the driver’s knee.The long list of available active safety features includes Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Blind Spot Detection, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Lane Change Assist, Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS), Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), Smart Cruise Control and a Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS).",Jonathan Lee
2016-01-15,Motorcycle sales fall after GST introduced: 19.2% drop,"Motorcycle sales in Malaysia have dropped since the implementation of GST, according to Koji Onishi, chief executive officer of Boon Siew Honda. Speaking at the launch of the  at Berjaya Times Square, Kuala Lumpur, today, Onishi said between April and December 2015, 261,851 motorcycles were sold in Malaysia, compared to 324,180 units for the same period in 2014.This represents a 19.22% decrease in sales numbers. “Retail sales were slower in October, November and December, with an average 6,600 unit sales monthly. In a nutshell, the motorcycle market is shrinking due to the economic downturn,” Onishi explained.The launch of the Wave Dash FI is part of Honda’s plan to revitalise motorcycle sales in Malaysia. “Honda is putting effort into developing new models in order to sustain competitiveness. Boon Siew Honda will be launching more new models as part of efforts to re-energise the motorcycle market and increase overall sales volume,” Onishi said.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-15,SPIED: Hyundai i30 goes cold testing under wraps,"The new Hyundai i30 has been spotted again, this time undergoing testing in a winter environment. The test mule here still sports the same heavy camo that was originally  back in August, 2015, hiding a lot of its visual changes.Those rally-style lights are certainly not going to be in the final production version. However, the bumper and grille section on which it is mounted does appear to be wider than before. The slender headlamps from that are fitted on the current model also shows little changes. Moving downwards, the LED DRLs now appear to be accompanied by a set of repositioned fog lamps as well. Around the rear, the car’s shoulders looks to be a little more upward sloping, which does make the roofline appear less sleek compared to the current model. However, the substantial camo applied on the prototype makes it hard to confirm that point. Also, the “new” rear end also appear to sport larger tail lights. No details on the available engine options for the new i30 as of now, but expect the usual variety of petrol and diesel units to be offered. of these, Hyundai’s 1.6 litre turbocharged T-GDI Gamma engine (186 PS/265 Nm) from the  looks to be a returning member.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-15,Frost & Sullivan predicts vehicle sales drop for 2015 and 2016; Honda and Perodua continue to lead,"Frost & Sullivan expects vehicles sales in Malaysia to contract in 2016, with the market research firm predicting a total of 648,000 units to be sold for the year, representing a 1.44% decline year-on-year. Additionally, barring the Malaysian Automotive Association’s sales data, it predicts vehicle sales in 2015 to end at 657,500 units, a 1.3% drop from the numbers obtained in 2014 (666,465).Vivek Vaidya, vice president of mobility at Frost & Sullivan attributed the projected decline in total industry volume (TIV) in 2016 to increasing economic pressures, the weakening ringgit, price hikes and tightening of credit approvals. “OEMs are compelled to increase the prices due to rising costs. If the crude oil price continues on its downward spiral, the ringgit will also continue to weaken, putting immense pressure on OEMs as well as component suppliers,” he added.However, new models that are scheduled to be launched this year are expected to help boost vehicle sales in the country. Frost & Sullivan also cited the continuation of various incentives under the National Automotive Policy (NAP) based on EEVs and local assembly will assist manufacturers in increasing their competitiveness and in maintaining their prices.As for Frost & Sullivan’s 2015 estimates, Vaidya cited the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the depreciating ringgit behind the dip in sales. He said, “despite several OEMs reducing the prices of cars after the implementation of GST, the economic downturn, weakening ringgit, and increase in cost of living and cost-of-ownership discouraged buyers from making big purchases.”Diving into the TIV for 2015, passenger vehicles accounted for approximately 583,000 units, a 0.9% decline from 2014. Perodua continues to lead the market with a 36.2% share of the passenger vehicle segment. Honda meanwhile, maintained its top position in the non-national car segment with a market share of 15.9%.Vaidya commented, “Honda’s market share growth was backed by strong sales of the Jazz, City and the newly launched HR-V. Despite tough market conditions, the passenger vehicle segment also saw several model/facelift introductions, which includes the Myvi, HR-V, Mercedes C-Class, and Mazda 3.”On the mention of Mercedes-Benz, the German marque had a fruitful 2015 in the premium cars category, with a double-digit increase in market share from 32% in 2014 to 48% in 2015. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is just one of the vehicles that largely contributed to this boost in sales.Moving on to the commercial vehicles market, Frost & Sullivan reports a 4.6% retraction to 74,500 units in 2015. While other categories saw a decline, pick-up trucks experienced a marginal growth of 1%. Pick-ups accounted for approximately 73% of the commercial vehicle market, with the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger and Isuzu D-Max leading the sales charts.Toyota continued to lead the commercial vehicle market with a 36.8% market share, even with competition from brands like Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Ford, all of which introduced all-new or facelifted version of their respective pick-up trucks.",Gerard Lye
2016-01-15,No defeat devices in Renault vehicles undergoing vehicle emission testing by French government,"Following Volkswagen’s , an independent technical commission was created by the French Government, the purpose of which was to verify whether French car manufacturers had not installed equivalent devices in their vehicles. Testing on around 100 vehicles in circulation are underway, carried out by the UTAC (French Homologation Authority, mandated by the Ministry), and the list includes 25 Renault vehicles. It was revealed that at the end of December last year, 11 vehicles had already been tested, including four Renault vehicles, enabling the French public authorities to initiate productive discussions with Renault’s engineering team.The French Agency for Energy and Climate (DGEC), which is the main contact for the independent technical commission, already considers that the on-going procedure will not reveal the presence of a defeat device on Renault’s vehicles, the automaker said through a statement. It however added that the French General Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) decided to carry out additional on-site and material investigations in order to definitively confirm the first findings resulting from the analysis of the independent technical commission. The DGCCRF has visited Renault’s headquarters, the Renault Technical Centre in Lardy and the Technocentre in Guyancourt, and Renault says its teams are fully cooperating with the independent technical commission and the additional investigations decided by the Ministry of Economy.",Anthony Lim

2016-01-15,Continental Malaysia launches CNY safety campaign,"The Chinese New Year holidays will soon be upon us, and for some, that means a trip back to the hometown. Given the erratic weather these days, it pays to check the condition of your tyres to ensure they operate well – be it in the dry or wet – to make sure the journey back is a safe one.  shares the same sentiment, which is why it has launched its Chinese New Year Road Safety Campaign 2016.The campaign is a collaboration with , and will take place from January 9-31, 2016, with the aim of educating motorists on tyre safety habits and prioritising vehicle maintenance. To create this awareness, CTM will conduct tyre safety and car engine oil checks at 15 Shell petrol stations nationwide, with the first already held in Kuala Lumpur on January 9 and 10, 2016.Those who partake in the CSR campaign will receive a booklet from CTM featuring tyre maintenance tips, Continental premiums and a RM30 voucher for Continental tyre purchase. Additionally, Shell Malaysia will be handing out promotional vouchers where with the purchase of any  or  product, one free petrol cash voucher will be provided.That’s not all, because 100 new SIRIM approved helmets will be given away for free to motorcyclists to replace uncertified helmets at each location, courtesy of JKJR.  The full list of location and dates of CTM’s Chinese New Year Road Safety Campaign 2016 is provided below, and each campaign held on the mentioned dates will run from 10 am to 8 pm.“Tyres are the sole point of contact between the vehicle and the road,” said CTM managing director Cameron Wilson. “In a critical situation, it is the tyre that determines whether the vehicle can stop in time, or whether it stays safely on course through a corner.”He stressed on the importance of tyres having adequate tread depth and, more importantly, that they were inflated to the correct pressure. “Studies from different tyre manufacturers prove over and over again that more than 50 percent of all passenger cars permanently are driven with under inflated tyres,” Wilson said.“Tests with underinflated tyres show increased risk of adverse safety consequences in emergency situations. Clearly, correct tyre inflation pressure and sufficient tread depth mean fewer accidents and this can mean the difference between life and death. And this is the key message that we hope to spread to the entire nation.”",Gerard Lye

He disclosed that 21 people have since been arrested, while 56 cloned cars have been seized. Under Section 18 of the MACC Act 2009 and the Penal Code, those involved or in possession of cloned vehicles can be investigated for falsifying documents. Upon conviction, individuals can be jailed for not less than 20 years, along with a fine. Meanwhile, the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA) has warned against buying these cloned cars, stating that it was against the law. “If it is too good to be true, it probably is,” said MAA president Datuk Aishah Ahmad. She added that said cars would face issues when it comes to the renewing road tax and obtaining insurance coverage.On that note, proposals by the JPJ to implement a vehicle ownership certificate system to replace the current registration card system from April 1, 2016, was well-received by the MAA. “The new system will allow car owners to check online on vehicle details.

2016-01-15,Dieselgate – California rejects VW’s diesel fix plan,"While Volkswagen may have attained an approval for its , its plan for a fix in the US has not met the same fate, as more ‘‘ drama for Volkswagen in the US ensues. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has rejected Volkswagen’s plan to fix its 2.0 litre TDI cars equipped with defeat devices,  reports. According to the board, the proposed fix was declared as “incomplete, substantially deficient and falls far short of meeting the legal requirements.” To add to that, the board also said that the implementation of the proposal was not soon enough. It detailed that the proposed plans “contain gaps” and “lack sufficient details.” Secondly, it stated that the descriptions of the proposed repairs “lack enough information for a technical evaluation.” Lastly, the proposal does not “adequately address overall impacts on vehicle performance, emissions and safety,” CARB said through a statement.The rejection, however, extends only to the automaker’s 2.0 litre diesel mills. The submission of the recall plan for  units are only due to the board on February 2. This covers a total of 80,000 vehicles not just from Volkswagen, but from Porsche and Audi as well.A confidential letter was sent to Volkswagen by the board, in which a detailed explanation was provided as to why the proposed solution or fix doesn’t work. Following this, investigations and talks with Volkswagen are set to continue, the board disclosed.To add to the headache, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also in agreement with CARB’s rejection, it said in a statement. “That Volkswagen has not submitted an approvable recall plan to bring the vehicles into compliance and reduce pollution. EPA has conveyed this to the company previously,” it noted.In a statement by the automaker, it notes that is still in talks to find a solution.

The MotoGP race remains unchanged from October 28 to 30 as the 18th round of the championship.Speaking to exclusively to  at the annual SIC appreciation dinner held on January 12 at the Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur, SIC chief executive officer Datuk Razlan Razali said that it would be a challenging year ahead, but the SIC team is looking forward to it.Asked if having two F1 races barely two weeks apart was a negative thing, Razlan said, “I think it’s great for the event, because we have a long promotion period to promote the race. Based on the feedback from travel agents, both local and international, they like it because it gives them more time to promote (the race) to the European market. The European market is our key market.”Razlan added, “Singapore has more to worry about rather than us. We were affected by spectator numbers dropping when they held their race in 2008 anyway. Now. we’re turning the tables in some ways, because we want to capture the global audience that could potentially attend two F1s in the region. I reckon that’s great for the fans.”He also did not see an impact on ticket sales at Sepang. “The only thing that is going to be affected is increased ticket sales. Because we have more time to promote, more news that we can leverage on. Right now, assuming we had the race in March, even in January there’s no news about F1 at all, that’s why we struggle every year. News will only come out when there’s testing but other than that, there’s not much news. So when we are in round 16 or 17, there’s plenty of news and developments that we can leverage on.”Razlan admitted that the track closure would hit revenue hard. “We will definitely lose revenue for three months. We’re talking about a solid 90 days of track revenue. That’s RM55,000 a day times 90 days, that’s a lot of money,” he said.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-15,Petron Blaze 100 Euro 4M fuel launched in Malaysia – RON 100 at RM2.80 per litre; available at eight stations,"Petron Malaysia has officially launched its new Petrol Blaze 100 Euro 4M fuel in Malaysia. We previously reported on the  fuel – which now takes its position above the RON 95 and RON 97 grades that are currently being offered.The unregulated Petron Blaze 100 fuel is sold at RM2.80 per litre, making it slightly pricier than the other unregulated fuel sold in Malaysia from Shell, V-Power Racing (RM2.65). The latter carries a 40 sen premium over regular RON 97, which is currently priced at RM2.25.However, where Petron Blaze 100 carries a RON 100 octane rating, V-Power Racing is a minimum RON 97. The new Blaze 100 petrol is 95 sen more per litre than RON 95, which is priced at RM1.85 this month.Petron says its Blaze 100 Euro 4M is formulated with Tri-Activ, a triple action formula that is claimed to provide better power, engine protection and mileage. The high grade fuel is produced locally at the Petron Port Dickson refinery.For its initial introduction, Petron Blaze 100 will be available at eight stations in Klang Valley and Johor. More stations are expected to carry the high grade fuel in the future. If you’re interested to get a tankful of Petron Blaze 100, then head on over to these stations and look out for the specially-painted floor: According to Faridah Binti Ali, Head of Retail Business, Petron Malaysia, due to the limited allocation of fuel storage tanks that offer Petron Blaze 100, the new fuel grade will displace the currently available Petron Blaze 97 at selected stations. She also stated that the company plans to increase the number of stations that offer the RON 100 fuel to between 30-40 depending on consumer demand.With the arrival of Petron Blaze 100, motorists whose vehicles are designed, or have a preference for RON 98 and above fuels (such as high-end sports cars and superbikes, as well as specific models like the Honda Civic Type R, previous-gen Suzuki Swift Sport and Toyota 86), will now able to run their vehicles without any fuel-related performance or reliability issues. Customers who opt for the RON 100 fuel will also receive some value-added services from a “pit crew” stationed at the pumps. Also present at the launch of the new RON 100 fuel were members of the local Lotus and Porsche clubs, who were more than eager to top up the tanks of their high-performance cars, including a .",Gerard Lye
2016-01-14,BMW Tyre Warranty Programme now here in Malaysia – 24-month coverage against tyre damage,"After  from two years to five last year, BMW Group Malaysia has now announced the arrival of the BMW Tyre Warranty Programme, offered on all new BMW vehicles and BMW-approved star-marked tyres sold from January 1, 2016.The 24-month warranty covers against tyre damage caused by any pointed or sharp objects such as nail or broken glass, or by hitting the edge of a kerb or pothole, but is only applicable if there is no existing guarantee or insurance that already covers the tyres. The cost of tyre fitment and balancing is also covered, but not alignment or vehicle towing – the latter because most BMWs are now fitted with runflat tyres.To make a claim, the dealer will inspect the cause of the damage and calculate the current market value of the tyre, based on tread depth and the retail price of the tyre during the time of change.Full compensation will be offered on tyres with a tread depth of more than 7 mm, while those from 6.9 mm to 6.0 mm, 5.9 mm to 5.0 mm, 4.9 mm to 4.0 mm and 3.9 mm to 3.0 mm will be given 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% compensation respectively. No compensation will be given for a tread depth of less than 3 mm.The warranty is valid within 24 months from the date of first registration of a new BMW, the date upon which the new tyres were purchased or upon reaching all four tyre claims, whichever comes first. For replacement tyres or new tyres purchased through aftersales, the warranty will cease when a claim is made.As usual, there are terms attached – the warranty is linked to the vehicle the tyres are mounted on and is non-transferable if the same tyres are fitted on another vehicle. Furthermore, it does not cover damage caused by normal wear and tear, as well as defects resulting from improper or incorrect use of the tyres.Other instances not covered include participation in driving events or test drives with racing characteristics, vehicle accidents, unauthorised vehicle modifications, as well as excessive or uneven wear due to false track and camber adjustment, inaccurate tyre pressures or the fitment of defective bumpers.The warranty is only applicable for personal vehicles, and will not cover vehicles used for commercial purposes such as car-for-hire, taxi or any driver car services. It will also cease automatically and with immediate effect if the vehicle is sold commercially or outside of Malaysia.",Jonathan Lee
2016-01-14,Mercedes-Benz GLC Edition 1 previewed in Malaysia,"Earlier today, Mercedes-Benz Malaysia revealed its new range of SUVs here in the country. We’ve brought you live coverage of the new ,  and  models from their launch event at the Kuala Lumpur Performance Arts Centre, where you will also be able to catch them this weekend.However, despite bringing you loads of content from the event, there’s one more model worth mentioning – one that we almost missed because of how well it blended in with the other vehicles on show. That model is the  Edition 1. Yes, the limited-edition model is being shown at KLPAC’s grounds, and will soon be for sale. But, blink, and you’ll miss it.Parked to the left of the main hall, the GLC 250 Edition 1 looks completely identical to the regular GLC 250. Both cars feature an AMG Line exterior kit and 20-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels. The only distinction on the outside comes in the form of the “Edition” 1 badging on the front fenders.Inside is where the changes are to be found. Rather than the regular upholstery, the GLC 250 Edition 1 gets a designo two-tone interior in platinum white pearl over black nappa leather. The open-pore black ash wood trim remains, along with the longitudinal-grain aluminium trim on the dashboard and steering.A designo badge is featured on the backrests of the front and rear seats, while the door panels and door armrests also feature white pearl upholstery in a diamond design with white top-stitching. The black centre armrest gets the same white top-stitching treatment.Crystal grey top-stitching is featured on the dashboard, which is now wrapped in black Artico man-made leather, and the black velour floor mats have “Edition 1” badges on them. The rest of the vehicle remains completely identical to the regular GLC 250 4Matic.When quizzed about the Edition 1’s price, the folk at Mercedes-Benz Malaysia said that it hasn’t been confirmed yet, but it’s set to go on sale, though apparently only in a very small number.",Chris Aaron
2016-01-14,Sepang to get fourth circuit layout during renovation?,"Sepang International Circuit (SIC) chief executive officer Datuk Razlan Razali hinted a fourth circuit layout might be included during  being carried out from February 15 to May 8. Speaking exclusively to , Razlan said the SIC team and consultants for the track layout are exploring the possibility of including a fourth track configuration.“We are exploring whether we can reconfigure the track in two or three different configurations.  Right now we have the full track, the north and south tracks, we are looking at one more in-between, a four km configuration,” said Razlan.Razlan is aware of the magnitude of the task ahead, “We are resurfacing the track, that is a major renovation. There may be some improvement, we are waiting for the consultants to let us know what other proposed improvements are included.  Of course, we still have the same number of corners, but, it should become what they call a “free-flowing” circuit rather than a stop-go type of track.”",Mohan K Ramanujam

The  was no slouch in the under-bone () market, being popular amongst the younger crowd due to its price and styling.The updated Wave Dash comes, as its model name suggests, with Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI), allowing for better fuel efficiency without losing anything in the get-up-and-go arena. is not new for Honda, with the technology being present in their product range in other Asian markets from about a decade ago, but is now coming to the Malaysian market in a big way – it made its local debut on the  last year, and comes to the Wave range for the first time here.The Wave Dash EFI has a 109 cc single-cylinder air-cooled four-stroke engine, mainstay of Honda’s  range since, well, about the time of the dinosaurs. The four-speed automatic gearbox with centrifugal clutch is also a familiar fixture, and instantly recognisable to any young lad who climbs on the bike. Power is claimed to be 8.38 hp at 7,500 rpm with torque rated at 8.42Nm at 6,000 rpm.Things have improved though, with the Wave Dash now coming with a four-litre fuel tank, reducing fill-ups. There are disc brakes front and rear to take care of stopping. A single element halogen light is front and center, and position lights are new in the front fairing. The rear lights have been redesigned, allowing for better visibility to other road-users both day and night.The 2016 Wave Dash EFI comes in three flavours – the single disc brake Type S at , the dual disc brake Type R at  and the Type R Repsol Edition with race-inspired graphics at .

2016-01-15,Caterham Seven 620S – a tamer wolf in wolf’s clothing,"Caterham makes rather bonkers road and race cars for drivers wanting the essence of driving – fast, quick and razor-sharp. Now, there’s a new one. Descended from the legendary Lotus Seven, the company has taken the Seven’s DNA and distilled it into the Seven 620S.The ‘S’ package is now an option for the , toning down the level of crazy a little, as is the wider-bodied S5 chassis, for the, ahem, wider-bodied driver. The S5 chassis is wider and longer than the standard S3, with the benefit of more interior and luggage space, and, more useful, to accommodate a larger fuel tank.Using the same 310 hp two-litre, supercharged Ford Duratec engine as found in the 620R, the 620S takes top-of-the-range honours with the 620R as Caterham’s fastest cars. Torque is also the same, 219 Nm at 7,350 rpm. This propels the 620S to 100 km/h in 3.44 seconds along to a claimed top speed of 233 km/h.Instead of the six-speed sequential gearbox that comes with the 620R, the 620S has a five-speed manual. This doesn’t detract from Caterham’s philosophy of delivering a special brand of unapologetically raucous fun though. Other modern conveniences in the Seven’s otherwise austere design ethos are a heater, full windscreen, hood and side screens and leather seats. A nod to comfort are the leather seats that come as standard, versus the carbon-fibre items in the 620R. Carbon-fibre seats will cost buyers an extra 600 pounds sterling (RM3,800).If potential owners are worried about the character of the Seven 620S going a little too ‘soft’, they can rest assured it isn’t – the road springs and dampers, the up-rated brake master cylinder and limited-slip differential are taken from the 620R to ensure optimum handling. Other carry-overs from the 620R are the carbon interior panels, dashboard and lightweight flywheel. A nod to the road-going nature of the 620S come in the form of the 15-inch Orcus anthracite alloy wheels shod with Avon ZZS tyres. The Catherham Seven 620S is only available as a factory car, hand-built in Dartford, Kent. Prices for the Seven 620S start at 44,995 pounds sterling (RM286,000), while the 620R goes for 49,995 pounds sterling (RM317,000). Orders are currently being taken by Caterham, with customer deliveries of the 620S expected in late 2016.",Mohan K Ramanujam

The Competition Package improves upon three aspects of the cars – power, handling and looks.First up, the 3.0 litre twin-turbo straight-six employed on all three models has been pushed to deliver 19 hp more than before, now producing 450 hp. According to BMW, the M3 Sedan and M4 Coupe, when paired with the optional seven-speed M dual-clutch transmission, will make the century sprint in 3.8 seconds (3.9 seconds without the Competition Package). For models fitted with the six-speed manual, the 0-100 km/h time now stands at 4.0 seconds (4.1 seconds before).The M4 Convertible meanwhile, accomplishes the same feat with a DCT gearbox in 4.3 seconds, 0.1 seconds quicker compared to the same model without said package. The manual version of the convertible will make the same sprint in 4.5 seconds instead of 4.6 seconds.As for the handling upgrades, BMW has included its Adaptive M Suspension for the models mentioned here. This includes new springs, dampers and anti-roll bars.

Finally, the visual upgrades on the exterior see the addition of BMW Individual high-gloss Shadow Line exterior trim. The high-gloss black finish finds its way onto the BMW kidney grille, side gills, model badge, tail, side window trim, window recess finishers and exterior mirror frames. The M sports exhaust system also get black chrome tailpipes with a more enticing exhaust note.

2016-01-14,"Proton 2016 plans – four new models, emphasis on improving aftersales, new turning point for carmaker","This year is a big one for Proton, as it promises to turnaround a not-so-encouraging 2015. The national carmaker sold just slightly over 100,000 units last year, a bit under the 115k units that rolled off dealerships in 2014 – which is “not very good,” according to Proton CEO Datuk Abdul Harith Abdullah.As such, the company is renewing its resolve by introducing new products and an improved aftersales experience for the brand. Leading the charge are four new models – the three which we know about are of course the ,  and  sedans, with .The D-segment Perdana, based on the , will be launched in the first quarter, while the -based Persona – Proton’s renewed entry to the popular B-segment sedan market that will fight the ,  and  – will arrive later. After that will come the Saga, still based on the current model but heavily revised, which will form the bottom end of Proton’s new product range.The relative unknown will be the new Proton-Suzuki model that is expected to arrive before the end of the year – no details have been revealed of the new car just yet, but it’s a safe bet that it will be a new A-segment hatch to fill a void in the company’s lineup. A rebadged  or , perhaps?Harith said that these new models will have “state of the art technology and safety standards, yet are affordably priced.” According to him, it is important get these products ready “with good technology and good quality,” all while maintaining a competitive price position for the brand.Chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad reiterated that Proton will continue to  like the Perdana, Persona and Saga, adding that it will follow the example of the likes of Toyota and Honda by building new models but retaining names that have a history and identity tied to it.To develop the new models, Proton has spent a total of RM2.2 billion in capital expenditure over the last two years, including the research and development as well as on building new engines. Previously, chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa said that the company is looking to replace its ageing CamPro engines with .Next comes aftersales, a known weak point for the brand. Proton acknowledges this, and Harith promises an improvement in the area – moving forward, the company will only add 3S and 4S dealers to its sales and service network.With the  as part of the Proton-Suzuki collaboration, Proton’s network of 1+1S, 2S and 3S centres has now swelled to 105, which Harith says will provide Proton with a solid dealer network to support the new models.Proton is also planning to fill up capacity at its under-utilised Tanjung Malim and Shah Alam plants, which are capable of producing up to 300,000 cars annually. The company is targeting to build 150,000 cars this year – a 50% increase in sales is a bold claim, but we shall see how it goes throughout the year.Lastly, Proton will be looking to bolster its brand value and confidence, with better aftersales service and the assurance of Suzuki technology coming to its models. With the collaboration with the Japanese small car expert, the brand is hoping to finally put itself on a new level against its competitors.Overall, Proton has a bullish outlook for the year ahead, and while we still aren’t placing our bets just yet, with a string of new models coming soon, it’s understandable why confidence is running high. “We are very confident that 2016 will be a much better year – a new turning point for Proton,” Harith said.",Jonathan Lee

Datuk Abdul Harith Abdullah, CEO of Proton commented on the relatively slow start of the Iriz, saying that, “market acceptance of the Iriz is growing, but not as fast as we’d initially liked”He attributed the slow sales of the Iriz to the loan approval rate, which is described as relatively low. Harith said, “that’s something that Proton is working on with the financial institutions now.” He added that the national carmaker’s initial sales target for the Iriz was between 4,000 to 5,000 units monthly, although the model currently averages just 2,500 units monthly.With Proton set to introduce a slew of new models in the future, Harith also mentioned that improvements may come for the Iriz as well. “For our current models running today, some need completely new replacements, which are all in the pipeline. Some will be out this year. “As for the Iriz, it’s still very new, so perhaps we’ll give it a facelift or new technical improvements this year.” In the rumour mill, Proton is said to be working on improving the Iriz’s NVH with new engine mounts, as well as updates to the CVT gearbox.

2016-01-14,Crackdown on cloned cars through RFID underway,"The Road Transport Department (JPJ) is set to launch a crackdown on cloned car syndicates as the government is losing over RM100 million in tax revenue,  reports. One such method it plans to use to filter out these illegal vehicles, is through embedded  tags in road tax stickers.Director-general of JPJ, Datuk Seri Ismail Ahmad said, “the government is .” He added “we are looking at implementing a smartcode tag for all vehicles to prevent car cloning.” Another way to weed out vehicles include the introduction of the , now said to be by the middle of this year. With the VEP, foreign cars that are above five years old, can be tracked down if taxes have not been paid.Ismail said that there were still 2,000 to 3,000 cloned cars on the road. “,” he declared. He said that cloned car syndicates were currently under pressure, prompting them to shift their operations about. Last year alone, a total of 506 cloned cars have been seized by the JPJ, with tax revenue losses amounting to approximately RM30 million. Cloned cars are usually vehicles from Singapore, but they appear as a Malaysian-registered vehicle, using identical number plates taken from a similar legitimately-registered model. Dealers of cloned cars assure buyers that the vehicles come with cloned documents and cloned road tax discs which costs somewhere between RM800 and RM1,000 depending on the model of the car in question.The process involves changing the engine, chassis number and providing cloned road tax discs and car grants with details input into JPJ’s system. A total of 1,500 car grants had been issued without authorisation. Cloned vehicles could be sold as cheap as RM5,000 for a  and RM25,000 for a .Last May, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission arrested four suspects (two were JPJ officers in Negeri Sembilan), when it was  for the past two years.",Graham Chin
2016-01-14,Proton-Suzuki JV – new joint model due end-2016,"At the appointment ceremony welcoming Suzuki Malaysia dealers into the Proton Edar fold, the collaboration between Proton and Suzuki has also been detailed, with the confirmation that a jointly-developed new model is expected to head into production before the end of the year.“Today, I am happy to announce that the collaboration is seeing the first of many exciting milestones and providing Proton with the advantage of additional dealers, vendors, skilled manpower, platform sharing and technology know-how,” said Proton CEO Datuk Abdul Harith Abdullah.Suzuki has already ceased sales of its vehicles, as well as production at DRB Hicom’s plant in Pekan. In addition, the national carmaker says that it has access to Suzuki’s talents, models, platforms, powertrains and other technology.Suzuki will also provide specific technical assistance for the joint products while taking advantage of Proton’s larger distribution and service network for its “rebranded cars” – the plurality of the term suggests that there will be more than one model to come from the venture.Proton also claims that Suzuki’s technology and expertise with smaller engines in the A and B segments will complement its long-term product plan. The collaboration will also give Proton the opportunity to leverage on Suzuki’s strengths – maximising volume potentials, reducing development lead time and expediting time to market – through Suzuki’s technology sharing and the ability to reduce cost.“We are happy that the Malaysian government supports such collaboration as it is also in line with the National Automotive Policy (NAP),” said Datuk Harith. “The collaboration will provide Proton with the opportunity to grow internationally, leveraging on Suzuki’s presence worldwide while Proton continuously develops and produces cars that meet international standards and requirements.“The collaboration will also see the assimilation of good and best in class practices. As Suzuki exits the Malaysian market, it displays genuine commitment to make this collaboration successful according to the agreed terms. In that, Proton is honoured to be part of its several successful partnerships worldwide and we look forward to a more fruitful journey in our transformation initiatives to increase market share,” he added.Proton chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad previously announced that the collaboration will involve specifically compact and small cars from Suzuki up to 1.0 litre that are not currently sold in Malaysia, in a segment where Proton is currently not present in. He also confirmed that the Tanjung Malim plant will be utilised in the collaboration.",Jonathan Lee
2016-01-14,Mercedes-Benz GLC 250 debuts in Malaysia – RM329k,"At long last, Mercedes-Benz Malaysia’s new range of SUVs are finally in town, and it starts with this, the  250 4Matic. Just one variant of the  has been launched, with a price tag of .The X253 GLC joins its larger  and  here, positioned as the smallest of the . It is the successor to the  which was never sold in Malaysia because a right-hand drive model was never considered.Now with a RHD version to boast, the GLC gets its revised name from its commonalities with the . A lot of this SUV’s styling, inside and out, has been lifted right off the popular sedan – a point which you’ll notice (if you haven’t already) mostly from its similar interior design.To help you position the GLC in our part of the world, you would be right to think of it as a direct competitor of the  and the . The locally-assembled X3 is priced from RM325,800 (xDrive20i) and RM345,800 (xDrive20d), while the imported Q5 2.0 TFSI quattro is priced at RM324,900.While the BMW X3 is the only locally-produced model in its class here, we understand that Mercedes-Benz Malaysia does have some plans to locally-assemble its GLC SUV at a later point in time.For now, the sole GLC 250 4Matic you see here is dressed up in a full AMG Line exterior kit that introduces sportier front and rear bumpers, protective underbody skid plates and 20-inch AMG multi-spoke alloy wheels.The front end gets a dual-bar grille with a centralised Three-Pointed Star, flanked by LED Intelligent Light System headlamps. Full LED tail lights are present at the rear, with dual exhaust tip finishers signing off on the rear.Inside, the GLC’s cabin is unsurprisingly a carbon-copy of what’s seen in the current W205 C-Class. An AMG interior styling package has been specified as standard, including Artico leather upholstery, open-pore black ash wood dashboard trim and the AMG flat-bottomed three-spoke multi-function steering wheel.An Audio 20 CD infotainment system is standard fare, dictating the inclusion of a seven-inch free-standing display screen positioned as the dashboard’s centrepiece. Similar to the local-spec C-Class, the GLC gets a Garmin Map Pilot navigation system integrated into its operating software as standard, while views for the 360-degree camera are also displayed on the seven-inch screen.Making up for the lack of a full COMAND Online infotainment system, Mercedes-Benz Malaysia has equipped its GLC 250 with a 590-watt, 13-speaker Burmester Surround Sound system. However, if you take a look at the COMAND Controller on the centre console, you’ll see that the clever  has been omitted from this model.The GLC has a 40/20/40 split-folding rear bench to balance between maximising cargo and seating space. The backrest can also be tilted forwards to create more cargo space, but in its regular upright position, the GLC has 580 litres of space behind the rear seats.With the seats folded flat, a total of 1,600 litres of space becomes available. To make loading cargo easier, MBM has specified an Easy-Pack Tailgate system with Hands Free Access. This generally translates into being able to swipe your foot under the rear bumper (with the key fob in your pocket) to open the tailgate. There is also a switch on the inside of the tailgate and on the dash to open and close the tailgate as well.The GLC comes equipped with a load of premium active and passive safety features. Collision Prevention Assist Plus, Crosswind Assist, Attention Assist and an Active Parking Assistant are all included as standard. Additionally, the car is fitted with a newly-developed window airbag that extends over both seat rows and the side and knee airbags.For power, the GLC 250 4Matic employs the same 2.0 litre (1,991 cc) engine from the current  and  models. The four-pot turbo petrol mill delivers 211 hp at 5,500 rpm and 350 Nm of torque from 1,200 to 4,000 rpm,The figures are said to power the GLC 250 to a 7.3-second zero to 100 km/h sprint and an electronically-limited 250 km/h top speed. Fuel consumption is rated at 6.5 to 7.1 litres per 100 km, based on the European NEDC test cycle.The GLC also marks the first application of the brand’s new 9G-Tronic nine-speed torque converter automatic transmission in Malaysia. Similarly, the GLE and GLE Coupe are also be equipped with the new unit.The multi-clutch 4Matic all-wheel drive system distributes 33% of the engine’s torque to the front wheels and the remaining 67% of torque to the rear wheels. Traction is optimised by the 4Matic system incorporating functions from the ESP and Anti-Skid Regulation.Five driving modes are available courtesy of the Dynamic Select switch positioned on the centre console, including Eco, Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and Individual modes. An Off-Road Engineering Package is also specified, including a Downhill Speed Regulation function, and Off-road, Incline, Slippery, Trailer selectable driving modes.To recap, the Mercedes-Benz GLC 250 4Matic is priced ast  (OTR without insurance). The price also includes Mercedes-Benz Malaysia’s four years, unlimited mileage warranty.

2016-01-14,Proton CEO: after CNY we may have to increase prices,"Following the  of the appointment of Suzuki dealers as Proton Edar dealers, Datuk Abdul Harith Abdullah, CEO of Proton suggested that prices of Proton cars in Malaysia may increase after Chinese New Year. Therefore, he suggests if you’re planning on getting a Proton, better do it soon.As for the justification of a price hike, Proton chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad explained that the depreciation of the ringgit has resulted in the national carmaker needing to pay more for imported parts or services. He cited the current exchange rate where USD$1 is now equivalent to around RM4.40 instead of RM3.00 in the past.The higher costs involved in producing cars would therefore need to be reflected in their price tags. Tun Dr Mahathir also claimed that Proton isn’t the only automaker to bear the effects of the falling ringgit as other brands will also have to face the reality of it. For now, the automaker will do its utmost best to hold on to its current prices for as long as it can.However, nothing is set in stone, as Proton has neither confirmed nor denied a price hike for its models. For those who are interested to purchase a Proton, would you be making your move before or after the Chinese New Year celebrations? Other brands like , ,  and  have already announced price hikes earlier in the year.",Gerard Lye

Called the Force 1 V10, the American supercar was unveiled by Henrik Fisker (of Aston Martin and  fame) and renowned Viper race car driver, Ben Keating – both were also actively involved in building the new supercar.The Force 1 V10 weighs a total of 1,538 kg as it possesses a light-weight carbon-fibre body that’s sculpted according to Fisker’s design language. The vehicle measures 4,545 mm in length, 2,019 mm in width, 1,243 mm in height and has a wheelbase of 2,512 mm. In front, a shaped hood with six air intakes and outlets are necessary to provide for the large mid-mounted engine sitting in the front bay.Round the sides, a large functional outlet is present. As for the day light opening (DLO) or side windows, it has been shaped as such to resemble a sharp spear. The character lines flow to the rear where and upward-shaped spoiler and UTV laser-blade tail lamps – said to be the thinnest in the world – are part of the Force 1 V10’s aesthetic characteristics.Aerodynamic elements are also incorporated in the rear spoiler, carbon-fibre rear diffuser and deep front spoiler. Just above the rear windscreen, there’s also a wing-like spoiler, which houses the third brake light and the in-car WiFi. The supercar sits on 21-inch aluminium wheels wrapped in Pirelli P Zero tyres, complemented by Brembo high-performance brakes.Providing power to the Force 1 is a -derived 8.4 litre V10 engine which produces 745 hp at 6,100 rpm and 928 Nm of torque at 5,000 rpm.

2016-01-14,"Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe launched in Malaysia – GLE 400, GLE 450 AMG priced at RM631k, RM700k","Undoubtedly the most stylish model Mercedes-Benz Malaysia’s , here is the new , the third model to be launched today. Two variants of the five-seat coupe-styled SUV officially make their debuts in the country, with the GLE 400 priced at  and the GLE 450 AMG at .Based on the regular GLE SUV, the  is Mercedes-Benz’s sole Sports Utility Coupe (SUC). The model faces competition from the BMW X6, which itself is available in Malaysia in two variants – the , and the fully-imported (CBU), range-topping .Like the , the Coupe is a fully imported model. More interestingly, though, is the arrival of the hotter GLE 450 AMG which marks a debut for an  in Malaysia. The top-shelf GLE Coupe variant isn’t a full-blown BMW X6 M-fighter, but sits one step below it, appropriately compared to an M Performance version of the X6.With formalities out of the way, here’s a look at what lies at the heart of these style-oriented SUVs. The entry-level GLE 400 Coupe starts things off here with a 333 hp/480 Nm 3.0 litre (2,996 cc) biturbo V6 engine – one similarly offered in the W212 Mercedes-Benz E 400.Even at its entry level, the vehicle is capable of performing the century spring in 5.9 seconds, and has a top speed of 247 km/h. Its fuel consumption is rated at 8.9 litres per 100 km. Both variants of the GLE Coupe are equipped with a new 9G-Tronic nine-speed torque converter automatic transmission and a 4Matic all-wheel drive system.If it is full-blown power that you’re after, keep in mind that the hotter GLE 450 AMG Coupe isn’t quite the AMG GLE 63 you may be looking for. It features the same 3.0 litre turbo V6 engine as the GLE 400, but is massaged to produce 367 hp and 520 Nm of torque. The result of this is a zero to 100 km/h sprint clocked in 5.7 seconds and a top speed limited to 250 km/h.The GLE 450 AMG Sport model also benefits from several chassis tweaks for better handling and an aggressive sports exhaust that the GLE 400 lacks. The variant also features AMG eSound – a feature that reproduces the exhaust note inside the cabin via the audio system.Both GLE Coupe variants offer five drive modes to tackle various driving conditions under its Dynamic Select system, being Individual, Comfort, Slippery, Sport and Sport+. Notably, the 4Matic all-wheel drive system in the GLE 400 has an even 50:50 torque split, while the edgier GLE 450 AMG gets a little more rear torque bias with a 40:60 split.The GLE Coupe duo are also equipped with an Airmatic suspension system as standard, inclusive of an Adaptive Damping System Plus system. The latter offers vehicle levelling control which can even automatically lower the vehicle’s ride height at high speeds to improve stability.Additionally, the GLE 450 AMG gets an Active Curve system with roll stabilisation. This system functions to improve high-speed cornering stability, and is automatically activated in Sport or Sport+ modes.Likewise, the active anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles instinctively work to improve ride comfort under regular driving instances. Where necessary, the electronically-controlled roll bars are capable of levelling out heavy, one-sided forces acting on the vehicle.For style, there’s nearly no telling the two GLE Coupe variants apart. Both SUCs feature an AMG Line exterior kit, adding sporty front and rear aprons to the mix among other items. Apart from their designation badges, the only visible difference between the two cars are its wheel sizes.The GLE 400 gets a set of 21-inch five, twin-spoke AMG alloy wheels, while the GLE 450 features the same kind in a larger 22-inch size. The exhaust tips are another subtle giveaway, with the GLE 400 featuring dual finishers while the GLE 450 gets quad tips.The front-end of the car features a single-bar radiator grille with a centralised Three-Pointed Star, a contoured bonnet, full LED headlamps and large air intakes on the front bumper courtesy of the AMG styling kit. Horizontal LED tail lights are present and linked by a chrome strip that runs across the tailgate. The AMG-style rear bumper integrates the quad exhaust tips in the process.If you’ve already been through our gallery of the regular GLE, you may find the Coupe’s layout to be very familiar, because apart from a few styling tweaks, they’re both identical. With the GLE 450 AMG Coupe the only variant in attendance, lets go through its cabin first.Specified with an AMG Line interior, the present GLE 450 features AMG sports seats, an AMG flat-bottomed three-spoke steering wheel, nappa leather upholster offered in various colours and aluminium sport pedals. The dash is adorned with AMG carbon-fibre and piano-black lacquer surfaces.The absent GLE 400 gets a more formal affair, offering several colour and material variations. The dash trim can be specified to have either a longitudinal-grain aluminium, brown open-pore ash wood, brown eucalyptus wood or dark-graphite poplar wood. Its leather upholstery also offers several colour options.A COMAND Online with DVD Changer infotainment system is fitted to both variants of the GLE Coupe, standard-fitted with an eight-inch free-standing display screen and a six-DVD disc changer. The centre console is identical to the regular GLE and has a COMAND Controller equipped with the touchpad cum palm rest feature.As seen before on the W212 E 400, the GLE Coupe gets a similar Rear-Seat Entertainment System – dual display screens with several connectivity options located on the back of the front passenger and driver’s headrests. A Harman Kardon Logic 7 Surround Sound system is reserved to the GLE 450 Coupe.Maximum cargo space amounts to a total 1,650 litres of usable space when the 60/40-split rear seats are folded flat. Left in its original upright position, there is still a respectable 650 litres of space. Access to the rear cargo space has been made easier by an Easy-Pack tailgate system. The GLE 450 AMG Coupe, however, gets an additional Hands-Free Access feature – a swipe of your foot under the rear bumper automatically opens the tailgate.For safety, the GLE 400 is most notably equipped with Collision Prevention Assist Plus and a Lane Tracking Package (Blind Spot Assist, Lane Keeping Assist). The GLE 450 adds several more active safety features to that list, particularly being Distronic Plus with Pre-Safe Brake, Rear Impact Warning and Protection System, Steering Assist, Cross Traffic Assist, Pre-Safe Plus and Pre-Safe Brake.To recap, the Mercedes-Benz GLE 400 4Matic Coupe is priced at RM630,888, while the more premium and sporty GLE 450 AMG 4Matic Coupe is listed at RM699,888. Needless to say, the OTR, without insurance prices for the CBU models include Mercedes-Benz Malaysia’s four years unlimited mileage warranty.Compare the  on .",Chris Aaron
2016-01-13,2016 Toyota Fortuner – Indonesian launch this month,"The rollout of the new  in the region continues – after being  in July and  in October, the Hilux-based SUV’s next stop is Indonesia later in the month.Three variants will be available in three variants – 2.4 G and 2.4 VRZ diesels and range-topping 2.7 SRZ petrol, with both 4×2 and 4×4 versions offered. The diesel models are powered by the new 2.4 litre 2GD-FTV engine that features common-rail direct injection and variable nozzle turbocharging, pushing out 150 hp at 3,400 rpm and 400 Nm from 1,600-2,000 rpm.On the petrol side sits a revised 2.7 litre mill, now lighter and with Dual VVT-i, improved combustion and less friction; it churns out 166 hp at 5,200 rpm and 245 Nm at 4,000 rpm. The base G gets the option of either a six-speed “intelligent” manual transmission with rev-matching or a six-speed automatic with ECO and Power modes; the rest are auto-only.Other details regarding the Indonesian-market Fortuner remain scarce, but it is confirmed that it will feature a powered tailgate, as well as an “advanced infotainment system” and “absolute safety” – the latter likely being seven airbags – on the VRZ and SRZ.To be built at Toyota’s Karawang factory there, the new Fortuner will have a big task to top sales of the current truck, which leads the 4×2 SUV segment there with a 25% market share in the period of January to October 2015 despite being an ageing model due for a replacement.",Jonathan Lee
2016-01-13,Hyundai Santa Cruz pick-up now closer to production?,"As the  makes its debut at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show, another unibody pick-up truck is set to take shape – Australian motoring portal  reports that the  is still very much coming to production.Hyundai Motor America president and CEO Dave Zuchowski told the publication that while the -based truck has yet to be officially green-lighted, it is very confident of the higher-ups at Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) in Korea will give the go-ahead, and that it’s more of a question of “when” than “if.”“We’re waiting more for an announcement than we are for an approval,” he said. “So HMC is going to dictate [when that happens]. We feel really good about it. It hasn’t been officially announced yet. Our timing is not crossing our fingers and waiting for approval, it’s trying to figure out when we’re going to announce it.”The bigger question is whether the Santa Cruz will be a global model, or if it will just be a United States-only model. Zuchowski, however, hinted that while the truck will have more potential in countries already with a sizeable lifestyle pick-up market, it may try out new areas, too. “I’m not clear on the other markets, but from our perspective it’s a vehicle that will be exported to other markets,” he said.Hyundai Australia public relations GM Bill Thomas tempered expectations by saying that there are still lots of questions to be answered about the Santa Cruz and its sales potential in the Australian market. “If it’s a production vehicle, it’s about where it’s produced and whether or not it can be made in right-hand drive,” he said. “That’s an economic decision based on numbers,” he said.The Tucson platform would enable the pick-up to potentially be built in various Hyundai plants worldwide – including Korea, Czech Republic and North and South America, among others – although as they are said to be at capacity, the location of where the Santa Cruz will be built will be key to its availability in markets outside the US.In Australia at least, Thomas claims that the production Santa Cruz would perhaps not be marketed as a typical truck with high load and towing capacities such as the ,  and , but instead fill a void in the market left by the outgoing car-based  and .“We’d still look at it,” he said. “As an urban runabout and as a practical lifestyle utility it works well. To rule it out for Australia would be wrong.”",Jonathan Lee
2016-01-13,Rewaco RF-1 LT-2 trike lands on Malaysian shores – powered by 1.5 litre turbo with Punch CVT gearbox,"German trike maker Rewaco has been producing trike and trike conversions since 1990, and its RF-1 LT-2 trike has landed in Malaysia. The RF-1 is a three-wheeler with swoopy, out of this world looks, and has a significant amount of road presence.Powered by a Mitsubishi-derived 4A91T four-cylinder 1.5 litre turbocharged engine, mated to a Punch VT3 CVT gearbox – the same unit which is installed in the Proton Suprima S, Preve and Exora CFE – this trike will turn heads wherever it goes.Power is claimed to be 140 hp at 6,000 rpm, with torque quoted at 210 Nm at 2500 rpm. The weight of the RF-1 is 705 kg, and seats two. There is also a three-seater version available.The transversely mounted engine fits tightly under the bodywork, and an intercooler sits up top, with a small electric fan for cooling during stops. The CVT gearbox is hidden deep in the recesses of the engine bay.The RF-1 you see here is a prototype for the Malaysian market, and is currently undergoing type certification and inspection. It certainly is imposing, with a length of 3550 mm and a width of 1880 mm. This is, in comparison, the same physical footprint as the Perodua Axia.Riding the RF-1 is easy, there are only two controls – throttle and foot-brake. Without the worry of having to balance the trike or putting your feet down at stops, anyone can learn to ride the RF-1 in minutes. The gearbox selector sits on the ‘tank’ between the rider’s legs, and is marked with the usual CVT markings, instantly familiar to anyone who drives a car.There are three storage areas on the RF-1, two sidepods on either side of the passenger seat, and a rear trunk that functions exactly like a car’s.The RF-1 is imported by Punch Powertrain Malaysia. Punch is currently looking for distributor partners in Malaysia for the Rewaco range of trikes and bike conversions. The RF-1 is sold in the US for an approximate price of USD45,000 (RM196,000).What do you think?  Would you ride one on Malaysian roads?

Chapman was a firm believer in the tenet that race, and road, cars should be as light and simple as possible, all in the quest of going faster, and faster. The  carries on that philosophy, with the driving experience and handling for which Lotus cars are renowned.Limited to a production run of 311 cars worldwide from March 2016, the 3-Eleven reaches 100 km/h in under three seconds, and 165 km/h in six. Lotus claims the race version of this open-top roadster will top 290 km/h. This would make it the fastest road car to come out of the Hethel works, completing the Hethel circuit in one minute and 19.5 seconds.Jean-Marc Gales, chief operating officer of Group Lotus, described the Lotus 3-Eleven as, “a game-changing car, not only in terms of what has come before it from within our own rich heritage of sports cars, but also in terms of anything else comparable brought to market by any other manufacturer. Extreme, focused and phenomenal are all words that have been used to describe the 3-Eleven.”The body is built out of lightweight carbon composite, giving the 3-Eleven a dry weight of 890 kg and maximum power of 460 hp in race trim. The road version weighs-in at 925 kg and has a maximum power of 410 hp that allows it to reach 100 km/h in 3.3 seconds before reaching a top speed of 280 km/h.The bodywork of the 3-Eleven is sculpted to provide massive levels of downforce – necessary in a supercar this light – provided by the rear wing, front splitter and flat floor and rear splitter. The road car has 150 kg of downforce while the race version, using an adjustable rear wing and twin canards in front, produces 215 kg. Cornering forces have been recorded at 1.5 g.The race car comes with competition spec Xtrac 6-speed sequential transmission with a semi-dry sump, oil cooler, cassette-type plate limited slip differential and paddle shift, while the road car makes do with a  close-ratio six-speed manual gearbox with a Torsen-type limited slip differential, featuring a performance clutch assembly and oil cooler.The Lotus 3-Eleven’s suspension features lightweight, double-wishbones front and rear, with an adjustable anti-roll bar, and bumps are soaked up by 2-way Öhlins dampers. The items are standard on the race car, and an additional cost option on the road car.Rolling on 225/40 ZR18 wheels in front and 275/35 ZR19 at the rear, the 3-Eleven comes with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres for road use, and Michelin Cup 2 rubber for the race car. Braking duties are performed by AP Racing four-piston calipers grabbing 332 mm discs front and rear.A list of performance oriented options include an FIA-spec roll cage, race fire extinguisher, battery isolator and motorsport towing eye. Other options include carbon racing seats, a tonneau cover and removable steering wheel.

Some riders, to while the miles away, use ear-phones connected to a phone or mp3 player. German firm Headwave has come up with what they dub the “Concert Capsule”, that eliminates putting bud speakers in your ear and long cords leading to your player.This externally-mounted vibration speaker fits to any helmet using adhesive tape. A special transponder inside the Concert Capsule produces vibrations and uses the helmet to resonate and amplify the vibration, transmitting sound and music to the rider’s ears.The Concert Capsule is certified to IP67, meaning it is completely waterproof and will withstand substantial shock and impact. You can pair the Capsule with a smartphone, other Bluetooth devices and GPS devices.Since the Capsule has no microphone, using it to make calls is not an option, but you can receive GPS instructions and the like. It has a USB rechargeable port, and is designed for one-button operation.  Battery life is estimated at six to eight hours. The Headwave TAG Concert Capsule is available for online purchase at a price of 299 euro (RM1,432) and ships worldwide.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-13,VIDEO: Building the 2016 Honda RC213V-S race replica,"Our previous post on the  road version of the MotoGP racer garnered some interest from readers, so here’s a video released by Honda Motor HK showing how the limited edition, and very expensive, motorcycle comes together. The video appears to have been taken during a factory visit at Honda’s Kumamato facility, where every RC213V-S is hand-built.Shown in the video are Honda craftsmen welding the RC213V-S by hand.  More of a surprise was the hand-finishing of the frame segments before welding. This goes a long way to explaining the race replica’s astronomical price tag. Now, think about what it costs every time you see a MotoGP bike highside and go tumbling down the track, exploding into a million fragments of carbon-fibre.The street-legal RC213V-S is sold at a staggering price of 188,000 euro (RM890,000). While this might seem an exorbitant sum to pay for a motorcycle, the money goes into the engineering design and materials that make up the bike. This is also not ignoring the fact that the RC213V-S is basically a MotoGP bike, with lights, rear-view mirrors and a side-stand.Whether you would want to actually ride the bike on the road is another matter, as all the parts on this bike are unique, and made out of exotic materials. According to an  report, the RC213V-S, in street trim, puts out 159 hp, while the US-spec version has 101 ponies. If you’re in Japan, all you get is 70 hp.There is a way to unleash the full potential of that engine, of course. All you need is the Sport kit, which lets all 215 hp run free. The catch is the kit costs 12,000 euro (RM57,000), and your RC213V-S is no longer road legal.",Mohan K Ramanujam

The speculated “43” nomenclature makes no reference to the models’ powerplants, as it once used to. However, it is believed that Mercedes-Benz would be keen to retain the designation’s alignment with the  range.The publication doesn’t reveal a specific source for this newfound belief, but says that the recently-revealed  is a firm clue to note. The compact AMG roadster features the same 3.0 litre turbocharged V6 that also powers the C 450 and GLE 450 AMG Sport models.Notably, there hasn’t been an AMG model that offered a six-cylinder engine for a very long time, but  believes that the arrival of the  sets a new precedent for the performance brand. Unlike the 4.0 V8, for instance, this engine does not adhere to AMG’s one-man, one-engine philosophy.Regardless, there’s no questioning the AMG Sport model’s capabilities to fill a role under the full-blown “63” range. Fitted with proper chassis upgrades and a 367 hp/520 Nm engine, these would do nicely as more approachable Mercedes-AMG models.Originally, the AMG Sport range was launched to take on Audi’s S (S4, S6) and BMW’s M Performance (M235i, M550xd) line-ups, leaving the range-topping Mercedes-AMG sub-brand to rival the full-blown Audi RS and BMW M models.

That’s right, Aston Martin has followed in the path of other high-performance manufacturers by going the turbo route. In its video, we get glimpses of the engine in question, along with some lovely exhaust notes of the V12 that sounds just as throaty even with the inclusion of the turbos.With the imminent introduction of its “V12 5.2 Twin Turbo” engine, Aston Martin is expected to bid farewell to its current naturally-aspirated V12, which displaces 5,935 cc (Aston markets it as a 6.0 litre).

However, the government is willing to cut the amount by half, according to deputy transport minister, Datuk Aziz Kaprawi. A total of two million court cases from the pilot phase of the AES project, are also currently outstanding. Recently, the government was , with .The discount is reportedly being proposed to make way for the . “We are targeting to start the second phase of AES hopefully in March and are suggesting to the Cabinet to give leniency by offering a 50% discount for six months, probably from February, to traffic offenders under AES (phase one),” Aziz said. After the discount period is over however, should summonses remain unsettled, offenders will be brought to court. “We will suggest to the Attorney-General to initiate the legal action for the outstanding summonses,” Aziz said. Out of 1.91 million summonses issued from September 2012 to April 30 last year, only 264,750 AES compounds amounting to RM76,647,750 have been paid so far. The traffic compound under the AES is set at RM300, while a discount of RM150 can be had for those who pay voluntarily within 14 days.He explained that the AES is a vital part of the government’s road safety 2020 plan to minimise road deaths. “The AES and several other steps will address the high road fatalities recorded every year. If all steps are not taken including firm traffic enforcement on the road, the death rate by 2020 will be high,” Aziz said.Rather than highways, phase two of the AES project will see cameras installed at traffic lights and intersections at some 350 proposed locations. According to accident statistics, in 2013, there were 205 crashes at traffic light intersections and pedestrian crossings, with 76 deaths and 129 injuries recorded.According to the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (MIROS) Red-light running (RLR) violations are said to have decreased by 1.23% a year and 2.2% within six months since the AES cameras were installed at traffic lights.

2016-01-13,Acura Precision Concept – a bold future for the brand,"It turns out the , unveiled at the 2016 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, was far more outlandish than previously thought – the  hinted that it could feature an evolution of the current Acura design language, but the real deal goes much further than that.Developed by the Acura Design Studio in California and previewing the future styling direction of its sedans, the Precision was designed to express Acura’s DNA of “Precision Crafted Performance.” The distinctive design starts with a new front end that debuts the company’s new Diamond Pentagon grille, flanked by sharp Jewel Constellation LED headlights with fractal elements, as well as deep gashes for air intakes.The proportions feature a long dash-to-axle ratio, providing the Precision a more premium long bonnet look afforded to its rear-wheel drive rivals (and which current front-biased Acuras lacked). The strong stance is accentuated by large haunches, muscular surfacing and 22-inch wheels. Around the rear, there are floating LED tail lights and large dual integrated exhaust outlets.Acura designed the Precision with a theme it calls “quantum continuum,” seamlessly blending the transition between exterior and interior materials and structure. These can be seen through the floating A-pillar, the suicide doors and lack of a B-pillar, the side sills that flow into the interior and the floating rear seats, as well as the high-mounted third brake light that goes through the rear windscreen, forming the structure for the metal aerofoil shape of the rear headrests. Boring this certainly isn’t.Inside, it’s a little closer in design to current Acuras, even if the resemblances are abstract in nature. As with the exterior, the cabin features a faceted design with cantilevered surfaces and unique materials and detailing. The dual-tier dashboard is dominated by a large, thin curved centre display and a smaller instrument display ahead of the driver, with a head-up display sitting behind.Other touches include a race-style steering wheel with paddle shifters and Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) controls, a floating centre console, lounge-style seats and handcrafted exotic wood speaker grilles. Also included is Acura’s new digital human-machine interface (HMI) that is more intuitive, with a touch pad controlling the centre screen. The system also scans each occupant and selects personalized features and functions, including maps, audio and customized vehicle performance settings upon entering the vehicle.There are no mechanical details released so far, but given the aforementioned rear-biased proportions, expect future Acuras to feature at least a longitudinally-mounted engine at the front, if not a full-blown rear-wheel drive layout.",Jonathan Lee

Kymeta’s solution is lightweight, has a flat profile antenna, and is “seamlessly integrated into the car during assembly or as an each aftermarket installation.”Shigeki Tomoyama, senior managing officer of Toyota Motor Corporation, commented that, “we were very excited to learn about Kymeta, because their flat antennae technology could solve the challenge of vehicle-based satellite communications.”Dr Nathan Kundtz, CEO of Kymeta, said that, “Kymeta is the first company to successfully demonstrate this type of technology, and we have over 8,000 miles of road testing with cars connected to satellites.”Toyota and Kymeta have been working together to develop this flat antenna technology and its applications for vehicles since September 2013. Just this month alone, Toyota invested USD$5 million to accelerate Kymeta’s development under the Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership fund.The car maker’s faith in satellite communications technology stems from its high capacity to distribute huge amounts of data to a vehicle, cover a broad range of areas that could aid a global deployment of connected vehicles and provide more stable and secure communications, particularly in emergency situations.",Chris Aaron

As for the price, there’s no point beating around the bush – it is SGD$75,888 or RM231,827.For that money, you’ll be getting a Perodua Axia 1.0 Advance (AT), which is the range-topping variant in the Axia line-up. By comparison, the same variant will set you back RM41,967 (solid) or RM42,377 (metallic) in Malaysia (OTR with insurance). Power still comes from the company’s new all-aluminium 1KR-DE2 1.0 litre mill, with output rated at 66 hp at 6,000 rpm and 90 Nm at 3,600 rpm, mated to a four-speed auto.The price listed is inclusive of Singapore’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Certificate of Entitlement (COE), which explains the ludicrous amount. However, each purchase includes a five-year/100,000 km warranty, plus a free five-year/100,000 km maintenance service. Additionally, if you opt to register the car as an off peak car, the price tag can be offset by up to SGD$17,000 (RM51,925).

Launched at the Detroit Auto Show, the successor of the Hyundai Equus is the  first model out the door, .Make no mistake, the Genesis G90 arrives in the US to directly compete with premium limousines like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Audi A8 and BMW 7 Series. To do that, the Genesis flagship sedan has been loaded with advanced tech, premium features and two very capable petrol engines.At the base level, the G90 offers a 3.3 litre twin-turbo V6 engine which delivers 365 hp at 6,000 rpm and 510 Nm of torque from 1,300 rpm to 4,500 rpm. There is also a bigger, but naturally-aspirated 5.0 litre V8 powerplant that dishes out 420 hp at 6,000 rpm and 520 Nm of torque at 5,000 rpm.No further powertrain details were revealed, apart from the fact that both engines in the US will be mated to an eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but a H-TRAC all-wheel drive system with active torque control can be optionally specified., the G90 appears identical to the Korean-market model, which is known there as the EQ900. The car wears the same front grille, headlamps, 19-inch turbine blade design alloy wheels and is also clearly badged as a “Genesis” model.Additionally, the US press materials mention that full-LED lighting is available as standard on the V8 variant only. The rear features vertical full-LED tail lights, dual exhaust tips and a clean use of chrome accents.Inside, the G90 isn’t short of luxurious appointments.

Standardised vehicle licence plate production coming later this year,"Customised number plate styles and fonts have long been a thorn in the side of law enforcement agencies in the country for a long time – and apparently the Road Transport Department (JPJ) is finally doing something about it, according to .The English language daily quotes deputy transport minister Datuk Aziz Kaprawi, saying that JPJ will implement a centralised production scheme for new  in the second half of this year, using metal plates with stamping. These plates are similar in style to the ones used in Singapore and Thailand.The new number plate scheme will be launched after the introduction of national plates as part of major programmes by agencies under the transport ministry this year. “For a start, we will make the installation of the new type of number plates to be mandatory for new vehicles. Later, we will expand it gradually for existing vehicles in the next five years,” said Aziz.He added that authorised agents in each district will be appointed gradually to ensure that number plates are produced in accordance to JPJ specification, in order to more effectively replace the licence plates on an estimated 18 million active registered vehicles.These vendors, Aziz stressed, will be required to use the JPJ’s MySikap online registration system to keep production in sync with the agency’s records, to keep production under control, maintain the JPJ’s specification and prevent certain parties from changing plates without valid reason.New buyers will get the new plates at no extra cost, and the JPJ is reportedly presenting a paper to the cabinet next month, requesting for government funding to cover the replacement cost on existing cars.Aziz claims that the move is done in the interest in public security, as well as road safety – witnesses of the  were unable to identify the registration numbers of at least three of the six Perodua Myvis allegedly street racing, as they were fitted with custom plates.Custom number plates have also caused problems with the  – so far, there have been 87,000 cases of errant motorists who have slipped past the cameras’ detection, as their registration numbers were barely visible.The standardised number plate styles would presumably also maximise the effectiveness of the , which helps the police identify and nab motorists with outstanding summonses.",Jonathan Lee

2016-01-12,2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV specs – 200 hp and 360 Nm,"The  in Las Vegas just a few days ago, and now, the all-electric five-door hatch makes its prescence felt at the ongoing North American International Auto Show. This time, Chevrolet has divulged more information in regards to the Bolt’s electric powertrain. The drive system on the Bolt EV consists of a single high capacity electric motor. The automaker say that the motor uses an offset gear and shaft configuration designed to meet efficiency and performance targets – important to meet its claimed range that exceeds 320 km. Power output is rated at 150 kW or 200 hp, with 360 Nm of torque available. As an electric motor generates its maximum torque from 0 rpm, when combined with the Bolt EV’s 7.05:1 final drive ratio, a sprint from 0-96 km/h (60 mph) in the Bolt EV will take less than seven seconds. To manage the power delivery, Chevrolet has fitted its Electronic Precision Shift control system. The shift and park-by-wire system sends electronic signals to the Bolt EV’s drive unit to provide precise feel and delivery of power and torque, based on drive mode selection and accelerator inputs. The “fuel” for the electric motor comes from a 60 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that was developed together with Chevrolet’s strategic partner, LG Electronics. The 435 kg, floor-mounted battery pack consists of 288 lithium-ion cells that are kept at optimum operating temperature thanks to an active thermal conditioning that is similar to that found in the larger Volt.Chevrolet also claim that the nickel-rich lithium-ion chemistry provides “improved thermal operating performance over other chemistries, which requires a smaller active cooling system for more efficient packaging.” It also guarantees an eight-year or 160,934 km (100,000 km), whichever comes first, limited warranty on the Bolt’s battery pack.Keeping the batteries charged involves using the standard equipment 7.2 kW on-board charger, which connects to a 240 volt wall box for regular overnight charging. A typical commute of 80 km can be recharged in less than two hours.Alternatively, the process can be accelerated with the optional DC Fast Charging system using the industry standard SAE Combo connector, allowing the Bolt EV’s battery to be charged up to 145 km of range in just 30 minutes. The Bolt can also recharge its battery pack via regenerative braking. In this instance, Chevrolet has extend the functionality of the feature by introducing the ability to provide one pedal driving for the Bolt. This is accomplished through a combination of increased regenerative deceleration and software controls, allowing the vehicle to slow down and come to a complete stop without using the brake pedal in certain driving conditions.When operating the Bolt EV in “Low” mode, or by holding the Regen on Demand paddle located on the back of the steering wheel, the driver can bring the vehicle to a complete stop under most circumstances by simply lifting their foot off the accelerator, although the system does not relieve the need to use the brake pedal altogether.",Gerard Lye

If the percentage continues to slide to below 45% then many of the local dealers and vendors may have to cease operations and this will have a negative impact on the economy as a whole,” added Asmat, who is also the group chairman of Perodua stakeholder UMW Holdings. In a press conference later in the day, with minister of domestic trade co-operatives and consumerism Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainuddin present, Asmat elaborated on the topic. “We expect national brands to be above 50%. Proton and Perodua have a higher degree of localisation. Perodua buys RM5 billion of parts locally – bigger volume means bigger opportunities for local vendors. So it’s important for us to have a bigger market share,” he said, adding that one must be strong in its home market before thinking of exports, citing ‘s domination of the South Korean market.Perodua president and CEO Datuk Aminar Rashid Salleh said that his company’s estimated 2015 market share based on a total industry volume of 667,000 units is around 32%, which is higher 2014’s 29.4%. The figures are not final as the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA) is yet to reveal official numbers. An update will be given later this month. “Our journey will continue. We need to do more, we need to accelerate. We’re already competing with other brands, not just national brands,” he said.The  is no sudden phenomenon, and is largely due to Proton’s decline as Perodua has been relatively consistent in holding around 30% share, . Proton controlled over half of the domestic market back in 2001, but now commands less than one third of what it used to enjoy. Put together, the local players’ share of the market has seen a steady drop over the years, but the point where they surrendered the lead to the non-national makes .Local or foreign, the strong will survive in the era of liberalisation. Perodua – with a transformation programme in place to be globally competitive in quality, cost and delivery – looks well equipped to sail in the real ocean.",Danny Tan

The two-door can be seen as a response to the many years of public criticism that the brand’s designs were less than inspiring.“I was determined to make sure we became a more emotional brand, and that the words ‘boring’ and ‘Lexus’ never showed up in the same sentence,” said president of Toyota Motor Corp, Akio Toyoda at the auto show. “We want to make clear the distinction between the Toyota brand and the Lexus brand,” echoed Tokuo Fukuichi, president of Lexus International.“Lexus is for drivers who are more discerning about drivability, design and quality,” Fukuichi said. He also acknowledged that these were areas where Lexus may not have been delivered to the best in previous years. Fukuichi further elaborated upon the differentiatiation between both brands. Labelling Toyota as an “anchor” that consistently delivers high quality products to the mass market.Previously, Akio Toyoda, “we are trying to position Lexus vehicles as emotional and cool. For Toyota, I attach greater value to family, convenience, fun-to-drive.” This, according to Toyoda, was one reason why the Lexus LC 500 coupe was born.The rear-wheel drive Lexus LC 500 premiered in the flesh with a new Lexus Multimedia system on the inside, and a host of safety tech.

Just days ago, Volvo announced that its , at no extra cost to buyers in the US. Kerssemakers said the initiative “symbolises Volvo’s commitment to autonomous driving and our Vision 2020.”Combine the above with Volvo’s leading developments in safety technology, and it isn’t hard to see where its newfound confidence comes from. Dr Peter Mertens, senior vice president, Research & Development, said, ‘the S90 has taken a big stride forwards in terms of driving dynamics, performance and ride.

2016-01-12,Audi h-tron quattro concept – fuel cell SUV debuts,"Present at the North American International Auto Show is the Audi h-tron quattro concept. The hydrogen-powered concept SUV features a range of tech similar to the , this includes piloted drive and a host of OLED displays (including a curved instrument cluster) for the interior.Dimension-wise, the h-tron quattro concept measures 4,880 mm long, 1,930 mm wide and 1,540 mm tall. It sits on the same second-generation modular longitudinal platform (MLB Evo) as the Audi e-tron quattro concept and carries a similar design too. Exterior-wise, it is fitted with high-res  tech. Complementing the daytime running lights are flat OLEDs that radiate blue lights to the sides and upwards. The sills come with a light strip in Matrix LED tech, which will change in colour when the vehicle is in piloted mode. Interestingly, while the Audi e-tron quattro concept achieves a drag coefficient of 0.25 Cd, the h-tron here, achieves 0.27 Cd instead.Underneath the h-tron quattro is a fuel-cell technology that takes about four minutes to fill up. The stack, housed in the front, comprises of 330 individual cells. Three hydrogen tanks are fitted beneath the passenger or luggage compartment and can supply hydrogen for a travel range of up to 600 km. The tanks are made of several layers, gas-tight polyamide for the inner tank, wrapped in carbon-fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass-fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP).Apart from the fuel cell, a compact lithium-ion battery that weighs less than 60 kg is beneath the passenger compartment. It provides short bursts of power up to 134 hp. Power supplied from the fuel cell and high-voltage battery additionally drives two electric motors – a 120 hp unit at the front axle and a 140 hp unit at the rear axle – controlled by an intelligent management system, that emphasises on efficiency. All-in-all, the h-tron makes a total of 550 Nm of system torque. It goes from 0-100 km/h in less than seven seconds, while top-speed is capped to 200 km/h. Based on the NEDC cycle, the SUV claims one kg of hydrogen per 100 kms. That said, a heat pump for the interior and a solar roof that generates up to 320 watts, adds 1,000 km to the total annual range.Furthermore, the concept features radar and ultrasonic sensors, a new kind of video camera and a laser scanner – for piloted driving. All information gathered from the sensors is processed by a . The same system as in the e-tron quattro concept, it allows the SUV to handle parking and stop-and-go traffic on highways at speeds of up to 60 km/h.Inside, there’s 500 litres or luggage space, while two large displays and a Audi virtual cockpit curved LED are for the driver. Here, the piloted driving systems are controlled via the left OLED display. Gesture controls are also present inside, while curved displays found on the front section of the door plays its roles as digital exterior side mirrors. In the rear, Audi tablets with OLED displays are also fitted, and serve as a mobile rear seat entertainment system.",Graham Chin

2016-01-12,Ghosn dashes Tesla’s claim to autonomous cars soon,"Renault-Nissan head honcho Carlos Ghosn has poured cold water on Elon Musk’s claims that  will have a fully autonomous car on public roads in the near future.  While Ghosn announced a year ago that Renault-Nissan would have an   by 2020, Musk said a Tesla would be able to drive itself, coast-to-coast across the US, “within 24 to 36 months.”Speaking at a reception just before the Detroit motor show, Ghosn said, “I understand there is a marketing war, a lot of announcements; that’s fair, everybody wants a piece of it, but at the same time judge on what is on the market.” It was reported by  that Ghosn is insistent that a true self-driving car is still some years in the making.He called into question the definition of an autonomous vehicle, saying if it was just a matter of lane-changing and station-keeping, the technology was already here, or almost ready. “But if you’re talking about autonomous driving in a city, with crossroads or the car making decisions in complicated situations, then frankly I don’t think it’s going to be ready before 2020,” said Ghosn.Ghosn pointed out self-driving did not mean a lack of user involvement. “What is very important is that we don’t want the consumer to be just able to buy the car; we want him to be able to drive it,” he said. He added that many people give up driving because they can’t, due to age, health or handicaps.“This technology is going to enable you to drive until you don’t want to any more. You will be able to drive no matter what your handicap, no matter what your impairment is. With this technology, you’re going to be able to drive at 80 years old, 90 years old. This is important as the planet’s population is getting older,” said Ghosn.Nissan unveiled the IDS Concept – a self-driving EV – at the Tokyo motor show in October 2015. Designed for both manual and piloted modes, the IDS Concept features a 60 kW battery along with ‘Artificial Intelligence’ that adapts the car’s driving modes to the driver’s preference.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-12,2017 Lincoln Continental exudes luxury in Detroit,"After a 13-year hiatus, Lincoln is back with a new Continental, which now enters its tenth generation. As the Lincoln MKS will cease production later this year, the all-new Continental will step in as the brand’s flagship model. The Continental nameplate has always been associated with luxury, and according to Kumar Galhotra, president of Lincoln, “with the all-new model, we are focusing on creating more human, personally tailored experiences for our clients – providing what we call quiet luxury.”If you’re experiencing a bout of déjà vu, we won’t fault you. The exterior design seen here is remarkably similar to the  that made its debut at last year’s New York International Auto Show (NYIAS). Up front, the fascia follows the current design language that can now be found on other Lincoln models. On the Continental, the imposing aluminium grille features a pattern that resembles that of the marque’s logo, which itself takes centre stage on it. LEDs are employed for both the front and rear lighting modules as well, with puddle lights fitted in the pedestal-style side mirrors.Another unique design element can be found as you move towards the sides of the car. Discreetly integrated within the car’s beltline are the Continental’s new E-latch electronic door handles. Lincoln say that the system uses a microprocessor to electronically assist in door opening and closing with the simple press of a button, without any mechanical linkages.Once you’ve grasped how to operate the doors and enter the cabin, you’ll be greeted by a generous application of Bridge of Weir leather and natural woods. There is plenty of tech to go along with the affluence as well. This includes Lincoln’s “Perfect Position” front seats that can be adjusted up to not eight, not 12, not even 20, but 30 ways! Ford’s latest Sync 3 system comes as standard, with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and MirrorLink capability.Heating, cooling and massage features are available for both the front and rear passengers’ seats as well, but adjustable recline is reserved for rear occupants. Additionally, those that are being chauffeured will also have access to a rear centre console that allows them to operate the air-con and 19-speaker Revel Ultima sound system. Lincoln is also offering three Black Label designer themes for the interior – Chalet, Thoroughbred and Rhapsody for the selective individual.To ensure that noise from the outside world is minimised within the cabin, there is an Active Noise Control system that uses microphones throughout the cabin to listen for unwanted noises and cancels them by producing opposing sound waves. The focus on ensuring low NVH also includes available 20-inch tyres that are lined with foam to reduce road noise and acoustic-laminated side glass.As for the parts you can’t see, the Continental rides on a heavily modified version of the ford CD4 platform, which also underpins the Ford Explorer, Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKT. Power comes from a 3.0 litre twin-turbo V6 petrol engine, which Lincoln claims produces 400 hp and 542 Nm. A six-speed automatic transmission handles power delivery to all four wheels. Alternative engine options include a 3.7 litre naturally-aspirated V6 and a smaller turbocharged 2.7 litre V6. Both engines are paired to a six-speed automatic, and can be had in either front- or all-wheel drive configurations. Selectable drive modes through the Lincoln Drive Control system —Normal, Sport, and Comfort — adjust suspension firmness, shift mapping, and steering effort.Safety and driver assistance system include Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection, Dynamic Torque Vectoring, Lane-Keeping System, adaptive cruise control, 360-degree camera and auto brake hold.

It is our intention to go that route with the next Elise.”One of the key targets Gales has in mind for the car is to greatly improve day-to-day usability, a well-known weak point of the current car. “There are maybe five or six points that define usability, and that’s what we’ll improve,” he said.Among the changes said to be coming to the new Elise include narrower sills for improved entry and egress –  plus a lighter aluminium tub than the current car’s 68 kg unit. There could be some aluminium panels to replace the fibreglass items, too, according to Gales, to further cut weight.That doesn’t mean that the Elise will stray far from its roots as a pure driving machine, however, as it will reportedly remain a “very lightweight car,” and Gales promises “benchmark handling” among its peers.

The interior can be specified with an option of either red or white leather, silver glass fibre accents, and aluminium or wood trim, depending on taste. Active Noise Cancellation is fitted to all Q60 models to cancel out the negative engine noise frequencies from intruding into the piece and quiet of the cabin. Other luxuries include Infiniti’s InTuition infotainment system and a 13-speaker Bose sound system. With this reveal, we finally get to know what powers the attractive-looking coupe. On offer are two petrol engines – a 3.0 litre twin-turbo V6 from Infiniti’s new “VR” powertrain family, and a 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder mill sourced from Mercedes-Benz.Starting with the 3.0 litre powerplant, the “VR30” engine comes in two power ratings.

For those who can make do with less power, the 2.0 litre turbo engine offers 208 hp (5,500 rpm)/350 Nm (1,500 rpm). The mill is also offered on the 2017 Q50 as well, along with the above-mentioned VR30s, a big change for Infiniti’s line-up. A seven-speed transmission (with Adaptive Shift Control) comes as standard, while Intelligent All-Wheel Drive is available as an option.The performance extends beyond the powertrain, as the Q60 also receives Infiniti’s new Dynamic Digital Suspension, which it claims offers best-in-class handling responses and agility, and enhanced ride comfort – thanks to a new set of dampers. There is also Infiniti’s second-gen Direct Adaptive Steering and Drive Mode Selector as well for more personalised handling.The active and passive safety technologies include Around View Monitor, Intelligent Cruise Control with Distance Control Assist, Forward Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Braking system, Lane Departure Prevention, Blind Spot Intervention and Backup Collision Intervention.The Infiniti Q60 coupe is a step towards the future for the company to remain competitive in the premium car market, where Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi are prime members. What do you think of the Q60 coupe? Does it have what it takes to go up against its German competition?",Gerard Lye
2016-01-12,2017 Honda Ridgeline to take on the pick-up big boys,"Officially unveiled at the 2016 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, is the . While the low-profile design is entirely new, the new Ridgeline is now larger and comes with various updates, including a front-wheel drive layout.Measuring 137 mm wider and 101 mm longer than the , the Ridgeline is based on Honda’s Global Light Truck platform. The truck carries on with a unibody construction and next-generation ACE body structure, instead of a ladder frame platform favoured by other pick-up makers. The cargo area is also larger now, with a four-foot wide flat bed with a maximum payload capacity of 725 kg. The composite, UV-stabilised bed is scratch resistant and it gets a dual-action tailgate that can swing downwards or sideways. Other features include a lockable In-Bed Trunk for secure storage, a drain plug, eight 158 kg tie-down cleats and a 400-watt power inverter. Also new is the in-bed audio system, which utilises six exciters inside the bed walls in place of conventional speakers, with up to 540 watts of power.Inside the cabin of the midsize four-door pick-up truck, tri-zone climate control and a push start button can be found. Aside from available leather trim, a full-coloured eight-inch Display Audio touchscreen with Apple Car Play and Android Auto compatibility can be had. The second-row seats can be folded down to a 60/40 split for added in-cabin cargo space.The new Ridgeline is powered by a 3.5 litre direct-injected i-VTEC V6, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Honda says that it has the best-in-class acceleration and fuel efficiency. Available in both front- and all-wheel drive configuration, the latter gets Honda’s i-VTM4 torque vectoring all-wheel drive tech, featuring Intelligent Terrain Management with normal, sand, snow and mud modes. It’s also available with Honda Sensing technologies such as lane departure warning (LDW), collision mitigation braking system (CMBS), forward collision warning (FCW), road departure mitigation (RDM) and lane keeping assist (LKAS). Higher up the range, Honda LaneWatch or blind spot information system are available. All variants get a multi-angle rear view camera as standard.The new 2017 Honda Ridgeline was designed and developed by Honda R&D Americas and will be produced in the United States by Honda Manufacturing of Alabama in Lincoln.",Graham Chin
2016-01-12,2017 Lexus LC 500 – a show car you can actually buy,"It’s taken four long years, but my, have they been worth it – , it has finally made the trek to production in the form of the 2017 Lexus LC 500 at the 2016 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) today ahead of its on sale date sometime next year.Stop rubbing your eyes (we know, we did so too) – we did not accidentally publish photos of the original concept car. What you see here is exactly what you’ll be able to buy off the showroom floor, right next to your uncle’s . The company claims the astonishing design is a culmination of a “heightened collaboration between design and engineering groups and their commitment to help overcome each other’s hurdles.”The result is that the styling has stayed incredibly faithful to that of the show car, from the dramatic, sensuous, impossibly low-slung forms, to the distinctive triangular headlights with three small LED projectors (apparently one of the smallest in production, contributing to a low bonnet height and short front overhang) and striking arrow-shaped tail lights. Only the addition of more practical door mirrors and flush door handles make the LC’s design appreciably different from the LF-LC.Options include a carbon fibre roof (a glass roof is fitted as standard), an active rear spoiler and 21-inch forged aluminium wheels to replace the standard 20-inch machined cast aluminium items.Inside, it’s just as striking, with a minimalist driver-focused cockpit, dominated by a central spar that rises from the transmission tunnel. And when we say driver-focused, we really mean it – the driving position has been engineered to be as close as possible to the car’s centre of gravity to provide the most amount of feedback to the driver, while optional sport seats offer added bolstering and lateral support when cornering.There’s more – attention has been placed on details such as the size and angle of the steering wheel, the feel and positioning of the magnesium alloy paddle shifters and the optional leather and Alcantara upholstery, all to provide “an engaging yet seductive atmosphere for the driver.”Debuting on the LC 500 is the 2017 Lexus Multimedia system with updated software that is faster and more flexible, with a new graphic user interface and the ability to add future updates. As usual, a Mark Levinson sound system is available as an option, but there’s now a new Pioneer system that is standard-fit, developed in collaboration with the car’s body and cabin designers to enhance the sound within the interior. In terms of safety, the LC 500 comes with the Lexus Safety System + package – utilising millimeter-wave radar and a camera – that adds All-speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (All-speed DRCC) that works in stop-and-go traffic, Pre-Collision System (PCS), Lane Keep Assist (LKA) and Automatic High Beam (AHB).As expected, under the bonnet sits the high-revving all-aluminium 5.0 litre naturally-aspirated V8 from the , developing 467 hp and 527 Nm. Matched to a 10-speed automatic transmission – the first in the luxury segment, Lexus would like to boast – it will sprint from 0-100 km/h in under 4.5 seconds.Going hand-in-hand with the performance of the car, the sound of the engine was also focused on here, with a dual intake inlet that also improves airflow into the V8. There’s also an active exhaust with baffles that open over 3,500 rpm – or all the time in Sport mode – as well as a “sound generator” with tuned acoustic plumbing.Beneath the skin, the LC 500 rides on Lexus’ all-new premium rear-wheel drive luxury platform, part of the global architecture for luxury vehicles (GA-L), that will also underpin all of Lexus’ upcoming front-engine, rear-drive models. The positioning of mass was key, with most of it packaged in a more centralised and lower position to improve centre of gravity.Among these measures, the battery has been moved to the boot, and there’s no spare tyre – the LC 500 rides on run-flat Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres. In addition, the aforementioned carbon roof, aluminium door skins on carbon fibre inner structures and a composite boot floor also help deliver an almost perfect 52:48 weight distribution front-to-rear.The bodyshell is said to be the stiffest Lexus has ever built, with strategic use of high-tensile steel providing higher torsional rigidity than even the ‘s carbon structure. Adding to the strength are special engine compartment bracing, stiff aluminium front suspension towers and a ring structure near the rear fenders.Suspension-wise, the multilink system has double ball joints on upper and lower control arms for more precise steering response and optimised suspension geometry for increased wheel control. All but one of the control arms are made from lightweight forged aluminium to reduce unsprung mass and further improve suspension response.All in all, it’s pretty stunning, isn’t it? What do you think of the LC 500’s looks? Sound off in the comments section after the jump.",Jonathan Lee
2016-01-12,Kia Telluride concept previews premium 7-seat SUV,"The  concept has finally been revealed at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) 2016. The large seven-seater concept is said to highlight Kia’s interest “in potentially offering a premium SUV positioned above the .”The , which gets its name from a ski resort in Colorado, rides on a stretched version of the current  architecture. Its wheelbase has been stretched by 302 mm for a total wheelbase length of 3,081 mm. Overall, the three-row luxury SUV is 5,000 mm long, 2,010 mm wide and 1,800 mm tall. Compared to the current Sorento, it is 241 mm longer, 119 mm wider and 111 mm taller.Designed at the , the Telluride is a plug-in hybrid model. It features a 270 hp 3.5 litre GDI V6 engine paired with a 130 hp electric motor. Kia claims that its Telluride produces a total system output of 400 hp and returns a fuel consumption figure of 7.8 litres per 100 km.Styling wise, the Telluride gets an enlarged version of Kia’s signature tiger-nose front grille, flanked by quad-LED headlamps and horizontal LED indicators. At the rear, slim, vertical tail lights are featured, leading down towards the dual exhaust tips surrounded by a chrome-finished protective plate. Large 22-inch five-spoke wheels contribute to the SUV’s presence.Interestingly, the rear doors are hinged at the back, allowing them to swing open in opposing directions with front door. With no B-pillar in sight, swung open doors clearly reveal the four captain seats in the cabin. The middle-row seats can recline backwards and have fold-away footrests. While not visible in the photos here, Kia says that the third-row seats are a foldable bench type.The middle row seats feature Smart Sensors that are able to capture a passenger’s vital signs – it is the in-cabin health-and-wellness technology the car maker has been talking about. Passenger vitals are then displayed on the interior door panel, and systematically sync with a Light Emitted Rejuvenation (LER) system.Kia explains that, “the LER system utilises a massive, wing-shaped LED panel mounted beneath the oversized sunroof that displays a pattern of therapeutic light to treat jet-lag and improve the passengers’ energy levels.”MIddle-row passengers also get a special Swipe Command touch-sensitive panel on the centre console that gives them control over the infotainment system. Music can be enjoyed via a Harman Kardon seven-speaker audio system, or a set of wireless headphones which can also be wirelessly charged in the car.Up front, the dashboard is a showcase of Kia’s first-use of 3D-printed components. The minimalist area appears to have dual display screens – one for the instruments, another for the vehicle’s infotainment system. Apart from the gear lever, the clean centre console only has a finger-print tech engine push-start button on it.While a lot of the Telluride concept’s features may not be included in production models just yet, it sure looks like the vehicle itself is something that Kia is keen to explore. Positioned above the Sorento, could the Telluride preview a spiritual successor to the long-departed ?",Chris Aaron
2016-01-12,Nissan Titan Warrior Concept makes debut in Detroit,"Nissan is out to make a statement following the introduction of its  in the US. For this year’s North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, the automaker has brought out this, the Nissan Titan Warrior Concept. Ford F-150 Raptor fans, we hope your faith is still strong.Although declared as a concept, the Titan Warrior still utilises the factory fully boxed ladder frame of the Titan XD’s Crew Cab body style. From there, bespoke visual elements are added to create a design which Nissan describes as unapologetic, aggressive and athletic.As no changes were made to the truck’s chassis, the Titan Warrior retains the Titan XD Crew Cab’s wheelbase and length. The concept truck does however get a bump in ride height by 71 mm (from 1,999 mm). Now standing at 2,070 mm tall, Nissan can now fit custom 18-inch aluminium alloy wheels, along with a long-travel suspension setup.The wheels are fitted with large chunky tyres as well, a move that requires widening the truck by 76 mm on each side, bringing the total width of the Titan Warrior up to 2,200 mm. Next, Nissan turned their attention to create a “modern armour” look befitting of a “warrior”. This includes enhancing the Titan’s grille for a more aggressive look, while the front and rear fenders have been flared to promote a muscular outlook. The signature headlights also receive a light makeover, and are now accompanied by custom LED lights. At the rear, a quad-tipped exhaust system is integrated into the rear bumper. Other visual statements include a large front skidplate, as well as a carbon-fibre rear cab spoiler, tailgate spoilers and roof-mounted LED off-road lights.Inside, the Titan Warrior extends the rugged performance look with a strong, angular dashboard layout. There is a custom-built steering wheel that is milled from one block of aluminium, lit panel-mounted gauges and there are auxiliary toggle switches to handle additional off-road accessories. The seats are covered in a carbon-coloured seat fabric trimmed with Magma orange accents. Other interior trim pieces meanwhile, are made of carbon-fibre, polished chrome and leather with accented Magma orange stitching.It’s not all show and no go either. Pop the hood and you’ll find a Cummins 5.0 litre V8 turbodiesel engine and a six-speed Aisin automatic transmission. The mill has 390 hp at its disposal and probably enough torque to pull down a tree, or enough for a Sunday cruise. What do you think of the Nissan Titan Warrior Concept? Would you rather have this or the Ford F-150? Or Dodge Ram 1500? Or something else entirely. One thing’s for sure though, that name, Titan Warrior, is certainly memorable.",Gerard Lye
2016-01-11,Dieselgate: Volkswagen to ready catalytic converter fix,"A redesigned catalytic converter is one of Volkwagen AG’s (VW) proposals to rectify . VW chief executive officer Matthias Mueller said this on January 10, ahead of the NAIAS in Detroit.As reported by , Mueller said “We have one (catalytic converter) in the works and we believe that will be a part of the technical solutions.” He expects the new catalytic converter will be able to be retro-fitted to 430,000 VW vehicles that contain the , and bring the vehicles into compliance.The report added that Mueller will be meeting US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Gina McCarthy on January 13, when VW’s proposal will be forwarded. Mueller has expressed optimism the proposal will help resolve the issue, while McCarthy has previously expressed disappointment over the lack of “a satisfactory way forward,” despite months of negotiations.Mueller said the package will fulfill the expectations of the EPA, including a proposal to buy back some of the affected cars. It was reported last week that VW may need to  non-compliant diesel vehicles in the US. He expressed confidence a “good solution” will be found with the EPA.On his first visit to the US since taking over the reins at VW in September, Mueller admitted the automaker made a “huge mistake” by trying to circumvent , and any solution to the crisis should include efforts to be conscious of the needs and requirements of the US market.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-11,Toyota expert says driverless cars safer than humans,"Autonomous vehicles have long been poised as a life-saving grace where being on the road is concerned. Car makers like , ,  and , to name a few, have all long been believers of the self-driving car, optimistically championing its rightful place in our future.Yet, you’ve heard it all before, and have probably wondered about it yourself, “could autonomous vehicles ever really be safer than humans?” What if a driverless car decides one time that in an attempt to save its own passengers, it must take a course that crashes into a crowd of pedestrians?Scary, isn’t it? That’s the precise sentiment shared by critics and skeptics of autonomous vehicles around the world. How can you blame them, too? Do you truly believe that a computer would be capable of making a rational and ethical decision in a split-second’s notice?At the recent Consumer Electronics Show (CES),  caught up with Gill Pratt, head of the  (TRI), to quiz the expert about this. To explain, TRI is an organisation funded by Toyota Motor Corp. with a special focus on artificial intelligence and robotics.Pratt says that, “I think it’s important not to get too hung up on these extraordinarily contrived rare cases where we have the mistaken belief that human beings actually solved the problem well. Human beings don’t solve the trolley problem well.”For those of you who are unaware as to what the “trolley problem” is, it is simply a question that asks what would you do if there was an unstoppable trolley on its tracks and headed towards killing a crowd of five people. You have a switch that could change the trolley’s course, redirecting it towards where just one person stands on the tracks. Which would you let die? The original five, or the alternative one person?The TRI boss firmly believes that humans and computers are capable of making the same mistakes. But in the greater scheme of things, however, Pratt says that the odds favour computers to do the safer job.Acknowledging that computers are bound to make mistakes here and there, Pratt says, “as part of this drastic reduction in fatalities and accidents (thanks to autonomous cars), there are still going to be some cases where the car had no choice, and it’s important that we as a society come to understand that.”He continued, “I do worry a lot about the learning curve in making sure we don’t mistakenly think the machine is better than it is and certify it to operate in a set of conditions beyond what it actually can do in a safe way.”“I think it is inevitable that there will be a learning curve in autonomy as well. It’s not a Toyota issue. It’s not any other OEM’s issue. It’s everybody’s issue.”",Chris Aaron
2016-01-11,"ZF TRW set to overtake Takata as one of the world’s largest airbag inflator supplier, looking at no.2 spot","With embattled Takata Corporation struggling with  and a , ZF TRW expects to take the number two spot as one of the world’s largest supplier of airbag inflators,  reports. The company has secured a flurry of new contracts from Takata’s former customers.According to Stefan Sommer, CEO of ZF Friedrichshafen AG, the company is expanding global production of inflators and airbags to keep up with demand. He also noted that two factors are currently pushing the expansion. The first, is due to the fact that global industry crash standards were becoming more stringent, requiring more automakers to fit airbags into vehicles. The second reason is that Takata is currently struggling to replace millions of defective inflators. This has lead to Takata’s customers buying replacement inflators not just from ZF TRW, but from Autoliv and Daicel Corp – all of Takata’s biggest rivals. Moreover, 68% of airbag inflators produced by all three companies will be used to repair the embattled company’s faulty airbags by March, this year. Honda, which has already , is one of the company’s newest clients. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said in August that ZF TRW will be a long-term supplier. To meet demand of its growing list of customers, Sommer explained that it will be expanding its global capacity. “It’s a global effect. We are expanding capacity in our existing plants,” the CEO revealed.The company’s North American headquarters will be located in Livonia, Michigan, where its headquarters is situated at the moment. Its old headquarters in Northville will be converted into a sales and engineering centre. Franz Kleiner will replace Julio Caspari as ZF TRW’s North American president on April 1, 2016.Instead of the controversial , TRW and Autoliv for that matter, both utilise guanidine nitrate as an alternative explosive compound. Guanidine nitrate is less vulnerable to heat and moisture in comparison. Said chemical is also being produced by Takata as an alternative propellant for the last two years.",Graham Chin
2016-01-11,Apple registers apple.car domain – hinting at new car?,"In what is probably the biggest hint yet that it is looking to , Apple has registered three top-level web domain names related to cars – apple.car, apple.cars and apple.auto – according to Apple portal .The Cupertino-focused tech site reported that WHOIS database – used for looking up of domain name ownership – was updated last week, indicating that Apple registered the URLs in December via sponsoring registrar MarkMonitor, although it has yet to activate the sites.Now, it very well could be that Apple has registered these domains for the sole automotive-related venture it is currently in, the CarPlay in-car infotainment OS. However, given that the company has reportedly been on a recruitment spree for specialists in the field of electric vehicle and battery technology, it’s likely that these are instead related to its , codenamed Project Titan.Apple is said to have already hired “several hundred people” to work in a “secret lab” – including automotive designers and specialists in the fields of mechanics, manufacturing and robotics –  in the San Francisco Bay area to test the car and has even met up with key personnel from contract manufacturer .",Jonathan Lee
2016-01-11,Volkswagen AG suffers first sales drop in 11 years,"The Volkswagen Group has revealed its sales performance for the whole of 2015, with the German automaker managing to deliver a total of 9,930,600 vehicles to customers. That figure however, represents a 2% decrease compared to 2014, which saw 10,137,400 vehicles being delivered.A breakdown of the delivery figures according to VW AG’s brands indicated that Volkswagen Passenger Cars experienced a 4.8% decrease in deliveries from 6,118,700 to 5,823,400 vehicles. Other brands that experienced a decline included VW Commercial Vehicles (-3.5%), MAN (-14.7%) and Scania (-4%).On the other hand, Audi, Skoda, Seat, Porsche all saw an upswing in sales. Audi managed to increase total vehicle deliveries to 1,803,200 vehicles, up 3.6% from 1,741,100 vehicles in 2014. Porsche meanwhile, saw a double-digit increase in sales of 18.6% to deliver 225,100 cars from 189,800 cars during the same year.From a global perspective, the tense situation in Russia (-36.8%) severely impacted VW AG’s performance in central and eastern Europe that saw an 8.3% decline in vehicle deliveries compared to in 2014. Similarly, the South American market saw a 29.8% decline in deliveries, with Brazil single-handedly dipping by 38.1%.However, it is all green for VW AG in Europe (4,045,400), Western Europe (3,430,200) and North America (931,800), all of which managed to see a 2.5%, 4.8% and 4.4% increase in vehicle deliveries, respectively.

Due to hit the US market sometime in 2016, the 2017 Raptor has been eagerly awaited by Ford fanatics.The redesigned Raptor SuperCrew cab will have four full-sized doors, with greater passenger comfort and storage space in the rear. The Supercrew adds 30 cm to the wheelbase of the SuperCab Raptor, bringing it up to 3.68 metres. The SuperCrew is also wider by 15 cm than the standard F-150, giving it muscular haunches and stability off-road.Dave Pericak, Ford Performance global director, said, “With the addition of SuperCrew, F-150 Raptor customers can leave the pavement behind – without sacrificing comfort and space.” Other upgrades over the previous Raptor are dual exhausts and new 17-inch wheels with next-generation BFGoodrich All-Terrain KO2 tyres to give the Raptor stability and confidence during high-speed runs on rough terrain.An EcoBoost V6 displacing 3.5 litres will power the 2017 F-150 Raptor, paired with a 10-speed gearbox. FOX Racing shocks are also fitted as standard, coming with 1.25 cm bigger canisters to add more ride height.

2016-01-11,Mazda debuts MZ-2.0T engine in prototype racers,"For this season’s IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, the two-car Mazda Prototype race team will be powered by a new petrol-fuelled MZ-2.0T engine. The engine has been in development for some time now, with nearly 6,437 km clocked prior to its racing debut.According to Mazda, the MZ-2.0T’s name is in references to its configuration – “MZ” refers to Mazda, “2.0” refers to its 2.0 litre capacity and “T” is the turbocharger that has been bolted on. The engine is specified as an inline four-cylinder, and shares a similar foundation to the MZR-R engine that powers the entire field in the Indy Lights series. The engine features direct-injection, a tubular 4-2-1 exhaust manifold, a dry sump oiling system, a single 46 mm Garrett turbocharger, a compression ratio of 13.5:1, and is capable of revving up to 9,000 rpm. Power output is rated at approximately 570 hp (285 hp per lire). With  and its Skyactiv-G 2.5T engine, the thought of a smaller turbocharged Skyactiv-G engine is certainly a tantalising one, especially for smaller models in the brand’s range like the Mazda 3 in the future.However, the MZ-2.0T doesn’t bear any Skyactiv-G branding on it, unlike the  that competed in the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) class. The Skyactiv-D engine was eventually adapted for road use, with the CX-5 being the first model to benefit from it.Whether this MZ-2.0T will serve as a precursor to smaller turbocharged Skyactiv-G engines in the future remains to be seen. On the prospect of high-performance models, Mazda says that they have  involving its current crop of vehicles but one can always dream.

2016-01-11,2017 Honda Ridgeline leaked ahead of Detroit debut,"Here’s the first official image of the  for the US market, leaked before its official debut at the 2016 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit.The  was Honda’s first attempt at the US truck market, and it was quite a unique looking machine. This second-gen Ridgeline is a little more conventional in appearance. The truck’s face has elements from the , with the top chrome bar of the grille extending into the headlamps, which have boomerang-shaped LED daytime running lights. The grille design and square jaw means it looks bolder than the 2016 Pilot. Unlike most trucks, the first Ridgeline had unibody construction, and this follow-up should follow suit. Expected items include all-independant suspension and a 3.5 litre direct-injection V6 engine from the Pilot, paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. Word is that front-wheel drive (!) will be available along with AWD, which includes sand, snow and mud terrain modes. Honda brings different things to the truck table, and fans would be hoping that things like the original Ridgeline’s dual-action tailgate and “In-Bed Trunk” are carried over or reinterpreted. The biggest cabin in its class would make it an ideal mid-size pick-up for the less hardcore. Full details soon.",Danny Tan
2016-01-11,2017 Chrysler Pacifica debuts at NAIAS – Town & Country replacement now comes in hybrid flavour,"This is the Chrysler Pacifica, which is making its debut at the 2016 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS). A replacement for the questionably-named Town & Country (T&C), the Pacifica isn’t just your standard minivan as it comes with its fair share of technologies, and even comes in a plug-in hybrid variant.Built on an all-new platform, the Pacifica is significantly lighter than the outgoing T&C, registering just 1,964 kg on the scales for the entry-level model – over 136 kg less than before. The Pacifica also adopts much of the styling cues from the Chrysler 200 sedan that is not only contemporary, but even hints at a “handsome” minivan with those 20-inch wheels.Enter the Pacifica and you’ll be greeted by more design influences from the 200, where depending on variant type, will features various colour and material choices. The dashboard plays host to Chrysler’s Uconnect infotainment system that includes an 8.4-inch touchscreen connected to six speakers, with option of upgrading them to either a 13-speaker Alpine system or a 20-speaker Harman Kardon system.Rear passengers aren’t deprived either with the Uconnect Theater rear seat entertainment system, where they can watch movies, play built-in games, connect personal devices to surf the Internet and stream content throughout the vehicle via two 10-inch HD touchscreens. Natural lighting should be abundant thanks to the tri-pane panoramic sunroof.Being a minivan, transporting children will not doubt be part of the Pacifica’s duties, and they are known to cause quite a mess what with falling cookie crumbs and what not. Which is why the Pacifica features a Stow ‘n Vac integrated vacuum that can access all corners of the vehicle.However, when you’re not transporting humans but things instead, the Stow ‘n Go seating and storage system along with the Stow ‘n Go Assist feature makes it easier to reconfigure the seats for maximum cargo capacity (3,978 litres). Push a button located on the B-pillar, and the Pacifica will move the front seats forward to allow the second-row seat to be stowed into the floor tub. Once the second-row seats are stowed, a second push of the button will return the front seats back to their original position. That’s pretty handy when trying to stuff an 8×4-foot sheet of plywood into the minivan, according to Chrysler.As mentioned earlier, the Pacifica can be had as a plug-in hybrid, where the powertrain consists of a next-gen Pentastar V6 petrol engine with a capacity of 3.6 litres. The mill makes 248 hp/312 Nm, with electrical assistance coming from two motors (front), powered by a 16 kWh Li-ion battery. An electrically variable transmission (EVT) handles power transmission duties to the front wheels.On a full charge, the Pacifica Hybrid is capable of travelling up to 48 km on electricity alone. Charging the battery can be done on a 240 V plug, and will take about two hours to complete. In city driving, the Pacifica is claimed to achieve an efficiency rating of 80 miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe), based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards.As for the non-plug-in hybrid models, the Pacifica still retains the Pentastar 3.6 litre V6 mill, but with a higher power output of 287 hp and 355 Nm, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Power is still sent to the front wheels, with engine stop-start (ESS) technology present to help save fuel.Finally, the safety and driver assistance systems are admirable as well.

Now, data has emerged to show that 2015 was the best year ever for .According to Autodata Corp, US sales hit 17.47 million units in 2015, breaking the previous record of 17.41 million in 2000. The company cites low fuel prices, easy credit and moderate economic growth for the boom. The  report also shared figures from WardsAuto, which provides data used by the U.S. government for economic analysis. The latter’s 2015 sales figure is a record 17.39 million, breaking the 2000 mark of 17.35 million. It was a bumper year, no matter which set of figures you follow.Experts are predicting another record breaking year. “The US economy continues to expand and the most important factors that drive demand for new vehicles are in place, so we expect to see a second consecutive year of record industry sales in 2016,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist for General Motors. He added that the most important factors are employment and growth in personal income, which will remain strong this year.Mark Wakefield, leader of the auto practice at AlixPartners, predicted that sales will peak this year at 17.75 million vehicles, before an annual decline to 15.2 million in 2019. He said that a century of data, along with factors such as a glut of quality used vehicles, pointed to a moderate downturn that will begin to be felt in 2017.We’re seeing a strong recovery from 2009, when auto sales hit the lowest level since World War Two, adjusted for population, at 10.4 million vehicles. The trend is a shift from cars to SUVs, crossovers and trucks, encouraged by low fuel prices and better fuel economy for larger vehicles. At GM, car sales fell 14.2% while sales of SUVs and trucks rose 16.3%.Last week, it was revealed that the Ford F-Series, led by the , has extended two streaks – 39 years as the best-selling truck in the USA and 34 years as the best-selling vehicle of any kind.

2016-01-11,Petron Blaze 100 – RON100 station locations revealed,"Earlier in the week, Petron Malaysia revealed that it will be  on January 15. It was reported that the new RON 100 fuel – which will sit above the RON 95 and RON 97 grades currently available in its Blaze range of fuels – will first be rolled out at eight stations nationwide, with more set to come soon.Now, Petron has revealed the stations that will carry Blaze 100 in the initial phase of its deployment. Six are located in the Klang Valley, while the remaining two are in Johor. The first eight Petron stations selling Blaze 100 are:
1. Petron Jalan Maarof
2. Petron Sg. Besi Toll Southbound
3. Petron Taman Tun Dr. Ismail
4. Petron Kesas Westbound
5. Petron Mile 3 Federal Highway
6. Petron Damansara Kayu Ara
1. Petron Skudai Toll Northbound
2. Petron Linkedua SouthboundThe pricing of the unregulated fuel has not been revealed – as mentioned previously, it’s likely to be pricey,  higher than RM2.25 per litre for standard RON97 petrol, if the pricing by the other unregulated fuel sold in Malaysia, Shell V-Power Racing, is any indication. The latter has commanded a premium of between 45 and 55 sen over regular RON97 V-Power, based on pricing over the past six months.The advent of Blaze 100 is a boon for motorists who own cars and motorcycles designed to run on RON98 and above (like the Honda Civic Type R, previous-gen Suzuki Swift Sport and Toyota 86, as well as high-end superbikes) – these machines should now be able to operate without any fuel-related performance or reliability issues.",Anthony Lim

2016-01-11,Yamaha Motobot Ver. 1 trash talks Valentino Rossi,"On display at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was Yamaha’s Motobot Ver.1. Based on the theme, “Beyond Human Capabilities”, the Motobot is a robot that rides a stock-standard Yamaha R1-M. Except for the crash bars on the R1-M, which we assume is more to protect the robot’s technology than the bike, the machine was unveiled in October last year. Yamaha’s intention is for the Motobot to be better at racing than human racers.  No, that is not a typo, Yamaha is developing the Motobot to race in 2017.They’ve set themselves a lofty target too, which is to beat Valentino Rossi’s lap time at an unspecified track. From the video below, it appears that Yamaha have created a specialised robot that is configured to do one task perfectly, ride a motorcycle. As a technology concept, the Motobot is an interesting development, especially in the field of safety. Humanoid robots can be used to safely test ergonomics and crash testing in real-world conditions, as opposed to static crash test dummies.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-11,VIDEO: Koenigsegg subsidiary shows camless engine,"A new kind of engine is being showcased by Freevalve, a subsidiary of supercar maker, . The company has released a video of its engine that comes without camshafts. The result of this is increased low end torque and power, decreased fuel consumption and less CO2 emissions.The Freevalve concept is also known as fully variable valve actuation. As mentioned, it has no camshafts but instead uses electronically-controlled pneumatic valve actuators controlled by air pressure or springs to open and close each valve.Said system allows each valve to be controlled individually, giving it variable valve lift that differs from standard camshaft-driven engines. That said, cylinder deactivation is also possible, and is much easier compared to conventional mills. The system, which offers full control of both valve timing and lift, utilises proprietary valve position sensors. These sensors allow the system to know the valve position within 1/10 of a millimetre in real time.Should the actuator fail, the company says that the engine will still run as normal, albeit with slightly reduced high rpm power. Furthermore, in this case, Freevalve says that the engine will still be able to provide limp-home capability even if 75% of the actuators fail. Uniquely, the company claims that should the system fail entirely, the engine will stop without any damage done to the engine. Regular camshaft engines, meanwhile, are likely to suffer significant damage or may even be wrecked should the timing belt or chain break.As for fuel consumption, Freevalve states that it offers “diesel-like” fuel consumption. It’s said to be 30% more fuel efficient than a comparable conventional engine. Power-wise, the engine is said to make 30% more power and torque as well. It’s still a work in progress, as the company is still looking into noise, reliability and refinement aspects of the engine.",Graham Chin

The two-door vehicle is an interpretative fusion of the  (known to us as the ) hatch and  SUV. Interpretative, because there’s not much resemblance to the two vehicles on the coupe-like ViRA, which displays a low roofline and a very rakish outline.No accompanying tech details or specifications on what looks to be a B-segment-sized, 2+2 layout offering, so it remains to be seen what drives it along. Plenty of physical presence, with large wheels, front brake calipers and discs on show, and there’s a camera-based rear-view system in place of the traditional side mirrors.More info on the ViRA undoubtedly when the TAS kicks off later this week.",Anthony Lim

Again, there’s nothing of the car to be seen here – it’s audio-only, and lasts just six seconds – but the sound of a seat belt clicking into place and a menacing, purposeful V8 roaring into life tells you all you need to know about the intent of this new model.As we’ve mentioned before, the most probable answer is that this is the long-awaited production version of the stunning , which made its debut a staggering four years ago at the same show.Previewing Lexus’ then-forthcoming design language, including the full-length spindle grille and Nike swoosh LED daytime running lights,  that year and was a crowd and designer favourite, so much so that the company  at the 2012 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney.More recently, , suggesting that the petrol-only variant would utilise the 5.0 litre V8 from the , the first non-F, non-hybrid model to use it.

Earlier in the week,  had caught the second-gen car (fifth, in the case of the Mondeo) undisguised out on Michigan roads.The refreshed Fusion line-up is led by the V6 Sport, which features all-wheel drive and a twin-turbocharged V6 engine. A Fusion Platinum variant has also been added to the petrol range, which now features three EcoBoost engine choices, and two hybrids – the Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid – are also to be found in the mix. The Fusion V6 Sport is powered by a twin-turbocharged 2.7 litre EcoBoost V6 offering 325 hp and 475 Nm, with all-wheel drive present. The motor also equips the  pick-up as well as the Edge Sport, and the power output listed here is almost identical to that seen on the F-150.Equipment includes a suspension with continuously controlled damping for real-time adjustment based on setup and road inputs – the system features pothole detection technology that, in less than the blink of an eye, adjusts the shock absorbers to greatly reduce the severity of impact transmitted to occupants.As seen in the earlier spyshot set, the V6 Sport is distinguished by an aggressive exterior, with deeper air intakes and a gloss black-finish mesh grille. It also has 19-inch wheels, a rear spoiler and dual twin exhaust outlets.The Fusion Platinum, meanwhile, plushes up the interior route in a similar vein to the pre-facelift  for the European market, if not that dressy – for this one, instrument and door trim panels are wrapped in antiqued Cocoa leather, and the hand-wrapped steering wheel is finished in premium Venetian leather. The facelift also introduces a new rotary gear shift dial, which reduces console clutter.On the outside, the Platinum is adorned with a grille finished in a shade called Magnetic, and 19-inch polished wheels are also part of the dress-up kit. The variant is equipped with a 2.0 litre EcoBoost unit and also features all-wheel drive.As for the  and Fusion Energi, the automaker says that new software in both hybrids deliver an even more refined and engaging drive for customers, while more efficient electric motors are expected to contribute to better fuel economy and a purer range of electric driving.Both electrified Fusions can run at electric-only speeds up to 137 km/h, and in the case of the Fusion Energi, its all-electric operation range is 30 km – the car automatically switches to its 2.0 litre Atkinson-cycle petrol engine when the battery is depleted, with total workable range being in excess of 800 km. Recharging the 7.6 kWh lithium-ion battery battery, meanwhile, takes just 2.5 hours.Tech available for the facelift includes a pedestrian detection system as well as hands-free parallel and perpendicular parking capability. Also on, lane-keeping assist, BLIS with cross-traffic alert and the automaker’s SYNC 3 communications and entertainment system.

Some 506 cloned vehicles have been seized as of December 31, in collaboration raids with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC).According to Ismail, the number of cloned vehicles ranged in the thousands. “There are 2,000 to 3,000 cloned vehicles on the road and we aim to seize them. Focus is on Negeri Sembilan, Terengganu and Perak as many cloned vehicles were seized there,” Ismail said.He added, “some people are willing to buy cloned Mercedes-Benz or BMW despite being aware of their dubious status due to the low prices of between RM20,000 to RM30,000.” Ismail advised the public not to buy cloned vehicles as it is an offence under the MACC Act and Road Transport Act. “The risk is very high as the cloned vehicles are not registered and not covered by insurance in case of road accidents,” he warned.Over in Kelantan, JPJ has seized a total of 96 cloned vehicles from 2014 to January 9, 2016.

According to Duncan Aldred, vice president of Global Buick Sales, Service and Marketing, “the Avista embodies the dynamic soul of Buick. It is a modern expression of the brand’s heritage of sophisticated performance, communicated with beautiful elegance.”That beautiful elegance is illustrated by the coupe’s design that sports a sleek profile and uninterrupted body lines that appears to “omit” the conventional B-pillars. The 2+2 seater concept also features wing-shaped lighting front and rear, with illuminated “halos” around the edges that lend a suggesting a three-dimensional shape to its lighting elements. Other exterior highlights include 21-inch aluminium wheels and front fender vents with chrome accents. Buick say that the Avista has a wheelbase measuring 2,811 mm, which is exactly the same as that on the 2016 Chevrolet Camaro. The Camaro rides on General Motors’ Alpha rear-wheel drive platform, and thus, hints at the possibility of Buick producing the Avista in the future.

To help it do so, the concept is powered by a turbocharged, direct-injected TSI petrol engine (likely the same 1.4 litre mill as on the GTE Concept) that provides 148 hp and 249 Nm. Assistance comes in the form of two electric motors that are powered by a 12.4 kWh lithium-ion high-voltage battery, the latter charged either externally or via the gasoline engine.A 54 hp electric motor is assigned to power the front wheels, and is housed within the casing of the SUV’s six-speed DSG automatic transmission. A second electric motor with 114 hp powers the rear wheels instead. The total system output possible is 221 hp, sent to all four wheels via a 4Motion all-wheel drive system. Fuel economy-wise, the hybrid powertrain is said to provide a maximum range of 933 km.The Tiguan GTE Active Concept will make the 0-100 km/h sprint in just 6.4 seconds, with a top speed of 193 km/h (112 km/h in all-electric mode). Its hybrid powertrain can also be direct drive to the front, rear, or all four wheels depending the driving mode selected. As for the off-road aspect, the 4Motion Active Control comes with six driving modes that is controlled via a rotary dial. With the mechanical aspect dealt with, Volkswagen also took the initiative to spruce up the Tiguan GTE Active’s looks to make it look more off-road ready. Built on the Volkswagen Group’s modular transverse matrix (MQB) architecture, the concept measure 4,493 mm long, 1,900 mm wide, 1,765 mm tall with a wheelbase of 2,682 mm. To protect the SUV from the perils of nature (stones, bushes, etc.), there is a matte aluminium shield with four solid black polymer protectors. Matte aluminium is also used for the underbody guard and rear bumper (with the same four polymer protectors as the front). Finally the tyres at 245/70 in size, wrapped around a set of 16-inch wheels.Unlike the all-terrain exterior, the interior is more focused on keeping the driver comfy.

More engines will of course arrive later, varying in availability to suit markets around the world.For now, the range starts with an E 200 variant that will feature a returning 2.0 litre four-cylinder petrol engine that delivers 184 hp and 300 Nm of torque. This will motivate the base petrol E-Class to perform the century sprint in 7.7 seconds. A fuel consumption figure of 5.9 litres per 100 km has been claimed.The second engine option is a brand-new 2.0 litre (1,950 cc) turbodiesel four-pot which makes 195 hp and 400 Nm of torque. The oil-burner is capable of an even quicker 7.3-second dash from standstill to 100 km/h, and promises to return fuel consumption figure of just 3.9 litres per 100 km. The new four-pot diesel mill effective replaces the trusty 2.1-litre turbodiesel that resides in our local W212 E 300 BlueTEC Hybrid, for example.It is said that the two new variants (E 200, E 200 d) will be equipped with Mercedes-Benz’s latest 9G-Tronic torque converter automatic transmission. However, while we do anticipate other variants to adopt this gearbox as well, it is possible to see different transmission options for the plug-in hybrid, AMG Sport model and full-blown AMG E 63 variants.There will also be a more powerful E 350 d (3.0 V6 turbodiesel) with 258 hp and 620 Nm, and an E 350 e plug-in hybrid (2.0 turbo petrol with electric assistance) with a total system output of 279 hp and 600 Nm to come later. They will be joined by a 245 hp E 300 (2.0 litre turbo) and a 333 hp E 400 (3.0 turbo V6).The new E-Class is equipped with a fixed steel suspension system as standard, and as usual, there are three types of suspension fittings – a basic Comfort suspension, a comfortable Avantgarde suspension (lowers vehicle by 15 mm) and a new Sports suspension with adaptive damping to replace the previous fixed Sports suspension.Should these suspension systems not do the trick for you, there is also the optional multi-chamber all-around air suspension – a class-exclusive option, seeing as how its competitors have previously only offered air suspension at the rear axle only. The Air Body Control system offers self-levelling capabilities and maintains optimal ride height, comfort and sportiness based on prevailing road and driving characteristics. The air suspension modes can also be set manually via the Dynamic Select button.Having seen the W213 E-Class from a set of leaked photos, we know that the new car’s styling very closely resembles that of the new W205 C-Class and W222 S-Class. The body features more curves than ever, contributing to a drag coefficient value of 0.23 – a record-breaking figure for the segment, so the German car maker claims.All W213 E-Class variants with a bonnet-mounted star will also feature an Airpanel front-grille shutter system, similar to that seen on the latest C-Class. The system opens the radiator grille by means of adjustable louvres when extra cooling is required and additionally features a second shutter in the air intake beneath the number plate to further improve the system’s overall performance.Avantgarde (red car in pictures) and AMG line (grey) models are available for the new E-Class, positioning the Three-Pointed Star in the centre of the front grille. However, appreciators of the more traditional bonnet-mounted star may opt for their E-Class with the Exclusive line (blue).The entire rear of the vehicle features a similar shape to the current C- and S-Class models. The single-piece tail lights feature a two-bar design similar to that of the W205 C-Class – you may recall that the S-Class has a three-bar design instead.Mercedes-Benz says that there is also an optional “stardust effect” rear lighting system which it describes as a “highlight reminiscent of stardust, the Milky Way or the glow of a jet engine.” The feature makes its debut appearance on the new E-Class. The effect is created with the use of reflectors and a specially configured structure for the tail lights.Inside, Mercedes-Benz has generously revealed pretty much all there is to see with what it claims is its “next-level interior design.” As seen before, the dashboard is a fine middle-ground of what the W222 S-Class and W205 C-Class has offer.On higher-spec variants, dual 12.3-inch display screens form the instrument panel and the centre display screen, while base-spec cars will have to settle for just the single screen on the centre console. Refusing to go with the touch-sensitive display screen route, Mercedes-Benz has instead opted for a pair of touch-sensitive buttons on the steering for its infotainment system.The latest-gen COMAND Online system is available, encompassing the double display screens and Touch Control Buttons on the steering wheel with new design graphics and functions. Vehicles equipped with the system also get a wireless, inductive charging system that works with all mobile devices that either support the Qi standard or can be upgraded to this standard.The charging pad, built into the stowage facility at the front of the centre console, is compatible with mobile phones with a screen diagonal of up to six inches. When the “NFC” logo is touched, the system connects the mobile phone to the head unit and the exterior aerials via Near Field Communication (NFC). Additionally, audiophiles may want to consider the optional 23-speaker Burmester 3D surround sound system as well.There are new sculpted seats for potential owners to embrace, a new three-piece 40/20/40 split rear backrest with a holder for a mobile tablet device and not to forget, the impressive 64-colour ambient lighting system, amongst other items. Merc has also seen to it to include a Heat Comfort package which introduces heated armrests in the doors and centre console.As expected, the new E-Class is also equipped with an array of new tech. If you’ve not been clued in already, the car comes is available with a Remote Parking Pilot system (smartphone-controller parking feature), Car-to-X communication (car-to-car communication), and Digital Vehicle Key (NFC tech allows smartphones to become a car key). Not forgetting Drive Pilot, the brand’s .Safety features galore, the W213 E-Class is not short of Mercedes-Benz’s latest offerings. To highlight a few key items, an Active Brake Assist system is equipped as standard, and is available with a cross-traffic function. Evasive Steering Assist is a brand-new item, which assists drivers who perform sudden evasive, and corrective manoeuvres later, with optimal steering torque to support the movement of the wheel.There are several other existing advanced assistance systems in the new E-Class as well, including Active Lane Keeping Assist, , Active Blind Spot Assist, Pre-Safe Plus and more. Notably, the Pre-Safe system has been updated with a new Impulse side and Sound capabilities.Pre-Safe Impulse side allows the W213 to move its driver or front passenger away danger zones once an imminent side impact is detected. The system inflates an air chamber in the side bolster of the front seat backrest nearest to the side of the impact, creating a greater distance between the impact and the occupant.On the other hand, Pre-Safe Sound is a feature that is based on the human reflex in the inner ear. Mercedes-Benz describes this function to, “emit a short interference signal through the vehicle’s sound system if the risk of a collision is detected. This signal can trigger the natural reflex and thus prepare the occupants’ ears for the expected sound of the accident.”",Chris Aaron
2016-01-11,VIDEO: Hologram to stop disabled parking abuse,"We’ve all seen this (annoying) occurrence before – a handicap parking spot occupied by an inconsiderate, able-bodied driver. Unfortunately, it’s a worldwide issue that one Russian non-profit organisation decided to address in a campaign, involving the use of a hologram, as seen in the video above.According to the video, 30% of drivers in Russia tend to ignore signs marked on the ground. Dislife, the organisation in question, has ingeniously found a way to deter such behaviour. The stunt utilises special cameras that can verify a disabled sticker on the windscreen. Upon detecting the absence of said sticker, a hologram would appear to face up against the driver.The “hologram” here is achieved though the dispersion of a thin layer of air, saturated with water. A moving image of a disabled person, is then projected onto the layer. The 3D-like image will attempt to dissuade the driver from parking in the handicap spot. “Stop! What are you doing? I’m not just a sign on the ground,” the hologram exclaims, followed by an earful for the driver.It is installed at various shopping malls and business centres in Moscow, Russia, including Aviapark – the largest shopping mall in Europe. From the looks of it, the campaign really brought drivers to a halt, as the video shows that many got out of their cars – to take pictures.So guys, rather than the usual “name and shame” on social media, do you think such a tactic will work over here in Malaysia? Share with us your thoughts on this unusual strategy, below.",Graham Chin
2016-01-11,"KTM tickets for CNY sold out, leaving many unhappy","According to a news report, KTM train tickets from KL to Penang, Kedah and Perlis for February 6 were sold out at KL Sentral on Saturday, within an hour after sales commenced. The tickets went on sale at 8.30 am on Saturday, and it wasn’t long before attendants announced that tickets to Butterworth and Padang Besar were no longer available, drawing the ire of some in the waiting crowd,  reports. Angry words were heard at the KTMB ticket counter, and security personnel had to pacify a few visibly agitated customers. Apparently, some buyers had queued up as early as 6.30 am just to secure their tickets under KTMB’s system of selling tickets not more than 30 days in advance, including the travel date. Under the system, tickets for February 7, 8 and 9 were only available on January 9, 10 and 11 respectively. It was also reported that north-bound tickets from JB Sentral to Ipoh, Butterworth and Hat Yai for February 6 were also sold out. February 6 is the day before the eve of Chinese New Year, which falls on February 8 and 9, and most Chinese would want to be home then for the traditional reunion dinner on the eve. The publication added that some customers said there was difficulty in accessing KTM’s website to make online bookings or buy e-tickets, leading to them having to make their way to KL Sentral to attempt the ticket purchases directly.",Anthony Lim
2016-01-08,Gov’t mulling age limit for commercial vehicle drivers,"The government may be required to enforce an age limit for drivers that operate commercial vehicles. This comes in light of a recent decision by insurance companies to no longer provide coverage for commercial vehicle drivers over the age of 65.According to , Deputy Transport minister Datuk Aziz Kaprawi indicated that the Road Transport Department (JPJ) may have to review the issuance of the Goods Drivers Licence (GDL) and Public Service Vehicle (PSV) licence to elderly drivers. “It looks like we have to synchronise the regulation for commercial vehicle drivers due to the latest policy by the insurance industry,” he said. However, Aziz stated that the Transport Ministry will meet with Bank Negara Malaysia and various insurance players to come to a consensus on the issue, with the aim of extending the age coverage for commercial vehicle drivers.Warranty W.4CV, which deals with the age limits for drivers of commercial vehicles outlined by Malaysian Motor Insurance Pool (MMIP), says that “only drivers whose age is between 21 and 65 years on the driver’s last birthday shall be permitted to drive the insured vehicle.” It is yet unknown when the policy came into effect, but it is believed that insurance companies have been applying it since 2014.Established in 1992, and is a special-purpose entity set up and owned collectively by all general insurance companies operating in Malaysia. Its primary aim is to provide motor insurance coverage to vehicles which may be considered ‘high risk’ and which will not be underwritten by any single insurance company. said the issue came to prominence when a 73-year-old lorry driver, Liew Kon Yew, discovered he was not covered under the company’s insurance policy after getting involved in a road accident in Kajang with an MPV two years ago. An experienced driver, Liew has had clean records of more than 40 years driving many different types of lorries.Malaysia Heavy Construction Equipment Owners Association commercial affairs officer Lam Kok Wai chimed in on the issue, stating that industry players were caught by surprise with the policy. “We admit that we didn’t read all the clauses in the insurance policy as drivers above 65 had been getting coverage,” he said. “Mr Liew passed the medical test every year as he was deemed to be in good health with excellent physical attributes. So it is puzzling that the MMIP is getting ahead of the government,” said Lam, who added that the real yardstick of able and healthy drivers is the annual renewal of GDL with RTD. Meanwhile, Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Lorry Association general-secretary Alvin Choong said the MMIP’s decision to renounce liability when it comes to elderly commercial vehicle drivers is setting a bad precedent. He deliberated that “to perceive that elderly drivers cognitive skill as weak is the responsibilities of the government. In doing so, driver over age 65 should not be able to renew their GDL, right?” He also suggested that the next best solution is to impose a slight surcharge on insurance premiums.Malaysian School Bus Association Alliance president Mohd Rofiq Mohd Yusof also urged the authorities to put into consideration the livelihoods of nearly 10,000 drivers across the industry (taxi, lorry and bus operators). He said that many of them above 65 are government retirees and the operators of school buses and taxis. “They are safe and careful drivers. Why single them out? We are talking about their livelihood.”Should commercial vehicle drivers over 65 years of age be denied insurance coverage? Or should they not be allowed to operate commercial vehicles altogether? What are your thoughts on the matter?",Gerard Lye
2016-01-08,The Youabian Puma can now be yours for RM4 million,"Let’s assume that you have in your possession USD$895,000 (RM3,939,342), you’re looking to buy an exotic, presumably expensive car. However, if the thought of owning a second-hand Ferrari 599 GTO or Porsche Carrera GT doesn’t seem to be that appealing to you for some strange reason, how about this, then? The Youabian Puma, an “exotic street legal monster truck.”Available for purchase from Swedish luxury products dealer , this bright blue Youabian Puma is sure to attract more than a few stares thanks to its design (an acquired taste) and gargantuan size. Measuring more than six metres long, two metres wide and nearly two metres tall, the four-seater certainly imposes its presence, and even boasts a retractable hard top!Of course, if the looks don’t attract you, there is always the General Motors LS7 7.0 litre V8 engine under the hood. The mill churns out 505 hp at 6,200 rpm and 637 Nm at 4,800 rpm, more than enough to get the behemoth to sprint to 100 km/h from a standstill in 5.9 seconds.Weighing well over three tonnes, the Puma’s chassis is made of aluminium and steel, while the body is built using aluminium and fibreglass composites. The car also rides on 20-inch chromed forged aluminium wheels, with stopping power provided by large 16-inch front (six-piston calipers) and 13-inch rear (four-piston calipers) rotors.Creature comforts include eight-way power adjustable driver and passenger leather seats with memory function, 1,300 W eight-speaker audio system and a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation and voice recognition.

2016-01-08,Roush F-150 in Blue Flame Metallic – it’s a mean Ford,"If you’re a  fan, this should be a feast for the eyes. The pick-up may be a macho offering, but as the Roush F-150 shows, there’s always a way to spice things up further.Finished in a shade called Blue Metallic Flame, the F-150 gets a host of Roush parts bolted on for effect. Items include a front grille with clear lighting, a front bumper cover, a Roush hood graphic, front windshield banner and a special license plate and frame. The side gets fender flares with clearance lighting, side rocker heritage graphics and on this blue fella, a “splash” style graphic – an optional item.Although not shown here, the blue F-150 will likely have Roush’s tailgate graphic and a square “R” hitch cover in the back. A side-exit performance exhaust system are one of the features not shown as well. In any case, a Roush/Fox 2.0 Performance Series suspension is added to the package, together with Roush 20-inch wheels wrapped in Mickey Thompson Baja ATZ 305/55 tyres.Said wheels also come with a locking lug nut set and a complimentary key bag. Roush isn’t too particular about the inside though, but that’s no loss at all. Here, it comes with simple additions such as moulded front and rear floor liners from WeatherTech and a serialised Roush console badge on the dash.Power-wise, the tuners have fitted the F-150 with a Roush Phase 1 Supercharger kit. Said kit squeezes out a total of 600 hp and 745 Nm of torque. If that’s not enough, the company will be coming up with a Phase 2 Supercharger kit in the future. The second phase, when ready, will see the Roush F-150 churning out about 650 hp and 813 Nm of torque.",Graham Chin
2016-01-08,Next-gen Lexus CT 200h rendered with LF-FC cues,"Said to arrive , the next-generation  has been imagined up by good ol’ . Here, the car image manipulator has thrown in hefty chunks of the ’s styling into the mix. Unsurprisingly, the final outcome looks pretty darn good.In the front, that’s the face of the LF-FC, with the large mesh spindle grille and L-finesse design language. It has probably been adjusted to proportion to fit the four-door hatchback styling of the Lexus CT. Speaking of looks, that side profile is sleek, so sleek in fact, that there’s absolutely no complaints here. This is also thanks to those bulging wheel arches in the front and disconnected character lines. Down the back, more of Lexus’ L-finesse design language is applied, quite excessively too. That pointy edge of the rear lamp leaves quite an impression, while the protruding diffuser-like part below fits in well too.Like the fourth-gen , the CT 200h will reportedly sit on the  platform. In addition to that, the latest model will probably mirror the hybrid powertrain found in the new Prius as well. This means a 98 hp/142 Nm 1.8 litre Atkinson-cycle VVT-i petrol four-pot, mated to twin 71 hp/163 Nm electric motors that are much lighter now. Currently, the CT 200h comes with a 98 hp/142 Nm 1.8 litre Atkinson-cycle petrol engine and a 80 hp/207 Nm electric motor. The existing setup allows for a total output of 134 hp.The Lexus LF-FC premiered at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show earlier. The sedan is actually a preview of the fifth-generation . The futuristic sedan features an “advanced human interface” that supports hand gesture controls on the inside. It’s clean too, as the LF-FC is powered by a hydrogen fuel-cell system.

2016-01-08,Here launches HD Live Map for autonomous vehicles,"Digital mapping and location service provider, Here has revealed its latest product, the HD Live Map at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The company was jointly acquired by three German automakers – Audi AG, BMW Group and Daimler AG , where it remained as an .Touted as the world’s most advanced cloud-based map asset commercially available for vehicles today, Here’s HD Live Map is ready for deployment in connected vehicles in North America and Western Europe. The product, an integrated offering, consists of multiple layers of data delivered in a map-tile format.It is intended to enhance both Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and automated driving functionality in vehicles. HD Live Map is capable of creating a comprehensive and dynamic representation of the road environment, enabling a vehicle to effectively “see around corners” beyond the reach of its on-board sensors.The system is said to serve important role in highly automated driving, which is set to become a commonplace feature in cars of the future. Automakers can utilise that full potential of HD Live Map to enhance their respective car’s ADAS functionality such as adaptive cruise control, adaptive headlights and curve speed warnings.This can be accomplished as the system is capable of collecting data that is subject to high permanency (rarely changing) like lane level information, and data that is subject to quick changes (temporary) such as road construction, traffic and accidents. The system analyses the data along with the car’s own analytics (speed profile, etc.) and informs the vehicle about how to drive based on actual human behaviour data, all in real-time.Here’s HD Live Map is also the first ever map from the company which is self-maintaining, using the multiple sensors on the vehicle to update its maps in near real-time, reducing the dependency on periodic updates. For instance, if a new lane closure is reported, the map would update to reflect this change, and other vehicles approaching the area can be alerted to switch lanes or re-route.Here also say that its product won’t sap your data quota too quickly either because any new events that are added to the map will be layered on top, eliminating the need to update the whole map itself. The small file sizes within each live tile make the delivery of data much leaner, thus reducing bandwidth requirements.With HD Live Map being offered across key regions, Here will be able to support automakers that are looking to widen and deepen their development of automated driving systems. With more and more testbeds, Here expects the continued refinement of HD Live Map together with automakers to ensure it is optimised for their needs be it in the present or the future.",Gerard Lye

The video showed that the 526hp/582 Nm 5.2 litre Voodoo flat-plane crankshaft V8 pushed out figures of 482 hp and 551 Nm at the rear wheels, that’s roughly around 530 hp and 607 Nm at the crank – more power than what was expected.Now, the Texas tuning company has come up with a new custom modification pack called the HPE575, which extracts more power from the naturally-aspirated 5.2 litre V8 mill. To be exact, with said modification pack, the Shelby GT350 will be able to churn out 575 hp at 7,700 rpm and a massive 692 Nm at 4,600 rpm. There’s a more potent  – but that involves a supercharger system.All it takes to achieve that 575 hp figure is a high-flow catalytic converter, a stainless steel mid-pipe exhaust, 1.75-inch stainless steel long-tube headers and an engine management upgrade.

2016-01-08,Small commuter motorcycle and scooter UK sales up,"The Motorcycle Industry Association (MCIA) in the UK issued a statement today that showed more ‘commuter sized’ motorcycles and scooters were sold during 2015 than for any other year since 1983. The association also reported that the number of registered bikes last year went up by 12% over the 2014 figure. The numbers showed more than 43,700 new motorcycles (including scooters) between 101-125 cc were sold in 2015. According to the MCIA, this sized motorcycle is a very popular size for commuting. If the figure included mopeds and bigger sized bikes, it would exceed 114,000 units, the highest total since 2008. The Honda PCX150 was recorded as the UK’s highest selling scooter.According to Steve Kenward, chief executive officer of MCIA said, “we’re seeing an increase in sales of new motorcycles of all sizes, but our records show that we’ve never seen as many bikes of this size sold before. We think it is likely that they are being used for commuting, as they are economical to run and easy to park.”Kenward attributed this to more families looking at a small motorcycle or scooter as an alternative to a second car. He said motorcycles have the advantage of being able to filter through traffic, and ease congestion by reducing the vehicle’s footprint on the road.In Malaysia, interest in small motorcycle and scooter have seen an up-tick, since the rise in the cost of living. More commuters are riding to work, in order to ease the strain on the monthly budget. This doesn’t just include the middle-lower class, as more professionals and younger people are looking at two-wheeled transport for their daily needs because bikes are economical and easy to park.",Mohan K Ramanujam

It is powered by a 2.1 litre four-cylinder turbodiesel engine – similar to the four-pot oil-burner found in the .But without any electric assistance here, the CLS 250d has an output rated at 204 PS at 3,800 rpm and 500 Nm from 1,600 to 1,800 rpm. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 7G-Tronic Plus seven-speed torque converter automatic transmission.With a top speed of 242 km/h, the CLS 250d is capable of performing the century sprint in 7.2 seconds. Its fuel consumption is rated at 4.6-4.7 litres per 100 km.

2016-01-08,Maya Karin petitions to PM Najib Razak to bring back tax exemptions for hybrids/EVs sold in Malaysia,"The Malaysian government introduced a tax exemption for hybrid and electric vehicles sold in the country in 2011. However, in 2014, all fully imported (CBU) hybrid and electric vehicles no , while  and EVs . Malaysian actress Maya Karin is looking to reintroduce those tax exemptions via a petition which you can find .The petition is directed straight at the Government, specifically, Datuk Sri Najib Razak, prime minister of Malaysia. She reasons the importance of green cars to reduce air pollution that adversely affect our health and environment. She even recalls the rise of the fossil fuel-powered cars and the fall of the electric car, resulting from the discovery of highly subsidised oil in the United States and Henry Ford’s highly affordable Ford Model T in 1908.She also points out the affordability of running an EV here in Malaysia, claiming that it is cheaper to charge an EV with electricity such as the Nissan Leaf at RM7 for every 100 km distance traveled, compared to RM22 for a petrol car. She also cites the convenience of an EV, where one can charge the Leaf at home while they’re asleep.Focusing on the policy itself, she points out the irony of it, stating “the irony of this policy is that EVs today have to be imported because with our current demand, there is no reason to locally assemble an electric car which has no engine and transmission parts. But yet the Government is giving the , which normally costs RM880,000, a RM300,000 tax saving for small group of rich people to buy them.”Other CBU hybrids/EVs that are mentioned include the  that could be priced at RM130,000 instead of RM200,000,  (RM150,000 instead of RM190,000) and a  (RM350,000 instead of RM550,000).The petition also highlights the economic benefit for the country that saw a massive spike of hybrid car sales in Malaysia, soaring to 8,403 units in 2011 and almost doubling to 15,355 units in 2012. She asks, “why stop a policy that has such a profound impact towards nation building and meeting our national environmental objectives by year 2020?”She is urging for the support of fellow Malaysians who share her sentiment on the issue of tax exemptions of hybrid and EVs in Malaysia. The , and so far, it stands at 388 supporters. Malaysians, are you supportive of Maya Karin’s petition? What are your thoughts on the matter?",Gerard Lye

In a video posted on Hennessey’s Facebook page, the C7 Stingray is captured screaming away like a banshee, which could perhaps indicate that it has achieved its targeted output.While the  already does quite alright in terms of delivering superb outputs (625 hp/861 Nm), the company chose to work its magic on the Stingray with just 450 hp and 610 Nm, instead. With its HPE1000 package, the company is looking to up the Stingray’s output to a total of 1,000 hp.In the engine bay, where the LT1 6.2 litre V8 engine sits, modifications include forged pistons and steel rods, a custom HPE camshaft, ported cylinder heads, while a 2.9L supercharger system is in place. It also features upgraded fuel injectors and an upgraded fuel system too.Furthermore, it receives a high-flow intercooling system and an intercooler heat exchanger. Elsewhere, long-tube stainless steel headers and high-flow catalytic converters are fitted. Relevant gaskets are in place and appropriate fluids, filled up. The engine management system gets special HPE calibration as well.The C7 Stingray was put on the dyno back in April, 2015, where it screamed out a total of 847 hp and a pretty respectable 976 Nm of torque at the rear wheels, as a result. While the video doesn’t detail as to whether the 1,000 hp target has been attained, it’s still great to watch (and listen to) it drag and yell its way off the mark.",Graham Chin

While that hasn’t changed yet, Kia has released a small photo set that give a better look at the full size sedan’s new looks, before the car launches globally this year.From these photos, the new Cadenza certainly cuts a striking figure – the angular, clean-cut styling marking a welcome change from the current car’s more organic forms. The crisp Z-shaped LED daytime running lights and tail light graphics look great, as does the sharp “tiger nose” grille.There are still no interior photos to be seen, although Kia has previously released , showing a new three-spoke steering wheel, a leather-covered dashboard and kneepads as well as a low-set gearlever. Whether the real thing will be able to get close to the impressive look of the sketch remains to be seen.No technical details have been revealed so far, either, but the presence of a “3.3” badge on the bootlid in an earlier released photo indicates that the new Cadenza could either soldier on with the current 293 hp 3.3 litre direct-injected V6, or utilise the new 370 hp turbocharged version that debuted on the  last month.

On a revised bumper sits a smaller aperture grille, which features a honeycomb pattern design in the same vein as the Focus ST, and the previously round foglamps have now been replaced with rectangular units. The headlamp profile has also been tapered, and the result is a much tauter-looking front.At the back, the  in spyshots has come off, and finally reveals what was hidden – a chrome panel strip that bridges the new tail lamps. In line with current Ford design direction, the redesigned units have a thinner profile, and now extend to meet the number plate recess. The result is a much wider looking rear end; it’s arguably a bit too heavy-set right now and makes the rear end ponderous to the eye from dead-on centre. As the side profile shows, the rest of the car has been left well alone. Those double five-spoke pattern wheels work on this one, for sure. Again, like on the  back in August, the Fusion Sport seen here features twin circular exhaust tailpipes – more recent spy pix showed the single circular pipe tip common to the current Fusion. In terms of presentation, there’s also recessed, flush-to-bumper twin pipe receptacles, the latter as seen on the Malaysian Mondeo, which comes from Europe.No interior pix yet, but the cabin should undoubtedly feature reworked bits. As for powertrain choices, the car should get the  unit (first seen on the Edge), and a  is said to be on the cards – rumours abound that it could be equipped with a 2.7 litre V6 turbo, but more likely is the 2.3 litre EcoBoost four-pot as seen on the , with a different output tune.

2016-01-07,Hyundai Ioniq hybrid – first details and official images,"Following , Hyundai has now revealed its first official images of its  hybrid, along with a few initial details surrounding the vehicle’s chassis and powertrain.As reported, the Ioniq will offer three powertrain options – a full electric vehicle (EV), a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and a plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV). However, only the Ioniq hybrid has been detailed here, with the Korean car maker confirming that the full EV and PHEV will only appear at later points.Even still, all three versions of the Hyundai Ioniq  will rely on just the one, brand-new architecture. Advanced High Strength Steel is a primary component of the structure, assuring chassis rigidity an ability to withstand collision forces. But, Hyundai has also cleverly incorporated lightweight aluminium body panels into the design as well.According to Hyundai’s materials, non-structural body panels such as the hood, tailgate and suspension components are made from aluminium. Use of the lightweight material has allowed for weight savings of up to 12.6 kg.Hyundai has also revealed that its new chassis features a low centre of gravity thanks to its traction battery being positioned lower and nearer to the centre of the vehicle. The Korean carmaker suggests that its new model will offer “dynamic ride and handling at its core,” but we’ll reserve judgement for that once we get a chance to drive it for ourselves.With only the powertrain of the Ioniq hybrid revealed, it looks like Hyundai is starting fresh with a brand-new 105 PS/147 Nm 1.6 litre Kappa GDI petrol engine. Paired with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, Hyundai says that both powertrain elements have been developed exclusively for the Ioniq.Claiming to have the world’s highest thermal efficiency at 40%, Hyundai also explains that its engine’s head and block has a split design for optimised cooling. The four-pot features a 200 bar high-pressure, six-hole direct fuel injector that is said to further improve fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.A 43.5 PS/170 Nm permanent magnet electric motor is sandwiched between the engine and transmission, while a lithium ion polymer traction battery positioned almost directly under the passenger’s seat completes this vehicle’s hybrid nature. No further details, such as its performance characteristics, were revealed.As mentioned in , the Hyundai Ioniq will be making a global debut in Korea first, while bookings for the vehicle are already being taken in several markets. Its motor show debut is set to take place at Geneva in March, giving Hyundai some time to go before revealing further details.",Chris Aaron
2016-01-07,McLaren P1 recalled in the US for faulty hood latch,"The McLaren P1 may be a blistering quick plug-in hybrid sports car, but like other regular cars, it too can be subjected to a recall. Recently, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) revealed a problem relating to the car’s hood latches.According to the NHTSA filing, about 122  in the US are affected by the issue, where the car’s secondary hood latch that may not properly re-engage. As a result, should the primary latch release involuntarily, the hood may open while the vehicle is moving, which sounds like a recipe for disaster when you consider the performance levels of the P1.So far, no injuries or accidents resulting from the defect has been reported. McLaren has submitted a report to the NHTSA stating that the issue originates from a tolerance build-up in two of the internal components within the hood latch.This results in a possibility that if the secondary latch becomes disengaged (by pressing the button found in the hood) and is then reengaged, the solenoid plunger in the secondary latch may miss the latch hole, causing the secondary latch to remain disengaged. If that occurs, the secondary latch will not function properly, which would create a noncompliance with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 113, “Hood Latch System.”Thankfully, the fix is pretty straightforward, and involves replacing the hood latch with a newly-designed one. McLaren will contact owners to have their cars mended at no extra costs, which is expected to take place sometime this month.The McLaren P1 now joins its “holy trinity” brethren – the  and  – where all three have now undergone a recall programme.",Gerard Lye
2016-01-07,Audi e-tron quattro concept on display at CES 2016,"Audi showed its fully-electric sports SUV concept from Frankfurt 2015, the , at the 2016 Consumer Electrics Show in Las Vegas, indicating that it is embracing the concepts of electric vehicles, digitalisation and piloted driving. This includes focusing on making future vehicles user friendly via the human-machine interface (HMI).Here’s a refresher – the e-tron quattro uses three electric motors with up to 370 kW (496 hp) of power in total to provide quattro four-wheel drive and electric torque vectoring, where power is distributed to the rear wheels as necessary to maximise driving dynamics and vehicle stability. Range is claimed to be up to 500 km on the 95 kWh battery, and a production model .Audi’s Electronic Development executive vice president Ricky Hudi said, “The future will radically alter the way our customers operate and experience things in the vehicle. We are developing our successful Audi virtual cockpit into the Audi virtual dashboard and creating an entirely new world of experience for our customers.”The Audi e-tron quattro concept includes all piloted driving functions, including piloted driving in traffic jams and piloted parking, where Audi has been at the forefront of development. The core component of future systems will be the central driver assistance controller, known as the zFAS.zFAS is on display at CES, with an interior model demonstrating a HMI concept that features large AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) displays with integrated haptic feedback. An “MMI touch response” recognizes familiar touch gestures and translates them for the cockpit operating environment.Other future technology developments by Audi include the . The HERE database features highly up-to-date cloud data providing highly accurate location information that is essential for the navigation of self-driving vehicles.Audi also showed its lighting innovations, including the latest Matrix OLED technology and Matrix laser technology.

2016-01-07,2017 Chevrolet Cruze hatchback unveiled in the US,"The 2017 Chevrolet Cruze hatchback has been revealed ahead of its debut at the upcoming 2016 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The alternative bodystyle Cruze comes half a year after its sibling, the second-generation . It’s expected to go on sale in the US in fall this year.Unlike the Cruze sedan that is offered in a total of four variants – L, LS, LT and Premier – the Cruze hatch will only have two variants to choose from – LT and Premier. However, it too can be specified with an optional RS styling package.For the Cruze hatchback, Chevrolet has largely retained much of the sedan’s handsome styling, including the slender swept-back projector headlights with LED positioning lights, sculpted bumper, chrome fog light surrounds and defined character line.The obvious difference between the sedan and hatchback, if it wasn’t clear already, starts from the B-pillar onwards, where the latter gets a reworked roofline and rear-end structure. On the Cruze hatchback, there are now new wraparound tail lights and a more pronounced tailgate-mounted spoiler.According to Chevrolet, the Cruze hatch retains the same wheelbase as the sedan model at 2,700 mm, although one should expect some differences in the other dimensions as well (length, width and height). The automaker also lists the Cruze hatch’s available cargo space as 524 litres, which can be increased to 1,189 litres with the rear seats folded. Expect the interior to be carried over from the sedan as well, featuring the brand’s new MyLink infotainment system.Like the Cruze sedan, the hatch rides on an all-new, more rigid and lighter architecture. Also similar to the sedan are the two different suspension set-ups. Although both variants (LT and Premier) will get MacPherson struts at the front, only the Premier benefits from Z-link independent suspension at the rear. The LT makes do with a torsion beam.The mirroring extends to the powertrain as well. In this case, it is the sedan’s all-aluminium 1.4 litre turbo four-cylinder petrol engine. The direct-injection unit produces 153 hp at 5,600 rpm and 240 Nm from 2,000-4,000 rpm. Transmission choices should include six-speed manual and automatic gearboxes.Chevrolet touts the Cruze hatch as a formidable opponent to other cars in its class, claiming that it offers more standard safety features (Lane Keep Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Side Blind Zone Alert and Rear Park Assist) than any other compact hatch, including the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic. The long wheelbase also results in an interior that boasts two inches more rear legroom than the Ford Focus hatchback and Hyundai Elantra GT.It is unlikely that we will receive either of the two  models anytime soon. The  looks to be a more probable acquisition before the all-new generation arrives. Which one tickles your fancy most – hatchback or sedan?",Gerard Lye

Which is no bad thing, since this is The Most Powerful Civic Ever, The Greatest Civic Ever, The Most Stunning Civic Ever and The Most Impressive Civic Ever, according to its maker. In short, .Honda has gone to town in the US on how the latest Civic is class leading in many aspects. Plenty of , which might or might not reach our shores, but the 2016 Civic’s most spacious cabin in its class and 21% bigger boot than before isn’t an option. Two engines are available in the US – a 2.0 litre naturally aspirated engine with 158 hp (15 horses more than the old 1.8) and a new 1.5 litre turbo engine with 174 hp. The base LX trim with the 2.0 NA engine can be had with a six-speed manual; all other variants come with a CVT. Will we get the turbo engine? Probably not, if what  recently applies.We’ve already detailed the 2016 Civic, and you can dive deep into the new model’s , ,  and even .By the way, Honda didn’t just benchmark the new Civic against traditional rivals (mass market cars like the , , , , , , ) but set out to target “luxury compact class vehicles” like the ,  and .

These photos come courtesy of reader Chua TC, as well as sourced from the .Let’s cut to the chase, shall we? This car is quite obviously based on the , albeit heavily revised. There’s so much of the car ahead of the B-pillar – from the basic shape and form, to the identical bonnet and front door cutouts and the carried-over door mirrors – that is so similar to the BLM that it wouldn’t make sense for this to be an all-new model.At the same time, the company appears to be putting some lessons it learnt from turning the  into the upcoming , as the new Saga features much of the same modifications from the current car. For one, the headlights look to have been reshaped, while the front bumper sports a jutting chin spoiler that we’ve seen on Protons from the Prevé onwards.Moving along, the new Saga gets new door handles that appear to have been carried over from the , while the rear door itself has been reshaped with a prominent C-pillar kink. The character line low down along the flanks also now seems to slope upward – the current car’s is parallel to the floor. The rear of the car is heavily-camouflaged, although it looks to be sleeker, more streamlined than the current Saga.Expect the new Saga to come with the Iriz’s 1.3 and 1.6 litre VVT engines, mated to either a five-speed manual or a CVT. Added equipment, particularly in terms of safety, should also make their way into the new car – although quite what level of kit we should expect from Proton’s sub-RM40k entry level sedan remains to be seen.",Jonathan Lee

No prices quoted here, but we believe if you have a rich brother with many jobs, you’d be able to get one!While inside is where the real magic happens, the Continental GT Monster’s exterior is still worth a mention. It gets an Onyx black paint scheme, detailed with fine red Hotspur accents. To add to that, the coupe features a ventilated hood, complemented with a bodykit, while two-tone alloy wheels are present on this one-off.Onwards to the interior trim, the Continental GT is wrapped in Beluga and Hotspur leather upholstery with more red going on. Other interior specials include a 3D laser-engraved fascia panel, derived and inspired by the Monster logo, sill plates that have the words “Always Lead, Never Follow” engraved onto them and the words “Monster by Mulliner” embroidered onto the headrests.Seeing that this custom Continental GT was developed together with an audio company, that’s where it stands out.

2016-01-07,W213 Merc E-Class gets driverless license in Nevada,"The US state of Nevada has granted an autonomous driving test license to the new . This makes the new German sedan the first standard-production vehicle in the world to receive the special approval by the state.Just in time to strut its stuff at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, three  have specifically been awarded with the license. The tests have been approved to be conducted on all interstate and state highways in Nevada, but Mercedes-Benz also explains that there are several terms that must be adhered to first.One of these terms set by the state requires that at least two people be present inside an autonomous test vehicle at all times. One person must be seated behind the wheel because human drivers are required to perform turns, and the merging and departing of highways.The tests themselves will be carried out amongst everyday traffic, and to make these vehicles easier to identify, they will be fitted with a red license plate reserved for autonomous driving vehicles.Mercedes-Benz has also dismissed the need for its  to be fitted with special and additional hardware and software, such as various sensors, steering wheel modifications and adapted ESP systems.The car maker claims that its production-ready W213 Mercedes-Benz E-Class is naturally equipped with sufficient tech to carry out these tests. It explains that only “some smaller software modifications to the Drive Pilot control unit” were required.Since May 2015, Mercedes-Benz has been testing two self-driving Daimler trucks on public roads in Nevada. The company believes that the desert state’s road network, landscape and traffic volume are highly representative of road conditions throughout the USA.Proudly, Daimler member of the board of management Thomas Weber said, “the fact that Mercedes-Benz is the world’s first vehicle manufacturer to be awarded such a licence shows that we are a step ahead when it comes to autonomous driving. The new E-Class is therefore another big step to the fully automated vehicle.”To clarify, a . However, the  self-driving tech is only fitted to a test mule and  isn’t featured in a production model yet.Mercedes-Benz’s claim to being the “first standard production vehicle” to be given this approval is warranted because its autonomous driving tech will be available in its production-ready W213 sedan – as an optional item, we believe – that is set make a full debut in a matter of days.",Chris Aaron
2016-01-07,Ford to triple its autonomous Fusion Hybrid test fleet,"It’s the next frontier in automotive technology – the stage is set for an autonomous driving arms race, as carmakers compete against each other to see who will build the first production self-driving car, with many already announcing to build one before the end of the decade.

The move is part of Ford’s Smart Mobility strategy for the advancement of connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, customer experience and data and analytics.“Using the most advanced technology and expanding our test fleet are clear signs of our commitment to make autonomous vehicles available for millions of people,” said Ford executive vice president of global product development and chief technical officer Raj Nair. “With more autonomous vehicles on the road, we are accelerating the development of software algorithms that serve to make our vehicles even smarter.”The new cars will utilise the latest version of Velodyne’s laser-based lidar sensors, the Solid-State Hybrid Ultra Puck Auto, to create a real-time three-dimensional image of the car’s surroundings – as the name suggests, it’s a puck-shaped device that is small enough to be fitted, for instance, on the wing mirrors.The sensors have a longer range of up to 200 m, making them the first car-specific lidar sensors to be able to handle different driving scenarios. Such capabilities will help accelerate the development and validation of Ford’s virtual driving software, the central brain.The design of the sensors also allows them to reduce the amount of sensors on the cars from four to two, yet collect the same amount of information thanks to a more targeted field of view. Also fitted are supplemental features and duplicate wiring for power, steering and brakes, as backups in case of failure.Ford’s experience with autonomous vehicles dates back more than a decade to the days of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge, a competition for autonomous vehicles – Ford participated in the 2005 and 2007 editions.The company was one of the first to use Velodyne’s sensors, fitted to a Ford F-250 Super Duty for the challenges – the second-generation Fusion Hybrid models were introduced later in 2013, using a smaller but more advanced Velodyne LiDAR HDL-32E sensor.",Jonathan Lee

There is even an on-board timer that can be programmed to start the charging.Over-the-air “point of interest” (POI) updates can also be delivered directly to vehicles as they become available, providing customers with the latest information as Nissan continues to refresh its services. This connectivity to Azure allows Nissan to bring new connected features to market faster and offer flexibility for the future.Naturally, data privacy and technology standards are a major concern when it comes to cloud-based computing. Nissan’s decision to partner with Microsoft is due to the software giant being the first major cloud provider to adopt the world’s first international cloud privacy standard, ISO 27018.

On the show car, the centre console is now a 13.3-inch HD touchscreen and the instrument panel is a 12.2-inch screen, incorporating electronic instrumentation and gauges. The original human-machine interaction (HMI) has also been updated by integrating Letv’s latest speech recognition technology. It’s also able to work with Letv’s other devices and will include remote monitoring and services with the support of LeCloud, through the vehicle’s Wi-Fi system.Letv first showed its Autolink system in November 2015, the first time the company had released a product specifically developed for automotive applications. Letv says the collaboration with Aston Martin on the Rapide S further demonstrates the capabilities of its global open auto eco-system.The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) a month ago to confirm research projects that include the development of connected electric vehicles through to manufacturing consultation on future electric vehicles, and the vehicle is the first result of the collaboration.",Anthony Lim
2016-01-06,"C346 Ford Focus facelift – 1.5L EcoBoost hatch and sedan variants sighted in Malaysia, launching soon?","Not long to go before the third-generation  premieres locally, by the looks of it – hatchback and sedan examples have been sighted in the country. Seen parked at Setia City Convention Centre, photos of these cars emerged on a local forum earlier today. These are undoubtedly lead examples sent in for SDAC to conduct product familiarisation and sales-related training work. Back in August, we reported that the refreshed C346 – which had its  and GIIAS shows in Jakarta last August – was  this year. Word from the grapevine has it that the launch will only happen after Chinese New Year, though no indication as to exactly when yet. The photos do give us more than a few clues as to what to expect when the time comes.The hatchbacks seen in the photos (dressed in Candy Red and Winning Blue) denote that what will be selling here is a Sport+ model – exterior-wise, the vehicle mirrors the Australian-spec mid-line Sport variant, with the same body styling kit (side skirts, front and rear diffuser extensions, rear sports spoiler) to be seen. It also features the same 17-inch multi-spoke alloy wheel design, which are shod with 215/50 profile tyres.The photos also reveal what we’ve expected for some time now, that the facelifted Focus range for the ASEAN and Oceania markets has dropped bi-xenon headlamps from the specification. The current pre-facelift Sport+ hatch and Titanium sedan have bi-xenons, but the new cars make do with complex surface reflector halogen units, as also seen on the Australian-spec and Indonesian market offerings. The CSR units feature LED daytime running lights, sitting on the upper part of the headlamp assembly.No photos of the interior, so there’s no way to ascertain yet if the local cars will come equipped with a SYNC 2 infotainment system and corresponding eight-inch central screen as seen on Australian cars or be kitted as that found on Indonesian variants, which only get a 4.2-inch screen and original SYNC. Likewise, safety kit – there should be six airbags (Indonesian cars only have two) in there, because any less would be unthinkable. We’ll try to find out more about the equipment levels on Malaysian cars, but if the levels follow Oz-spec trim the Sport+, and these include a nine-speaker Sony sound system, keyless entry with push-button start, leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear shifter. Also on, auto headlights and wipers and dual-zone auto air-conditioning. As for seat trim, the Sport features fabric seats, though we might get leather if we follow Indonesia’s example of up-speccing things.The Titanium sedan wasn’t seen during the  for the car last September, but the general specification and trim shouldn’t veer too much from the Titanium hatch, which is not going to be sold here. As such, equipment should include a six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, leather inserts and bolsters for the seating and a sports suspension.A change to the wheel on this one though. In Australia, the Titanium sedan wears 18-inch five-spoke alloys and 235/40 rubbers, like the hatch, but the local car seen in the photos (finished in what looks to be the shade called Magnetic) is equipped with a previously unseen 10 double-spoke alloy, likely to be a 17-incher.Whichever the body type, the facelifted Focus will be available here – as it is in other markets across the region – with a 1.5 litre EcoBoost engine. The Sigma-derived GTDI four-pot, which has 180 PS at 6,000 rpm and 240 Nm at 1,600 to 5,000 rpm for output numbers, replaces the 2.0 litre Duratec 20 normally-aspirated Ti-VCT GDI engine as powertrain choice.The mill is paired with a SelectShift 6F35 six-speed torque converter automatic gearbox, which takes over from the Getrag 6DCT250 six-speed dry-type double clutch transmission seen currently.

But while the  debut is set to take place in a matter of days now, we may have to wait a little longer for the full unveiling of the next-generation 5 Series.Just like the spyshots we brought you before, a heavy amount of camouflage continues to mask the car’s exterior details. Peeking past the disguise, we can see the 5er’s new headlamps and wider front grille. Wrap-around tail lights with new lighting graphics are visible at the rear, and it also appears that the sporty sedan has received a set of new stylish tail pipes.We’ve also had a  when we spied a wagon version being .

2016-01-06,DRIVEN: Nissan NP300 Navara review in Malaysia,"A seismic shift has been happening in the world of pick-up trucks lately – previously the sole refuge of the commercial trader, these hardy workhorses have taken a surprising slice of the private market, as regular Joes begin warming to their trademark rugged style and all-around invincibility.Since then, manufacturers have started catering to these buyers by outfitting their trucks with stylish looks, a slew of state-of-the-art technology and vastly-improved ride and handling.Nissan introduced the first of these new-age pick-ups with the  – it boasted first-in-class features such as LED headlights, keyless entry and start, a seven-speed automatic transmission and multi-link rear suspension. It’s an impressive offering to say the least, .But the Nissan is late to the party in Malaysia – it was only , and in the ensuing period, rivals like the  and facelifted Ford Ranger have been launched both internationally and in our market. It’s on the back foot, then, but is there still time for the NP300 Navara to claw back ground? We drive it both on and off the beaten track on local soil to find out.The NP300 Navara may be late, but at least it’s  late. It wears its sharp suit with pride, with a strong stance accentuated by big haunches. Do remember, however, that only the top-spec VL is the looker here with the LED headlights and 18-inch dual-tone alloys; the others make do with regular halogen reflector units and puny 16-inch wheels (single cab and base double cab E variants are stuck with steel wheels).Stepping inside, the Navara’s cabin is probably the most car-like on the market, with a dashboard that looks to have been taken off a crossover like the . The pleasing first impression doesn’t stand up to touch, however – the plastics are hard and scratchy, if solid and sturdy. The leather upholstery on the seats, steering wheel and gearknob does lift the ambience somewhat, but again, it’s limited to the VL variant only.Elsewhere, local distributor Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) offers a TCAT Multimedia Navigation system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen as a RM3,922 option, but we wouldn’t really recommend it – it’s a little sluggish in operation and the graphics with the Windows 8-like tiles look a little aftermarket and incongruous next to the truck’s upmarket aspirations.If you can stand having a tiny five-inch non-touch colour screen, the factory system on the top V and VL models – familiar to those who own either the  2.0XL or 2.5XV – is a better choice in our book, being quicker and easier to use as well as possessing classier graphics.Also derived from the Teana, the “zero gravity-inspired” seats, standard on the double cab models, are a real stand-out here – they are very supple and provide so much support that they make light work of long distance driving. Our only complaint here is the steering wheel which, although tilted at a more upright car-like angle than before, doesn’t adjust high enough, making this truck still a bit awkward to drive for taller drivers.It’s a slightly different story at the rear, as the seats are too upright and just a little too cramped to get truly comfortable. But the rear air-con vents (the only one in the class) feel like a real luxury here, and are a big plus point in our sweltering climate.In terms of load capacity, the double cab Navara’s 1,503 mm cargo bay length trails the class leaders, coming in behind the Triton’s 1,520 mm and the Ranger’s 1,549 mm beds. The single cab variant, on the other hand, comes with a no-nonsense 2,348 mm bed, as well as a first-in-class bed step for easier access to cargo.Under the bonnet sits the familiar YD25DDTi 2.5 litre four-pot diesel with common-rail direct-injection and a variable geometry turbocharger. Derived from the previous , it gets a revised cylinder head to push out 190 PS at 3,600 rpm and 450 Nm of torque at 2,000 rpm – that’s 16 PS and 47 Nm more than its predecessor. Nissan claims an improvement in fuel efficiency of around 11%.But (you can start to see a trend here, can’t you?) these outputs are only for the top VL; the rest get just 163 PS and 403 Nm, 11 PS less than before. At the very least, the V and VL models share the same Infiniti-sourced seven-speed torque converter automatic transmission with manual override – the single cab and double cab E variants are available solely with a six-speed manual, while the SE gets the auto as an option. All come with part-time 4×4 as standard, selectable via a rotary knob on-the-fly at speeds of up to 100 km/h.On the open road, you can definitely feel the drop in output – whereas the VL effortlessly surges ahead (if not quite as effortlessly as the more powerful Ranger 3.2L), the V model tested here takes a little bit more time to get up to speed, with a slightly laggier power delivery at low revs.The tardiness is compounded by the automatic gearbox, which is hesitant to kickdown – even though the shifts themselves are smooth and swift – and tends to stick to higher ratios in the interest of better fuel efficiency. While the more powerful variant drives around this through its surfeit of torque, the lower-spec models don’t get the facility to do so; the result is that, in this configuration, the Navara simply feels sluggish.It also puts out a rather loud engine note at speed – despite having seven ratios to play with, it doesn’t quite settle down in top gear – although does become nicely muted at idle and at low revs. Wind and tyre noise is well-isolated, too, even at high speeds, but it’s still not as hushed as the Ranger.In a departure for the segment, all double cab models come with multi-link live rear axle with coil springs, a move that promises SUV levels of ride and handling. Despite this, payload is still rated at around a tonne depending on the model, while towing capacity comes in at up to 3.5 tonnes. The more cargo-ready single cab variant sticks to the beefier, more durable leaf spring suspension.The result is that, with the coil springs, the Navara soaks up undulations relatively well, but it doesn’t feel quite as much of a revelation in its class as Nissan would lead you to believe. At low speeds, the compliance is first-rate, but get up to speed and it actually feels a little too soft to feel properly comfortable, and the body still shimmies about over sharper ruts. What’s more, the rear sinks considerably under heavy loads – not really what you want on a carry-everything pick-up truck.The fact of the matter is that the Navara still doesn’t quite have enough control over body movements for it to really stand out against the best of the rest. So while it does have a ride that approaches those of truck-based SUVs, an X-Trail the NP300 still isn’t.It’s much the same story when it comes to handling, as well. Hustle it through a series of corners and you can feel the potential in the chassis – there’s good grip, decent body control, and it definitely feels a lot more stable and sure-footed than the previous Navara. But it’s just not quite there with the best of them.The soft suspension makes it roll a little bit, of course, but the main issue here is the steering. The slow rack needs a lot of turns to make any discernible change in direction; this, together with the vague, imprecise action, conspire to make the Navara feel a lot less nimble than it actually is, which is a shame.There are other areas where the steering ruins things, too. Despite being electro-hydraulically assisted, the tiller feels much too heavy at low speeds, and it makes the NP300 a slightly cumbersome beast to manoeuvre around town, even though the 12.4 m turning circle is smaller than its predecessor’s. That’s just too bad, as the Nissan’s slim pillars (slimmer than those on the D40) offer a great view out, supported by the rear-view camera that is fitted as standard on the V and VL models.Last but not least, let’s talk about safety. Dual airbags are standard across the range – par for the course for the segment, but lags behind the top Ranger WildTrak’s six – and while SE, V and VL models come with ABS with EBD and brake assist, stability control, Active Brake Limited Slip (ABLS), Hill Start Assist (HSA) and Hill Descent Control (HDC), the base single cab and double cab E variants don’t even feature ABS.When all is said and done, the new Nissan NP300 Navara is a sterling entry to the lifestyle pick-up market, despite the slight blemishes that blot its report card. It looks arguably the best in the segment (although you really need the range-topping VL to showcase the Nissan at its best) and feels the most car-like inside, with modern styling, solid build quality and by far the most comfortable seats ever to be fitted on a truck.Downsides? Well, the ride, although certainly very good, isn’t quite all Nissan makes it out to be, and the wooly steering makes the Navara feel a bit too much like a traditional pick-up than its new clothes suggest. So, not a revolution, then, but you know what they say: “shoot for the moon – even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars.” And the NP300 is definitely still a star among its peers.Sure, there are cheaper pick-ups model-for-model, but the wealth of talent in the new Navara more than makes up for the gulf in price; yet, it’s still affordable enough to distance itself from the technically superior but rather overpriced Ranger. All things considered, it’s the best pick-up on the market.The only decision for those in the market, then, concerns the variant to go for. And for us – if you can stomach the premium, of course – the more powerful engine and vastly better looks of the VL are well worth the extra outlay over the V. Whichever one you choose, however, it’s safe to say that the NP300 Navara is the new  in town. No doubts about that.",Jonathan Lee

2016-01-06,Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coupe receives Night Package,"While both the  are pretty good looking on their own, some customers might want their cars to stand out just a tad bit more. Therefore, the team at Affalterbach has introduced the  for the coupe duo that tags on some exterior enhancements.The Night Package tags on a high-gloss black front apron, with a similar treatment applied for the radiator grille. Down the sides of the car, there are now black-finished alloy wheels, side skirts and side mirrors. The window surrounds now receive a high-gloss black finish, with heat-insulating dark-tinted glass installed from the B-pillar onwards. At the rear, the trademark AMG sports exhaust system gets both its twin tailpipes finished in chrome black, surrounded by modified diffuser.Being a purely visual upgrade, there is no bump in power from the 4.0 litre biturbo V8 petrol engine, which continues to deliver 476 hp and 650 Nm for the C 63 Coupe and 510 hp and 700 Nm for the C63 S Coupe. An AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT seven-speed sports transmission is retained, with 0-100 km/h accomplished in 3.9 seconds on the C 63 S Coupe (base model hits the same mark 0.1 seconds slower).",Gerard Lye
2016-01-06,CES 2016: Volkswagen BUDD-e Concept – electric van is first on the Modular Electric Platform (MEB),"Volkswagen has revealed the BUDD-e Concept at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The BUDD-e is the first car to be based on the new Modular Electric Platform (MEB) designed specifically for plug-in vehicles.VW says that with the BUDD-e, it is demonstrating what electric mobility could be like by the year 2019. The MEB platform will enable a production car to have pure electric range that is on par with today’s petrol-powered cars, and the time required to charge the batteries to 80% of capacity is anticipated to be reduced to about 15 minutes by then. MEB is designed to have the space for electric drive components and large batteries while maintaining interior space and driving dynamics. The 101 kWh battery in the BUDD-e is flat and integrated into almost the entire vehicle floor. It powers two electric motors, one to drive each axle for 4WD. Top speed is 150 km/h and total range is 600 km on a full charge in the NEDC cycle. Like today’s EVs, the BUDDE-e offers several levels of plugged-in charging with the added benefit of cordless inductive charging.The concept van is 4.6m long, 1.9m wide and 1.83m high, placing it between two the existing  and  in size. Nice proportions, thanks to its generous width, relatively long wheelbase (3,152 mm), and very short overhangs. Apparently “inspired by the iconic charm of classic Volkswagen vans”, the two-tone box does resemble .As a car for the Internet of Things, the BUDD-e’s infotainment concept creates a link between it and the outside world. Passengers will be able to access their homes to perform tasks such as controlling the air con, turning lights on, or simply checking if the kids are home yet, for instance. In cooperation with LG, the BUDD-e can obtain info from a smart fridge. Smart home stuff, you get the drift.There’s plenty more it can do, but I like this one the best. BUDD-e can remind its occupants if they have forgotten anything in the car, via their smartphone or wearable. The “Home-Net don’t forget” app has an inventory list where one can see everything that has been put in the car, and if they are still there. The intelligent “Reminder” also informs when particular items should be remembered. For example, if rain is forecast, BUDD-e will notify the driver if there is an umbrella in the car. Relevant items are fitted with a transmitter (in the form of a small sticker) in advance, making it possible for the car to locate them. No more “S#*%” and turning back.VW reckons that in the near future, consumables such as windshield wiper blades, or other kinds of personal items could not only be ordered from the car, but also delivered to it using a “Drop Box” that is accessible from the outside. The vehicle “reads” an access code to open the Drop Box for authorised parcel delivery services, using a digital key, essentially making the vehicle a mobile mailbox.",Danny Tan
2016-01-06,Bosch at the 2016 CES – a full electronic display dashboard and a textured touchscreen lead the tech,"Bosch is showcasing a number of connected functions and assistance systems at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, led by a show car with plenty of visual appeal.The concept features electronic displays filling up the dashboard and central console area, and each of the panels provide information and interactivity with the driver. It’s quite reminiscent of that seen on the  study, except here the presentation is more segmented and geared towards front occupants.The multi-info displays offer plenty in the way of assistance to the driver, such as keeping tabs of appointments in a diary. If say an appointment is cancelled, the car can automatically indicate the route to the next appointment listed. Connected to a smart home, the system can also enable household functions such as heating or security systems to be operated at any time, and handle all aspects of infotainment. The large-scale display can also offer safety-related info. For example, if a pedestrian approaches from the right, a lighting sequence is triggered to alert the driver. The company is also showing a new touchscreen at the CES. The new haptic feedback unit can generate different surface textures, allowing elements to be felt on the display akin to tactile physical button imprints on a surface. The screen generates the feel of rough, smooth, and patterned surfaces to indicate different buttons and functions. To make a selection, a button needs to be pressed more firmly. What makes this special is that the touchscreen looks no different from an ordinary display, and yet it gives users the impression that they are pressing real buttons, the company says.Bosch is also showing a new cloud-based wrong-way driver alert at the event, which lets drivers know of any danger just ten seconds after it arises. A cloud-based function compares actual, anonymised vehicle movement on freeways with the permitted direction of travel, and if there is a discrepancy, wrong-way drivers are warned of their error almost immediately.The company says that the pure software module can be integrated at low cost into smartphone apps such as Bosch’s myDriveAssist or existing infotainment systems, and from this year, will be available as a cloud service.Automated driving is also explored via a highway pilot system, which assumes all the driver’s tasks and responsibilities on freeways. – Bosch will be showcasing the systems and sensors necessary for automated journeys in another demo vehicle at the CES. Also on the list is a new function called automated valet parking. This one goes beyond the ability to help find a vacant space in a parking garage – it enables cars to park themselves. Drivers can simply leave the car at the entrance to the parking garage, and using a smartphone app, can instruct their car to find a space for itself. When ready to leave, they call the car back to the drop-off point in the same way.",Anthony Lim

2016-01-06,"Volkswagen e-Golf Touch previews near-production MIB infotainment system, brings gesture controls","Volkswagen has brought out its e-Golf Touch at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), a follow up to last year’s . The e-Golf serves as a preview of Volkswagen’s next-generation infotainment system, where instead of using buttons exclusively to interact with said system, gestures are used instead.Unlike last year’s concept that served more as a teaser of things to come, the e-Golf Touch, dubbed a “smartphone on wheels”, is an early series-production preview of this new control technology, which will actually make its way into future production vehicles soon. The e-Golf Touch is fitted with the latest generation of Volkswagen’s Modular Infotainment Toolkit (MIB) infotainment system with a 9.2-inch touchscreen display that has a resolution of 1,280×640 pixels. The MIB system captures the gesture control via a proximity sensor that allows you to “wave” your hand across the screen to play the next song, for instance.Greeting the driver and the front passenger are four touch-sensitive buttons on the left side of the screen with a single power/volume dial. Those are the only tactile controls that are available, and the only other way to interact with the system is via hand gestures or the next-gen voice control technology with “Keyword Activation” voice recognition function. Familiar with “Hello Siri”? Try “Hello Volkswagen”.The screen’s available real estate (8.2-inch wide, 4.1-inch high) is divided into two configurable tiles. Each tile area, sized 1.7 inches high and 2.4 inches wide can be assigned any of ten different functions. This includes displaying the current media (song, album art) being played alongside phone functions and/or navigation. If needed, the entire home screen can be filled with one sole function like displaying the full navigation map or work in tandem with smartphone integration platforms such as MirrorLink, Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, through Volkswagen’s Car-Net App-Connect interface. The e-Golf Touch is also catered towards the more tech-savvy individual, with an inductive charging system for mobile phones (located below the air-con controls) and USB Type C port beside it.In addition to the new infotainment unit, the e-Golf Touch also gets a new digital instrument cluster akin to the  in the . Here, it is a 12.3-inch screen, called the Active Info Display, with a resolution of 1,440×540 pixels.Volkswagen also took the time to introduce additional functions that will feature in its future models. The first involves an expanded range of functionality for the Exit Screen, offering personalised, simplified access (one touch) to functions relevant to the real world like programming the auxiliary heating system within a matter of seconds.Personalisation 2.0 meanwhile, introduces “user accounts” for cars that are saved to the cloud via Volkswagen Car-Net ID, allowing a driver to load up their preferred settings into the infotainment system so that everything remains just the way they want it to be.Volkswagen’s rear-seat infotainment system app, Media Control, Generation 3.0, will allow passengers to control various function via a tablet device, like video streaming between tablets, remote control of the media that is playing on tablets via the infotainment system and audio streaming a playlist via tablet or smartphone to the infotainment system.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-06,Harman previews eye-based driver monitoring system,"On top of its , Harman has revealed a new pupil-based driver monitoring system at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2016. The new technology is designed to keep drivers safe by continuously monitoring their eyes’ pupils to prevent excessive cognitive loads.Claimed as an industry-first in vehicle safety systems, the new tech measures pupil dilation to tell if or not a driver is mentally overworked. Harman explains that its “proprietary eye and pupil tracking system measures high cognitive load and mental multitasking in the driver’s seat, and signals the car’s other safety systems to adapt to the driver’s state.”Constant pupil monitoring by the camera allows the computer to analyse pupil reflexes and identify responses triggered by high mental activity. Once the system detects that a driver’s attention is too thinly spread, it can instruct, for example, connected mobile devices to enter a “do-not-disturb” mode, or tell other advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to minimise further physical and mental distraction to the driver.The technology relies on a vehicle’s driver-facing camera, and is said to eliminate the need for complex sensors building into seats and steering wheels or other type of sophisticated biometric sensors.Alon Atsmon, vice president of technology strategy at Harman said that, “safety on the road is more important than ever as more vehicles become connected. Harman is advancing the state of the art for solutions that balance drivers’ desire to stay connected in the car without a compromise to their safety and security.”“Our priority is to arm OEMs with a holistic range of integrated technologies that address both driver wants and needs, and the Harman eye and pupil tracking technology is another advanced step toward a more intelligent driving experience,” he concluded.",Chris Aaron

2016-01-06,"BMW i Vision Future Interaction revealed, with Air Touch gesture control, 21-inch panorama display","Here is the new BMW i Vision Future Interaction concept, folks. Shown at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2016, BMW’s latest concept is said to be a glimpse into the brand’s “user interface of the future.”The concept is based on a . Interestingly, BMW has decided against having conventional doors for this model and opted for an E-Copper Orange as its primary colour, with high-gloss black and Frozen Grey highlights throughout.Similar to the , BMW’s i Vision Future Interaction is the automaker’s answer to an anticipated demand for digital networking in the age of autonomous driving.BMW says that, “on the one hand, it supports the driver in manual driving mode with a clearly defined focus. On the other hand, when the vehicle is in its highly automated mode, the interior provides an opportunity to relax in the innovative seats and to make proactive use of the time gained through the expanded content available on the central information display.”While the exterior of the Future Interaction concept may appear largely like your everyday  – bar the missing roof and doors – the interior is where this car has been mostly redesigned. In some cases, you could argue that it is the cabin that the i8 has long deserved.Completely reworked, three key items feature inside the Future Interaction concept – a large Head-Up Display (HUD) projected on to the windscreen, a 3D instrument cluster, and a 21-inch panorama display screen on the dashboard.The HUD and 3D instrument cluster provide various navigational and driving data in a futuristic way, but its the 21-inch panorama display that completely changes the game. Measuring 40 cm wide and 11 cm tall, the giant screen can be operated by a new Air Touch gesture control method.Without having to physically touch the screen and potentially leave fingerprints all over it, sensors installed in the dashboard captures your hand gestures. Waving and pushing the air is all it takes to operate the system in that mode.BMW says that its system is not only intuitive to use, but is also responsive to prevailing driving situations. For example, at the beginning of a drive, the displays round up driving data for you, such as the battery charge status, route options and more. Once driving along, the displays automatically show a live map and several other driver assistance visuals.With data connectivity and access to the Open Mobility Cloud from BMW, drivers will get unrestricted access to web and video content in their cars. This is for when autonomous driving is engaged and a driver can sit back and relax.Also noteworthy is that the BMW i Vision Future Interaction concept features no physical switches or dials on the dashboard. The gear selector has moved to the steering column, similar to the BMW i3’s arrangement. The only other control is located on the new steering wheel, and is a selector for the drive mode.Three driving modes are available – Pure, Assist and Auto. In Pure mode, the car surrenders its technological wizardly for pure BMW driving pleasure. In Assist mode, the car allows driver control, but will intervene and take over control should it detect an imminent danger.In Auto mode, the BMW i Vision Future Interaction concept is capable of completely autonomous driving. All hands off, the vehicle takes complete control of the car, and allows a driver to sit back and relax. Given that full autonomous driving is only legal in some roads around the world, this BWM will be able to inform drivers when switching on the Auto mode is possible.",Chris Aaron
2016-01-06,BMW i8 Mirrorless Camera technology shown at CES,"At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, BMW is showcasing a unique piece of innovation in the form of Mirrorless Camera tech for the . Said technology is employed to replace age-old exterior and rear view mirrors via the use of three cameras, that can cover large viewing angles and dangerous blind spots as well. Outside, two cameras are housed in aerodynamically-optimised encasings – these replace the exterior side mirrors. In addition to that, a third camera fixed to the upper edge of the rear windscreen further supplements both. When active, images from all three are combined and displayed as a single image on a high-res display in the rearview mirror (or display). The images, when combined, are sent to a display (where the rear view mirror is located) that measures 300 mm wide and 75 mm tall. The display is rounded at the side to give off a natural panoramic perception of traffic in the rear. It doesn’t just display images from the camera by the way – the display system can also evaluate camera images and respond quickly to impending hazards. If a driver signals to indicate they are about to overtake, but an oncoming car is travelling much faster, a striking yellow warning icon flashes on the display. It increases in size as the hazard approaches. Another feature, is when a driver is about to turn right at a traffic light. The system recognises this through the indicators or a sharp turn – the image swivels to the right and is expanded to give a better view of the rear. According to BMW, the image of the traffic behind the vehicle via said cameras has a wider viewing angle than that of conventional interior and exterior mirrors. To add to that, no adjustment of the cameras are needed (it’s also free from servicing for that matter). Aside from blind spots, motorcyclists can be captured by the camera or directly in vision from the side window.In addition to that, the display prevents direct glare, while the contrast can be adjusted according to lighting conditions. As for parking, trajectory lines are provided as well. Furthermore, passengers can use the display to check whether there is oncoming traffic, pedestrians or cyclists before they open the door. Design of the exterior mirrors are also taken into consideration. BMW says that the “wing-like” holders are optimised aerodynamically and “aeroacoustically,” with positive effects on consumption and low wind noise. It can channel rainwater round the side windows, while the camera lenses are made of Gorilla Glass Type 2. It’s heatable and sealed with a dirt-repellant coating and spray water can be conducted around the lens. The  Extended Rearview Mirror is also featured. Working in tandem with conventional exterior mirrors, it improves the view behind the car, BMW says. With a camera located in the antenna foot on the roof of the vehicle, the combination significantly extends the drivers field of vision in the rear. It also allows for easier assessment of how far away or how quickly vehicles are approaching from behind.",Graham Chin

The innovations presented at this year’s show demonstrate the future direction we are taking.”Kia’s future Drive Wise technologies that are currently on display at CES are built upon the current generation of driver assistance systems. They include Highway Autonomous Driving (HAD), Urban Autonomous Driving (UAD), Preceding Vehicle Following (PVF), Emergency Stop System (ESS), Traffic Jam Assist (TJA) and Autonomous Valet Parking. These system are designed to make driving safer and more convenient for Kia customers, be it on the highway, where the car is capable driving itself while maintaining a safe distance from the car ahead, navigating through a traffic crawl, or remotely parking the car.In addition to these driver assistance systems, Drive Wise technologies will also facilitate communication and interaction between the driver and vehicle with innovative new Human Machine Interface (HMI) function. This is demonstrated via its I-Cockpit display that features gesture control, fingerprint sensors and smart-device connectivity.To accelerate its development of its new Drive Wise technologies, the US state of  to test the new technologies on public roads. This will be accomplished by using a Kia Soul EV that will act as the brand’s testbed.The vehicle will play a role in the development of Drive Wise’s vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications system. The V2X system will form the stepping stone to bring a true fully-autonomous car to market by 2030, where V2X must be fully integrated into real-life driving environments and be able to react as a human driver can.The V2X applies a series of sensors, radar, LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and external cameras, to recognise the surrounding environment and all relevant obstacles. The system integrates vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technologies as well, allowing the car to recognise, judge and control every driving scenario, obstacle or potential threat.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-06,"BMW showcases networked mobility technology, including gesture control parking and remote 3D view","Keeping up with the times, BMW says that to allow for the vision of BMW Connected – a personalised digital assistant to support individual mobility – in becoming a reality, “a highly flexible service architecture” is needed. Hence, the introduction of “Open Mobility Cloud” at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. Employed in the , it’s linked to networked systems such as smartphones or smart watches to allow automated control through the Cloud. To demonstrate this, the  and a Smart Home are linked to the Open Mobility Cloud. Here, the brand also categorises this new tech under “The Internet of Things.” Gesture Control Parking is one of those features linked to the Cloud (and Smart Home, for that matter). As to how this works; it allows for the i3 to drive in and out of a parking space via wave gestures, recognised by a smart watch (connected to the Cloud) and transmitted to the car. Said gestures will signal the start of the parking procedure, without the driver needing to be in the i3.Similarly, to drive out of the parking space, wave gestures can also be performed here. Triggered by the smart watch, at the wave of the hand, it prompts the i3 to reverse out of the space on its own and position itself in the right direction – ready to go.Next up, is Remote 3D View. The application here allows for drivers to monitor the i3 as it drives in and out of the garage on its own. With four cameras that give a 360 degree view of the vehicle’s surroundings, images taken by cameras are streamed through BMW Connected to smartphones or Mobility Mirror – an intelligent in-home mirror that displays information, including info of the i3, in this case.Bumper Detect, is another feature elaborated at the show. As its name suggests, it’s particularly useful for small accidents in car parks – to catch hit-and-run incidents or unwary bumps, by the driver at fault. Utilising sensors that detects the bump, the cameras then activate, while providing images through Remote 3D View. As this happens, the network sends a notification to the driver’s smartphone over BMW Connected and if requested, images can be sent to the driver’s smartphone as well.

This also marks Microsoft’s first venture into the connected car space.The tech giants aims to incorporate the Microsoft Office 365 suite into Harman infotainment systems to offer a new emphasis on in-car work productivity. The two companies will also share its existing products, services and tech to develop this new convenience feature for a safe and reliable work experience in your car.No confirmation has been provided as to when a final product of this collaboration will enter the market, but it sure looks like quite a different ball game to what  and  have been playing up recently. There, the Swedish and German car makers have cooked up more entertainment-based ideas, while it is all business for these tech giants.In any case, this initiative to introduce Microsoft Office 365 in the vehicle is said to allow drivers to “complete tasks without compromising safety.” This was defined as being able to schedule meetings, listen and respond to emails and join conference calls without having to manually input phone numbers or passcodes.Drivers will also be able to hold Skype calls when the vehicle is in park, or whilst it is in autonomous driving state – this will of course depend on your vehicle’s ability to drive autonomously.Phil Eyler, president of Harman Connected Car believes that, “drivers want an immersive, and personalised experience in the car. Increasingly, that includes strong demands for richer productivity. This collaboration will bring these functionalities to market with, importantly, great reliability, security and minimal driver distraction.”",Chris Aaron
2016-01-06,Decline in spectator numbers for 2015 Malaysian GP – Sepang International Circuit expects a tough 2016,"Sepang International Circuit (SIC) has revealed in its 2015 roundup that the year was a difficult one for it – while the MotoGP round provided cheer, garnering more than 150,000 spectators, there was a decline in spectator numbers for the 2015 Malaysian F1 GP and lower than expected fan support for the FIM Superbike World Championship 2015 (WSBK) round held here, the latter due to the Hari Raya period. The implementation of GST also impacted ticket sales, with consumers cutting down on spending for non-essentials, and forex losses following the depreciation of the ringgit didn’t help, SIC said.Even as sales and revenue targets for events like the F1 and WSBK fell short due to limited local support, compounded by GST and the haze, the track itself continued to be popular in terms of bookings – SIC says it has been hitting a consistent 98% for the past five years. The track has become more popular with new audiences, with an increase in  and events being held there.With regards to the Petronas Malaysia Formula One Grand Prix 2015, the decline in overall spectator numbers, particularly local spectators, was offset by an increase in international visitors, which saw a growth of 2.7%.The venue is , following successful negotiation with Formula One Management, though the race for this year has been rescheduled – the Malaysian GP is now placed further along in the 2016 calendar, . It’s set to run on October 2, two weeks after the Singapore GP.The move is to facilitate  to be carried out on the 5.54 km-long circuit to ensure homologation requirements. The track will be closed from February to May.The closure will be part of the challenges facing SIC this year – the company says it is expecting a demanding year, given the reduced revenue following the track closure for three months. Nevertheless, there are indications of improvements being seen in ticket sales and spectator numbers in 2016, with the WSBK taking place on a more conducive weekend and featuring a well-known local rider, and the move to October will allow SIC more time to promote Malaysian F1 GP.It added that plans to expand SIC’s scope beyond the track will continue to be pursued – planned projects over the next few years include a hotel and a specialised drivers’ education facility within SIC’s 300 hectare land bank.",Anthony Lim
2016-01-06,"Volvo, Ericsson to offer HD media streaming in cars","Preparing for its , Volvo is teaming-up with Ericsson to bring high-bandwidth, interruption-free media streaming to its cars. The new technology was previewed in the brand’s  which was shown at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).Anders Tylman, general manager of Volvo Monitoring and Concept Centre, said, “imagine a highway full of autonomous cars with their occupants sitting back watching their favourite TV shows in high definition. This new way of commuting will demand new technology and a much broader bandwidth to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.”Volvo and Ericsson believe that with the rise of autonomous vehicles, highly-populated areas will soon demand consistent and high-bandwidth coverage. Volvo plans to utilise Ericsson’s network and cloud expertise to answer this by delivering the service, interruption-free, in its future cars.Video content, sourced from the internet, will then be delivered uninterruptedly to vehicles, in which passengers enjoying the autonomous journey may stream and watch seamlessly. Volvo also plans for its vehicle systems to be able to calculate routes and network conditions ahead, and tailoring the duration of the content according to each trip.“Our research shows that almost 70% of all mobile data traffic will be from video in the coming years. This requires an innovative connectivity, cloud and analytics solution that is not only capable of serving multiple moving vehicles across a highway, but also has the capacity to provide the high-quality, uninterrupted video service today’s consumer is accustomed to,” said Claes Herlitz, head of Automotive Services at Ericsson.Tylman continued to highlight the capabilities of its future tech being able to optimise video content based on how long a journey would be. Altering a route if it must, Tylman says that, “autonomous driving is no longer just a question of getting from A to B quickly – it’s about the experience you wish to have in the car, how you wish to spend the time you are saving.“With our future autonomous drive technology we will provide people with the freedom to choose the way they would like to commute and the content they would like to experience,” he concluded.",Chris Aaron
2016-01-05,"Honda R&D chief defines future powertrain direction, turbo engines not likely for majority of SEA markets","In an interview with  recently, Honda R&D chief Keiji Ohtsu shed some light on the automaker’s future direction for its powertrains. Since its , Honda has put five new engines and three CVT transmissions in the market, and it is far from done.This year, Honda will launch two more engines, and Ohtsu revealed a few more plans leading up to year 2020. “We are focusing on weight reduction (in the future), changing V6 to inline-four engines, and inline fours to three cylinders,” Ohtsu told the publication.Given the three new turbocharged engines it revealed in 2013, the R&D chief confirmed that the goal was to meet “regional needs in North America, Europe and China.” However, he did say that the , which hasn’t found its way into a production model yet (), is still under development. The  and , for example, while the .He mentioned later that these markets were continually adopting more stringent emissions regulations, resulting in car makers switching their focus to engine downsizing. “China offers the added incentive of a tax break for smaller-displacement engines, further encouraging downsizing,” he explained.But while the Chinese market is set to gain Honda’s turbocharged power, it looks like the rest of South East Asia (SEA) may not be so lucky. “Depending on the market and region, but particularly in Asia and other emerging markets, we will continue offering our naturally-aspirated lineup, which tends to be less costly. In South East Asia, we will supply our current lineup of naturally-aspirated engines,” Ohtsu stated.With Honda moving towards turbocharging in many markets, it was anticipated that the Japanese manufacturer will be looking to gradually replace its  with its new 1.5 litre turbocharged mill. It seems likely that our market will continue to feature N/A engines for the foreseeable future.Ohtsu did mention that he was also expecting Honda’s  to storm the global market, but claimed that in its attempt to achieve ultimate fuel efficiency levels, a turbocharged hybrid isn’t likely to take shape any time soon. “We expect the ratio of hybrids to grow, although for the time being Honda won’t use turbocharged engines in our hybrids,” he explained.With turbo-hybrid powertrains out of the way, looking ahead, the Honda R&D chief said that it plans to continue developing pure turbocharged engines for greater performance and efficiency. “We’re just approaching the midway point in our plan. We eventually want to achieve a heat efficiency of 50% through lean turbocharging. We will focus on HLSI, or homogeneous lean-charge spark-ignition technology,” he said.“Of the two leading combustion technology candidates – the other being HCCI, or homogeneous-charge-compression ignition – we have opted for spark ignition because we feel that HCCI is limited in terms of rpm, torque and operational band or range. HLSI is better suited to Honda’s engine concept. We’ve researched both, of course.”To further elaborate, HCCI engines require no spark plug type of igniter to create a ignite the fuel mixture. A reaction is created purely by raising the density and temperature in the combustion chamber via sheer compression until the fuel mixture ignites spontaneously.“If we achieve 50% heat efficiency, it would put our conventional engines on an equal footing with our hybrids. Using the JC08 test mode, the Honda Fit, for instance, would improve to 2.7 litres per 100 km from 3.9 litres per 100 km at present. This is an estimate, of course.”",Chris Aaron
2016-01-06,BMW Motorrad unveils laser light and HUD helmet,"BMW Motarrad showed the Connect Ride concept bike at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on January 6. Based on the  touring bike, BMW highlighted two technology concepts it says will enhance the riding experience and improve safety and awareness for the rider.The first of these, laser headlights, is not really a new thing, having been shown on the  and . And it isn’t quite using lasers to light the way either. The system uses a set of mirrors to focus laser light that excites a yellow phosphorus coating, which then emits a pure, white light.The advantage to using lasers, says BMW, is a longer throw of the light beam, up to almost 600 metres, and low power consumption.  There is also less bleed-over from the beam, which means drivers in oncoming traffic will not be blinded by the glare of the beam.At the moment, BMW says the technology is too expensive to bring to the motorcycle mass-market, but developments in technology may see laser light on the road soon.  What’s not to like about a focused, glare-free light beam that illuminates everything up to a half-kilometre away?The second technology concept BMW displayed at CES was Connect Ride, a heads-up display (HUD) helmet that has been in the works for a while. The initial concept was shown in 2011, but it was found to be slow, and rather clumsy. Four years later, the improved system seems to be something that might work in real life.BMW’s HUD helmet drops a screen down in front of the rider’s eye. The system can display data such as speed, navigation, fuel level, tyre pressure, temperature and so on. The data display is customisable to the rider’s needs, and can include other data such as traffic warnings and road congestion.The controls for the HUD are located on the left handlebar, making it easier and safer to operate. The system also incorporates a pair of cameras, front and rear. The front camera functions as a dash cam, while the rear acts as a rear-view mirror.According to BMW, there are plans to put this helmet into production “within the medium-term”. Since other companies purporting to be developing HUD technology have yet to to produce HUD helmets beyond prototypes, BMW’s Connected Ride might be the best bet yet.Whether the distraction of having a screen in front of your eye is a boon or a bane to riding safety, remains to be seen.  What do you think? Is “Tron” technology the next great leap forward in enhancing riding safety and the ride itself? Leave a comment with your thoughts and opinions.",Mohan K Ramanujam

The camouflage around the front end keeps its particular design line under wraps, but judging by the wheels, front grille and single exhaust, this could be one of the lower-end GLC Coupe variants.Don’t be fooled by the appearance of dual exhaust tips – look closely, and the “outlets” are clearly fake. Despite the camouflage all over the rear, it once again appears the GLC Coupe will share a very similar tail-end design with its larger  sibling.The tail lights appear to be elongated, as they are on most new Mercedes-Benz coupes  and .

2016-01-06,Bentley’s Mulliner now offers stone veneers from India,"Wood veneers too mainstream? Bentley has the answer. The Crewe outfit’s Mulliner bespoke coachbuilding division is now offering stone veneers. Yes, stone, .Bentley says that its latest interior finish utilises state-of-the-art stone veneer technology to make a luxurious, contemporary feature of a natural product formed over 200 million years. The slate and quartzite stone is sustainably sourced from hand-selected quarries in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, India, which has an ancient and rich culture of stone masonry. The sections of stone are split from larger pieces and cured using glass fibre and a bespoke resin. They are then shaped and hand finished by the Mulliner coachbuilding team in England.Apparently, the stone surfaces of the veneers are both extremely light and translucent, allowing the grain and pattern in the stone to be visible to the eye. Mulliner offers stone veneers in a natural finish, in four different colours on the : Galaxy, Autumn White, Terra Red and Copper.“Bentley is the established expert in the handcrafting of wood and leather, and now we are exploring new, fine and rare materials to offer even more bespoke tailoring and choice to our customers.

2016-01-06,Nvidia Drive PX 2 – world’s first in-car artificial intelligence computer for future self-driving cars,"At the ongoing 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia unveiled its sequel to the Drive PX in-car computer it debuted last year – the Drive PX 2. With the advent of self-driving cars from major automakers, the company is looking to be the main supplier of hardware to ensure that there is sufficient processing power to support this technology. The Drive PX 2 packs 12 CPU cores capable of providing eight teraflops (TFLOPS) worth of processing power. This allows it to deliver up to 24 trillion deep learning operations per second. The computer also adopts a 16 nm architecture on the computer, along with two next-gen Tegra processors, as well as a Pascal-based GPU.Running the whole system requires 250 W, with liquid-cooling installed to ensure things don’t get too toasty. To put into perspective the amount of processing power found on the PX 2, it is equivalent to that of 150 MacBook Pros.All that raw processing power is necessary for building capable self-driving cars. The PX 2 is capable of processing the inputs of 12 video cameras, plus lidar, radar and ultrasonic sensors. It fuses them to accurately detect objects, identify them, determine where the car is relative to the world around it, and then calculate its optimal path for safe travel. Nvidia also announced Drivenet alongside the PX 2, its own deep neural network that features nine separate neural networks. Drivenet is able to identify five different classes of objects, including pedestrians and motorcyclists, and it learns over time. Nvidia understands that automakers might want to “teach” the system differently, which can be accomplished via the Deep Learning GPU Training System (DIGITS).The company dubs the PX 2 as the “first in-car artificial intelligence supercomputer”, and automakers, including Audi, BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo have already pledged their interest in testing out the system, with Volvo being the first company to deploy the PX 2.In the world’s first public trial of autonomous driving, the Swedish automaker will lease 100 XC90 SUVs equipped with Drive PX 2 technology, slated to hit the road next year in the Swedish carmaker’s Drive Me autonomous-car pilot programme. The programme, in line with the brand’s Vision 2020 will see the cars operate autonomously on roads around Gothenburg, the carmaker’s hometown, and semi-autonomously elsewhere.Volvo isn’t the only automaker to capitalise on Nvidia’s latest creation. Toyota is also looking to provide its cars autonomous driving capabilities, with the collaboration of Tokyo-based company Preferred Networks. Toyota recently purchased a three percent stake in the company to develop cars with autonomous driving capabilities.Non-automakers like Tokyo-based ZMP also stand to benefit from the PX 2. The company is working to create autonomous taxis by using using deep learning technology and Nvidia Drive PX 2 to dramatically improve the accuracy of detection and decision-making algorithms for autonomous driving. The goal is to realise its driverless Robot Taxi service in the future.",Gerard Lye

Thankfully, Kia is now developing a successor, as can be seen from these photos from our European spies.At first glance, the new car looks similar to the existing TA generation, but a closer look reveals a few new details. The (likely optional) projector headlights now feature unbroken strips of LED daytime running lights – the current one uses individual diodes. The front fascia with a large downturned lower grille also appears to be more aggressive-looking than the current car’s cheery face.Along the side, the first-gen Picanto’s upward window line kink at the rear makes an appearance here (current car’s is straight). Moving towards the rear, there are C-shaped LED tail lights like we get on our Picanto, although the clear portion indicates that the reverse lights could move up from its current position in the rear bumper to be integrated into the tail lights.Details are pretty scarce, but like the , expect the new Picanto to be larger in all directions than the current car, with the chief beneficiary likely being boot space to address a key shortcoming of the TA.The interior should also become more upscale to better compete against the likes of the Volkswagen up! – through the spyshots, we can see what appears to be a new three-spoke steering wheel, replacing the current two-spoke unit.As for the mechanicals, the Picanto should retain the current 1.0 litre three-cylinder and 1.2 litre four-cylinder naturally-aspirated Kappa II engines, as well as a 1.0 litre three-pot Kappa TCI turbo.

2016-01-06,Ford sets out to develop drone-to-vehicle technology,"Ford and drone-maker DJI have announced the DJI Developer Challenge, which invites developers to create a drone-to-vehicle communications system utilising Ford SYNC AppLink or OpenXC. Developers – who will be able to use vehicle data available through the platforms – will be tasked with creating software that would allow a  and a drone to communicate in real time.The idea behind this is to come up with a surveying system for the United Nations Development Program to inspect emergency zones that are inaccessible to vehicles, or in situations that are space-, height- or terrain-limited. Such a system would allow UN first responders to earthquakes or tsunamis to quickly deploy drones to survey and map the hardest-hit areas.An emergency response team would drive an F-150 as far as possible into an emergency zone. Via a  touchscreen, the driver could identify a target area and launch a drone by accessing an app projected through SYNC AppLink. The drone would follow a flight path over the zone, capturing video.Using the driver’s smartphone, the F-150 would establish a real-time link between the drone, the truck and the cloud, so vehicle data can be shared. The driver can continue moving on to a new destination – data is relayed to the drone, which will then catch up and dock with the truck.Ford says that while the challenge is target specific, the software might eventually allow drone-to-vehicle applications in agriculture, forestry and construction. There’s a carrot for this one – the challenge winner will receive US$100,000.",Anthony Lim

The listing completes the supercar maker’s .The ceremony, attended by Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne, FCA chairman John Elkann, Ferrari CEO Amedeo Felisa, Ferrari vice chairman Piero Ferrari, Borsa Italiana CEO Raffaele Jerusalmi and Italian PM Matteo Renzi, took place less than three months after the . FCA boss Marchionne underlined the fact that Ferrari’s listing in Milan represents a new start, rather than a point of arrival, emphasising that the now complete spin-off from FCA reaffirms the independence Ferrari has always enjoyed within the group. For the NYSE listing, Fiat Chrysler listed a 10% stake at US$52 a share, valuing the famous prancing horse brand at nearly US$10 billion. For this parallel listing in Milan, FCA distributed its remaining 80% to shareholders, at a rate of one Ferrari share for every 10 FCA shares.The new company counts Exor SpA, the Agnelli family holding company that also controls Fiat Chrysler, as majority stakeholders with 23.5%. Piero Ferrari, son of founder Enzo, retains his 10% stake. Fiat bought a 50% stake in Ferrari in 1969, before increasing its holding to 90% in 1988. Fiat merged with Chrysler in 2014 to create FCA.According to , Marchionne has been positioning Ferrari as a creator of high-end products, rather than as an automaker, to entice investors. It is certainly as valuable as a luxury goods brand – at 26.5 times estimated 2016 profit, it’s on par with Hermes. To compare, FCA fetches 8.6 times earnings and GM is worth 6.4. The Maranello-based small-volume company is the most profitable stand-alone automaker, according to Evercore ISI. Generous dividends have been promised.Reports note that this spin-off will help FCA reduce debt and fund grand plans to expand higher-margin luxury brands  and , which the group retains. With Ferrari, which accounted for 12% of FCA’s profit before interest and tax in 2014, off the group’s books, Marchionne’s plans for Fiat, Chrysler, Jeep, Alfa Romeo and Maserati will be in the spotlight.There will be an update of the FCA masterplan at the end of this month, but the current 2018 targets are an ambitious seven million units, almost two million more than IHS Automotive’s estimates for the group,  notes.

2016-01-05,Faraday Future FFZERO1 Concept debuts at CES 2016,"At long last, the  FFZERO1 Concept has been unveiled at the ongoing 2016 Consumer Electronic Show (CES), which should unsettle Tesla Motors just a tad bit. The concept isn’t just limited to shock and awe duties however, as it features a modular platform on which all future FF production vehicles will be based.Focusing our attention on the FFZERO1 Concept first, the design signifies a modern interpretation of a closed-cockpit, single-seater race car. With a heavy dependence on carbon-fibre and lightweight composite materials in its construction, the FFZERO1 also features high-performance racing suspension.That should bode well for the EV’s handling, which is further enhanced with advanced vehicle dynamic control and torque vectoring systems. The contemporary design you see here isn’t just for show, with aerodynamics playing a major part to every component, including that prominent stabiliser fin for high speeds. Inside, the FFZERO1 seats just one occupant, the driver, with an asymmetric digital instrument panel design dubbed “propeller IP”, encased in a halo safety structure greeting them. The driver’s seat is inspired by NASA’s “zero gravity” research, and is raised from the exposed carbon-fibre vehicle structure itself. It may appears strange that a race car adopts a white-coloured interior but it’s meant to represent the purity of a zero-emissions electric vehicle.Faraday’s head of global design Richard Kim (designer behind the BMW i8 and i3) called the car something “not of this world” and it clearly shows with some of the “out of this world” features. For instance, the steering is said to be made for zero gravity situations. Closer to current reality, you can stick your iPhone on the steering wheel for it to interact with the car for navigation and act as a digital co-pilot by projecting augmented reality visuals on the road ahead.The main highlight of the FFZERO1 Concept is what you can’t see underneath, the FF-developed Variable Platform Architecture (VPA). The platform adopts a battery structure that is arranged into what FF calls “strings”. Adding or removing these “strings” allows FF to modify a vehicle’s battery capacity as well as its wheelbase. The front and rear sections remain the same, although the crash sections can be modified as well to suit a vehicle’s needs.The VPA also accommodates various electric motor configurations, ranging from one to four motor layouts. On the FFZERO1, FF went with the most extreme of the layouts, with four quad core motors (AWD) that provide over 1,000 hp, good for a century sprint time (0-100 km/h) of less than three seconds and a top speed exceeding 322 km/h. The platform’s flexibility allows FF to adapt the electric powertrain to two- or four-wheel drive setups, depending on needs (extended range, power outputs). FF also state that the VPA comes pre-equipped for increasing levels of autonomous driving and safety on vehicles. Put all this together, and you get a platform that can be adapted to deliver a diverse range of vehicles ranging from compact hatchbacks, sedans all the way up to SUVs. The FFZERO1 is meant to show off the platform’s maximum potential. All this sounds very promising, although no definitive dates has been given as to when FF will produce an actual consumer car. The company itself has received a USD$1 billion backing from Chinese media firm LeTV to set up a three million square foot factory in Las Vegas, which should be a clear sign that FF is not just puffing up smoke here. FF’s future plans also involve an infrastructure of internet-connected vehiclesWhat do you think of the Faraday Future FFZERO1 Concept?

2016-01-05,2016 Triumph Street Triple Rx Black launched,"The 2016 Triumph Street Triple Rx Black was unveiled at the Motorcycle Live show in Birmingham in November 2015, and is the top model of the Street Triple series. The Rx Black is derived, as are its siblings, from Triumph’s well-received supersports model, the Daytona 675R. The bike comes with revised graphics, and a semi-gloss black paint job, setting it apart from the 2015 Rx’s matte silver finish. Aside from the paint, there is no change in specification from the previous year’s model.As its name implies, the Street Triple has an inline three cylinder, 12-valve, DOHC liquid-cooled engine displacing 675 cc. Power is claimed to be 105 hp at 10,500 rpm, while torque is 68 Nm at 9,750 rpm, driving a six-speed gearbox. Fuelling is with multi-point sequential electronic fuel injection.Differences from the standard Street Triple include a flyscreen, seat cowl, belly pan, and quickshifter. Weight is claimed to be 168 kg, while seat height is a rider-friendly 820 mm. Braking is with Nissin four-pot calipers in front with ABS, while a Brembo single piston looks after the rear.The 2016 Street Triple Rx Black is reported to retail at £8,599 (RM54,886).",Mohan K Ramanujam

2016-01-05,Aston Martin slapped with USD$100 million lawsuit,"Automotive designer Henrik Fisker, the man behind the Fisker Karma hybrid vehicle, has filed a USD$100 million lawsuit against Aston Martin. The suit was filed at the US Federal District Court, and claims the British marque committed civil extortion.Fisker claims that Aston Martin had sent him a “threatening letter” that called for him to either change the design of his upcoming Force 1 supercar, or not display it at the 2016 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.Aston Martin claims in said letter that the Force 1 looks remarkably similar to its own DB10, which was a key highlight in the Bond flick, . The allegation is based on a sole teaser image of the Force 1 that was uploaded to Henrik Fisker’s website. Fisker’s legal counsel, Jonathan A. Michaels of MLG Automotive Law, countered Aston Martin’s allegations by pointing out, “we do not know what the final version of Fisker’s Force 1 will look like.” The lawsuit adds that the Force 1 does not utilise any Aston Martin chassis and is “completely distinct from any Aston Martin vehicle that has ever been made, including the DB10.”Fisker’s lawyers highlighted several differences between the Aston Martin DB10 and Focus 1’s design as well. The lawsuit contends Aston Martin is “greatly threatened by Fisker’s return to the sports car market.”It continues by stating that Aston Martin’s concern is “exacerbated by the fact that since Fisker left Aston Martin, the company has failed to introduce new products that have garnered anywhere near the same level of attention the V8 Vantage and the DB9 did a decade ago.” Both cars were design by Fisker in the past.Fisker said “Aston Martin is trying to intimidate me to prop up their own flailing company and to mask their financial and product deficiencies. I refuse to be intimidated and that is the reason for today’s filing.” Fisker and MLG Automotive Law are asking the court to award them with punitive damages, court costs and compensatory damages of not less than $100 million.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-05,Volkswagen faces USD$90 bil lawsuit over dieselgate,"Volkswagen is facing a USD$90 billion (RM390 billion) lawsuit in the United States. The Department of Justice has filled a court action against the car maker for its attempts to .Following a thorough investigation, a complaint was put forward by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The complaint is based on allegations that nearly 600,000 Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen branded vehicles in the US have been equipped with systems that allowed it to cheat official emissions tests.According to the , the maximum fine faced by Volkswagen exceeds USD$90 billion (RM390 billion), based on each vehicle being penalised for the maximum USD$37,500 (RM163k) for the violation. This is a significant leap from the previously estimated USD$18 billion (RM78 billion) fine.However, it is understood that  is making a plea with the authorities, suggesting that the maximum fine would cripple the company’s future existence. Should its plea for leniency pay off, several reports suggest that a USD$21 billion (RM91 billion) figure is likely.John C. Cruden, attorney general of the Justice Department’s Environmental and Natural Resources Division told reporters that, “car manufacturers that fail to properly certify their , endanger public health and disadvantage competitors.”He continued, “the United States will pursue all appropriate remedies against Volkswagen to redress the violations of our nation’s clean air laws alleged in the complaint.” Crudden was specifically referring to the allegations that in real-world scenarios, the Volkswagen vehicles involved showed exhaust emission levels that would cause it to fail official emissions tests.The vehicles in violation particularly feature Volkswagen’s  which are equipped with the infamous “defeat device,” and  mills that are equipped with a “temperature conditioning” system. Vehicles with the defeat devices are capable of reducing their actual emissions by up to 40 times, while the temperature conditioning system in the diesel V6 reduced emissions by nine times.In its reports, the EPA highlighted some of the ill effects of excessive NOx particulates from exhaust emissions. It says that these pollutants are also “linked to asthma and other serious respiratory illnesses.”It continued, “exposure to ozone and particulate matter is also associated with premature death due to respiratory-related or cardiovascular-related effects. Children, the elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory disease are particularly at risk of health effects from exposure to these pollutants. Recent studies indicate that the direct health effects of NOx are worse than previously understood, including respiratory problems, damage to lung tissue and premature death.”Do note that this dieselgate issue here is a .

2016-01-05,KTM to play with MotoGP big boys at Austria in 2016,"Coming off the back of three days of successful testing at Red Bull Ring in Spielberg in November 2015, KTM has announced that its MotoGP machine, the RC16, will debut at the Grand Prix of Austria on August 12. From its fledgling Moto3 (250 cc, single cylinder) effort three years ago, and some rumbling about lack of return on investment, KTM appears to have found a second wind for 2016.KTM chief operating officer Stefan Pierer expressed confidence in the RC16 prototype, and said development was going according to plan. He added that the project was financially healthy, which could mean an aggressive effort from KTM for the 2017 season if results roll in.While the 1,000 cc, 90-degree V4 engined RC16 is intended to compete in the 2017 MotoGP season, KTM has requested a wild-card entry from FIM for the final round of the 2016 MotoGP in Valencia. Pit Beirer, KTM’s motorsport director, said the test at Spielberg “was a very emotional moment.” Despite making known its plans for competing in MotoGP only a couple of years ago, KTM has shown considerable effort and progress in the project.There has been no announcement as to who will be riding the RC16 in 2017. Current test riders in the KTM MotoGP team are former MotoGP racer Alex Hoffman and Mika Kallio from Finland. It is rumoured that KTM will produce a customer track-only version of the RC16 in 2017 at a price of 140,000 euros (RM656,000).",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-05,Forcing it in – super and turbocharged motorcycles,"When Kawasaki introduced the supercharged H2 and H2R in 2015, it said the bikes were intended to “shake up” the world of high-speed motorcycles. This sector of the market had, in its words, “not shown any technological advances”, and the H2/H2R were a technological tour-de-force.Forced induction is nothing new to today’s cars, with almost every major manufacturer offering a turbo or supercharged engine in their line-up. It’s also a way of controlling emissions, since smaller engines tend to pollute less than big V8s.In the motorcycling world, things are slightly different, due to that issue turbochargers have, lag. Cars get around the lag issue with twin-stage, twin-scroll and variable geometry turbos, all of which serve to reduce the problem to imperceptible levels. For bikes, the issue is lag when you don’t want it, like when building speed for acceleration, and power coming in with a rush when you really don’t want it, like when heeled-over mid-corner and the rear tyre is scrabbling for traction.The Japanese majors all tried turbocharging back in the 80s, with Kawasaki leading the way in 1978 with the Z1R-TC. Suzuki came in with the XN85, a 650 cc four-cylinder producing 90 hp in 1982/83, the same year Yamaha introduced the XJ650 Seca Turbo.Honda followed suit with first the CX500 Turbo, then the CX650 Turbo, after riders complained the bike lacked any sort of urge. The pinnacle came with Kawasaki’s 750 Turbo, boasting EFI, and a turbocharger located as close to the headers as possible to minimise lag.And then it all went quiet. The riding public realised turbo bikes didn’t offer a lot of advantages over a 1,000 cc bike.  Weight and power numbers were practically the same, and turbos were a lot less reliable than they are today. The tyres, suspension and frames of the time were inadequate to handle the power numbers forced induction was capable of producing.Aside from drag racers and top-speed record attempts, forced induction motorcycles fell by the wayside, apart from the Vyrus 987 C3 effort in 2009. Till the advent of the H2, and its supercharger. Kawasaki’s decision to invest in the engineering effort necessary to produce such a beast is reflective of the advances made in materials technology and manufacturing methods since the 80s.Engine controls and rider aids are now common-place, and perhaps forced induction is due for a renaissance in the motorcycle world. Supercharging offers an advantage over turbos, since the impeller is driven at engine speed, eliminating lag. The faster you go, the more air you compress.So is forced induction the way ahead?  It depends on who you talk to. There are benefits to super and turbocharging, like getting big power numbers from small engines. There are disadvantages as well, such as added weight, maintenance and complexity, something a lot of riders dislike.Kawasaki’s  are currently factory specials, hand-built to order, although they have shown the  concept bike, with a supercharger fitted to a mid-size engine. Suzuki is rumoured to be bringing out a  with a supercharged 1,400 cc engine. While both Yamaha and Honda have not said anything about forced induction on their two-wheeled offerings, it can be safely assumed developments at Kawasaki are being watched with interest. Developments in electric motors and battery technology are also advancing e-bikes and hybrid electric bikes, which shall be covered in a forthcoming feature.So, what do you think? Is forced induction for motorcycles the way forward? Leave us your thoughts and comments.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2016-01-05,"Mechanic invents car fuelled by water, calcium carbide","Right, time for some alternative – fuel – news. Over in India, a mechanic has come up with a car fuelled by water. Well, not just water – there’s calcium carbide too, and together the combination forms the basis for the novel fuel.According to news reports, Mohammad Raees Markani from Madhya Pradesh is the man behind the tech, and he’s worked at it for the last five years, modifying an 800 cc Suzuki engine to adopt the system.“The car runs on acetylene gas, which is formed from a chemical reaction between calcium carbide and water. The gas is used for several industrial purposes including welding and portable lighting for miners. But in my case, I am using it to propel the car engines,” the 44-year-old said.“I have made other changes to the engines, which helps the overall performance of the car. This idea struck my mind while I was gas welding a part of my car in my workshop many years ago. But I did not know how to go about it. Somehow, I made a start and it took five years to make this efficient engine,” he added. The reports add that a litre of the water/carbide mix costs only 13 sen to make.Markani, a car mechanic with more than 15 years of working experience, has become something of a local celebrity following his invention. Now, armed with a patent for his water-powered tech, he has been invited by Chinese automobile companies to develop the idea further.The news jogs the memory of something along similar lines, closer to home – back in 2006, there was a local attempt to commercialise a hydrogen-based system in  and .

The charging port for both PHEV Merc saloons is located on the right side of the rear bumper.The S 500 e is one of three hybrid variants in the W222 S-Class range, the others being the petrol  and the diesel-powered S 350 Bluetec Hybrid offered in Thailand. The LWB-only S 500 e is the most powerful of the lot, and is powered by a 3.0 litre turbocharged V6 with 333 hp and 480 Nm, combined with an electric motor with 114 hp and 340 Nm, juiced by a lithium-ion battery. Total system output is 442 hp and 650 Nm, which is good for 0-100 km/h in just 5.2 seconds, but with fuel consumption rated at just 3.0 litres per 100 km on the NEDC cycle. The claimed pure electric range is 33 km.The C 350 e, Merc’s second PHEV after the S 500 e, is powered by the ‘s 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbo with 208 hp and 350 Nm. The ICE is assisted by an 80 hp/340 Nm electric motor for combined power output of 275 hp and 600 Nm. 0-100 km/h is done in 5.9 seconds and fuel consumption is rated at an amazing 2.1 litres per 100 km. The all-electric mode is good for a claimed 31 km. BMW won’t be letting its archrival have the whole Lumpini park to itself, and will be introducing the locally-assembled 740Le and 330e PHEV models in Thailand later this year.The  brings together a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbo, a 95 PS electric motor and a lithium-ion battery for a 326 PS total, a 5.5 second century sprint time and FC of 2.1 litres per 100 km. The fresh limo’s electric-only range is 40 km.The  from the  also uses a 2.0 litre turbo, but it’s paired to a 108 hp electric motor for a combined 252 hp and 420 Nm. It goes from 0-100 km/h in 6.3 seconds and also uses 2.1 litres of fuel per 100 km. The EV range is 35 km.This German PHEV push in Thailand comes as our northern neighbour adopts a , moving away from the engine capacity-based system that Malaysia also employs. The new system, which also takes into account E85 gasohol compatibility, starts this year and is four-days old. All four PHEVs mentioned above have C02 emissions below 100 g/km, which means that they can qualify for a 10% rate for hybrids below 100 g/km. Previously, all hybrids were given the low 10% rate, but under the new structure, hybrids emitting 101 to 150 g/km of C02 are liable for 20% excise tax; and those with 151 to 200 g/km C02 figures, 25%. Lexus’ conventional hybrid models lose out in this new system.   Now that these tech flagships are assembled in Thailand, will Malaysia be next on the list? The likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz will have to gauge demand, negotiate a deal with the government and start local assembly – like in the case of the  – as these Thai-made PHEVs aren’t likely to feature enough local content to take advantage of Asean free trade rules.

2016-01-04,Hyundai Motor Group cuts 2016 sales target to 8.13 mil,"In view of challenging market conditions both at home and abroad, Hyundai Motor Group has announced that it ls setting a lower sales target for 2016 compared to the previous year, when it fell short of its forecast,  reports.The automaker is aiming to sell 8.13 million units this year – Hyundai Motor has set a target of 5.01 million vehicles, while Kia Motors is expecting to shift around 3.12 million cars in 2016.At an event marking the start of 2016, Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong-koo told employees at the event that the group sold around 8.01 million cars last year, short of the 8.2 million units it had projected for 2015.He said that while Hyundai/Kia managed to sell more than eight million cars for the second straight year in 2015 despite “challenging” market situations, the slowing growth in China and other emerging markets, low crude oil prices and economic instability does not bode well for the Korean automaker, the world’s fifth-largest.“The auto industry is facing a structural change due to intensifying competition among existing brands and vehicles getting more electronic,” Chung said, adding that it was important for the automaker to secure future competitiveness to overcome heightened market uncertainty.Chung said that the group should place more emphasis on R&D while leading technological innovation in the industry as well as enhancing its brand image “significantly” through top-class quality and product competitiveness, the report added.",Anthony Lim
2016-01-04,Renault Alpine “A120” sports car to debut on Feb 16,"February 16, 2016 is the date that Renault-owned company Alpine will be revealing its production sports car – likely to be similar to the  seen earlier. Labelled as the “A120,” the upcoming model is a tribute and successor to the iconic A110. On its Twitter page, the company showed a little teaser saying, “we wanted to announce our come back, but some would say we never left.”  The  was first seen at Le Mans last year, sporting a blue and orange livery. In the mid-engined sports car, word is that a turbocharged 1.8 litre four-cylinder mill that’s based on the 1.6 litre engine of the  will feature. Two variants are also said to be in the pipeline.The standard variant will push out around 250 hp, while the more powerful one will reportedly churn out 300 hp. In addition to that, the turbocharged engine is also said to be paired with Renault’s new EDC seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, currently found in the .Rumours continue to indicate that the A120 will be light, weighing just 1,100 kg, achieved through the use of aluminium that has been employed throughout its construction. Carbon-fibre was originally to be used to achieve a 1,000-kg target, however the idea was dropped as the material was seen as too costly and not worth it, despite the reduced mass.Aside from rivalling the  and the , it seems as though the A120 will be looking to contend with the light-weight  as well.

2016-01-05,"Facelifts now more extensive, pricier in the US – report","It seemed only yesterday that a typical mid-life facelift amounted to nothing but slightly revised bumpers and rejigged trim levels, but fast forward to 2016 and a more thorough refresh is now the norm – in the United States at least – according to .Witness the revisions Nissan made to the  (known as the  here) and the  () last year – the duo get completely revised front fascias, a retrimmed interior, upgraded infotainment systems, retuned engine and chassis as well as the addition of new active safety kit such as Forward Emergency Braking.“We invested three to four times more than we typically would invest [in a mid-cycle update]”, said Nissan product strategy chief Pierre Loing. “The competition is getting stronger. If you want to remain there, you need to invest and show consumers you have a credible offer.”The trend of developing more extensive facelifts began back in 2011 when Honda was stung by criticism regarding the then-new ‘s styling, build quality and handling – including  removing the car off its ‘Recommended’ list. This prompted it to release a  just one and a half years later to address these issues.But it was the facelifted  that really got the ball rolling, with almost every exterior panel heavily revised to create a much more aggressive, youthful-looking machine, in line with president and CEO Akio Toyoda’s mission of adding more emotion to the company’s vehicles. Like the Altima and Sentra, there were updates to the interior trim, driving dynamics, technology and safety features, too.Toyota also spent around three times more on this facelift than before, claimed the Camry’s chief engineer Monte Kaehr. “The 2012 Camry was doing well in the marketplace,” he said “We did research with customers and intenders to see what they appreciated and what needed to be approved.”Kaehr added that while feedback suggested that the 2012 Camry “was very appealing from a rational standpoint,” it was not attractive emotionally, according to reviews.These more frequent, larger-scale revisions are said to come as a result of vicious competition, tightening fuel economy regulations and the quicker pace that in-car mobile connectivity is becoming obsolete.Milton Wong, chief engineer of the  – which also , including a new , for 2017 – said that facelifts are new opportunities to “deploy a lot of new technologies, or technologies already deployed on other vehicles.”Former Ford vice president of product development and Chrysler vice president of platform engineering Chris Theodore noted that the notion of the facelift has changed over the years. “In the old days, facelifts were too modest, and the customer didn’t notice. They were probably US$10 million (RM43.5mil) to US$20 million (RM86.9mil) jobs,” he said, adding that he estimates facelifts nowadays could cost ten times that.“The manufacturers have learned [a facelift] has to be much more than it used to be in the past. You have to give customers reason to come in and buy a new one,” he said.Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s auto analyst John Murphy remarked on the trend in the annual “Car Wars” report last year. “As automakers emerge from the trough in the cycle, more are aiming to spur demand by launching fresh product rather than discounting stale models at the expense of margins,” he said, adding that average showroom age has been “on a steady decline since the early 1990s.”Of course, it’s a different story over here – Malaysia never got the massive Civic refresh enjoyed in the US, sticking to a  amounting to a new grille, minor trim differences, added kit and the introduction of curtain airbags on 2.0 litre models.

2016-01-05,W213 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: first photos leaked,"Mercedes-Benz has been pretty generous with teasers for its next-generation W213 E-Class, giving us glimpses of how the headlamps and tail lamps look like as well as completely revealing to us the interior towards the end of last year.Now, just a week ahead of the car’s official unveiling on January 11 at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show, a set of exterior photos of the new E-Class have made their way onto the internet. No idea how this happened, but it has. It’s pretty much as per what we expected – like the already unveiled interior, the exterior is sort of smack in the middle of the smaller C- and flagship S-Class in terms of both size and design.We already know the front will not feature split headlamps which was an E-Class feature since the W210, but now the rear end has gone back to the W211’s design, with the light staying clear of the boot lid. Thanks to that, the new E-Class looks like both a baby S-Class and a big C-Class.You’ll notice two different types of exterior styling here – the grey and red car features a sportier outlook with a sport grille while the dark blue car features a more traditional outlook sporting a stately grille paired with a hood ornament.While the headlamps are no longer split units (gone since the W212 facelift), the design of the integrated daytime running light design sort of pays homage to this short history. A teaser video released yesterday reveals it has an 84 diode Multibeam LED module although we expect this to be optional.The leaked interior photos are of no surprise since Mercedes-Benz has already unveiled the interior before this. The S-Class-inspired dash has twin 12.3-inch displays on higher-end models, new digital instrument cluster and COMAND Online display graphics, steering wheel-mounted touch pads to control the infotainment system as well as an impressive new 23-speaker Burmeister sound system.We also know the W213 will get a new key fob design. Unlike the previous fob, the new one is a lot slimmer and curvier. It features four buttons, with three traditionally being to lock, unlock and to remotely open the boot lid. The fourth button is the panic button, an alarm trigger which may be unfamiliar to Malaysians. Only the United States has this.The push start button has also been revamped – it doesn’t look like there’s no option for a key hole behind it. The button is flush with the dashboard, and doesn’t look like it has a removable cover that would expose a slot for the key. The company has also detailed the technologies that will come, including expanded smartphone integration – your phone can now serve as a key, as well as guide the car in and out of parking spaces via the Remote Parking Pilot function. Safety technologies like Active Brake Assist also get a bump up, capable of scanning other lanes for cars and initiating braking earlier if it senses an evasive manoeuvre is impossible.Other features include the new Evasive Steering Assist, Distance Pilot Distronic with Speed Limit Pilot and Active Lane Keeping Assist, semi-autonomous Active Lane Change Assist as well as an uprated Pre-Safe system – the latter now protects your ears in a loud crash, and pushes you closer to the centre of the car using the inflatable seat bolsters to provide more survival space in the event of a side impact.We’ve also seen  with a slightly different C pillar – will it be confined to China as per the current car or will it be a global model this time?What do you think of the new E-Class so far? Do let us know your thoughts in the comments and stay tuned for more information as we get closer to the car’s Detroit debut.",Paul Tan

2016-01-04,SPY VIDEO: 2016 Proton Perdana to get beige seats?,"The 2016 Proton Perdana has been sighted again, this time on the Karak Highway thanks to Instagram user . The upcoming flagship sedan has been spotted numerous times on Malaysian roads as it undergoes testing, and here’s another of the car in motion. Like previous test mules spotted, the Perdana seen here wears a significant amount of camouflage that extends to the wheels. We also get a perspective of the vehicle’s length, which is said to measure , significantly more than the eighth-generation Honda Accord on which the model will be based on.However, the new Perdana will receive its own distinct styling that differs heavily for the Accord, so any murmur of the “Accordana” will be put to rest. More recently, a prototype Perdana was seen at night, where its L for first time for us to see.The video also shows us a very brief glimpse of the car’s interior, which appears to sport beige-coloured upholstery on the seats, without any indication as to whether they are leather or fabric in material (more likely the former). However, as this is a prototype, the final product may differ from what we see here.Additionally,  reader Mohd Fahmi Abdul Hamid sent in these photos of a prototype Perdana roaming around Putra Heights. One of the frontal shots of the car appears to reveal that a sunroof is part of the equipment package. Everything else however, looks to remain the same as .The 2016 Perdana will be built at Proton’s Medium Volume Factory in Shah Alam. Engine wise, it’s set to retain Honda’s 154 hp/189 Nm R20A3 2.0 and 177 hp/222 Nm K24Z2 2.4 litre i-VTEC engines – for now, at least. Both engines will be mated to a five-speed automatic transmission.

2016-01-05,VIDEO: Proton Wira long-term unconventional review,"Reading and watching reviews of brand new cars is all good and entertaining, even informative at times. However, what is the car actually like after it has undergone its fair share of usage over the years? A long-term review to put it short. Well, for owners of the Proton Wira, here’s your answer, and it comes from a local Malaysian stand-up comedian, Jason Leong.First things first, if the title,  isn’t stating the obvious already, this video contains not just humour, but satire as well. Nonetheless, we’re sure some Proton Wira owners can associate with what Jason has experienced with the car before.Purchased in 2008, the grey Wira owned by Jason is one that he cherishes thanks to its utmost loyalty in serving him for the past eight years. As long-serving as it is, Jason does point out a whole list of features that the car lacks, including, but not limited to, anti-lock brakes, CD changer, ventilated seats, premium audio system, “dignity” and etc. However, the Wira is fitted with something not everyone might be familiar with. We won’t spoil what it is but it’ll definitely invoke two things. One, massive nostalgia for those who knows what it is at first sight. Two, massive confusion for those who don’t, and think it is a place to store your iPhone.The Wira was truly ahead of its time when it came to practicality as well. Cup holders are all well and good, although the local mamak store isn’t gonna pack your  in a cup but rather a plastic bag (). Therefore, the car features a “drinks in plastic bag holder”, or better known as the  holder.Jason continues by mentioning that his car has a problem with the locks, granting it a “keyless entry” feature as well. He goes on to point out that the NVH levels inside the car manage to cancel out the noise coming from the outside of the car as well. The noise does have a role to play in keeping the driver awake while driving, according to Jason.Jason’s Wira is also a hit not just with animals (weirdly enough), but comes highly recommended by many. In Jason’s case, mechanics strongly favour the car but for reasons that are less than desirable for a car owner. On the other hand, Jason claims that the car remains a sound financial investment as people on the street come up to him just to hand him money for some strange reason.Even with all these quirks, the Wira still remains loved by Jason. So, how many of you can associate with what you saw in this video? Let us know your experiences or any unique “features” you love about your car in the comments below.",Gerard Lye

2016-01-04,Mercedes-Benz design boss talks styling turnaround,"Mercedes-Benz is on a roll lately – starting with the  in 2013, it has unveiled a slew of models to replace its entire lineup, from all-new models like the  and  to significantly revamped (and sometimes renamed) ones like the , ,  and . And it won’t stop there, according to .Design boss Gordon Wagener talked to the publication about the styling of the upcoming , which will make its debut on January 11 – specifically the “sophisticated, stylish and sporty” direction the executive sedan will take in its 10th generation.“[The E-Class] features many forward-looking and unique elements – such as the “catwalk line” on the flanks and the “stardust” look of the LED tail lights,” he said. “It is an aerodynamics leader, and it will take interior design to the next level.”Wagener also touched on the grilles that will be offered on the W213, adding that while there is an 80:20 split in favour of the sports grille (with the big three-pointed star) on the C-Class, there will be a greater emphasis on luxury on the larger car, something that the classic grille – with the small, upright bonnet ornament – will better express. “The luxury grille has a future, and we will carry it forward intelligently,” he said.The design of some of the facelifted models, particularly the SL, was also discussed. “I think we did a very good job bringing both [the SL and GLS] to the next generation. If we would have changed the side and the rear, we might as well have started from scratch. “But the front end of the SL is perhaps the most modern one in the entire lineup. It is the first series application of the ‘Rennsport’ grille, inspired by the 300 SL Panamericana of 1952 – and that’s just an evolution of our pre-war race cars,” Wagener said, adding that the SL’s new trapezoidal grille would work well on sportier models, and might be applied on full-fat AMG models to give it a “sharper identity.”Wagener was also cautiously optimistic over the  sub-brand, saying that it has room to grow but will also require patience. “We are just at the beginning of its relaunch. Its success makes us very confident to evolve it further. But we need time,” he said.Lastly came the subject of fully electric vehicles, and how to differentiate them from regular vehicles. Wagener pointed to some of the concept cars introduced last year – including Frankfurt’s  – as an indication of its strategy.“Our Frankfurt concept was inspired by the airflow and streamlined spirit of the 1930s; we wanted to show that an aero car can look beautiful. The aero effect, with the long tail end, brings significant advantages at highway speeds, and this is important in an [electric vehicle],” he said.One more thing – before you think the -aping  as a gateway to other SUV variants like two-door and convertible versions, Wagener puts the brakes on the idea. “SUV customers want space and practicality. And the last thing we’ll do is an SUV convertible.”",Jonathan Lee

The replacement for the GLK rides on the same Modular Rear Architecture that underpins the the new W205 C-Class and carries a 2.1 litre diesel engine with 204 hp and 500 Nm.Next up is the both the GLE and , each powered by a 3.0 litre V6 turbodiesel engine that provides 258 hp and 620 Nm of torque. Of course, every Mercedes-Benz SUV shown here features the brand’s 4Matic all-wheel drive system. Now that we’ve been introduced to the current crop of Mercedes-Benz SUVs, the video moves on to the vehicles making their way up the mountain with the most rugged-looking of the bunch, the G 350 d leading the way. Halfway through however, the lead Mercedes-Benz SUV deviates from the three other vehicles in a “shortest route vs fastest route” comparison, with the G 350 d tackling harsher terrain as compared to the new-gen Mercedes SUVs.Nonetheless, by the end of the video, all four vehicles are reunited at a picturesque site as a mark that Mercedes-Benz SUVs can perform on the road and when the road ends as well. Mercedes-Benz Malaysia is expected to introduce its range of , with the GLC, GLE and GLE Coupe set to debut during the January 15-17, 2016 weekend. Which one tickles your fancy the most?",Gerard Lye

The company expects to see a total of 100,000 new drivers in 2016 – a major reason for this can be attributed to the increasingly challenging economy.General manager of Uber Malaysia, Leon Foong said, “these part-time opportunities just make a lot of sense in terms of increasing incomes while serving people who need rides.” He added, “we plan to create 100,000 new flexible economic opportunities in Malaysia to meet the economic challenges that Malaysians face.”So far, there are a total of 60,000 Uber driver partners in the Klang Valley and in relation to the higher recruitment this year, Foong said, “there are seven million people living in the Klang Valley, so we’re just getting started.” According to him, new products that “maximise time and seat efficiency” are intended for a launch this year.While Uber has clarified that it is , some 102 taxi drivers will be .

Should Uber and Grabcar be made legal, the committee was looking into a strike, or even going to the extent of blocking off the streets of Kuala Lumpur again. Kamarudin said that the government had given SPAD a mandate to improve the taxi industry, however, the committee felt that it was not doing a satisfactory job.Earlier, SPAD said that it was being made the  over issues relating to ride-sharing services, said chairman Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar. “Many people are just happy to point fingers at SPAD, even though that’s not our area of responsibility. In the end, we have been blamed for many things, we are like a punching bag, while the media are happy to provide space to hit out at SPAD.”",Graham Chin

German brands like Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW are heavily involved in the usage of turbocharged engines in their vehicles. “When the consumer is doing their side-by-side comparison online, it gives you parity,” Bolain said of adding turbos.

Michael Kang, the national president of the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Association of Malaysia rejected the idea, calling for the government to maintain its current monthly revisions instead.According to , Kang said that should weekly fuel price revisions be implemented, “SMEs will need to start monitoring the global oil price to do their budget forecast if the cost of fuel is one of the major components in their operational costs.”Kang agreed, however, that should fuel prices remain stable or keep , the proposed system could benefit SMEs. But should prices suddenly be increased, it will burden them. The SME association’s president said that, “it’s good if the oil prices keep going down, but bad if the oil prices increase suddenly as it will be out of control for SMEs in terms of cost,”Datuk Low Kian Chuan, secretary-general of the Association Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia shared Kang’s sentiments, but added that, “businesses know how to adjust to it, most know how to do the forecast. Normally, oil prices only change between three and five percent.”He continued, “only if the price fluctuates more than 10% will it affect businesses.” Stating that the manufacturing industry has already adapted to buying oil at different prices every day according the market rate, Chuan believes that it would be better for Malaysians to also adopt daily fuel price revisions.How would you feel about weekly or even daily fuel price revisions?

These include revealing when . An insider said, “bosses have been left open-mouthed by some of the announcements Chris has been making. Giving away the exact start date months before is a complete no-no, as it gives rivals the chance to try to damage the show.”In addition to that, a source to the daily says that the BBC have brought in a production team “that doesn’t know anything about cars.” The source added, “writers from  magazine have had to be called over to suggest ideas.” The TV presenter is also said to have recorded a 12-page monologue for the cameras that was “totally unusable,” and adds that Evans was “struggling” with pre-recorded videos.While news has it that  will be joining the show as well, the “low-profile” line-up is intentionally arranged as such as Evans reportedly wants to hog the limelight. “Chris is always the boss of the show.

2016-01-04,Aston Martin says it won’t be returning to Formula 1,"Aston Martin has announced that it will not be participating in Formula 1, ending speculation of a return.

2016-01-04,2016 Honda VFR1200X Crosstourer official US release,"Honda ushered in the new year with the US web release of the 2016 VFR1200X, as it is known there, and Crosstourer for the rest of us. While the VFR1200X is not a new model per se, it receives a host of mid-model updates and improvements to put it head-to-head with the giant in the adventure touring segment, the .The 1,237cc V4 engine, the culmination of 30 years of Honda technology, has redesigned cams to provide torque lower down the rev range. Horsepower has been detuned to 129 hp at 7,750 rpm and 126 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm from the 170 hp at 10,000 rpm and 129 Nm torque at 8,750 rpm of the VFR1200F engine from which it is derived.This is more in keeping with the steadier, mile-munching pace of a dual-purpose bike like the VFR1200X, where the journey has slightly more importance than the destination. The 78 degree angle between cylinder banks, and a crankshaft with 28 degree offset between crankpins, reduces vibration to the extent that a balancer shaft is unnecessary. Fuelling is with 44 mm throttle bodies that are ride-by-wire. There are two gearbox options – a standard six-speed and Honda’s automatic Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) with bar-operated buttons. DCT offers the rider three modes, ‘MT’ gives the rider full control to select gears, while ‘D’ gives better fuel consumption and ‘S’ lets the revs build up a little before selecting the next cog up. For riders who prefer changing gears with their foot instead of pressing buttons on the handlebar, a foot-shifter is available.To aid control, Honda’s Selectable Torque Control system (HSTC) lets the rider choose between three engine torque delivery modes, depending on available ground traction, or switching the system off – useful in certain off-road conditions such as heavy snow or sand. The drive goes through a fully-enclosed shaft, suited for a motorcycle designed to travel long distances across the world, and endure variable conditions.Suspension duties are controlled by a 43mm USD fork by KYB, adjustable for spring pre-load and rebound, while Honda’s Pro-Link suspension takes care of the rear, mated to a KYB shock that does not require tools to adjust the pre-load.  This makes it easy to set the suspension on the VFR1200X for varying loads.The single-sided swingarm lets the rear wheel be removed without fuss. Dual 310 mm discs grabbed by six-pot Nissin calipers in front should make for sure stops, especially with a bike that weighs 275 kg, 285 if DCT is installed. A 276 mm disc does duties at the back, and ABS is standard. Wheels are 19-inch front and 17-inch rear, wearing 110/80R19 and 150/70R17 rubber, in keeping with general dual-purpose design ethos. Fuel capacity is 21.5 litres.Seat height on the VFR1200X is 850 mm, and a lower seat option is available, dropping seat height by 20 mm. A full range of touring accessories is available from Honda, including panniers, heated grips, taller windscreen and LED fog lights, among others. The base VFR1200X retailed for AUD17,499 (RM55,000) in 2015, with no word on 2016 prices as yet. Other models in Honda’s ‘X’ range are the VFR800X, NC700X and CB500X. Dual-purpose and adventure motorcycles are popular here, in part due to their upright seating position, comfort, and ability to cover large distances without fuss or worry. It remains to be seen whether the VFR1200X will be able to wrest the adventure touring crown away from the BMW R1200 GS.",Mohan K Ramanujam

Unmasked by Swedish website, , here are a few revealing snaps of the new estate.For the most part, the V90 is remarkably similar to the . A lot of the car’s design also largely resembles what we’ve already seen on the Volvo S90 sedan, featuring the “Thor” headlamps, vertical grille design, long bonnet, and the same multi-spoke wheels.The rear end of the car is a key highlight of these images. The new tail lights are a conversation starter for sure, , only slimmer and featuring an additional horizontal bit that leads towards the centre of the tail gate.The sloping rear glass looks like it limits the V90’s cargo space, but the Swedish publication responsible for these photos say that the estate model is expected to offer more luggage room than the Volvo V70’s current 575 litres.With just one photo of the rear seats to show you, there’s a very limited view of the car’s cabin.

2015-12-31,The paultan.org 2015 Top Five cars list – the writers each pick five that impressed them the most this year,"It’s time again for our signature final post to sign off the year – the  2015 Top Five list continues the tone set previously in the ,  and  editions, with the writers each picking five cars that impressed them the most this calendar year.An explanation, if it’s the first time you’re coming into this one. The five selection cap, which was set when we first ran with this idea, is not because we have anything against the usual 10 as found on most lists – my original intent of going with half of that was to encourage the writers to put more thought in the selection process.The brief back when the ball was first rolled was to see which five cars driven in that year had the most impact on each of us, with no consideration of pricing, reliability, resale value and all the things that drive say, a vehicle purchase. In years past, the selections have been varied, and have ably highlighted the individuality that resides in our collective – we’d like to think this year’s outing continues that. Again, some changes to the authors – 2015 was when we sadly bid farewell to two sterling writers, Jonathan James Tan and Gregory Sze, but we welcome two new names to this year’s edition, as Christopher Aaron and Gerard Lye offer their opinion on the five that stood out for them. Graham Chin and Mohan K. Ramanujam also joined our team this year, but did not drive enough cars to do the necessary. Next outing, then.And so, on to the musings – here are the individual picks from the team, what each thought were the cars that got them going in some way in 2015. As always, we hope you enjoy reading it as much as we did writing it. Have a very Happy New Year, and we’ll see you in 2016! During a time when the compact crossover seemed doomed for an early demise, in came Honda with the HR-V that is sort of like a “Swiss army knife” of city cars in my eyes, and here’s why, practicality.Say what you will about Honda but when it comes to packaging, the HR-V nails every need a city dweller needs. From its Ultra Seats that can be folded to accommodate a potted plant, to its nifty centre console stowage spaces and a bevy of inputs for the multimedia system, there’s not a lot of situations where the HR-V can’t handle in your daily lives.With a significant amount of bookings already received for the HR-V, I think many Malaysians would share the same sentiment. The Golf GTI is already an established household name when it comes to hot hatches, considered as the yard stick to which others are compared to. The Volkswagen Golf R however, is an all-new playing field altogether.The thing I like most about the Golf R is how much of a sleeper car it is. In terms of looks, there are enough visual cues to differ it from a GTI, but it abstains from conspicuous spoilers, bumper lips, overly flared arches, etc. However, if you ever feel the need to be hasty in it, the car calls upon its 280 PS 2.0 litre TSI, six-speed DSG, 4Motion all-wheel drive and XDS+ e-diff to ensure that you go as fast physics will allow, while fluffing up your driving confidence.I’ll admit that I’ve always thought as the Mazda MX-5 as a “hairdressers’ car”. However, that’s because I’ve never actually driven one. Not the first-gen NA, nor the NB and NC. This time, with the ND, I managed to get myself behind the wheel of one, and I’m delighted to say that my previous perceptions are now totally transformed.My time with the MX-5 was brief, a short drive to a photo shoot site. Upon entering the roadster, it was almost instinctive that I lowered the manual folding roof before setting off. Malaysian heat? Furthest thing from my mind at that time.Mazda’s affiliation with the  philosophy is something that needs to be experienced first-hand. In the MX-5, you feel connected to everything the car does naturally, and the best part is, you don’t even need to be at considerably high speeds to be entertained. This approachability combined with the ability to leave you smiling all the time behind the wheel is why I adore this roadster. Where the Volkswagen Golf R on my list was the reserved monster, the “entry-level” AMG is the polar opposite. Several fins, a large rear spoiler, quad exhaust tailpipes, you’ll be able to easily point out a Mercedes-Benz A 45 AMG from a regular A-Class, trust me.The “boy racer” looks extend inside as well, with those prominent AMG sport seats and generous application of red and carbon-fibre accents everywhere. This attack on the visual senses gets even better once you let this thing loose on a track.I had just that opportunity not too long and let me tell you, this thing is an absolute weapon. The grunt from the exhaust on the over-rev is still something that is fresh in my mind, and the acceleration provided by the 2.0 litre AMG four-cylinder engine with 355 hp and 450 Nm beggars belief. Entry-level AMG? I think not.You may have noticed that hatchbacks are a common sight on my list, and here’s another, and for good reason. For me, the Mazda 2 is proof that good things can come in small packages.Mazda’s common philosophies –  and  – is applied across all its models, and the 2 benefits from this as well. It’s eager, spritely and always ready to inject a little joy into your daily drive. And all this is done while you’re seated in a cockpit that isn’t dreary, but exudes a premium outlook that should be reserved for cars in the upper segments.This amalgamation was more than enough to convince me to lay down some actual money to acquire a Mazda 2 of my own. I will concede that it is not the perfect car, but as I’ve mentioned at the beginning, what appeals to me most is how the car makes you feel behind the wheel, and in this little Mazda, it’s good.Speaking about occasions, I would probably call the  a firm all-time favourite, even. Embarking on a drive from KL to Bangkok is no easy feat, made more difficult by the fact that we only had one tank of fuel to do it with.At the time, I was working for a different publication, and was fortunate enough to be paired on the drive with my current colleague Anthony. Needless to say, I couldn’t have asked for a better drive partner.We didn’t quite win the overall challenge, but did manage to set a day’s fuel-consumption record of 4.0 litres per 100 km. Like I said, it was gruesome. But you can bet on neither Anthony nor myself choosing anything but the E 300 BlueTEC Hybrid to get through the  in the way we did. The car’s plainly an awesome package for a cool price.It was a brief encounter over a typical weekend’s drive, but hell, the  was a hoot. Capturing the essence of driving left behind by the grown up 3 Series now in its F30 form, the 2 Series doesn’t need anything more than its 2.0 litre BMW TwinPower engine to dish out the thrills.Being a lot more tricky to get strapped in, I don’t normally take to coupe body styles all that well. But once you do, every inch of this BMW wills you to be quick. You can’t ask for more from the compact coupe’s focused seats, dynamic steering and athletic rear-wheel drive chassis.The 2 Series is an honest premium sports car that makes you feel good, day in, day out. Sure, you could opt for a better bargain somewhere else, but I guarantee you that as a driver, you wouldn’t be as fulfilled.So, here’s a car making a comeback from 2014. Listed twice by two different paultan.org authors in , it’s my turn to put the humble  on its pedestal this time around as the cream of the D-segment’s crop.I know, you could argue that a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry would make better sense for whatever reason, but the former’s just a bit too dull to look at and the latter’s a bit overpriced if you want all the goodies thrown in. Overall, neither of them offer as good a balance of comfort, space, safety features and presence as the Teana (IMHO). Mazda 6? Handsome and epic to drive, but its lesser space, harsher ride and higher price put us off.I liked the Teana so much, that just a week ago, my wife and I took delivery of the very car you see pictured here – a . It’s got all the right ingredients for safety, style and comfort, and we’ve been all smiles since. Call it what you like, but I don’t believe that a better D-segmenter exists out there.Yes, I like my Teana, but that doesn’t make it the ultimate goal. Bar any financial restrictions, this is the bad boy I’d have – the . Up to no good once again with my current colleague Anthony, we were in Frankfurt, Germany, for this drive.Being there to cover the motor show for my previous publication, Mercedes-Benz Malaysia had kindly arranged two courtesy cars on a blank day for us to tour the country a bit – a Mercedes-AMG S 63 Coupe, and an E 63 S.Don’t get me wrong, the S 63 Coupe is an amazing product. It looks ridiculously handsome, and has all the right stuff to get your juices flowing. The E 63 S, however, wasn’t as grand an occasion for sure, but to me, that made it all the more special.An everyday W212 E-Class when you want it to be, the E 63 S can be docile, practical, and is far from showy – just the sort of thing I appreciate. However, unleash its mountain of power, and its the sort of car you get up to 300 km/h on the autobahn without much effort. Then there’s the noise this beast makes. Good golly.Okay, so it’s the third Mercedes-Benz model in my list, but how do you expect me to overlook driving an  on a track at the end of any year? I bet you’d find that equally challenging too.It was a rare occasion that Mercedes-Benz Malaysia treated us to, and I couldn’t be more excited to make the long journey to the Sepang Circuit on a Saturday afternoon. Packed with a 510 PS/650 Nm 4.0 litre biturbo V8, the AMG GT S was also the quickest thing I’ve ever driven in my relatively short motoring career.Needless to say, there aren’t words to describe the experience. It goes like stink, handles exceptionally well despite having a V8 over its front wheels, and you’ll be amazed at how much grip this monster has going in and coming out of a corner at speed. It even transforms to an everyday car just like that.Money no object? This is it, hands down, right now.Yes, it’s a trend here – quite a few of us have included our own cars into the mix. Apart from the fact that Chris, Gerard and myself bought our new cars this year (Hafriz also bought his Peugeot 208 GTi, but given that the feline hot hatch has already made it to the list two years in a row, it was probably wise not to make it a hat-trick), the unique experience of actually owning the car lets us properly experience its full quirks and merits, some of which do not readily present themselves over a three- or four-day test drive.My rather humble mode of transport is this, the cheerfully-coloured Kia Picanto. Yes, it was Paul Tan’s #1 pick in 2013, mostly on the grounds of safety – six airbags and electronic stability control are fitted as standard, something that still stands out amongst similarly priced vehicles, Proton Iriz 1.6 Premium notwithstanding. But its inclusion on my list goes a bit further than that.Indeed, it’s not the most involving to drive – the inert, wooly steering sees to that – but there’s still something about pushing a zippy city car (an added bonus: mine’s a manual) to the limit without actually going over the speed limit that’s inherently fun. Not that it has any trouble going over that limit, thanks to the peppy 1.2 litre four-pot that needs a lot of revs, but then feels far more sprightly than its 87 PS output suggests. Not only that, it’s refined too, thanks to a smooth, quiet engine and a plush ride that belongs to a segment up.It’s telling that despite the insane amount of new metal I get to test overseas, it still brings a smile to my face when I see the Picanto again in the KLIA parking lot, and flog it all the way home. In fact, I drive it so often that I’ve racked up over 32,000 km on the odometer just a few days shy of its first birthday. It may be humble, but I absolutely love it to bits.Tech showcase drives tend to be a smorgasbord for the average motoring journalist, as you get to drive plenty of new, interesting and pretty serious machinery over the course of the day. The recent ZF Global Press Event 2015 was no exception, with the highlight for enthusiasts being the new Porsche 911 Turbo S. It was a shame, then, that the first hack to get behind the wheel binned it before the rest of us even got a try.Salvation for me came with this Maserati Ghibli S Q4, which came some way to making it up. Of course, it’s no 911, but there was something about the Ghibli and its gorgeous low-slung looks that have always piqued my interest, and I’ve always wanted to drive one.And I was not disappointed. The Maser felt plenty quick in this top S guise – thanks to the 404 hp 3.0 litre V6, working seamlessly with the ZF eight-speed automatic. The taut, nimble chassis and accurate, linear steering also gave it the measure of the twisting German test tarmac, while the Q4 all-wheel drive system gave in massive amounts of grip.But it all pales in comparison to  noise. It may only have six cylinders – and twin-turbocharged at that – but the masterful tuning of the Bolognese engineers mean that the guttural baritone roar, and the pops and crackles that come with it, sound authentic and just as exotic as the best of them. The BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class may be much more rounded propositions, but if it’s theatre you’re looking for, then your search ends here.If one of the considerations for the Top Five was meeting the vast expectations set upon the car, the new Ford Everest would be right up there. The Blue Oval made big claims with the Ranger-based SUV in terms of refinement, ride and handling, and while the pick-up was already impressive in that regard (of course, until the NP300 Navara stole the crown), I was still not quite sure how the Everest would actually fare.I need not have worried. Traversing the rough Chiang Rai roads, the Everest didn’t possess the same overly-cushy, rock-a-bye-baby ride that is typical of truck-based SUVs – instead keeping a firm but compliant control on body movements. We tend to talk about certain trucks and SUVs as having a car-like ride, but this one comes the closest to achieving it.It’s the same story with the handling – slightly slow steering aside, the Everest was grippy, stable and always in control, something that could not be said of its rivals. Throw in the handsome good looks, tidy interior and the amount of toys that are on offer and it starts to become a rather compelling package. The only potential snag for the soon-to-arrive Everest would be the price – we’ll need to see if Sime Darby AutoConnexion can price it competitively, but initial estimates suggest a sticker of up to RM240k for the range-topping 3.2L Titanium 4×4. That’s certainly very pricey for what is still a truck underneath, but one thing is clear – however much it will cost over here, this is still one talented vehicle.Another diesel car makes it after the BMW 320d GT last year, but they couldn’t be more different in character. As with Chris’ E 300, my first blush with the Mazda 2 1.5L SkyActiv-D was also through a fuel economy challenge, this time spanning 1,041 km from Bangkok to the Kedah border town of Changlun. And as fate would have it, I was paired with now-colleague Gerard, who was then working alongside Chris at the time.The experience of driving out of the capital at rush hour was completely different from the one back in KL, and I got us lost, not once, but twice in the span of half an hour. But even after the resulting mad rush to the first checkpoint ended up with us having the highest average fuel consumption of the competition, shrewd timing and careful driving thereafter enabled us to minimise the penalties, and we came in second with a combined score of 3.7 litres per 100 km. Like Chris, it really was the experience that sealed it for this one.As for the car itself, it was fantastic – the punchy 105 PS/250 Nm oil-burner, only sullied by slight turbo lag at low revs, really transformed the car, finally giving the 2 the oomph its nimble, capable chassis was screaming for. Local distributor Bermaz has indicated that a diesel 2 will arrive in showrooms sometime in 2016 – you’d do well to keep a look out for it.This has got to be the shortest test drive ever – I only drove the BMW i8 around the block for no more than five minutes after the boys collected it for the  – but it is the one that has seared itself into my mind and I can’t get it out.Forget the million ringgit price tag – the most shocking thing about the i8 is its brutal power delivery. This…thing may be powered by a heavily-boosted 231 hp 1.5 litre turbo three-pot, but the way the 131 hp electric motor at the front fills in the turbo lag makes the car feel naturally-aspirated, such is the instantaneous throttle response. This, combined with the all-wheel drive traction off the line means that the i8 feels , much faster than its 362 hp combined power output suggests.There’s more too – you sit very low, so it feels very special, although the cabin looks and feels way too much like a lowly 1 Series for it to really take the fight to the likes of the Mercedes-AMG GT. But the best thing about the i8 is the incredible sculpted exterior design and  doors that make it feel 10, 20 years ahead of its time. It’s a weakness of mine, coming from a product design background – Hafriz tends to chide me on this – but this time I just don’t care.My colleagues may not agree with me – they much prefer the consummate ability of the AMG GT or the extrovert character, sensuous styling and downright dirty exhaust note of the Jaguar F-Type R – but if I had RM1.2 million to spend on a car, I would go for i8 every single time. Yes, it’s complicated, feels (and sounds) a bit synthesised and, to be quite honest, feels low-rent everywhere you look, but the i8 is the one for me.Yes, my 2014 number one is on my list again, just as I predicted last year. Proton’s finest (it is!) left me thoroughly impressed during our  shoot, where it single-handedly and convincingly beat its competition. Clear as day it was the victor – by far and away our easiest verdict of the season.  A year on since I first drove it, the Iriz lost none of its charm and dynamic grace. The thoroughly used (and most likely abused) example didn’t feel a day old in our hands either, which was initially one of my major worries. Instead, it felt as tight as it should be, and proved to be the most comfortable, most dynamically capable hatch of the day. This is an affordable Proton hatchback that is good to look at, nice to be in and immensely enjoyable to drive. Sure, it’s smaller than the Myvi inside, and its ergonomic faults (tiny speedo, huge steering wheel) are hard to forgive, but in this case the positives certainly outweigh the drawbacks. Now if only it didn’t have  dreadful CVT as its automatic option. It may have mounted a proper challenge to Perodua had that been the case. For those willing to row your own gears, though, this is an absolute beauty.  Sticking to the very essence of this post, the very best car I’ve driven this year does not top my list. It’s a thoroughbred sports car, designed from the ground up to wow. And it amazed me, of course, but no more than I had expected to be. Had it been butt ugly (and still as capable), it might have ended up higher. Make no mistakes, though, the AMG GT S is objectively the finest machine I’ve experienced for a long, long time. Not since the magical 987C Porsche Cayman R have I been so thrilled behind the wheel. To me, this car has it all: sexy and menacing looks, elegant yet audacious image and scary but harnessable performance.  It’s one of those cars that, to me personally, look considerably better in the flesh compared to photos. What I initially thought as derivative “oh look at me, I’m a 911 wannabe” styling in flat images turned out to be both original and drop-dead gorgeous in front of my own eyes. I’m never trusting photographs again. And the driving experience? It’s a full-on attack on all your senses, how intimidating, visceral and involving it is. Out of the three million ringgit sports cars on hand at the time, I was drawn most to the Mercedes, the least to the Jag. Having thoroughly tested them all, the i8 and the F-Type swapped places, but the AMG GT S stayed at the top. Love, as they say, stands the test of time (behind other wheels). Let me be honest here – I’ve never been a fan of pick-up trucks. I think they’re crude machines that should be used as workhorses, and not as everyday-use family cars. The T6 Ford Ranger came closest to convincing me otherwise, but didn’t quite manage it. For all that’s been said of its near car-like driving characteristics, I was far from sold. The NP300 Navara changed all that. Finally, here’s a pick-up that could pass off as an MPV in terms of ride – long been my biggest issue with trucks. The T6 Ranger was a revelation when it arrived in 2012, but this, I believe, represents the biggest move forward for the class yet. Nevermind the fact that it’s not much of a load carrier. Its multi-link rear suspension with coil springs will have the rear deck sag awkwardly under heavy load, but it also transforms the truck’s ride qualities to far beyond what its competition can offer. Now this is how you execute a passenger-oriented pick-up truck. For those who intend to use a truck as a truck, there’s always the Ranger. Heavy mile-munchers can have the D-Max, while off-road junkies may be better off with the Triton. Urban dwellers, however, should go for the new boy. The new Mother Trucker. The Nissan NP300 Navara. When you’ve driven as many cars for as long as we have, you tend to make learned assumptions even before turning the wheel, be it based on past experiences, credible hearsay and, well, your own general expectations. In years of doing this job, I’ve hardly been proven wrong in this regard. Until this thing came along.Clicking the seat belt into place, I had a story crafted in my head, about how the X6 M is insanely fast on the straights, but a bit too heavy to take corners properly. I expected it to be well mannered, but a bit of a blunt weapon on track. Steady and supremely composed, but unexciting. More X than M. Oh but such a fool I was. The big M ate up the Sepang circuit like it was on rails. It was quick alright, exceedingly so, but it also proved magnificently capable of lighting your pants on fire through the bends. The harder I pushed, the harder the M-tuned xDrive system worked, juggling power between the four wheels. The result? Absolute magic. I also happened to drive it after stints on the F82 M4 Coupe and F10 M5 LCI. On the back of the fast but less-than-involving M4 and the lairy drive-it-properly-or-you’ll-bin-it M5, the X6 M turned out to be the biggest surprise of the day. All-wheel drive M5? Bring it on. Enthusiasts have nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. We had an empty track at our disposal during one of our  shoots. With the day’s work done and the circuit still open, Harve and I decided to have fun with our own cars. So out we went, me in Harve’s stock manual 86, and him in my daily drive, a Peugeot 208 GTi. What happened next was telling. While Harve decided to call it quits after two short laps, I carried on, driving like an idiot. Round and round I went, all the while thinking to myself, “dammit, I’ve bought the wrong car!” Thing is, the 86 is far from fast (it really isn’t, by anyone’s standard), nor is it particularly good looking (it’s bland, and the cabin has as much visual flamboyance as that of a Vios). But my God does it handle. The steering and body control is beyond exquisite, and the seating position is as perfect as it gets. Bliss on wheels, that was. My best driving experience of 2015. What it taught me is this: forget about the idea of a one-size-fits-all hot hatch – there’s no such thing. Go bold or go home. Want a fun car? Get a toy. Get a sports car. For something that you’ll want to drive everyday, a small, uncomfortable and unglamorous hot hatch just doesn’t quite cut it. Jack of all trades, master of none. The more grown-up me now wants a more user friendly, more passenger-friendly ride. A stylish sedan with some turn of speed, perhaps, like a Mercedes-Benz C 250 AMG Line. Maybe next year…You’re either a big fan of the exterior looks or you’re not (I’m okay with it), but the real magic is what’s tucked beneath all that sheet metal. There’s a lot of win with this one, and it’s not just about the burst of speed when you prod the accelerator pedal.Fast it is, but the intrinsic allure goes beyond that. The ride has a good level of refinement, and the quietness at cruising speeds is exemplary. Add to that an eminently achievable 400 km or so range and you have all the makings of a planet-friendly daily driver.The poor rear seating and odd trim here and there takes away some of the gloss, but not the technical achievement and core competency, which is first rate. Shame it won’t be available to a wider audience here.Fuel economy challenges are always good fun, even if there’s more than a modicum of insanity in them. The one involving the E 300 BlueTEC Hybrid was probably the zaniest I’ve ever been in – paired with Chris, who was with a different publication then, the three days of hijinks in the car made for an adventure truly worth writing about.The car, meanwhile, took all our nonsense without batting an eyelid. As a hybrid, it’s not perfect, because that battery is only good to assist the car to run electrically at very light throttle, but the oil burner works a charm, and to get 1,500 km on a single tank as we did on that run was quite the achievement, even if we had to drive conservatively – and toil – for it.The time spent in it also got us familiar with the interior like no other vehicle this year, and despite the W212’s cabin presentation starting to show signs of aging, as it invariably would, it’s not a bad place to be. Trust us, we know.Purists may dismiss this one and look back wistfully at the 458 Italia, lamenting the loss, but this is the way forward, and a very appealing one at that. Wide-ranging scope and drivability, insanely quick, eminently adjustable to input, the 488 GTB is a superb all-rounder. Sure, that soundtrack is muted in comparison to that before it, the character a little less gregarious, and that exterior can be accused of playing it a bit too straight and safe, but the mechanicals are absolutely brilliant and the dynamic sense nothing short of impressive. A tad tempered, you’ll need to drive it hard before the magic really appears, but it’s there, make no mistake about it. The rewards come, approached clean or ham-fisted.Putter around and you’ll find that works as well for this turbocharged horse. Tractable around town, with very decent levels of compliance for a sports car, this adds versatility to the game, which will be a boon to new followers. Still, it’s firm and deep-rooted when it matters, and did I say it was insanely quick? Oh yes, I did.Finally, the C346 facelift brings to the table what should have been there from the start – an adept handling family-based hatchback paired with a powertrain and drivetrain combination it deserves. The third-generation Focus is by no means as ground-breaking or emotionally engaging as the C170 Mk 1 was, but it’s still a very good car to drive.Nothing quite wrong with the outgoing pre-facelift dynamically, and that 2.0 litre Duratec Ti-VCT NA motor, despite needing some prodding to hustle the car along, is a thoroughly capable mill. The main letdown has been the accompanying Getrag 6DCT250 six-speed dry dual-clutch PowerShift transmission, the less of which is said, the better.Going the blown route with the 1.5 litre EcoBoost 15 and a conventional six-speed torque converter automatic transforms the Focus. The SelectShift 6F35 gearbox may not be the brightest and newest, but it’s proficient and a world away from that on now. Elsewhere, revisions and enhancements in the areas of steering, NVH and ride/handling do their bit to further the cause. Intrinsically smoother, peppier off the mark, and much tauter, all at one go. Now, why didn’t they nail it the first time out?Not so much the vehicle as it was the location and timing – Iceland in the thick of winter made for unquestionably the best driving experience I had this year, hands down. Snowstorms, wind, blizzards that reduced visibility to non-existent levels and black ice were part of the parcel, but so were picturesque landscapes – albeit monotone – and some great B-routes. All this, in a day.Ah, what was the vehicle again? Oh yes, the L550 Discovery Sport, which turned out to be the ideal star in the particular play. It’s a bit boxy looking upon first measure, not quite as visually stimulating as its Evoque cousin, but the looks grow on you, and I quite liked the interior of the five-seat example from the get-go. The Si4 petrol and SD4 diesel motors worked a treat, too. As for the driving, the SUV reveled in all that slush and blustery conditions, going about the task with no fuss whatsoever. While not indestructible, as shown on three occasions when my co-driver got it stuck into snowbanks due to human error, it accomplished everything else asked of it correctly in quiet, understated fashion. Sure, you could argue that the drive would have been as much fun and compelling in a Lada Niva, but maybe I wouldn’t be alive to write about the experience here if it were the case.It just struck me that I’ve driven more SUVs in the past one and a half year than the rest of the years in this job combined, despite our team’s rotation system – such is the popularity of the raised hatchbacks as today’s urban machine of choice.The soft-roader is of course not a new concept, but the Honda HR-V can claim to be groundbreaking. It wasn’t the first B-segment hatch-based SUV to reach our sunny shores, but it did take the market by storm.It has brand power, but the HR-V is also a good product that . Easy to drive, smooth and refined, a unique cockpit, and interior packaging that trumps rivals from a class above are strong points. Familiarity hasn’t helped with the looks, but this is a winning package.It’s here for that interior. Pretty much the closest thing to love at first sight when it comes to car cabins, the third-gen Audi TT fulfils my fetish for minimalist interiors. After losing its way for the Mk2, this TT dashboard is as impactful as the original car’s trendsetting cabin, for me at least. Fresh thinking sees the AC controls incorporated in the cool turbine vents, leaving just one row of buttons on the stark, but functional centre stack. No jutting central screen to spoil aesthetics too – all you see is presented on a 12.3-inch “virtual cockpit”, which unfortunately has no local navi to show off . That skull of a steering wheel, the quality…I could go on, but the car itself isn’t half bad. Explosive real world acceleration, a brutally efficient gearbox and an iconic shape has got me dreaming. Compact SUVs are all the rage these days, but BMW didn’t jump on the bandwagon – it helped create the premium sub-segment with the original X1 back in 2009. It may have been the pioneer, but recreating the E84 won’t do in 2015.Which is why today’s second-gen X1 is as all-new as it gets. Sitting on a fresh FWD platform (xDrive available), the X1 ditches the gawky wagon shape of old for a more robust, handsome appearance. It’s a better SUV too, being more spacious and practical than before, with higher quality finishing. All the above is enough to propel the X1 back to the top of the class of 2015, but the clincher is that the junior SAV is still , front-wheel drive or not. Plenty of time for dreams and ideals when you’re young but most enthusiasts will eventually fall into the grasp of reality. Suddenly, the thought of a luxury express (automatic, of course) that will ferry me from A to B with minimum fuss doesn’t seem so impure anymore.None will do that as well as the B9 Audi A4, I reckon. The most slippery car in its class is also very comfortable and efficient. The 252 hp  does the century sprint in just 5.8 seconds, but has the legs and refinement for the long haul. Dynamically improved, too.A major part of the B9’s appeal is its new cabin. A slim fit version of the Q7’s dash with elements shared with the pricey SUV, the A4’s cockpit is minimalist and warm (or technical, depending on trim) at the same time, layered with top notch quality. Smooth operator in a sharp suit.Life was simpler back in the day, and so were cars. No twin-turbos and torque vectoring in this , just raw mechanical delight and an accurate transcription of the road to your body.This “Italian M3” is a rare car – only 2,540 coupes were made for Italy and Portugal, markets that imposed lower taxes on engines below two litres in size. The M3’s 2.3L S14 engine had its stroke shortened to make 1,990 cc, and the 192 hp/210 Nm four-pot is paired to the M3’s close-ratio five-speed manual. This four-pot loves high revs, and the buzz from the final dash to 7,000 rpm got me high as well. The steering is slow by modern standards, and the suspension more liberal, but it allows you to flow with the car as it flows down the road. With that pearl of an engine and a stick shift, the experience was !",Anthony Lim

Founded by Ferruccio Lamborghini, a new biopic titled  will be produced by the Ambi Group to chronicle the life and times of the Italian industrialist from even before his time manufacturing high-end luxury sports cars.The film will trace the career path of Lamborghini (born April 28, 1916) from his early days making agricultural tractors (Lamborghini Trattori), to the manufacturing of military equipment in World War Two, and finally the foundation of his sports car company in 1963. Ferruccio passed away on February 20, 1993.Before his demise, Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. saw several ownership changes, with the first resulting from 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis, that drove the company into bankruptcy in 1978. American company Chrysler took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V’Power Corporation in 1994. The company was then sold to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group’s Audi division in 1998.Since it existed, the company has produced some of the world’s greatest sports cars, including the iconic Miura in 1966, the Countach in 1974, the well-known Diablo (1990).

Next came the present  and . The company also had a go in making limited-run models that included the stealthy , lightweight ,  and the . Lamborghini has even produced an SUV before in the form of the LM002, so the upcoming  certainly has a bit of heritage to go with it.Of course, one of the driving factors behind Ferruccio Lamborghini’s passion to produce sports car was his “rivalry” with fellow Italian business , who will also receive his own biopic, with Christian Bale tipped as the film’s lead actor.

2016-01-04,KL-Singapore HSR project – the race begins to heat up,"The race to win the bid for the  project is ramping up, with more jockeying coming about – now, a report indicates that the Chinese may be a step ahead of its competition given that it owns a significant stake in Bandar Malaysia, which is slated to be a hub in the HSR service.China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC) and its Malaysian partner, Iskandar Waterfront Holdings, collectively owns 60% of Bandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd, the project owner of the 486-acre Bandar Malaysia, and though CREC has brushed off talk of the ‘advantage’ of its stake in Bandar Malaysia, the state-owned company isn’t denying that it is , reports.“Yes, the group is a reputable HSR developer from design to construction. We could provide end to end solution for HSR in Malaysia as what we are doing in the recently announced US$5bil Jakarta-Bandung HSR,” CREC project director Cai Zemin said. According to another news report, another advantage may be there in the form of entrenchment, as China already supplies more than 80% of the rolling stocks for rail use in the country.China and Japan are going head to head in attempting to embed a stronger industrial and political foothold in the region through their HSR projects. Although Japan lost to China in securing the Indonesia HSR project, it managed to win the rights to  in India.While the parties have been maintaining a civil front, the behind-the-scenes talk is apparently less friendly – a Japanese official was reported to have contended that China has no proper business plan for the Jakarta-Bandung line and was making promises it cannot keep, with the reportedly uncompleted Northrail project in Manila being used as an example.Meanwhile, China is proud of a cheaper cost of building HSR systems, claiming it had not lost to Japan in the Mumbai-Ahmedabad HSR project as there was no open tender, the report added.Not to be discounted is South Korea, which  with the opening of a 157 sq m showroom in Nu Sentral, KL to highlight its HSR prowess. The South Korean government has organised a consortium that will work on the bid for the project, and this will include the Korea Railroad Corp, Korea Land & Housing Corp, Korea Rail Network Authority (KRNA), top construction companies of South Korea and South Korean maker of HSR trains Hyundai Rotem Company.According to KRNA chairman and chief executive officer Kang Yeong Il, the unified bid for the KL-Singapore HSR is the first time both rail-related South Korea government agencies and private corporations have formed a consortium on such a large scale. “We are well prepared to cover all aspects of the HSR development here, from construction, operation, rolling-stock, financing, signalling system to development of new townships along the line,” Kang said.All the interested parties participated in the  conducted by the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD).",Anthony Lim
2015-12-31,Top 10 most popular stories on paultan.org for 2015,"Well, here’s a surprise then. It turns out that the most popular posts on  this year weren’t about any specific vehicle, but rather on topics close to motorists’ wallets, in this case fuel and GST.According to Google Analytics data, our most popular post of the year was fuel-related, as in whether there was any significant difference in using RON 95 and RON 97 in terms of fuel economy. This was followed by our thesis on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and its impact on car prices, a couple of weeks before GST was introduced on April 1.Honda again cropped up three times in this year’s top 10, as it did last year – proof of the popularity of the brand then? Here, the HR-V, 2016 Honda Civic and post-GST pricing of the local Honda model range were in the mix. The locally-assembled Mazda 3 also struck a chord with readers, as were renderings of the new Proton Perdana, which arrives in 2016. Plenty of interest too in another future hot cake, Perodua’s new sedan. The final slots were occupied by posts on passenger safety and vehicle sales data for the month of April, which is when GST began. Here’s a recap of the top 10. A tragic tale, this. Back in May, the occupants of a Mitsubishi Pajero Sport – a couple and their infant – were killed when their SUV rolled over on the DUKE highway. Leaving the contention of how involved some Myvis – which were apparently racing – were in the accident well alone, we set out to remind drivers of why safety is so important with this post. In March, full specifications and pricing of the CKD Mazda 3 were revealed ahead of its debut a month later – there was a lot of interest in what the locally-assembled 3 brought along for the ride, as the post’s ranking suggests. The C-segment sedan market may be shrinking, cannibalised by the growing (quite figuratively) ultra-competitive B-segment and SUV brigades, but there’s always keen interest whenever the Civic name is brought up. Mind you, this was way ahead of the tenth-gen Honda Civic’s actual reveal, with only patent images to go by, but that was enough to get things stirring.One of the most anticipated vehicles to debut in 2015 rolled in like a whirlwind, translating all that interest into tangible sales. By the transporter-loads. Early on, the wait time for one became ridiculously long, and though the fuss has eased up nearly 10 months on, the B-segment SUV is still a popular choice, and not just with buyers, as you’ll find out soon enough. We already know the general shape of the national carmaker’s upcoming flagship D-segment sedan, what with no less than five spyshot posts this month alone, but nothing concrete visually as yet, given all that disguise. Thanks to rendering wizard Theophilus Chin, we all had an imaginative view of what the biggie will eventually look like when it arrives next year. Tune in then to see how much of the forecast was right.Prices, schmices. There was a flurry of activity when GST kicked in on April 1, with revisions to local car prices coming thick and fast. Of the lot, the most popular one turned out the be Honda’s.Again, number four was related to GST – its implementation had a noticeable impact on sales of passenger and commercial vehicles in the country, with sales dropping by over 30% compared to March. This post broke down all the specifics – sales performance by brand, actual numbers shifted. It wasn’t a pretty sight.News emerged that Perodua’s sedan, codenamed the D63D, had been green-lighted for production and was at the prototype stage, and it was enough to create this hornet’s nest of a post. Anticipated to arrive sometime next year or 2017, imagine what will happen then.We toiled over this one like never before, and never have we researched or queried a topic more (you should have seen the whiteboard – it looked like a theoretical physics discussion at one point). The seminal body of work, which set out to explore all the facets of GST from an automotive perspective, is one of our literary highlights of the year.“Should I use RON 95 or go for the more expensive RON 97 fuel?” We decided to wade into the debate by comparing the two fuel grades directly, head-to-head against each other. Interesting findings, and a captivating read, as it turned out.",Anthony Lim
2015-12-31,VIDEO: E36 and E46 BMW M3 detailed – an evolution,"Last week, , the first video of a five-part series showing the evolution of the ultimate driving machine. This time, Munich has given us a look at the car’s two immediate successors, the  and  models.For all that talk that the M3 is the zenith of the sports sedan, it was only in its second generation in 1992 that it spawned a four-door variant which only reappeared later on with the  and .It was also a much different car than the E30 – while the older car was a no-holds-barred racer on the road, built mainly to satisfy homologation rules that allowed it to go racing, the new E36 was designed from the get go to be a more luxurious, understated road car. The now legendary straight-six engine was new here too, initially a 3.0 litre mill with VANOS continuous variable valve timing – a first for BMW – delivering 286 PS.Available with either a six-speed manual or, in 1997, a six-speed sequential manual gearbox (the latter, boasts head of chassis development Gerhard Ricter in the video, came to market earlier than even Ferrari’s system), the E36 went from 0-100 km/h in just 5.9 seconds.Like its predecessor, the E36 spawned many a special edition, one of which was the M3 GT with a more powerful 295 PS engine. A mid-life update in 1995 brought along a bigger 3.2 litre motor making 321 PS. Overall, over 71,000 units of the E36 M3 were sold.The year 2000 saw the introduction of the E46 M3, bringing back some of the harder edge of the E30. Available only as a coupé or a convertible, it sprouted a lot more muscle in the design, with a bonnet power bulge, blistered wheel arches, (faux) fender air vents and quad exhaust exits. If BMW was going for a more hardcore look than the E36, it certainly succeeded.That exterior aggression was backed by a more powerful version of the 3.2 litre straight-six, now producing 343 PS. It was with this car that the M3 became known as a precision driving tool with a high-revving engine – this one screams all the way to nearly 8,000 rpm. Continuing with the six-speed manual and SMG ‘boxes, the E46 flung itself to 100 km/h in just 5.1 seconds.Racing success came with the M3 GTR, which swapped its then-underperforming straight-six for the 2001 American Le Mans Series (ALMS) championship with a 500 PS 4.0 litre V8 – it won both the team’s championship that year and the 2003 24 Hours of Nürburgring. Just 10 road-going versions were built for ALMS homologation purposes.A more reserved special edition came later with the 2004 M3 CSL. Limited to less than 1,400 units, it was far closer to the standard E46, but was 110 kg lighter thanks to removed equipment and new weight saving features like the carbon fibre roof – the first M car to have it, and it reappeared on the  and F80 M3, as well as the . The engine was also retuned to push out 360 PS, while the SMG was made standard.With the butch looks and stonking engine, the E46 M3 is a firm favourite both in our office and in enthusiasts hearts around the world, and it’s no wonder that it was even more successful than its predecessor, selling around 85,000 units when production was ceased in 2006.",Jonathan Lee

2015-12-31,Mercedes-Benz working on new platform for electric vehicles – the first of four to be launched by 2018,"Better late than never, Mercedes-Benz is reportedly working on a new platform for four electric vehicles. The first of the four will be introduced by 2018 – earlier than initial plans,  reports. It will underpin a sedan, a mid-sized SUV, an S-Class-sized vehicle and a large crossover, to be introduced in that order.To elaborate, the first to be launched in 2018 will be the sedan, slotted in between the  and . Subsequently, a crossover slotted between the  and  will follow. Later on, an S-Class-sized EV and an SUV – said to be larger than the  – will come after.The , which we saw earlier at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, may provide a hint of what the new electric-powered vehicles may look like. In relation to that, the first sedan to launch will reportedly measure around 4,700 mm in length and with a 2,700 mm wheelbase.Said platform is reportedly called the Electric Vehicle Architecture (EVA), and it will share elements with the Modular Rear Architecture (MRA). These include the body structure, suspension and the electronic platform. Additionally, the platform is also said to be engineered to handle a 400 kg battery pack to power one or two electric motors. The rear-wheel drive models are said to be powered solely by an electric motor with 402 hp, while all-wheel drive variants will have an additional electric motor in front that produces 120 or 201 hp.Features such as adaptive e-suspension, e-brakes with wheel-selective recuperation and e-torque vectoring are some to the features expected to make way into these electric cars as well. The platform will come out of Mercedes’ facility in Bremen, Northern Germany. It is also here that “EVA Phase II” – which involves the S-Class-sized EV and the larger crossover – is to take place. Mercedes expects to sell 20,000 units of each model per year at a price of £70,000 to £80,000 (RM445k-510k).",Graham Chin
2015-12-31,2016 Kawasaki ZZR1400 loses 10 hp to Euro 4,"The 2016 Kawasaki ZZR1400 (sold as the ZX-14R in the US) recently underwent US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) testing, and was found to have lost 10 hp over previous models. Kawasaki has traditionally been conservative about the big Z’s power, quoting 200 hp as the official figure, but dyno testing over the years showed another five percent or so horsepower could be found on tap.Down-grading of the ZZR’s power output was attributed to compliance with Euro 4 standards. Changes to the incoming model include a new three-way catalyst, and revisions to the ECU and evaporative system.This was despite earlier claims to the contrary by Kawasaki, saying the 2016 ZZR would suffer no loss of hp.  The new number is 199.4 hp, and emissions figures have dropped as a result, with the 2016 engine running a tiny bit cleaner than the older model.Major changes are a new instrument cluster and Brembo M50 Monobloc calipers lifted off the ZX-10R. The 2016 ZZR1400 comes in two versions, standard and Performance Sport. The Performance Sport model gets Ohlins suspension at the back and a pair of Akrapovic exhausts. The ZZR1400 weighs-in at 269 kg, and is sold in the UK for £11,799 (RM75,200) for the standard and £13,399 (RM85,400) for the Performance Sport.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-31,Honda CB1100R concept bike closer to production?,"Concept motorcycles tend to have strange lives.  Some, like the Suzuki GSX1100S, a.k.a the Katana, generate such interest from the public that a production model appears the very next year. Others, like the Honda CB1100R concept, take a little longer.Publicly shown in October 2007 together with the un-faired CB1100F, the single-seat racing-bodied CB1100R disappeared while its ‘F’ sibling made it into production in 2008. Fast-forward to 2015, and the ‘R’ has reappeared in the form of submissions at the Japanese patent office.The patent filings deal with air-flow around the spark plugs of the CB1100 engine. Ducted air from the new fairing design is channeled to the plugs and the hottest parts of the engine to take away excess heat. This also helps the engine comply with Euro 4 standards by controlling emissions.As reported by , the concept of the CB1100R is still cooking at Hamamatsu. Honda chief engineer Hirofumi Fukanaga, the man responsible for several generations of the Fireblade, said, “We can’t say no to this bike. It’s not just a simple concept bike – it can’t be. I can’t say when, but the way the European market is going we may well be seeing naked bikes and retro bikes out-selling sportsbikes and the CB1100 has been designed with a long time of development ahead of it.”",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-31,SPYSHOTS: smart forfour Brabus playing in the snow,"The  Brabus was recently spotted by our photographers, frolicking in the snow. Seeing that it’s a tuned-up version of the little four door, there’s little change in terms of the way it looks save for a new front and rear bumper.Additionally, the four-door compact here looks like it has been lowered as well, while a dual exhaust system is also present. This perhaps suggests that the Brabus version of the forfour could be packing a little more punch, in terms of power. To recap, the standard forfour comes with a 71 hp/91Nm 999 cc naturally-aspirated unit or a  90 hp/135 Nm 898 cc turbocharged mill.That said, seeing how Brabus works, the said mills will likely be tuned to propel the forfour to speeds similar to that of superminis – perhaps somewhere within the range of 110 hp to 130 hp. As a refresher, the forfour is fitted with a five-speed manual or a six-speed dual-clutch transmission that sends power to the rear wheels.Aside from a firmer suspension setup, other enhancements that can likely be found include thicker anti-roll bars and a tuned steering system to improve the handling. Outside, apart from new bumpers, exterior items might include a different set of wheels as opposed to the ones seen here, and a rear spoiler to spruce up its overall look. Not much else can be said, seeing that this Brabus-tuned forfour has been relatively discreet. Inside however, a different set of front seats and instrument panel as well as Brabus badges and a different interior trim, could also be a possibility here.",Graham Chin
2015-12-31,BMW to show autonomous car developments in 2016,"It seems BMW is ready to present its developments in the field of autonomous technology,  reports. In conjunction with its 100th birthday which falls on March 7, 2016, the brand will unveil said developments, according to Ian Robertson, BMW head of sales and marketing.He also disclosed the ‘stages’ the brand’s tech is currently at. “We’ve reached the ‘feet off’ phase of autonomy and now we’re in the ‘hands off’ and ‘eyes off’ phase, but only for brief periods,” Robertson said. He further stated that the next phase will be “brain off.”In that, Robertson noted that although the technology could be ready in about a decade’s time, there were still factors that will delay the innovation by 15 years instead. Of the factors, Robertson said that one of it was the “moral dilemma” of fully-autonomous technology.Robertson explained, “in a situation where a truck is going to hit your car, what does the autonomous car decide to do: save you by swerving out of the way, swerve into the path of another vehicle and possibly kill someone, or hit a pedestrian, or does it simply decide that, yes, the truck is going to hit you? We’re not ready for that,” he said.According to him, while the the brand will be celebrating its 100th year in business but at the same time, it will be mainly be looking at the next 100 years. “Maybe what I’ve been alluding to will be the direction of that,” he concluded.While not exactly from BMW itself, concept car builder Rinspeed is working on a self-driving car based on the .

2015-12-31,Volvo XC40 compact SUV will spawn small car range,"Hakan Samuelsson, Volvo’s head honcho has revealed that a small SUV is a likely segment in which the Swedish automaker wants to delve into,  reports. “Highest on my list is a small SUV, because that’s where the market is going,” Samuelsson said. The  will be the first to spearhead the said range.“We want to build a broader range of ‘40’ cars,” he said. “Today we only have the hatchback, but we want more, and with the new technology that we’re working on, we will have the means to expand the line-up,” he added. He further hinted that small hybrids may soon make way onto most of Volvo’s cars in the future.The company’s  will reportedly allow Geely, Volvo’s parent firm to develop more upmarket vehicles. At the same time the models will be more profitable and allow for a broader range of the company’s 40-series models.It’s said that the CMA will be engineered towards comfort rather than handling, and it can accommodate hybrid powertrains. Volvo insiders assert that the Swedish company has brought about “strong solutions” by coupling a small electric motor with the transmission. Diesels might not be an option here, due to the “costly technologies that are required to make them comply,” according to Peter Mertens, Volvo’s head of R&D.That said, a likely choice for the 40-series range could be a small electric and petrol duo – the new turbocharged 1.5 litre three-pot engine might be a possible candidate here. Samuelsson said, “I think in the future, and independently of ‘dieselgate’, we will see some more petrol sales, and of course, more electrification, the mix of a small petrol engine and an electric motor.” Moreover, the expansion of the 40-series range will allow the Swedish brand to develop its three production sites around the world. The XC40, along with the  and S40 are to be produced in Ghent, Belgium, while the  and  are produced in Gothenburg, Sweden.

2015-12-31,Taxi drivers sue SPAD over Uber and Grabcar issue,"The taxi vs ride-sharing war continues, and now the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) has been drawn directly into the melee.  reports that the commission is being sued by 102 taxi drivers for alleged negligence in taking action to ban , Grabcar and Blacklane.The drivers, who claim the three transportation network companies are affecting their livelihoods, have formed an ad hoc action committee from 29 taxi associations and are applying for a permanent injunction to compel SPAD not to legalise the activities and operations of the three operators, claiming that the companies have not received approval from the authorities to ferry passengers.In the statement of claim, taxi driver Abdul Aziz Lebai Milin and 101 other taxi drivers named SPAD as the sole defendant. The drivers are looking to obtain a declaration from the High Court for SPAD to ban these three operators within seven days of a court order. They are also seeking general damages, interest, costs and relief deemed fit by the court. The group filed the lawsuit at the High Court civil registry through lawyer R. Kengadharan, who said his clients filed the suit to ensure “fair play” and healthy competition to improve the transport industry. He said that his clients’ incomes had been affected by the three operators, who used personal vehicles for commercial purposes.Committee chairman Zailani Isa Usuludin said the taxi drivers were defending their rights, as their source of income had been seriously affected, and they had lost almost 60% of their daily take to ride-sharing services.“We have to support our families. We work for 16 hours but only get between RM150 and RM160. We have to pay for costs for car rental, petrol and maintenance, and to the respective companies. How to survive with the balance of RM30 after all those deductions?” said Zailani.Earlier in the week, SPAD had said it was  over issues relating to ride-sharing services. Commission chairman Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar said that certain quarters, including government agencies, had been dodging responsibility in solving the “illegal taxi” services offered via smartphone apps, and the commission was being faulted.“Many people are just happy to point fingers at SPAD, even though that’s not our area of responsibility. In the end, we have been blamed for many things, we are like a punching bag, while the media are happy to provide space to hit out at SPAD,” he said.",Anthony Lim

2015-12-31,Wunderlich X2 – two-wheel drive BMW GS prototype,"German BMW Motorrad after-market accessories firm Wunderlich has developed a hybrid two-wheel drive system for the R1200 GS. The system utilises a 13.6 hp electric motor embedded in the front wheel to provide “more propulsion on the ground and also draw the GS through curves on the road more quickly.”Wunderlich says the bike, called the “Wunderlich X2”, is still at concept stage, and chief executive officer Frank Hoffman only added, “we want to show what is going on and establish standards.” A 2WD motorcycle would be easier to handle in the dirt, especially in arresting impending front-end washouts and help pull the bike through turns.The motor, developed in collaboration with Italian firm Evolt, is able to pull the GS along at 20 km/h, even with the bike’s engine off. It is also capable of going in reverse at 3 km/h to help low-speed and parking lot maneuvers, while regenerative braking charges a battery that powers the system.Two-wheel drive motorcycles are not new, with several firms producing prototypes over the years, including Yamaha and KTM. Rokon has been producing 2WD off-road bikes for decades, as has Christini. The designs use mechanical or hydraulic drive, and thus add weight and complexity to the front-end.",Mohan K Ramanujam

2015-12-30,VIDEO: Nissan GT-R undecorates a Christmas tree,"Christmas is over, and that can mean only one thing, it’s time to take down the tree. For some, this represents an opportunity for the family to have another group activity together as they undecorate it. On the other hand, this is just another time-consuming chore that you wish can be over with quickly. Fortunately, Nissan USA has the solution to the latter’s woes, and it’ll only take 2.7 seconds, apparently.Of course, there is some preparation involved before you remove the decorations on a Christmas tree that quickly. First up, you’ll need a decorated Christmas tree (obviously). Next, you’ll need a  and its 3.8 litre twin-turbo V6 engine and its 600 hp, where you’ll tie the Christmas tree lights’ power cord to the rear tow hook of the car.After that, step into the car and fire up the GT-R’s VR38DETT. Nissan’s video doesn’t provide a definitive answer if the car’s launch control function should be engaged while attempting this endeavour. We presume that you should engage it for the best results.Finally, floor the accelerator pedal and in just 2.7 seconds (claimed), your Christmas tree will be deprived of all its decorations. However, there are two things to keep in mind if you follow Nissan USA’s “tip”. Firstly, you should do this in an open space because a GT-R would likely not fit in your house. Secondly, there’s no guarantee the decorations will come out unscathed, ready for use next year.",Gerard Lye

Uber India and South Asia communications head Karun Arya told  that it is an entirely different service that aims to reduce traffic congestion.“It’s not about Uber versus taxis, we don’t see them as a ride-sharing competition,” said Arya. He said it was  to provide “reliable, safe and affordable” transport services to clients, especially in major urban areas.Uber has come under heavy fire in recent weeks with taxi drivers staging protests on a regular basis claiming the service has caused to lose customers and earnings.

If you can increase that four percent utilisation to even 70% or 80%, then you can start taking more cars off the road,” he said.Uber head of Global Trust Bhavdeep Basin said Uber was 100% compliant and regulated through local regulations that are in place and encouraged authorities to implement regulations for their business model. “When people say you are illegal and you are unregulated, we couldn’t be further from the truth,” he said.While taxi drivers have been protesting against Uber and Grabcar, another ride-sharing service, the general public views these services as an attractive alternative to traditional taxis, citing better cars and polite drivers as the main reasons for choosing the service.",Mohan K Ramanujam

The new QL has been on sale in South Korea for months now, having been  (before Frankfurt).The current SL Sportage has presence, but as the photos show, the QL’s front has incredible heft – massive would best describe that face next to the old one; certainly, there’s no shortage of bumper on the new car. It’s also quite visually imposing at the back, which features among other things sharper LED rear lights and a chrome trim strip providing linkage between the units.Design-wise, the new Sportage has improved aerodynamics, and it’s also a more refined offering mechanically – NVH levels are down compared to the current one. The interior is also an advancement in terms of material and trim.Engine options for the new Sportage include a new turbocharged 1.6 litre T-GDI petrol engine which makes 174 hp and 265 Nm of torque and a 1.6 litre GDI petrol offering 130 hp and 161 Nm. A new seven-speed double clutch transmission (DCT) is dedicated to the 1.6 litre T-GDI engine – a choice of six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission works with all the other mills.The current Sportage facelift sold locally – be it  or  form – is powered by a 2.0 litre Nu MPI four-cylinder petrol engine developing 154 PS at 6,200 rpm and 191 Nm at 4,700 rpm, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.So, which Sportage do you think works better for you, the new QL or the outgoing third-gen SL?

The car is inspired by the motoring era of the 60’s as well as the “universe” of Petrolicious, Jay Leno’s garage and , according to the brand. It further states that the purpose of the two-seater is to allow “great freedom in self-customisation and pure performance.”“You can play with body parts, add a windscreen, change the back side, add a hardtop and aerodynamic elements,” Julliot explains. A look at its website notes that the technical specifications can be altered too.

2015-12-30,Government should consider bus fare hike – KTB,"To shelter bus companies from increasing operational costs, Konsortium Transnasional Berhad (KTB) is asking that the government increase bus fares,  reports. The consortium is expected to sink into a loss for the financial year of 2016.Tan Sri Mohd Nadzmi Mohd Salleh, chairman and MD of KTB stated that due to the goods and services tax and the weaker ringgit, the company’s profit margin is being strained, as operation costs have increased as a result of both factors. By increasing bus fares, Salleh explained that it would assist by offsetting operational costs associated with spare part purchases and the disposal of old buses. “It is difficult for companies like us to cope with the current situation. If it persists we could record losses next year,” Salleh said.He also added that the government had approved a 22.6% hike in bus fares which was supposed to be in effect in May this year.

2015-12-30,Ariel Ace –  a bespoke bike for the discerning rider,"Ariel has a rich history in motorcycling going back to 1901, and was famous for the Square Four and Hunters, bikes capable of reaching 165 km/h back in the fifties. The name was revived in 1999 as Ariel Motor Company Ltd, manufacturer of the minimalist Honda Civic Type R-powered Atom.The small-volume success of the Atom allowed Ariel to launch the Ace in 2014, a bespoke motorcycle that could be designed exactly as the customer wished. Working on the same exposed trellis frame concept as the Atom, the frame is milled from solid billets of aluminium, a process requiring 70 hours of machining time.The frame is further hand-welded and hard anodised, and mated to its Honda-built engine, a 1,237 cc V4 that puts out 173 hp. The gearbox is a six-speed unit that had its origins in the Honda VFR1200, a seriously capable sports-tourer. ABS brakes are standard, as is traction control.Where the Ace differs from almost any other motorcycle you could buy is the staggering list of options available. There isn’t a single ‘look’ or ‘style’ for the Ace.  The owner can specify the bike as a cruiser, a naked bike, a streetfighter, a sports-tourer or a sports bike. The only common items are the frame, engine and gearbox, and the limit is effectively the owner’s imagination.The options list continues with four different seats and three different fuel tanks. Two fork types are available, a USD telescopic or a girder-style fork, the latter of which is machined and forged out of aluminium.The owner can then specify adjustable footrests, different handlebars, dampers, wheels, body parts, exhausts, fairings, even different steering head angles. This ensures that no two Ace motorcycles will ever look the same.Manufactured in Ariel’s works in Somerset, UK, 100 to 150 Aces are made each year, following the path set by the Atom.  Owners are encouraged to return to the factory for upgrades and modifications, something that is in common with Atom owners who keep their cars and embark on a journey of continuous improvements to their ride.It is hard to put a price on the Ariel Ace, since no two Aces are alike. It has been reported in the motorcycling press that prices start at £20,000 (RM130,000) and rapidly ascend into the stratosphere.",Mohan K Ramanujam

2015-12-30,School bus fares increase expected in January 2016,"Parents may need to fork out more for school bus services as fares are expected to go up next month. According to Amali Munif Rahmat, president of the Federation of Malaysian School Bus Operators Association, a number of school bus companies are looking to combat the rising cost of operation with an increase in their fares.“The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the depreciation of our ringgit have been attributed for the increase. Even a piece of screw at 50 sen is charged GST. The problem is that they can’t claim taxes paid from the Customs as these companies barely reach half a million ringgit sales, as required by the government if they intend to claim,” he told .Amali claims that some transport companies decided to maintain their current fares this year, although they had hardly enough to stay in operation. The Land Public Transport Commission’s (SPAD) decision to deregulate the fares in January 2016 has provided companies with the ability to set their own fares. However, any increase in fares is up to the individual company’s discretion.This variance in rates is also dependant on the status of the residents, their requirements, and the distance to the respective schools. “Some would want their children to only board air-conditioned school buses. This would obviously cost more than others,” he said.Amali also warned the school bus companies not to collude on any fare hikes. “They should not conspire with each other or come to an agreement to increase their fares together as it should be done individually. Otherwise, it would go against Section 4 of the Competition Act 2010, which prohibits deals between enterprises,” he stated.For parents who employ the services of school bus companies, how much are you currently paying them to send your child to school? Do you think the impending fare hike is a justified one? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",Gerard Lye

Going the AMG Line route naturally sports the exterior up with the addition of an AMG bodystyling kit and 18-inch AMG multi-spoke alloys, as well as the inclusion of a sports suspension. The diamond grille that usually accompanies the trim level is however not to be found.No mechanical changes – the A 200’s Camtronic-equipped 1.6 litre M 270 DE 16 AL BlueDirect petrol unit retains its 154 hp at 5,000 rpm and 250 Nm at 1,250 to 4,000 rpm output, paired with a seven-speed 7-DCT dual-clutch transmission. Likewise, performance specs for car should be as before, with a 0-100 km/h time of 8.3 seconds and a 224 km/h top speed being the primary numbers.As before, much of the equipment levels continue on – these include a Light & Sight package, six-speaker Audio 20 system and a Night package, the latter easily identifiable by black wing mirror caps as well as a high-gloss waistline trim strip. Also on, a dynamic handling package.Back in 2013, the local A 200’s interior featured an Artico man-made leather/Larochette cloth combination, with diamond pattern trim and contrast stitching. The latest info on the A 200 AMG Line brochure lists an Artico/Microfiber Dinamica upholstery combination, which brings it to pre-FL A 250 Sport levels.",Anthony Lim

2015-12-29,Honda Odyssey for US market revealed via patents,"These recent patent images published by Japan’s patent office reveal what the US-spec Honda Odyssey could possibly look like once the fifth-generation model debuts there sometime in 2017. If the design looks familiar, that is because it closely resembles the China-only Dongfeng .In fact, we dare say that the patent images mirrors the design seen on the Toyota Alphard/Vellfire-rivalling seven/eight-seater MPV that was previewed by . This includes the full-LED Jewel Eye headlights, generous application of chrome on the grille and door handles and black accents.Other minor changes like the larger tail lights and bumpers differentiate it further from the Odyssey. Additionally, the Elysion gets larger dimensions than the Japan-spec Odyssey. That should make it more agreeable with US customers. Currently, the Honda Odyssey in the States is in its fourth-generation since 2011 and is due for a replacement.The replacement for the Odyssey will compete against the Toyota Sienna in the US, and is said to be powered by a 3.5 litre V6 borrowed from the Honda Pilot. A nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive is expected to debut on the all-new US-spec Honda Odyssey as well. Meanwhile, our  that was introduced in 2013, is in its , and based on the Japan-spec model instead.

And it appears a more thorough revamp is still on the cards, judging by these spyshots of a facelifted model being tested in the United States.Despite the heavy camouflage, a number of changes are apparent, including a more shapely front bumper, new Y-spoke alloy wheels and a more angular rear diffuser section. The adaptive LED headlights with LED positioning lights and the redesigned LED round tail lights seen here were introduced in a .Of course, updates to the GT-R tend to be on the under-the-skin variety, so the visual tweaks probably barely scratch the surface – although it has to be said that this would be the first proper revision to the car’s looks since the .However, Nissan has , now that its considerable performance credibility – culminating in the sensational  – is beyond reproach.Programme manager Hiroshi Tamura told  that he still wants “to hit some of the other objectives first” regarding the R35 – specifically in terms of adding creature comforts, including a premium leather interior and high-end sound system – before moving on to developing a successor.“I want to make the GT-R more premiere.

2015-12-29,1995 VW Jetta up for auction,"The entire  is iconic as it put the spotlight (for better or for worse) on both Japanese tuner and American muscle car cultures, but did you realise that the original 2001 movie had a German sedan in it? That’s the car you see here, a 1995 Volkswagen Jetta, and it’s now up for auction at the Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale 2016 auction.Don’t remember seeing this particular piece of Teutonic rolling art in the film? That’s because it was only featured in one scene, in which a minor member of Dominic Toretto’s (Vin Diesel) crew, Jesse (Chad Lindberg), loses the only race the car is ever featured in, and the Jetta disappears for the rest of the movie.Not a particularly stellar CV then, but it gets better – this particular unit is owned by none other than Frankie Muniz (of  fame!), who bought it in 2002 when he was just 16. Whatever you think about the man or the car, it takes some dedication to stay with the Jetta for 14 years.There are some tricks up the car’s sleeve – it features the signatures of the late Paul Walker himself, Lindberg and director Rob Cohen, and hides a PlayStation 2 hooked up to a custom stereo. Unfortunately, there’s little show to match the go, as it’s powered by a mostly stock 2.0 litre four-cylinder engine, mated to a four-speed automatic transmission.It’s unlikely that the Jetta will ever rake in anything like the US$185,000 (RM794,500) that  (yes,  orange Supra) fetched recently, but if you’ve always wanted to have a shot at owning a piece of proper movie memorabilia (and one autographed by Walker at that), now’s the time.",Jonathan Lee
2015-12-29,VIDEO: Porsche Carrera Cup Asia Putrajaya flash mob,"Many of us are familiar with the flash mob, where a group of people suddenly assemble in a public place and perform an act before quickly dispersing. Just search up the term on YouTube, and you’ll see what we mean. However, Porsche put a twist on the flash mob, and it involves something a whole lot more exciting.See, the German marque currently runs a one-make racing series known as the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia. From September 4-6, round nine and 10 of the racing series was held at the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. In an effort to “get closer to their fans”, the racing series decided to organise a flash mob on the streets of Putrajaya after the race, and it certainly was a spectacle to behold for the surprised pedestrians, some rushing out of their offices to catch a glimpse.For the flash mob, Porsche brought all the action from the race track to the streets with a full racing grid of  Cup (Type 991) racers. The cars were accompanied by not just their pit crews, but grid girls as well. With an impromptu crowd cheering to the sounds of the wonderful flat-six engines revving at the start line, a set starting lights begin the countdown to start the “race”.Unfortunately, the video fades out to the action on the Sepang International Circuit, so we don’t think any actual racing took place on that day. However, the flash mob itself is pretty amazing to watch just for the sight of a fleet of  racers on the streets of Putrajaya. Certainly looks ripe for a street circuit, right?",Gerard Lye

A report by  reveals facts and figures that appear to be for the most part, consistent with an .An undisclosed source that took part in an exclusive presentation organised by Bugatti for potential customers provided the details on the upcoming supercar. The main highlight here is of course the engine. It appears the Chiron will adopt an uprated version of the Veyron’s 8.0 litre W16 quad-turbo engine that now features some form of electrification.The engine is said to produce 1,500 hp and 1,500 Nm of torque, good for a 0-100 km/h time of just 2.2 seconds, which is 0.3 seconds quicker than the Veyron. Flat out, the Chiron will hit a claimed top speed of 467 km/h, that would eclipse the current Guinness World Record holder (Veyron Super Sport) as the fastest street-legal production car in the world (currently 430.9 km/h).Production of the Chiron is said to be limited to just 500 units, 50 more than the number of Veyrons made. However, the supercar is said to complete its production life cycle in just five years, with 100 cars made annually until the 500 mark is met. That is half the time it took to produce all 450 units of the Veyron in both hard-top and open-top variants.Pricing-wise, it won’t be cheap as the report claims that the Chiron will start from two million euros (RM9,373,887) before any options are listed.

2015-12-29,Free trade in ASEAN would create 500k jobs – report,"According to an  released by General Motors earlier this month, the removal of non-tariff measures (NTMs) in the automotive industry that prevent free trade within ASEAN would create up to 500,000 new jobs as well as an increase economic output.The study, commissioned by GM and carried out by Oxford Economics, reveals that while import tariffs have progressively fallen, almost 190 additional NTMs were implemented across ASEAN member countries between 2009 and 2013, and these remain a significant impediment to achieving the fundamental aims of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) to establish the free movement of goods across borders.Oxford Economics found that the automotive sector lags behind other sectors in removing NTMs, with over 70% of imports of motor vehicles and auto parts subject to some kind of non-tariff barrier in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.The most common NTMs are technical barriers to trade, followed by quantity control, affecting 25% of the automotive sector. Excise taxes are also often used as an NTM across ASEAN to implicitly or explicitly discriminate against imports.This is accomplished through the application of differential rates or thresholds that favour domestically produced vehicles or via reference to different tax bases (for example, by using CIF prices for imports versus ex-factory prices for domestic producers).Opening trade would support a globally competitive automotive industry in the region and give ASEAN motorists greater choice of vehicles, said GM international vice president of government relations and public policy, Matt Hobbs.“ASEAN motorists are missing out because of non-tariff barriers. NTMs deny them choice because they prevent the majority of imported vehicles from being sold in ASEAN markets at a competitive price, or getting to those markets at all,” he said.He said that with the December 31, 2015 deadline fast approaching for regional economic integration under the AEC and many Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in place within ASEAN as well as between ASEAN and other countries, motorists in the region should be spoiled for choice.“But across many ASEAN countries, automotive industry policy is being used to prevent large-scale imports of vehicles from other ASEAN members and countries outside the region. This also makes it very difficult for new market entrants to industrialise in ASEAN countries,” said Hobbs.He added that while the ASEAN automotive industry has the potential to be globally competitive and access major markets outside the region, it is being held back by not operating as a single market.“Almost four million vehicles were produced in ASEAN in 2014. This is on par with South America, India and South Korea. But it does not act as one market. If it did, ASEAN would have the size, scale and expertise to become a globally competitive automotive manufacturing base that could export to major markets around the world,” Hobbs said.",Anthony Lim
2015-12-29,"Triumph in black for 2015, posts £2.3 million profit","Triumph Motorcycles, based in Hinckley, UK, posted a £2.3 million (RM14.7 million) profit for its financial year ending June 30, 2015, a turn-around from its £8.0 million (RM51.2 million) pre-tax loss the year before.While turnover dropped slighty, from £364.4 million (RM2.3 billion) to £341.3 million (RM2.1 billion), profitability was driven by launch of the new Tiger 800 dual-purpose, and a final hurrah from four special edition Bonnevilles that ushered out Triumph’s era of air-cooled motorcycles.Triumph continued to develop its global presence throughout 2015, expanding current dealer and distributor networks, as well as aggressively moving into markets like India and Brazil.

2015-12-29,SPIED: Hyundai Ioniq hybrid completely undisguised!,"The  won’t be unveiled to the world until January, but our spy photographers have managed to capture the -fighting hybrid/EV completely undisguised on what looks to be a video commercial shoot, revealing the car in full.It’s clear that Hyundai isn’t looking to ape the look of the Prius quite so much with the Ioniq – the front fascia is much more conventional affair, with the brand’s large hexagonal grille leading out to the slim headlights (with C-shaped LED positioning lights) via a black surround. Air inlets sit on either side of the bumper, fitted with discrete LED daytime running lights.The side profile is also distinctly different from its Japanese competitor – in fact, it’s more reminiscent of the , with a more rakish greenhouse and simpler body side surfacing. The window line features L-shaped chrome trim to add some contrast; something that was also apparent in the official teaser render.Moving to the back, the Ioniq gains the split rear windscreen made popular by fastback hybrids like the Prius (as well as the Volt and the  and ), but gets horizontal tail lights rather than the Toyota’s vertical items; they also come with red lenses instead of the clear lenses typical of the class. The rear number plate recess is mounted low down in the bumper, inside a gloss black surround.We’ve already seen  before, showing the hexagonal centre panel (incorporating the air vents and infotainment system), three-spoke flat-bottomed steering wheel and the unique instrument cluster with battery charge readoutsHyundai claims that the Ioniq will be the first car in the world to offer an electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid powertrain in a single body type. It also says that the Ioniq “combines class-leading fuel efficiency with a fun, responsive drive and attractive design, a unique mix not yet achieved by a hybrid vehicle.”Equipped with a fully-electric (EV) powertrain, the Ioniq is powered by a high capacity, ultra-efficient lithium-ion battery. The plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version combines a “fuel-efficient energy” with battery power that is obtained by charging the car via an external power socket. Finally, the hybrid (HEV) utilises the petrol engine and motion of the car to charge the on-board battery.To cater towards the multi-powertrain options, the Ioniq rides on a new platform that is said to be “optimised to deliver responsive handling while remaining efficient in each of its three powertrain configurations.”",Jonathan Lee
2015-12-29,The year that was – a quarter-litre class roundup,"The 250 cc motorcycle segment is hotly contested locally, especially after some of the major manufacturers opened up assembly plants in Thailand. Many riders step up to, or begin with, 250 cc bikes, attracted by the reasonable price-to-performance ratio, easy handling and low weight, as well as license restrictions.Behind only the under-bone () and scooter categories in terms of popularity, the 250 cc segment is well represented in Malaysia, with all the big guys, and several of the small ones, offering at least one quarter-litre class bike in their range.The year that was saw some interesting offerings hit the market, with many bikes following the supermotard/streetfighter styling beloved of younger riders who form much of this market segment. With low hp output, and low-to-the-ground seating, 250 cc motorcycles are firm favourites with many Asian riders.Here is a roundup of what was available in 2015, with some snippets of what may be coming this way in 2016. Due to the large number of model types in this segment, this list is confined to road bikes, which have a lion’s share of the market.The long-awaited Yamaha YZF-R25 was officially launched by Hong Leong Yamaha in February. This DOHC parallel-twin with four valves per puts out 35.5 hp and 22.1 Nm of torque at 10,000 rpm. The compression ratio is 11.6:1, so you’ll have to feed it with the good stuff. Transmission is through a six-speed box and fuelling is via EFI.The Yamaha MT-03 has already been released in Thailand as a 321 cc naked sportsbike, while Indonesia made do with the MT-25, the smaller engined version. No word yet as to when it will officially hit local motorcycle shops, but it is said to be sometime in 2016.The uprated engine pumps out 41 hp with 29.6 Nm of torque. Engine configuration is similar to its racier sibling, the YZF-R25.The Honda CBR250R has been providing sterling service since 2011, with a mid-model update in 2013. Rumours of , the CBR250RR, have been bouncing around, but no official word from Honda if the CBR250R will be replaced in 2016.This 249 cc single features a DOHC four valve engine that is rated at 27 hp with 23.3 Nm of torque. The CBR250R is available three versions – standard at RM19,999, Repsol replica at RM20,999 and Trico with ABS at RM22,999.Kawasaki’s small Ninjas are extremely popular here, in part due to the low price. The fully-faired Ninja 250SL is new for 2015 and is lighter than its 250 counterpartThe Ninja 250, a parallel-twin with eight valves and DOHC, fuelled by EFI, while the Ninja 250SL runs with a thumper. Power is claimed to be 28 hp with 22.6 Nm of torque for the twin, and the single puts out 27.6 hp and 22.6 Nm of torque. The Ninja 250SL retails at RM17,689.Listening to riders, KTM brought in 250 cc versions of the RC and Duke, in response to rider feedback that the 200 was a little too small, and the 390 was out of reach, license and price wise. Outwardly resembling the bigger 390 version, both the RC and Duke share almost identical specifications.The single-cylinder engine is rated at 31.3 hp and 24 Nm of torque. While it might not sound like much, KTM’s tuning of the engine will ensure either bike spends as little time on the front wheel as possible. The RC is tagged at RM18,888 while the bare Duke is priced at RM17,888.Not brought in officially, the Inazuma GW250Z harks back to Suzuki’s Bandit and GS-series big bikes. Designed as an entry-level, do-anything bike, the Inazuma is targetted at the rider who wants a no-fuss daily bike.The engine is a parallel-twin fed by EFI, and power is directed through a six-speed gearbox. No official word on power or torque figures, but somewhere around 30 hp and 20 Nm torque would be about right. It is rumoured that Suzuki will be releasing an all-new GSX-R250 in 2016.",Mohan K Ramanujam

As mentioned in our initial report, , and the specs and equipment levels of the production versions follow that detailed back in August.The baseline version is the 1.5L S, which is only available with a six-speed manual transmission, while the midline 1.5L E comes with manual or CVT gearbox options. Finally, there’s the high-spec 1.5L Prestige, which is only available with a CVT.All variants are powered by the same engine, a 1.5 litre SOHC i-VTEC four-banger as seen on the City sedan and Jazz hatchback, with output numbers being 120 PS at 6,600 pm and 145 Nm at 4,600 rpm.To recap, all the grade variants will ride on 16-inch alloys and 195/60 series tyres as standard, though the top-of-the-line Prestige features a different five-spoke design (it’s the car in green here in the pix). General equipment across the range includes projector headlamps, fog lamps, powered side mirrors and double blower air-conditioning. The second-row seats get a one-touch tumble feature, while the third row seats are 50:50 fold-down units.Standard safety equipment consists of dual airbags, ABS and EBD as well as Isofix mounting points. On the base S, the audio system is made up of a double-DIN head unit, while the E and Prestige variants get an audio system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen display. The S also omits audio switches on the steering wheel.Additional kit for the E includes LED position lamps and a multi-information display, as well as chrome-finished door handles and side protectors. The Prestige features all this, and adds on VSA, hill-start assist and an aerokit as well as a nanoe ioniser.Indonesian pricing for the BR-V – which will be available in six exterior colours in the republic – starts from 226.5 million rupiah for the BR-V Grade S. The Grade E manual goes for 236.5 million rupiah, while the CVT version is 10 million rupiah more at 246.5 million.

It is reported the photos were taken during a presentation to Suzuki’s decision makers ahead of the Tokyo motor show in October, showing engine options and concept design for the bike.Rumour has it the new Hayabusa has been green-lighted and will undergo chassis and ride testing soon before a mid-2016 release. This is unusual since under normal circumstances, such a production decision would only be made six months after testing before being launched.Perhaps this is Suzuki’s late-to-the-party challenge to Kawasaki’s H2R, which has taken the motorcycle top-speed crown away from Suzuki. Kawasaki’s H2R has a top speed of 357 km/h, and is not road-legal. The road-going H2 is reported to be speed-limited to 300 km/h, as is the current-model Hayabusa.",Mohan K Ramanujam

2015-12-29,Daihatsu Copen goes Coupe and Shooting Brake route,"The  interpreted as a coupe or shooting brake, anyone? That’s the premise of two of the concepts the Japanese automaker is bringing to the 2016 Tokyo Auto Salon, the JDM roadster being given the fixed top treatment to become the Cerro Coupe and Robe Shooting Brake. The duo will be joined by four other concepts for the show.The coupe looks quite the trick, the hatched version possibly needing a bit more eye time to catch on for most – the big question is of course if they’ll make it to series build; the coupe would be an interestig prospect. Still, the studies are neat variations for the second-gen LA400K, which made its debut in mid-2014 in Japan following its initial appearance as the  concept at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show.First to arrive in the market was the Copen Robe variant – which forms the basis for the shooting brake study – before a more rugged, off-road inspired XPlay joined in late-2014. There’s a third bodystyle called the , which was introduced in June this year. The Copen features a 660 cc turbocharged three-cylinder KF engine, paired with either a five-speed manual or a CVT gearbox, and its 64 PS and 92 Nm output numbers are defined by the country’s kei-car limitations.Daihatsu will also be showing a third Copen study called the Adventure, which is only teased via a simple sketch – plenty of cladding on show in the outdoorsy, X-styled take on the car. Other TAS exhibits from the automaker include a rugged Activa version of the Cast, which premiered earlier this year.",Anthony Lim

2015-12-29,"Taxi company calls for higher fares for Uber, Grabcar","A taxi service operator has proposed that the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) and government set a higher fare for ride-sharing and taxi booking (via mobile app) services. In reports by  and , Big Blue Taxi Services founder and advisor Datuk Shamsubahrin Ismail said that this move should be put in place first before they are allowed to operate legally.“A fare hike is apt (for Uber and Grabcar services) as these operators practise ride-sharing compared to the budget taxis which impose fare on one passenger at a time,” he said. Shamsubahrin also welcomed the  for ride-sharing services like Uber and GrabCar. However, he is not convinced that the resulting solution will be effective.“I want to ask the government now, how do you want to regulate (Uber, Grabcar, etc.) in terms of the rate? Because if the rate is much, much cheaper than budget taxis which starts at RM4 and RM2, it means that the government and the ministry themselves are killing the industry,” he said.Shamsubahrin also suggested that these online app-based taxi services be registered under the limousine permit instead of the hire-and-drive ones employed by taxi drivers. “What permit do you want to give them? Is it hire and drive or limousine? It cannot be the same permit like a budget taxi…if that is so, the taxi industry will become worse,” he stated.“If they are regulated well and imposed a higher rate, then I welcome them and none of the taxi services should be complaining. The rates must be higher and they must be registered as limousines. If you want to do sharing, it’s your problem, but it must be above the taxis,” he added.Shamsubahrin also confirmed that he has submitted an application seeking for an  that includes areas designated for taxis only. “One of the conditions fixed by property owners such as shopping malls, who engage us to pick up customers is that we have to ensure that all our vehicles must be Puspakom certified, have valid road tax and permits approved by the government as well as insurance with comprehensive liability coverage and that the cars must be in good condition. “If it’s a metered taxi, then the rate must be displayed clearly and not tampered,” he said, adding that private hire companies do not possess proper insurance coverage nor permits for commercial purpose. However, Shamsubahrin said that he has no reservations about Uber and GrabCar divers operating in the same area as normal taxi drivers, but insists that they must prove their legality.Do you agree that ride-sharing (Uber, GrabCar) and taxi booking (via mobile app) services should be charged higher rates?

We’ve seen the JDM kei car earlier while we were at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show, but now, the car goes officially on sale in Japan.Under the hood, the Alto Works packs a 660 cc turbocharged three-cylinder R06A engine, paired to either a five-speed short-throw manual or automatic gearbox. Drive is directed to the front wheels as standard, but for a little extra, a full-time all-wheel drive system can be specified as well for both transmission options.The pint-sized engine manages to output just 64 PS at 6,000 rpm and 100 Nm at 3,000 rpm, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but as we’ve seen in the , you don’t need a lot of power to have fun behind the wheel. It also helps that the powerplant only needs to propel at max, 740 kg of car (670 kg minimum). To beef up its sporty performance, the Alto Works gets an upgrade to its suspension setup from KYB. The front suspension system are MacPherson struts, while the rear is dependent on transmission choice. The 2WD gets a torsion beam type whereas the 4WD model gets a isolated trailing link type setup instead.On the aesthetics front, 15-inch alloy wheels (with 165/55R15 tyres) are fitted here, along with a body kit. Other visual treats include the front brake calipers that are finished in red, chrome headlight bezels and badging The Works theme continues inside with Recaro front seats, red interior accents, steel pedals set and other minor tweaks.The Alto Works continues to impress with its safety suite as well with ABS (with EBD and BA), ESP, Isofix and dual front airbags (driver and passenger). The car is also available with a front collision avoidance system and a false start suppression system that detects front obstacles and prevents unintended sudden acceleration.What do you think of this little pocket rocket? It may not be as visually arresting as the other hot kei car, the Honda S660, but it certainly has its own boxy charms. Interested? Unfortunately, it remains a JDM model for now, with prices starting at 1,509,840 yen (RM53,802) for the manual 2WD model and up to 1,617,840 yen (RM57,650) for the automatic 4WD model.",Gerard Lye
2015-12-28,Motoair Airbag One gives bikers more torso protection,"Motorcycling is an inherently dangerous activity, but riders accept and manage the risk. A new item for their safety arsenal is the Motoair Airbag One inflatable vest.Designed to be worn with normal riding gear, the Airbag One is activated when the rider comes off the motorcycle and disconnects a safety tether. This triggers the discharge of a 28-gramme CO2 cartridge that inflates an air bladder.The air bladder covers the neck, shoulders, torso and spine. MotoAir claims the bladder will inflate in 0.2 seconds. While this isn’t fast as airbag inflation speeds go – Alpinestars and Dainese have airbag jackets that inflate in milliseconds – at slower speeds it might be enough to save the rider from more serious injury.The Motoair Airbag One is available in Hi-vis, black or camo, and comes with YKK zippers for durability. Certain models have removable inner linings. It is ISO9001 certified, TUV, SGS and CE approved.At an online price of 220 pounds (RM1,400) the Airbag One isn’t cheap, but it isn’t expensive either, as far proper safety gear goes. The only drawback is if the rider forgets to disconnect the tether when dismounting the motorcycle, or stands up in the saddle while riding. Unintentional inflation can be dangerous, and could cause an accident.",Mohan K Ramanujam

The company is the only licensed and factory-authorised builder of Shelby Mustang continuation cars. The Oklahoma-based coach builder is offering a twin-turbo 3.5 litre V6 EcoBoost in the said models worldwide, while a 2.0 litre turbocharged four-put EcoBoost engine will be offered in China. The all-aluminium V6 mill is a similar unit that can be found in the , except that this one produces a total of 365 hp and 570 Nm of torque.According to CR, the combination of a flat torque curve, light weight and modern suspension “will make this one of the best handling muscle cars ever made.” In addition to that, CR says that the engine can be tuned and fitted with larger turbos to give the pony cars over 600 hp. As for the 2.0 litre turbocharged EcoBoost, it is derived from the . While it may be the same mill, it’s lighter and produces more power as the ECU has been tweaked for premium fuel. This allows for the 2.0 litre engine to produce a total of 300 hp/488 Nm of torque over 250 hp/360 Nm in its original state-of-tune.The smaller engine option is being offered for the Chinese market as imported vehicles with larger displacement engines are subjected to hefty taxes.

This includes the 2.5 litre variable geometry turbo engine that provides 178 PS and 400 Nm at 2,000 rpm, coupled to a five-speed automatic gearbox and an all-wheel drive system. What makes the Phantom Edition different from the standard truck is the addition of various design details.At the front, the Triton Phantom Edition gains a large “Phantom” decal wording just above the blacked-out front grille. A larger silver trim piece located just beneath said grille forms part of a bull bar that links the HID projector headlamps with LED daytime running lights.Along the sides, the Phantom Edition sports the same design multi-spoke 17-inch wheels.

2015-12-29,2016 Land Rover Discovery to launch late next year,"The 2016 Land Rover Discovery will be launched late next year, according to Land Rover’s design director Gerry McGovern. The Discovery will enter its fifth generation, the seven-seater SUV carrying on a tradition that began in 1989.According to , Land Rover is looking to carve a niche in the expanding SUV market, which is expected to see sales of 20 million units world-wide in 2016. The new Discovery has a bonded and riveted aluminium monocoque in common with the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport and all three models will be built in Land Rover’s Solihull facility.The bonded monocoque is expected to realise substantial savings over the outgoing model’s 2,622 kg weight. The 2016 Discovery will feature a lower, sleeker design based on the Discovery Vision Concept unveiled at the Beijing motor show in 2014. McGovern said the concept was “very important in terms of being a benchmark for new-generation Discovery models: the versatility of the car, the seats, the reconfigurability, how you use it inside.”The new Discovery is also destined to receive a revised version of the current Discovery’s 3.0-litre V6 turbodiesel. There have been no reports of the SUV receiving hybrid or electric power, as Land Rover feels more development is required before such technology enters the Discovery production line.According to McGovern, the new Discovery would approach the Range Rover in terms of luxury and fitment. “There will be a premium execution in Discovery, more Range Rover-like. But we need to not get confused and get the balance right,” he said.There would also be no compromise to the Discovery’s legendary off-road capability, said McGovern. “We won’t back off from that capability, but it has to be appropriate and relevant,” he said. “We need to be about more than that. It’s a killer combination: core engineering technology and truly desirable and bespoke design with our own twist,” he emphasised.",Mohan K Ramanujam

The sharp cues are achieved through a full-piece TechArt Magnum front apron, a front splitter and a carbon-fibre bonnet that comes with two air-outlets. The Cayenne also receives a redesigned grille and LED lights to achieve that intimidating appearance.While it looks subtle from the side even with the skirts on, the same can’t be said about the rear. In the back, cosmetic enhancements include a roof-mounted and rear-door spoiler, alongside a diffuser that allows for the quad-exhausts to be seen quite clearly.Those large 22-inch Formula rims also play their part in giving the kitted-up Cayenne its wild appearance, while those yellow brake calipers certainly match the Cayenne’s black colour scheme. It’s not all cosmetic enhancements at that – as the Cayenne can be boosted to 80 hp or 180 hp by TechArt.In the Cayenne Turbo, the customised 4.8 litre twin-turbo V8 allows the SUV to have power delivered in two stages. During normal operation, a total of 640 hp is available, while pushing the Sport button, will see it receive 700 hp between 5,400 and 6,400 rpm, while total torque is rated at 920 Nm. As a reference, the standard Cayenne Turbo delivers 520 hp and 750 Nm of torque.",Graham Chin
2015-12-28,"KL-Singapore HSR will not stop in Putrajaya – new train to get dedicated track, not shared with ERL","The upcoming Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) project will not include a stop at Putrajaya, according to MyHSR Corp. This would mean that the next HSR stop after Kuala Lumpur would be the Seremban . The company’s chief executive Mohd Nur Ismal Mohamed Kamal told  that the HSR was supposed to share part of the Express Rail Link’s (ERL) track.“Using the ERL track for HSR, it becomes natural for Putrajaya to be in (the alignment). But after looking at certain feedback from technical experts, the Government decided to go for a dedicated HSR line,” he said. The more complex agreement and a potential safety risk involved with the project will mean that the HSR will not share the ERL’s track.HSR trains are expected to travel at faster speed (300 km/h) than ERL coaches (160 km/h top speed), and as such, the ERL line would require extensive modifications.  will also be required to pay ERL Sdn Bhd for using the track, and both train services will need to be coordinated for using the same track.Mohd Nur added that although track-sharing with HSR trains was common in European countries, there was a risk of accidents occurring as well. This was one of the reasons why the HSR will have its dedicated line. The move would mean shorter travel times for commuters travelling between Kuala Lumpur and Seremban, he added.Putrajaya commuters could still connect with the HSR at Bandar Malaysia, which replaces the current Royal Malaysian Air Force base in Sungai Besi. “The ERL track runs alongside Bandar Malaysia. Once we have this (HSR) service, we will talk to the Government to introduce a Bandar Malaysia stop for ERL,” he said. This will imply a connection between the HSR and ERL at Bandar Malaysia.",Gerard Lye
2015-12-28,KLIA/KLIA2 passengers will subsidise ERL fare hikes,"According a report by , the impending fare hike for the KLIA Express and KLIA Transit rail services will be subsidised by KLIA/KLIA2 passengers. Earlier in the month, Express Rail Link (ERL), the operator of the rail services, announced that its fares will be increased for the first time since it began operations 14 years ago as a means to keep the .An officer told , “the sad thing is that even people not using the ERL are subsidising its operations and the operator feels that it is justified in increasing the fare from .” He agreed that the operator had the right to raise the fare under the concession agreement it had signed with the government.The officer pointed out that every passenger coming through both airports, whether domestic or international, contributes to the ERL’s treasury. “Whether or not a passenger to KLIA or KLIA2 uses the ERL service they still pay airport taxes from which RM6 (international) and RM3 (domestic) goes directly to ERL,” he said, adding that these passengers were obliged to do so.He added that on a daily average, 10,000 people travel to KLIA and KLIA2. This allows ERL to collect an estimated RM350,000 daily, translating to a yearly collection of RM128 million. The fare revision without the “subsidies” from KLIA/KLIA2 passengers would have seen commuters on the KLIA Express pay RM64 instead of the “discounted” rate of RM55.The ERL project was implemented at the cost of RM2.4 billion, and the company has been suffering losses over the years, accumulating to RM671.7 million, it said, adding that ERL had invested in new systems and train sets which would be progressively delivered, starting next May.In an earlier announcement, ERL stated that a  will be offered to 1Malaysia Students Discount Card (KADS1M) holders, the disabled and senior citizens. Discounts will also be available to customers who purchase tickets online, at the ERL kiosks as well as with selected credit cards.",Gerard Lye

2015-12-28,VIDEO: Ride on the wild side with Ducati’s Multistrada,"Ducati has released a web series called “The wild side of Ducati”, featuring the new Multistrada 1200 Enduro. Covering six episodes, the series is available on Ducati’s website, and highlights the capabilities and features of the Multistrada.Each three-minute episode follows Multistrada 1200 Enduro riders across various types of terrain, showcasing the global touring capability of the bike. Released every two weeks, the videos also explains the rider aids and other electronics built into the bike that help it tackle rugged terrain.The first episode puts the Enduro on a motocross track in southern Italy, as well as riding across Tuscany, Sardinia and Spain. The bike features Ducati’s liquid-cooled Testastretta V-twin with variable valve timing.  The Desmodromic cylinder heads have four-valves per cylinder and twin-spark ignition.Displacing 1198 cc, the engine’s power output is a claimed 160 hp with 136 Nm torque at 7,500 rpm. Bosch EFI takes care of fuelling with a fly-by-wire system linked to twin 56 mm throttle bodies.Final drive is chain, with power fed through a six-speed gearbox with a wet, multi-plate hydraulic clutch. The Sachs upside-down 48 mm diameter forks feature electronic compression and rebound adjustment, and Ducati’s Skyhook Suspension (DSS) system controls fork movement. The rear is suspended on a fully-adjustable Sachs unit, again with DSS, and full electronic control. Braking is with a pair of 320 mm floating discs in front, matched to Brembo Monobloc four-piston calipers, and the rear has a 265 mm disc and two-piston floating caliper. Cornering ABS is standard on the Multistrada 1200 Enduro.A new 19-inch front wheel with wire spokes, in keeping with the “Enduro” image, is unique to this bike, along with a 30-litre fuel tank. Seat height is 870 mm, and an optional seat is available which gives 890 to 850 mm of height adjustability.The Multistrada 1200 Enduro is expected to arrive in Malaysia in February or March 2016, and is estimated to retail between RM140,000 and RM150,000.

It has already been confirmed that MBM is looking to bring in the , GLE Coupe and  next year, so it seems they may all be making it to our shores at the same time.The timing makes sense – although both the GLE and GLE Coupe were unveiled to the world some time before the GLC (GLE Coupe in December last year, GLE in May, GLC in June), MBM would quite rightly want to bring the GLC’s launch forward.It’s Mercedes-Benz’ first proper foray into the compact SUV class, after all – the previous  was left-hand drive only and thus not sold here.

Other features include the new Evasive Steering Assist, Distance Pilot Distronic with Speed Limit Pilot and Active Lane Keeping Assist, as well as an uprated Pre-Safe system – the latter now protects your ears in a crash, and pushes you closer to the centre of the car to provide more survival space in the event of a side impact.",Jonathan Lee
2015-12-24,"Revise fuel prices every week instead of monthly, urges the Malaysian Petrol Dealers Association","By now Malaysian motorists would be used to expecting , under the  first introduced a year ago. If the Malaysian Petrol Dealers Association gets its way, however, revisions would be done weekly instead of monthly. The association has urged the Malaysian government to revise fuel prices on a weekly basis, as the current monthly system could cause them to incur heavy losses. As it is, the system has severely affected the volume of fuel supply to petrol dealers, the association has complained to Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Johari Abdul Ghani.“A lot of oil companies now use this opportunity by sending the petrol dealers oil supplies in large volume at the end of each month if they expect the price to fall the following month,” he said today. “If the fuel is expected to increase in the next month, they will then reduce the supply,” the Deputy Finance Minister further explained, according to . Johari went on to claim that if the matter is not managed properly, more than 3,200 petrol dealers would be open of losses of up to 70%. In essence, the current system allows oil companies to adjust the supply distribution to their benefit (based on forecasts of oil prices), which may compromise the petrol dealers. To solve this issue, the Petrol Dealers Association has suggested that fuel prices be revised every week, with a maximum price difference of 5 sen, so that the price change would not be “too noticeable” for motorists. “This will benefit the consumers, the petrol dealers and the oil companies regardless of what the market price is,” Johari concluded. What do you think of this, folks – would you be open to weekly fuel price revisions? Let your thoughts be heard below.",Hafriz Shah
2015-12-26,DRIVEN: Mitsubishi Triton through Sabah and Sarawak,"The Mitsubishi Triton no longer needs a lengthy introduction. Its undoubtedly-unique bulbous front fascia and curves gives the phrase “an acquired taste” a new lease of life.  However, looking past all that to see it for the vehicle it is meant to be, would require some quality time spent. Hence the reason why we drove it up to a little hot spring resort situated across the South China Sea.If there ever was a place to really put a truck to work to test out its capabilities, it would have to be on a vast piece of land with lush, green surroundings, blue skies (without the haze) and a lot of rough and demanding terrain. One would agree that there’s no better place to do that than the largest state in Malaysia – Sarawak.Recently, Mitsubishi Motors Malaysia (MMM) invited us for an adventure that could showcase the urban workhorse, doing what it was meant to do in its natural habitat. Landing in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah on an early Thursday morning, we made way towards Lawas over in Sarawak. There, I was once again greeted by the same fleet of trucks that I had used to travel from Selangor to Penang . As the sun rose early the next morning, I started out with the high-spec Triton VGT Adventure – smiling away as this was and still is my favourite variant, with all the added goodies and items that impressed me during my drive back from Penang.It has to be noted that the roads in Sarawak are not exactly paved for comfort. Even before this, I actually pondered as to how the Triton would ride here in the East. Now, the second-generation Triton is said to feature optimised suspension tuning, while the rear leaf spring has been extended – said to contribute to ride comfort. But is all that worth a mention?While I felt that the Triton rode quite comfortably on West Malaysian roads, the same can almost be said on East Malaysian tarmac, despite its irregular characteristics. Heading to entry point of our off-road route, we needed to travel on a stretch of about 10-km worth of Lawas roads. During that time, there wasn’t all that much jiggle. However this time round, I noticed that the Triton was a tad stiff in terms of the ride – not overly so, just a little. Of course, what needs to be mentioned again is that 2.5 litre turbodiesel mill’s loud roar. It can really get to you over long journeys. Thankfully, the event organisers provided us with some tunes, which could be played via the USB port, drowning out all that burbling.However, boring ol’ tarmac wasn’t really the main objective of this drive, not today at least. As we approached the entrance of the adventure route, we were briefed earlier that it is in fact a timber trail – a common playground for off-roaders. One that has its own set of rules that need to be abided by very strictly, or the result could be disastrous and unwelcoming at that.For those who aren’t familiar with logging tracks, let me explain as to how it works. It is marked with left and right arrows and it’s unlike normal roads, where you keep to the left lane at all times. A left arrow means that your vehicle is required to stay on the left for the entire length of the stretch. When you see a right arrow, you are to switch from the left and stay on the right instead. But why can’t we just stick to left lane like normal road users do? The system is actually well planned out – for logging trucks. Remember, these tracks are not actual roads – a forest used to be here not too long ago, which means that the terrain can flow steeply uphill or downhill through various gradients, with a ravine that can drop sharply by some 40-feet, by the side. Another reason is that while light vehicles (pick-up trucks included) do traverse these trails from time-to-time, the trails are dedicated to these logging trucks, which have priority here. The arrows play their role in directing vehicles going into the trail to take the “softer” side, so that laden logging trucks going in the opposite direction take the “firmer” side, or the safer side – bear in mind that logs (laden trucks) only travel outwards and almost never into the track.In the event of an emergency, laden logging trucks (that take the firmer lane) can come to a halt by shifting their weight and using the side wall of a hill as an emergency brake if needed. Remember, that laden trucks are extremely heavy, as they can carry up to six or seven (or more) colossal, century-old logs at a time. For that very reason, when threading mountainous terrain, the softer side can crumble due to all that mass.Apart from that, overtaking will certainly be common, especially if you’ve got slow logging trucks carrying a load full of wood. However, one must take extra caution when considering to make a pass. The reason being that since the roads are uneven, overtaking a long timber truck at speeds of 100 km/h isn’t quite possible, or a smart thing to do for that matter, as a slower truck, tractor or road vehicle might be on the opposite lane.As our convoy gathered at the starting point, I gave way to my co-driver who was quite eager to be at the wheel for the first part of the journey. This gave me an opportunity to take the back seat and truly feel how the Triton’s rear would manage bumpy terrain. As stated before, the Triton’s rear space is quite spacious (though less so than the latest Ranger and Navara), while the seats provide quite a sufficient slant, complemented by an armrest in the middle. The only thing that it lacks are rear air vents, which can be deemed as a necessity in our climate.Getting on with it, we proceeded to the start of our off-road journey. The track was riddled with little stones and pebbles, with some as sharp as nails. In addition to that, at certain parts, there were little mounts, while deep ruts were certainly abundant. According to our off-road instructor, vehicles have been wrecked before just going through them. For this journey, we were wearing standard all-terrain tyres, which managed pretty well as the terrain was dry throughout.Back to the bounciness in the rear of the Triton. Oh dear me, bouncy is but just an understatement, which wasn’t so apparent on tarmac. It didn’t help that at certain times, when we met with random elevated humps on the track, going at speeds of up to 50 km/h, the back would just heave up. This happens usually if you’re lugging about with an empty tray behind. That said, there was little rattle from it, despite all the turbulence.Making up for that bumpiness are the leather seats, which are decently comfy. But again, I reiterate, the lack of rear vents really make sitting in the back a little bit of a pain. The circulation supplied from the front air vents took quite a while to bring down the temperature behind. Now hear, hear, although I may rant about the bouncy experience, I have yet to meet a pick-up truck with a rear that doesn’t bounce off-road. That said, if you do know of one, do let me know below! About an hour and a half later, we arrived our first stop at a little family village called Long Lidong, where we would catch (and release) a large local river fish called “semah” and enjoy the breathtaking view of an untouched valley. After getting an hour of rest, we got on with the journey. This time, I took the wheel as we set on straight towards our final destination point. I was traversing in 4L and cruising at around speeds of 50-60 km/h with the rpm needle hovering in the range of 2,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm. Manoeuvring through the stone-filled path required a lot of attention, but that wasn’t as challenging as what was to come. Progressing through the course, at certain stretches, the road was dry as no rain had fallen. In these parts, despite all four wheels providing grip, it was still slippery due to the smooth surface of the ground. Picking up the pace, where we needed to curve to a small degree, and I could even feel the truck slide a little, despite the balance of traction. At one part, as we were traveling in a convoy, we kicked up a lot of dust due to the bone dry earth, making visibility next to zero. The only indicator that we could use to move forward carefully (so we wouldn’t fall off the route) were the taillights of the car in front. I would be lying if I said it wasn’t a little bit tense. However, it’s situations such as this one that allow a man and his truck to bond, to gain its trust, to know its true capabilities, and so far the Triton had performed to expectations.While some may wonder what use there is for paddle shifters in a pick-up truck, we actually did put them to work in the last leg of our journey. Cutting away from the timber trail, we turned right onto a random patch of road. As we entered, a beautiful valley could be seen on the left. There, we stopped and alighted from our trucks to take the view in, along with the freshness of the air. While we took a breather, we were welcomed by our host Tommy, who told us that our destination point was another 15 minutes away. So setting off into the final leg of the journey, where we had to cross through another track that sloped and snaked throughout. It was here, that I found the paddle shifters handy. Especially during those steep slopes downwards, where we needed to engage lower gears frequently. Rather than having to use the gear shift (one still has to in the Triton VGT), my hands did not need to let go of the steering to do so. The shifts were quite instantaneous as well, so no annoying waits with each pull of the paddle. After much first, second and third gear play, we eventually arrived at Merarap hot spring resort, a gem hidden deep within the rainforest of Sarawak. As the night matured, we called it a day, retiring to our chalets to get some much needed rest – we needed to drive over more than 200 km back to Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, the next day.After a snoring bout between me and another roommate took place that night (yours truly won), dawn broke soon enough. We were on a tight schedule as we needed to leave the resort by 7.45am to make our way back to Lawas and subsequently to Kota Kinabalu. On the third day, I was handed the Triton VGT with a five-speed manual transmission.Now, as stated before, the manual transmission felt quite rough. For the entire drive, the clutch gave my left foot a good massage. It vibrated quite noticeably as you lift your foot off a little bit. In addition to that, changing gears required a good amount of strength to pull off. However, the responsiveness of the engine can be better felt here. That’s certainly not a bad thing indeed. Returning to Lawas and after a quick lunch, we switched vehicles once again. I got back into the Triton VGT Adventure for the trip back to KK – the perfect companion for long-distance driving. Moving along, after about a distance of some 20 kilometres, we soon reached a ferry that would bring us across the Lawas river. Upon crossing, we headed onwards. At this juncture, the skies were turning rather gloomy – a storm was brewing. The downpour started with a light drizzle, followed by thunder and extremely heavy rain. As the Triton lacked an active stability control system, it would be smart to take it slow especially on rural roads. It was also best to engage 4H as the next best alternative, in this case.As I had more than an hour more to spare, I stopped to look at the other trucks that shared the road with us. Already it was apparent that the sheer number of pick-ups that I saw along the way were Toyotas, old and new. Back in the old days, the Hilux was truly a common sight, so much so, that it has replaced the term “pick-up truck” in parts of East Malaysia. Some folks here (or most) label a pick-up truck as a “Hilux.”It’s a given that this is one of those complex equations that MMM is trying to solve, and it’s not the only brand (with a pick-up in its range) that is looking to break through that wall. While I feel that the additional items inside the cabin and the price of the Triton is a good start, maybe this could be resolved by adding in a little bit more safety bits – Like offering more than two airbags and a electronic stability programme as standard.Getting back towards the drive, the rain was unrelenting, and hellishly violent at that. In the Triton VGT Adventure, while those headlights react quickly to dimming light, the same cannot be said of the automatic wipers. I’ve had issues with them before, and while I wasn’t expecting that they would trouble me this time round, they still did. It wasn’t until the later part of the journey, when the downpour eased, that the auto wipers actually worked as they should.After the rain left us, we had arrived KK just in the nick of time before the sun set to make way for night. Cruising through town, the suspension still held up firmly despite all the rough driving in Lawas. Trying to find fault in whether there would be squeaks or strange sounds coming from the suspension left me disappointed. That the same trucks have been on rough terrain in both Peninsular and now East Malaysia pretty much sums up their durability.It was a good drive overall. While East Malaysia may be pick-up truck haven, it’s still unsure as to whether the Mitsubishi Triton will be able to top the Toyota Hilux or even some of its newer, more powerful contenders for that matter. But what I do know, is that the brand is really doing its best to ensure that some things can change. So we’ll just have to wait and see how that pans out.But it has to be said that the second-generation Triton, while not exactly the prettiest among the range of modern-day trucks, and not the most powerful now, is still a well-packaged and decently priced pick-up. If you just want a workhorse that has all the niceties of an SUV – without going overboard – then the Triton will be right up your alley.",Graham Chin
2015-12-24,"DRIVEN: Lexus IS 200t Turbo – downsized, at a price","It’s a rare sight. The , but is still very much a novelty in these parts due to a combination of factors. Launched locally in June 2013, the IS came in as a high cost Japanese CBU import with a 2.5 litre naturally-aspirated V6 engine, attracting high road tax. Its task against the German heavyweights is monumental on an equal footing; encumbered with such price/cost disadvantages, the Lexus never stood a chance.Ever since , the IS has been crying out for a downsized turbo engine to at least have both hands in the fight. They took awhile, but Lexus finally has one, and the blown 2.0L has in a short period gone into the whole range – , , ,  and . Is the IS finally in with a shout? Replacing , the IS 200t is powered by the 8AR-FTS 2.0 litre turbocharged engine also found locally in the NX and RX SUVs. The in-house designed twin-scroll turbo engine with Dual VVT-iW (Variable Valve Timing-intelligent Wide) pushes out 241 hp at 5,800 rpm and 350 Nm from 1,650 to 4,400 rpm here, six horses more than in the 200t NX and RX, although the SUVs produce peak power from 4,800 to 5,600 rpm. The figures are healthy, and are good for a 0-100 km/h time of seven seconds flat and a top speed of 230 km/h. Unlike the six-speed auto NX/RX, an eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission sends drive to the rear axle here, as in the . RWD is of course a class norm that only  dares to defy.Speaking of the Germans, the IS 200t does not go up against the 320i and C200 despite the badge similarities. In power terms, and in Malaysia, the 200t is shoulder to shoulder with the  (252 hp, 350 Nm, 5.8 seconds) and the  (211 hp, 350 Nm, 6.6 seconds). The C300 available elsewhere has 248 hp and 370 Nm. Now that they’ve decoupled engine size with variant names, both 330i and C250 are also powered by four-cylinder 2.0 litre turbos despite the bigger ’30’ and ‘250’ designations. Both are significantly faster than the IS 200t F Sport, even the Mercedes with 30 hp less, which could be down to the Lexus’ 1,620 kg kerb weight and tuning (330i 1,545 kg, C250 1,480 kg).What’s undoubted is the IS 200t’s higher level of performance compared to the old 2.5 litre naturally-aspirated V6. With 205 hp at 6,400 rpm and 252 Nm at 4,800 rpm, the IS 250 did the benchmark sprint in 8.1 seconds and a top whack of 225 km/h – for RM500 more in annual road tax. The gulf between 2.0T and 2.5 V6 is even bigger in practice, as we found out over a weekend.The IS has looked sharp since the second generation, but the IS 250’s V6 drivetrain never quite lived up to expectations that the sporting looks promised. It was smooth revving, but one had to work hard to squeeze out the juice. I personally like NAs, but effortless performance counts for a lot in this class. Five minutes in the IS 200t is all one needs to banish the memory of the IS 250’s delivery – this thing builds up speed very fast, and the turbo effect is pronounced. The fact that my bum was a lot closer to the ground could be a factor, but the IS feels more rapid than . It’s very smooth revving and refined too, certainly more cultured than BMW’s direct-injection turbo units in the 3 Series.Similarly quick and smooth are the gearchanges, but the transmission is culpable for the partnership’s less than perfect response. There’s noticeable lag during take off, and when coming back on the throttle. The hesitance isn’t a big issue when you’re driving fast in a progressive manner, but can be annoying during quick overtaking moves or when driving spiritedly. A trait also detected in the NX, it’s a blot on the copybook of an otherwise decent powertrain showing. The ride comfort was a pleasant surprise, more so with this F Sport variant’s gorgeous 18-inch alloys with 225/40 tyres in front and 255/35 rubber at the back. I feared the worse driving around Petaling Jaya (does the MBPJ mayor commute via chopper?) but the low profile-tyred IS soaked up the blacktop mounds and craters pretty well, and quietly too.  The firm but not uncomfortable adaptive suspension had good control over body movements and roll was well contained. Even the steering is improved over the previous gen IS – tight and safe at high speeds but not too cloying at low speeds, surprisingly hefty with some lock on. The fat Bridgestones (Turanza not Potenza, a curious choice) aren’t the quietest during high speed cruising, though.Despite the dynamic upgrades, the lack of ultimate finesse when pushed is still present – the IS wont’t allow you to feel your way to the limit, and while it’s agile enough, it’s not the most confidence inspiring drive when pushed. The VSC safety net is just a short leash away, something we’ve previously noticed in Lexus cars. Not quite sheer driving pleasure.        It’s no surprise to discover that the IS isn’t the best to drive in its class, turbo engine or not, but that does not mean that it’s without merits. Far from it, because the Lexus is a rather fascinating entry in a safe segment.   For a challenger brand, there’s no point in being a me too, and yours truly is a supporter of the bold design direction taken by Toyota’s luxury brand. Kudos to Lexus for having the balls to go bold; and by sticking to its guns, a signature look has been established. It’s easy to flip-flop your way around design, just ask Mitsubishi and Subaru.  The difference between this IS and its predecessor isn’t as big as that of the  versus the third-gen S190, but that’s because the previous IS was already an athletic-looking sedan. The blend of sharp details and flowing lines seen here, while very Lexus, isn’t as extreme as on the NX and RX. However, befitting its position as the youngest Lexus sedan, the IS appears significantly bolder than the GS. For this writer, it’s the prettiest example of modern Lexus design, amped up by the more aggressive F Sport styling. I love it, but you could hate it – the IS is that polarising.  Likewise the cabin, which like before, offers a cocooning cockpit environment for the driver. The high centre console makes the working area nicely cozy, or annoying tight, depending on your preferences. Slightly more room than before though, if memory serves right. The F Sport specific seats are wonderful – firm and supportive for thighs and torso, but lined with soft leather.Supple cowhide can also be found on all touch-points, and you’ll feel guilty soiling the brand’s typical deep pile carpets. The materials look and feel good, but I’m curious as to why Lexus is not into metal or metal-like trim – the IS’ gear knob and other silver dashboard bits could do with the cold touch.  Everything is solidly put together, but I did encounter one misaligned panel/sharp edge on the driver’s side of the air con control panel. Uncharacteristic and an isolated case, I’m pretty sure.The overall feel from behind the wheel is one part sporty, one part high-tech. Elements that contribute to the latter include touch-drag air con temp strips and the mouse-style Lexus Remote Touch Interface that has been improved from earlier iterations. One can get used to both, but they’re not necessarily the most intuitive forms of control. Despite having a centralised control system, there are still plenty of physical buttons to add to the “cockpit feel” that previous-gen Audis had.  The centrepiece of our F Sport tester is the “LFA-inspired” digital instrument panel, which consists of a central rev meter housing a digital speedo. It’s cool as it is, but the party trick is the physical dial’s ability to slide to the right, revealing a colour multi-info display. The MID’s pages show everything from audio and navi info to gear position and a boost meter with oil pressure/temp gauge. A little gimmicky but cool nonetheless. 
Less attention was paid to the more mundane things. There aren’t enough storage space for oddments, just the two cupholders and door bin in addition to the armrest box, which is difficult to access. No place for coins and keys if the cupholders are used for what they were designed for. As premium compact execs go, the IS is a pretty selfish option. While the exterior dimensions track the F30 3 Series closely (at 4,665 mm by 1,810 mm, the Lexus is as wide as the BMW and 32 mm longer; 2,800 mm wheelbase is 10 mm shy), the cabin packaging doesn’t – the IS’ rear quarters are almost as cosy as the front section.  Rear headroom is at a premium – no room to spare for this 175 cm occupant – and while knee room is adequate, there’s no gap under the front seats for feet to tuck under, creating an uncomfortable position for longer distances. The rear bench is highly sculpted with a high and hard centre section – this, coupled with the high centre tunnel, means the Lexus is effectively a four-seater.While others in the class have grown in size and scope ( and  are on the opposite end of the scale, pushing class boundaries), the Lexus keeps it true to the compact sport sedan template. Positive or negative depends on where you’re coming from, but the IS is probably the least suitable as an occasional family hauler.  Also unsuitable for many will be the price of this Japanese-made saloon. Our top of the range IS 200t F Sport has a sticker price of RM384,900 OTR excluding insurance, and the range starts from RM297,800 for the IS 200t Premium. Sure, it’s packed to the gills with kit, including the above-mentioned F Sport exclusive items plus a 15-speaker Mark Levinson audio system, but one can get a .  Luck is not on Lexus Malaysia’s side. Just when the IS finally receives the downsized turbo engine it needs to compete,  nullifies whatever advantage gained. Already a left-field option, such high prices compared to CKD locally-assembled Germans could render it a non-starter. That will be a shame, because there’s plenty about the IS to marvel over.",Danny Tan
2015-12-27,DRIVEN: Tesla Model S 85 – exclusive first-drive report,"Back in October, we had the chance to get up close with the  via official channels – the  of the vehicles, both rear-wheel drive  versions offered not just a  but also a chance to get an initial feel of the car, albeit in limited scope, given that the cars hadn’t been registered at that point.Last month, through a special arrangement, we were again invited to have another go with the car for a day, the road-going session offering a better insight into its character and workings in real-world conditions.A recap on timelines and perspective, for those still unaware of the unique manner in which Tesla vehicles are set to be deployed in the country. The two S 85s are essentially the lead elements of a programme initiated by Malaysian Green Technology Corporation (GreenTech Malaysia), one that will see .The main bulk of the cars, when they eventually arrive, will be available on a contracted two-year leasing period, and will – as mentioned when the programme was  this year – only be offered to government-linked companies (GLC).The intent of all this is to allow influential parties the means to better understand the merits of electric vehicles (EVs) by sampling the technology for themselves, and is meant to aid  through its .The leasing programme is sanctioned by Tesla Motors, which is not keen to have its cars sold in direct fashion in Malaysia – the automaker is agreeable to the running of the initiative on the understanding that the cars are to be used for increasing awareness of EVs and their tech amongst policy makers.Back in May, GreenTech Malaysia CEO Ahmad Hadri Haris said that under the agreement with Tesla Motors, GreenTech Malaysia cannot sell the cars for a period of two years, but GLCs interested in purchasing the cars will be able do so once the 24-month timeframe has expired, which is also when the leasing agreement period per vehicle comes to an end. Leasing costs bandied back then was said to be in the region of around RM6,000 per month.Originally, GreenTech Malaysia said it planned to bring in 110 cars for the leasing programme, a mix of the S 85 and  all-wheel drive variant, the larger proportion of cars being made up of the latter. The latest is that this number may not be capped at that, depending on demand, and some aspects of the programme itself may be revised, the primary one regarding the possibility of individual customisation of the cars.Next, a rundown of the Malaysian S 85’s specs, as mentioned in our initial report. The base 362 hp variant is equipped with an 85 kWh battery, which offers up to 426 km of travel on a single charge. The S 85 will come with a single 10 kW charger, a mobile connector with a 240 volt outlet as well as a SAE J1772 public charging adaptor as standard.A quick aside on the road tax for the car, which turns out is a staggering RM5 per year. No idea how this rate was achieved, or for that matter the manner of conversion by the JPJ to that (the electric powertrain is apparently the equivalent of a conventional mill with a 5,792 cc displacement). The two cars are specified with Smart Air Suspension, Premium Interior and Lighting, Autopilot Convenience features and even a SubZero Weather Package, the latter an extension brought about by the specification of the optional executive seats, which revises the rear bench to a twin-occupant-only row, on the two cars. The two cars will be the only Malaysian-spec Teslas to feature these exec seats, as the automaker has dropped the option for the model.Additionally, there’s Autopilot Convenience, the package coming with traffic-aware cruise control, lane keeping with automatic steering, self-parking and automatic high/low beam headlights. Safety kit, meanwhile, includes eight airbags (head, knee and pelvis airbags in the front, plus two side curtain airbags), parking sensors, blind spot warning, lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking.Back in October, the quick spin in the confines of the GreenTech Malaysia carpark hadn’t offered too much from a performance point of view, but there were many micro observations, many of which were reinforced on the road-going drive, which covered a total distance of 111.8 km from the GreenTech office in Bangi to PJ and back via a mix of routing.Some relevant numbers – at the start of the drive, the car’s trip computer listed a 436 km estimated range based on the almost fully-charged battery, and by the time the charger went back on at the GreenTech office the available range reading was 273 km. Earlier, with 71 km done, this had read 334 km of available range.In all, the accuracy in calculated available range in relation to actual mileage deviated by around 40%, but there were many long-ish stops made during the route, and the last hour consisted mainly of stationary placement and low-speed movement to take photos of the Midnight Silver example (the other car is a ). It’d be interesting to see how wide that difference is in regular everyday use, but 400 km per charge sounds like an attainable figure.For much of the drive, the S 85 was driven quite gently, the approach taken to viewing it as a daily driver, which was hard given the rather addictive accelerative qualities of the car. The Tesla is fast, and it doesn’t feel sluggish propelling off, even at conventional in-gear mid-level speeds. Still, much of the drive observed speed limits right across all state and national roads.The approach for the day saw total energy consumed being 23.2 kWh, with an average energy consumption of 208 Wh for every km – this dropped the energy consumption numbers from the previous running averages, which I was told had a more liberal view of the accelerator pedal. Floor it consistently, and that battery isn’t going to give you anywhere near 400 km of travel, but poor mileage will likely be the case when new lessors get their cars, until sanity eventually prevails. With regard to ride and its quietness, the compliance and level of comfort offered by the SAS system is noteworthy – it’s plush without being overtly soft, and body control is good. Likewise, the NVH levels, winsome, especially cruising on expressway runs.Out on the road, the steering feels responsive enough, though perhaps not as communicative as that suggested initially during the first preview, lacking feel off-centre. Still, no complaints about the speed and the car’s reaction to directional input. Front seat comfort levels continue where it left off previously, with no trace of fatigue being noted over the four-plus hours of drive time.In-cabin functionality – from the driver’s seat perspective – of switchgear and displays follow on that noted during the initial session. The main instrument display is a winner to the eyes, and the 17-inch central touchscreen continues to dazzle, though it felt a bit too bright when the car was taken into a basement carpark, lending to the question if it would be in daily use at night, even with night mode. Otherwise, operation is intuitive, though like before, a larger font for the adjustment parameters wouldn’t go amiss.The two cars come without a central storage console, which isn’t really an issue – the open space binnacle between the seats allows you to put just about everything that you tote along, even handbags for the ladies.As for fit and finish, the trim and material to areas of direct sight is – as noted previously – good, with strong contact point tactility, though some elements in other areas feel less polished. In the end, it’s a mixed bag presentation-wise; offerings from the major players have arguably better overall refinement.The rear exec seats, meanwhile, continue to disappoint, more so under extended scrutiny. Ingress and egress aspects are decent enough, and there’s plenty of knee room (in this regard, it’s more than the measure of a  or a ), but the lack of headroom when sitting upright (or properly, if you will) shunts perception towards the claustrophobic. Slumping down in the seat solves this to a degree, but introduces a severe lack of lumbar support, which brings about its own set of problems.The Tesla’s raised floor height in relation to the seat level also presents occupants with another issue – seated as such, the knees are raised quite high, so there’s . All this, not only if you’re tall – a number of people of varying height was asked to get into the rear seat and all faced the same problem, save shorter folk (read ‘five-footer’ tops).Given that many prospective lessors will be sitting at the back in this one (and be much taller than five feet, presumably), the level of contention here is high. Thankfully, the exec seats won’t feature in the cars that will be coming in, so hopefully the normal seat bench should fare much better in use. At the very least, it’ll offer one more person to be shuttled in the rear in relative comfort.The flawed scope of the executive rear seating and some iffy elements of cabin material presentation are about the only two niggles in an otherwise well-thought out interpretation of electric mobility, at least upon first view.Indeed, the Tesla Model S 85 has many positives going for it – the tech under that skin undoubtedly leads the way, but its turn of speed and the highly workable operating range also makes for the allure. In urban use, 400 km should be an achievable distance per charge, good enough for at least three days of use for an average driver in the city, and a run up to Penang without having to recharge looks downright doable – the 240 volt mobile charger (and a friendly three-pin wall socket) takes care of the return leg.GreenTech is hoping that the programme involving it will not just  but also help pave the way for the return of tax exemptions for electric cars somewhere in the not-too-distant future – indicatively, an S 85 will go for more than RM600k with tax, and well under RM400k with exemptions, moot as the discussion on pricing is where the general public is concerned.",Anthony Lim
2015-12-28,BMW “Grand” X1 appears in Chinese patent office,"It’s no secret that BMW is working on a long-wheelbase version of the BMW X1. Thanks to , we now have leaked patent images that provide us with an early look at what the new model could possibly look like before its supposed 2016 debut.The obvious difference in design is the X1’s stretched wheelbase, with longer rear doors and windows. Currently, the five-seater BMW X1 measures 4,439 mm in length and boasts a wheelbase of 2,670 mm. The extension (about 100 mm) seen here could likely result in an additional pair of seats being installed in the third row, more suited for children due to the limited headroom.The UKL1 platform will be used on this BMW “Grand” X1, which also underpins the 2 Series Active Tourer (five-seater MPV), and the larger 2 Series Gran Tourer. The latter gets an increased wheelbase of 110 mm from the Active to accommodate an extra row of seats, to make it a seven-seater. of an elongated X1 also revealed that a hybrid powertrain might be offered. Should that be the case, it will join the three- and four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, coupled to a front-wheel drive setup, or if need be, BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive system.The BMW “Grand” X1 will be offered in the Chinese market initially, before going on sale in other markets globally. Whether this involves the European and American markets remains to be seen. Nonetheless, if the BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer doesn’t cut it for you, will a seven-seater BMW X1 be a better prospect?",Gerard Lye
2015-12-28,BMW Vision Car concept interior teased in new image,"A teaser image of the BMW Vision Car concept has been released, and while not all that much can be told,  reports that the new interior picture might be that of an  concept. The Vision Car concept is set to be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January, next year.The noticeable feature in the image is the large coloured widescreen display on the passenger’s side. There doesn’t seem to be buttons of any sort, which suggests that a gesture control system could be the star feature. The automaker has confirmed that AirTouch will be present in the concept – occupants can control the entertainment, navigation and communication systems without touching any buttons.Said system makes use of a number of sensors to monitor and record movements of the hand between the centre console and interior rearview mirror. The system can already be found in the new , however with a different name – Gesture Control system. AirTouch on the other hand, will be more advanced as it allows for 3D gestures. According to the brand, the latest iteration of the gesture control system “reduces the number of steps needed to make a selection.” To illustrate this, BMW says that when activating the phone pad, the system automatically “brings up contacts or call lists to the top select level so that a call can be made with just one further action.”If it is indeed the i8 Spyder concept, improvements to the connectivity, safety systems as well as subtle changes to the powertrain and batteries could also likely be announced at CES. The topless i8 is expected to carry on with the mid-mounted 231 hp/320 Nm 1.5 litre TwinPower Turbo three-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, with a front-mounted 131 hp/250 Nm electric motor.Like the , the electric motor gives the i8 an all-wheel drive configuration. Combined, the current car makes a total of 362 hp and 570 Nm of torque, surging from 0-100 km/h in 4.4 seconds and with a top speed of 250 km/h. The hybrid sports car achieves a claimed fuel consumption figure of 47.6 km per litre, while only emitting 49 grammes per kilometre of CO2.We took the BMW i8 coupe for a spin recently, against the  and .

2015-12-28,Renault buys Lotus F1 for £1 to make Formula 1 return,"Renault has returned to Formula One after it  of the Lotus F1 team on December 18 for £1 (RM6.40). The token payment required Renault to assume the team’s debts, which had left Lotus F1 embroiled in court cases through most of 2015.The takeover comes on the back of Renault’s split as engine supplier from Red Bull Racing. The decision to leave came after it was reported Red Bull Racing had complained about the performance of the engine.Renault managing director Cyril Abiteboul affirmed its return to Formula One, “Renault had two options: to come back at 100% or leave. We have been successful as a competitive team before, and from a marketing stand point and connection between F1 and the rest of the business, we have never been so strong.”The convoluted deal saw Genii Capital and associate company Gravity Motorsports holding 10% of the team, while also writing off £98.2 million (RM628 million) in shareholder loans. The 90% majority of shares is held by Grigny (UK) Ltd, the company that previously owned the team when it raced under the Benetton banner. Abitetoul said it would take at least three years for Renault to be fighting at the front of the grid. “We have given a time frame [of three years] in the statement that was communicated by Carlos Ghosn, and we need to be pragmatic,” he said.As reported by , Abitetoul is confident that the team has a good business plan in place to tackle the 2016 season. “What should not wait is the capacity of Renault to turn what we do on the track into tangible marketing value for the group and for the brand. That is really important, as that is what will give us the stability so that we have the capacity – the financial capacity and also the time – to become one of the big boys,” said Abitetoul.Further details about the structure of the Renault Formula One team are expected to be released at a press conference in February 2016. It was reported that Jolyon Palmer, son of former Formula One driver Jonathan Palmer, would replace Romain Grosjean, with Pastor Maldonaldo taking the other seat.",Mohan K Ramanujam

The MCMC currently deems ride-sharing apps a legal service.The  and its supposed legalisation of ride-sharing services in Malaysia was also condemned by Syed Hamid. “This topic of legalising never arises at all. SPAD’s position is very clear from the beginning – legalising Uber does not arise and statements coming from the Transport Ministry are confusing and making us (SPAD) look bad as if we are set to execute this move of legalising Uber.“It was the Transport Ministry which made the statements while SPAD has yet to make any announcement or finalise our plan with regards to Uber, GrabCar or any ride-hailing apps which utilise private vehicles. And I am surprised that the Transport Ministry is getting ahead of themselves,” he stated.The ongoing ride-sharing saga has left several , with some looking to take legal action against SPAD, which Syed Hamid responded to by saying, “in the first place, they (cabbies) are taking legal action based on speculation. As far as we are concerned, we have not made any decision (on Uber). I think the taxi drivers are pointing their finger at the wrong party here.”However, Syed Hamid stated that even though SPAD will participate in a workshop with the Transport Ministry on the possibility of regulating ride-sharing services, any proposal to revitalise the taxi industry soon still needs to be presented to Cabinet.",Gerard Lye

2015-12-23,AD: How well do Malaysians drivers know their cars?,"How well do Malaysians know their cars? According to Shell, Malaysian motorists log an average of 250 million hours in vehicles every year. That puts a lot of engine stress, even for your daily commute. It’s also said that Malaysians are now increasing their oil change intervals to an average of 8,600 km.  Obviously, the engine oil plays a vital role in keeping your vehicle running, and with the typical engine breakdown cost in the country estimated to be between RM3,000 to RM5,000, it’s important for you to choose the right motor oil. That being said, studies have shown that six out of 10 Malaysians are clueless about this, and aren’t well versed with the types of engine oils that are available. That’s where Shell Helix Ultra with PurePlus Technology and Active Cleansing Technology Additives comes in. Shell’s latest motorsport-proven engine oil features an ultra-clean base oil made from natural gas. It utilises a revolutionary gas-to-liquid (GTL) process, developed over 40 years of research, that converts natural gas into a crystal-clear base oil with virtually none of the impurities found in crude oil.In the case of the top-end Shell Helix Ultra ECT C2/C3 0W-30, it boasts four times improved wear protection, three times better corrosion protection of engine components, 45% cleaner pistons and up to 2.6% better fuel economy, or an increase as much as 16 km per tank.Shell says the Helix Ultra ECT C2/C3 0W-30 is the highest-specification engine oil in the market, and meets European ACEA C2 and C3 and North American API SN specifications, as well as major carmaker approvals including from Mercedes-Benz (MB229.52,MB229.51 and MB229.31), Volkswagen (VW504.00/507.00) and Fiat (955535.GS1).All being said, studies again have shown that nine out of 10 Malaysians experienced a positive driving difference with Shell Helix.

2015-12-23,2016 CSC RX3 – 250cc copy of the BMW GS Adventure,"What you are looking at is the 2016 RX3, made by Zongshen Motor of China, and marketed in the US by CSC Motorcycles. At first glance, it looks like a BMW GS Adventure, until you notice little details like the single-disc front wheel, lack of ABS sensors and cast steel frame.The engine is a liquid-cooled, overhead cam four-valve single cylinder that is rated at 25 hp and 23 Nm. Fuelling is taken care of by a Delphi EFI unit, and final drive is chain, going through a six-speed box.The 16 litre tank provides a useful range for the RX3, and the balance shaft cancels out vibration from the thumper. Braking is taken care of by front and rear single discs. No dinner plates here, just an appropriate 262 mm disc up front grabbed by a twin-piston caliper and a 258 mm unit out back.The 37 mm inverted fork gives 130 mm of travel, and the rear has 140 mm of bouncy monoshock. Weight is claimed to be 165 kg, and the seat height is 795 mm.The front wheel uses a 100/90-18 tyre, which isn’t hard to find, but the rear 130/90-15 is going to limit tyre choices, somewhat. Most riders will find the RX3 unintimidating, compared to the nose-bleed seat height and elephantine weight of full-sized dual-purpose machines.For 2016, the RX3 comes in four colours – Sahara Orange, metallic Sierra Silver, metallic Garnet Red, and pearl Ice White – and US distributor CSC provides an option list that includes a lowering kit, gold-anodised forks and adjustable, Seat Concepts custom seat, satin finish handlebars and bar-end weights. The 2016 RX3 retails in the US for US$3,895 (RM16,772).",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-23,Approved Permit (AP) policy to remain in Malaysia; improvements to the system to come in 2017 – MITI,"It has now been confirmed – the  for the import of used cars is set to remain in Malaysia, as announced by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). Following a comprehensive research, a new set of improvements will be set in place from January 1, 2017 onwards. In the statement, MITI adds that the improvements to the current system would allow “eligible new  companies that strictly adhere to the criteria to participate” in the used car business. To ensure compliance, a qualified and independent auditor will be selected to audit the new companies involved. “The government will (also) launch a programme to use a portion of the open AP fees to enable the public to directly benefit from this new policy. The details of this programme will be announced later,” said MITI.Findings of the research into the current AP system, covering the analysis of its effects, contributions and implications to the industry, were also revealed. “The research team opined that the current Open AP system gives opportunities to the public to purchase used imported cars at a competitive price. They also found that the distribution and importation of used cars industry contributed significantly to the automotive industry and the country’s socio-economic development,” said MITI in the statement. It went on to add that the system’s contributions to the supporting business and service sectors such as banking, insurance, shipping and logistics was estimated to be in the region of RM450 million per year. The government also collected about RM2 billion worth of taxes and fees per year, based on the current system. Furthermore, the study found that the AP system directly provided job opportunities to 3,800 high- and medium-income earners. Meanwhile, it’s said that the policy contributed to 5% out of the 36%  equity in the automotive sector. The research was conducted over six months, and involved accounts and opinions of industry players, consumer associations, NGOs and politicians. As mentioned above, the study recommended that the current policy be continued. MITI went on to warn that, “if the system were (to be) discontinued, there would be no more used imported cars allowed into the country and this would deny many people the opportunity to buy such cars. Also, the percentage of  equity participation in the automotive sector would reduce to 31%.”The Open AP policy was supposed to be discontinued by December 31, 2015, under NAP 2009. The , however, mentioned that an  of Open APs would be carried out. The study has now been completed, as described above. So folks, it’s now certain that the Open AP policy will indeed remain, with improvements to come in 2017. What do you think of this decision?",Hafriz Shah

Especially for racers and fast road riders, nailing a fast time on a stretch of tarmac requires much repetition before the perfect line is found.Honda filed a patent in December 2015 for a system that allows a rider to record and analyse the ride immediately, then obtain feedback on how to improve the ride. The system comprises of various sensors including a gyroscope, accelerometer, steering angle sensor, GPS locator, velocity sensor, and camera.Activated at the beginning of the ride, the Computer Instructor records millions of data points, combining it into a video that can be viewed when the rider stops. The magic happens when the system shows where the ride can be improved based on its internal mapping, showing the rider what to change such as road position, lean angle, throttle position, and braking force.It’s like having your own personal riding instructor, except this one lives inside a silicon chip. The system doesn’t need to have any pre-knowledge of the route beforehand, and can be used for any stretch of road.",Mohan K Ramanujam

It is said that its findings will be presented to the Cabinet prior to a final decision being made. Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar, SPAD’s chairman, said that legalising services such as Uber cannot be done plainly to please the public.“I understand that the public have voiced their dissatisfaction with the quality of the taxi services. People are reluctant to use their service because there are some of them who don’t follow the rules and regulations set. There are also those who ignore the law,” he said.The SPAD boss also revealed that one of his fears stems from there possibly being too many for-hire vehicles on the road. He stressed that, “once we legalise services such as Uber, there will be an overflow on public service vehicles. There will be too many taxis on the road.”He believes that an oversupply of taxis threatens the livelihood of taxi drivers altogether, with business typically spread too thinly across the nation. “We must ensure that everyone involved can make a living, there is no use to simply giving in to the wishes of the public,” Syed Hamid said. The chairman also expressed his hope that regular taxi drivers will improve their services in an attempt to win back passenger confidence.Should ride-sharing services like Uber and GrabCar be legalised, Syed Hamid explained that it will not be done overnight.

2015-12-23,Nissan kills its GT-R LM Nismo racing programme,"Nissan has issued a statement announcing it is shutting down its GT-R LM Nismo racing programme and withdrawing from the World Endurance Championship (WEC). The news comes on the back of a troubled development process for the , the front-engined race car never having reached the performance levels of its rivals in WEC.The twin-turbocharged, direct-injected 3.0 litre petrol V6 GT-R LM, with a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) driving all four wheels, was introduced just over a year ago. It was slated to compete in the entire 2015 season, but Nissan elected to withdraw from the initial two races to introduce the GT-R LM at the third race in Le Mans.All three cars were well off the pace, with none of the cars placing. Two of the cars were forced to retire with mechanical issues, and the third car was parked early to make one final lap at the end of the 24 hour race.Nissan then announced it was withdrawing from the 2015 WEC schedule to concentrate on testing and development of the GT-R LM. The departure of Nissan P1 racing programme head Darren Cox in October, although expected, left a void in the team.

2015-12-22,VIDEO: Ten years of Toro Rosso’s STR in one minute,"Formula One cars go through evolutionary design changes every year, in response to FIA rules and regulations, and the vagaries of Bernie Ecclestone. The video above shows the changes the Toro Rosso STR went through across ten years of racing. Scuderia Toro Rosso, Toro Rosso or STR as it is commonly known, rose from the ashes of the Minardi Formula One team after being purchased by team principal and Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz, at the end of 2005. After taking full control of the team in 2008, Toro Rosso began functioning as a feeder team to Red Bull Racing, developing promising talent for eventual promotion to the top flight.Currently Toro Rosso is managed by team principal Franz Tost, who came over from BMW’s motorsport division. Current drivers are Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz, Jr., with the team campaigning the STR10 chassis powered by a Renault Energy F1-2015 engine rolling on Pirelli tyres.2015 was the best year yet for Toro Rosso, with the team finishing seventh in the Constructor’s championship with 67 points.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-22,"Toyota GRMN 86 revealed, limited to 100 units only","Toyota’s Gazoo Racing Meister of Nürburgring (GRMN), the brand’s motorsports division, has released full details on its upcoming GRMN 86, a limited-run version of the automaker’s . Only 100 units of the car will be made, and the variant is set to go on display at the Tokyo Auto Salon in January.Dubbed the “Ultimate 86,” the GRMN 86 doesn’t just get a bump in aesthetics accompanied by a ludicrous price tag. The car instills various performance upgrades drawn from Gazoo Racing’s experience at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring endurance race, so the changes are certainly beyond skin deep.The GRMN 86, or GRMN86-FRSPORT if you want to refer to its exact model code, undergoes a revision to its chassis that makes it 1.8 times stiffer than the base model currently offered in Japan, the Toyota 86 GT “Limited.” The chassis also gains a GRMN-tuned suspension and rear performance rod with a damping mechanism for an improved ride as well.As you can clearly tell, the GRMN 86 is fitted with a body kit that provides functional aerodynamic downforce as well. Carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) is used on the bonnet, roof, trunk and rear wing as well for weight saving purposes. Even the glass bits are replaced by a lightweight resin.The weight savings doesn’t translate to big differences on the scales. Compared to the standard car, the limited-run 86 tips the scales at 1,230 kg, 20 kg less than the manual and unchanged from the automatic 86 GT “Limited,” respectively.However, the weight loss is accompanied by changes to the car’s dimensions. With the addition of the body kit, the car is now longer at 4,290 mm, with a five millimetre increase in the front track (1,525 mm), and a five millimetre decrease at the rear (1,535 mm).Under the hood, the FA20 2.0 litre boxer four-cylinder engine has been redesignated to the FA20-GR following a series of revisions that include new lightweight pistons, low-tension piston rings and low-friction crank bearings. To ensure the engine is heard more closely, there is now a centre-mounted muffler with variable valve that kicks in at 4,000 rpm.This translates to an output 219 PS (19 PS more) at 7,300 rpm and 217 Nm (12 Nm more) at 5,200 rpm.  Power is sent through a six-speed manual gearbox only (with revised ratios), and to the rear wheels via a Torsen limited slip differential. Other performance bits on the GRMN 86 include six-piston monoblock brake calipers at front, with four-piston ones at the rear. The wheels and tyres have also been swapped. Here, specially-developed Bridgestone Potenza RE-71R tyres (front 215/40R17 x 7.5J, rear 235/40R17 x 8.5J) are fitted on 17-inch RAYS forged lightweight aluminium wheels.Inside, the cabin gets a significant amount of Alcantara trim along with GRMN badging. The material is also used to upholster the Recaro racing seats as well. On the mention of seats, the GRMN 86 loses both its rear ones as well.As tempting as the GRMN 86 is, there’s a catch. The car will only go on sale in Japan wearing a price tag of 6,480,000 yen (RM230,334), including local consumption taxes.",Gerard Lye

2015-12-22,Alta Motors delivers the first Redshift electric bike,"San Francisco-based Alta Motors has delivered its first production electric motorcycle, the Redshift, to proud owners Eric Gauthier and Jeannine Smith,  reported. Alma had its beginning back in 2007, the brainchild of Marc Fenigstein, Derek Dorresteyn and Jeff Sand.Dorrestyn and Sand were avid motorcylists who wanted a bike that would deliver a smooth, perfectly responsive torque curve. This resulted in the Redshift, a motocross-styled electric motorcycle. The core of the chassis is the Redshift Bulkhead, which functions as the outer motor casing, the cooling circuit for the motor and inverter, as well as the transmission case for the gear reduction while serving as a structural member. It also ties together the rear suspension, the airframe, the forged monocoque chassis and the trellis skidframe.The Redshift uses a high-speed permanent magnet brushless motor that provides direct response between the rider’s throttle hand and the rear tyre. The rotor, one of only two spinning parts in the drivetrain, is located at the bike’s precise roll centre, minimising the rotor’s gyroscopic effect on handling.Alta spent three years developing the APK5 battery battery pack, which it claim allows for extreme energy density. The pack is digitally self-monitoring and self-balancing, and built to handle shock up to 50 G. Power is rated at a continuous 25 hp with a 40 hp peak.The Redshift comes in two models, the Redshift MX, with a factory price of US$14,995 (RM64,000), and the SM, which goes for US$15,995 (RM66,000) and is road legal. Range is claimed to be two hours riding, and a top speed of 130 km/h, with both bikes weighing in at 118 kg.",Mohan K Ramanujam

We reckon that the new bumpers, front and back, account for this 61 mm increase.Performance wise, the Ertiga Dreza is expected to carry forward the regular MPV’s 1.4 litre K-Series petrol engine, pairing it with the same four-speed torque converter automatic transmission. The Ertiga Dreza is also said to offer two airbags as well as ABS with electronic brake force distribution.",Chris Aaron

2015-12-22,Toyota reveals new map generation tech for CES 2016,"Toyota will be previewing its latest high-precision map generation technology at the coming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2016. The new system is being developed by Toyota Central R&D Labs in conjunction with its  self-driving technology.As the dawn of fully autonomous Toyota vehicles nears, high precision maps are proving more essential. With zero human intervention, Toyota explains that, “an understanding of road layouts and traffic rules (including speed limits and various road signs) is essential for the successful implementation of automated driving technologies. Additionally, high precision measurement of positional information requires the collection of information on dividing lines, curbs, and other road characteristics.”The Japanese car maker’s new map generation technology aims to harvest live data from on-board cameras and GPS devices installed in its production vehicles. This data will be continually sent to a Toyota data centre via an automated cloud-based spatial information generation technology.The data is largely pieced together automatically, but further information on dividing lines, positions of curbs and other road characteristics and signs will be manually integrated into the map.Conventional road data gathering relies on specially-built vehicles with three-dimensional laser scanners. However, Toyota says that this is too costly of a solution to keep maps constantly updated, and doesn’t feature the same depth of information its system will offer.By using its production vehicles and existing infrastructure to collect information, Toyota’s high-precision map can be updated in real time. Furthermore, it is said that the system can be implemented and scaled up at a relatively low cost. The car maker plans to include the tech in its production vehicles by 2020.",Chris Aaron

2015-12-22,BMW slapped with RM172 million fine for MINI recall,"BMW was penalised US$40 million (RM172 million) and required to comply with performance requirements imposed by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in a consent order. The consent order – a voluntary agreement between both parties – was imposed on BMW for failing to issue a timely recall for 2014 and 2015  models that did not comply with side-impact crash protection standards.“NHTSA has discovered multiple instances in which BMW failed its obligations to its customers, to the public and to safety,” said US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx “The Consent Order NHTSA has issued not only penalizes this misconduct, it requires BMW to take a series of steps to remedy the practices and procedures that led to these violations.”The order brings to a close an NHTSA investigation into whether BMW issued a recall within five days of learning the MINI had failed in testing. During testing in October 2014, a MINI Cooper 3 Door failed a crash test – Munich contended that the vehicle was listed with an incorrect weight and would pass the test if conducted at the proper weight rating.At the time, BMW agreed with the NHTSA to conduct a recall to correct the incorrect weight rating on the MINI’s Tire Information Placard and to conduct a voluntary service campaign – not quite a recall – to fit additional side-impact protection. The agency conducted a second crash test in July 2015 on another MINI 3 Door at the corrected weight rating and with additional side-impact protection, again resulting in failure – it was then that the NHTSA realised that BMW had not conducted the service campaign it originally promised.Following an investigation and issuance of the order, BMW had to acknowledge it failed to timely recall non-compliant vehicles. It also had to concede additional violations the NHTSA has discovered, including failing to notify owners and dealers of recalls in a timely manner as well as providing required quarterly recall completion reports on time for multiple recalls since BMW’s previous consent order in 2012.“The requirement to launch recalls and inform consumers in a timely fashion when a safety defect or noncompliance is discovered is fundamental to our system for protecting the traveling public. This is a must-do,” said NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind. “For the second time in three years, BMW has been penalized for failing to meet that obligation. The company must take this opportunity to reform its procedures and its culture to put safety where it belongs: at the top of its priority list.”The order requires BMW to pay US$10 million (RM43 million) in cash and spend another US$10 million (RM43 million) to meet performance requirements; it would then have to trump up US$20 million (RM86 million) in deferred penalties should the order not be complied with, or if future safety violations are discovered. Additionally, BMW has to appoint an NHTSA-approved independent safety consultant to develop best practices to comply with the US Motor Vehicle Safety Act and submit them to the NHTSA.The company is also required to evaluate all safety or compliance issues under its review (handed to the agency under a monthly written report), kick off a pilot program determining if BMW can detect safety-related defect trends through data analytics, and prevent BMW dealers from selling new vehicles with unremedied safety defects. The last bit stemmed from the fact that an NHTSA representative bought a new car with an open safety recall from a dealer.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-22,Rumours flying fast about 2016 Honda CBR250RR,"Honda unveiled the “Light Weight Super Sports Concept” at the Tokyo Motor Show in October, and since then rumours have been flying fast and furious about whether this concept motorcycle is the pre-cursor to the CBR250RR, Honda’s small displacement replacement to the CBR250R.Reported to debut in the middle of 2016, little is known about the CBR250RR, aside from that it will have a parallel-twin engine displacing either 250 cc or 350 cc, depending on intended market. Indonesian site  has reported that this pocket rocket will have a fly-by-wire throttle, making it a first from a major manufacturer for a small engine.While 250 cc motorcycles with EFI and electronic throttles are not new, especially in prototypes and racing, its installation into a small engine such as this is perhaps a harbinger of things to come.  An electronic throttle will allow the integration of a whole slew of rider aids and controls, previously the provenance of superbikes, race track weapons and other high-end motorcycles.The redline is reported to be a stratospheric 14,000 rpm.  High rev limits are not new to motorcycles, with the 1985 Yamaha FZ250 Phazer turning the dial all the way to 20,000 with its tiny inline-four. In this case, Honda are eschewing the the laid back nature of the twin in favour of squeezing as much performance as possible of the engine.Other features of note on the concept bike are a possible aluminium swingarm and trellis subframe. If released, the CBR250RR will be going head-to-head with the Yamaha YZF-R25/R3, Kawasaki Ninja 250R/300R and KTM RC250/RC390.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-22,VIDEO: McLaren 675LT Spider – Senna has a go in it,"On December 3, McLaren officially announced the . Two weeks later, all 500 units of the second car in the McLaren stable to bear the LT designation (the LT standing for ‘Longtail’ and ‘Spider’) have been sold, three months ahead of its official public appearance at the Geneva motor show in March 2016.This means you can’t have one for Christmas, unless you have Santa Claus on direct dial. So, those of us who can’t have one – ever – will have to make do with a video the Woking firm have released, with Bruno Senna at the wheel and putting the 675LT Spider through its paces.The Spider was created in response to McLaren’s customer demand, and made with an eye to lightness, without compromising handling and stiffness, two traditional bugbears when it comes to a convertible. The light, stiff and strong MonoCell chassis used in the 675LT Spider hasn’t required any additional reinforcement, according to McLaren.This means the convertible 675 is only 40 kg heavier than its coupe sibling, with the additional weight directly attributed to the two-piece retractable hard-top roof. The roof can be folded even when the car is moving, operable up to a maximum speed of 30 km/h.The new LT Spider is powered by the same 3.8 litre twin-turbo V-eight as the coupe version, but extensive mechanical revisions – including more efficient turbochargers, revised cylinder heads and exhaust manifolds, a new camshaft, lightweight connecting rods, and a faster-flowing fuel pump – means the mill has 666 hp and 700 Nm torque on tap.Performance figures are similarly impressive, the 675LT taking 2.9 seconds to 100 km/h, same as the coupe, while 200 km/h is reached in 8.1 seconds, just a touch slower than the hard-top. McLaren claims a top speed of 326 km/h for the 675LT Spider.While the point is moot, since none are now available for sale directly from McLaren, the 675LT Spider had a factory price of RM1.82 million, RM180,000 more expensive than the coupe. Deliveries are expected to begin in mid-2016.",Mohan K Ramanujam

2015-12-22,Volkswagen to rotate key staff for better supervision,"In an effort to improve oversight at the , Hans Dieter Poetsch stated that the company is planning to start rotating its key staff, sort of like a game of musical chairs. The supervisory board chairman of VW AG stated that such a move was important in order to implement better supervision over their operations.Speaking to , Poetsch said, “we are planning a rotation principle for certain functions. The employees concerned will spend only a limited time in certain positions before moving on.” “We will bolster checks, determine responsibilities in a clearer way and better implement technical supervision of procedures,” he added. This “four-eyes principle” where at least two people are involved in key duties (future engine software) would become a company norm.However, Poetsch admits that the job rotations would prove to be more challenging when it comes to more complex roles. Volkswagen could draw upon the expertise of staff across the group to circumvent this potential shortcoming, he claims.“It’s easier said than done. There are few employees that are able to programme an engine control unit. But we have these people across the different brands.

2015-12-22,VIDEO: E30 BMW M3 – the making of a legend,"The legendary  was the first generation of a car that redefined what a fast sports sedan was supposed to be. Produced between 1985 and 1992, it is claimed to be the most successful touring car ever, clinching titles in DTM and BTCC, among others. The video above is the first of five-part series detailing the evolution of the M3, giving an insider’s look into its development and engineering.Outwardly similar to its , the E30 M3 came with different body panels designed to improve aerodynamics and flared wheel arches to accommodate a wider track and larger wheels. It is powered by the race-bred S14 2.3 litre twin-cam 16-valve four-cylinder engine, originally producing 195 PS – sent to the rear wheels, of course.The gearbox is a Getrag 265 five-speed manual unit that came with overdrive for the US market and a dog-leg first gear and a 1:1 fifth gear for Europe; a limited-slip differential was also fitted. Under the skin, the M3 gained a much stiffer chassis and tweaked front suspension with added castor and redesigned stabiliser and steering, resulting in improved responsiveness, steering feedback and stability at higher speeds.Over the years, the E30 M3 went through several different revisions, namely the Evolution and Sport Evolution, each adding aerodynamic, performance (the Sport Evo gained a stroked 2.5 litre mill that pushed out 238 PS) and handling improvements.Although only 5,000 units of the road car needed to be sold for homologation purposes, BMW ended up selling nearly 18,000, despite it being one and a half times more expensive than the most powerful of the regular 3 Series at the time, the 325i.

However, German tuning house Väth doesn’t share the same sentiment as it has unveiled its tuning packages for the four-door high-performance sedan.Under the hood, the 4.0 litre biturbo V8 engine in the V 63 S now produces 609 hp and 810 Nm, which is 99 hp and 110 Nm more than the standard car. These changes enable the car to hit a top speed of 320 km/h. For even more power, Väth offers a V 63 RS tuning kit that tags on optimised turbochargers and a new down pipe for up to 680 hp.With all that power, the Väth- C 63 S still looks very much like the stock car. Available options include a reworked suspension that lowers the car by 40 mm. New wheels can also be specified, measuring 20 inches with 255/30ZR20 front and 275/30ZR20 rear tyres. They can be finished in either silver or black.Uprated brakes are also installed here to ensure enough stopping power is available as well. The options list extends into the cabin as well, including a speedometer that reads up to 360 km/h, aluminium pedals and black velour floor mats.With its sleeper looks that conceal a mountain of power underneath, what do you think of the Väth V 63 S?

The GT-R GT3 shown here is the same one that took part in the 2015 Spa 24 Hours endurance race, back in July this year. As mentioned, it’s billed as one of the toughest tracks to endure, with over 500 laps that needed to be completed. This year’s race was no exception as rain fell and accidents were rampant; adding to that, many cars failed to finish.That’s the 2015 Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3 you’re seeing right there. The upgraded competition car features further weight reduction as well as improved weight balance. In addition, aerodynamics, fuel economy and braking performance have also been enhanced as well.

This is in keeping with Agusta’s year-on-year growth, and its  looks to be bearing fruit.With 9,000 motorcycles sold around the world, international sales for MV Agusta has shown the most improvement. While sales in its home country remained stagnant, the firm’s increase in sales over 2014 was pushed by the UK, recording a 140% jump. Spain clocked in with a 54% rise, followed by Germany and France with a 20% increase each.The US saw sales rise by half, while Asia added another 12% to MV Agusta’s units sold worldwide. Agusta’s revenues also took a jump, with a 30% increase in turnover. Profits were up as well, with margins coming in at 40%, driven in part by top-end models such as the Turismo Veloce and Dragster. The best selling model for 2015 was the Brutale RR, making up more than a third of all MV Agusta bikes sold.President and CEO Giovanni Castiglioni said, “2015 has been a very important year for MV Agusta. With the launch of the Turismo Veloce we have created the first Touring MV Agusta, a motorcycle that differentiates itself from its competitors by introducing a whole new dimension and experience to traveling, touring that excites your emotions. This aspect is what sets MV apart from other manufacturers.”However, Agusta admitted falling short of its 2015 sales target. For 2016, MV Agusta hopes its partnership with Mercedes-AMG, and the expected January launch of the all-new Brutale 800, will further push sales.Previously owned by Proton Holdings at a price of RM500 million, the company was controversially sold for RM4 to Gevi SpA in 2006, which also assumed the brand’s debt. Harley-Davidson then bought the company for RM429 million in 2008. The stake was then sold to Claudio Castiglioni in 2009, who then reported an increase in sales by 50% in 2010.Since then MV Agusta expanded its range to capture the middle-weight market with the F3 675, and the Brutale 675.

Choosing to take the road less travelled, KTM unveiled two new bikes for 2016 at the EICMA show in Milan, the Super Duke GT and the 690 Duke and Duke R.The Super Duke GT is KTM’s take on a fast sports tourer, with the emphasis on the ‘sports’. Taking a de-tuned version of the 1290 Super Duke engine, the 1301 cc engine pups out 173 hp.To make the ‘tourer’ part a little more realistic, the fairing and windshield have been redesigned to direct wind blast away from the rider. The rear sub-frame has also been designed to accept a pair of custom designed KTM panniers that give large carry capacity without affecting ground clearance.The Super Duke GT meets Euro Four emissions standards, and comes with a full complement of aids for fast and comfortable riding. These rider aids wouldn’t be out of place on a track oriented sportsbike, and include cornering ABS, semi-active WP suspension, Brembo radially-mounted calipers, and Motor Slip Regulation (MSR) which allows the rider to adjust engine braking.  More touring-friendly features are cruise control, heated grips, tyre pressure monitoring system and optional Hill Hold Control which electronically holds the bike stationary when starting on an incline. KTM says a full range of accessories will be made available to enhance both touring capability and engine performance.Meanwhile, the 690 Duke, long beloved of hooligans and wheelie merchants over the past decade, comes back badder and more anti-social for 2016. Revisions have been made to the big thumper, which now puts out 73 hp. The addition of an extra balancer shaft dampens out the vibration from the single piston.The 690 Duke and Duke R also come with cornering ABS, apparently the smallest capacity motorycle to be thus equipped.

The video is indeed a perfect way to start the Christmas season.The Ford Focus RS features a 2.3 litre EcoBoost four-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed manual transmission. It produces 345 hp and 440 Nm and can be boosted to 470 Nm (for 15 seconds) of torque in European specs, while the US version makes more – 350 hp and 475 Nm of torque. The European Focus RS does 0-100 km/h in 4.7 seconds.Aside from Launch Control, the all-wheel drive RS has “torque vectoring” capability. Furthermore, It features four different Drive Modes, which include Normal, Sport, Track and a Drift Mode for controlled oversteering – perhaps used when shooting the video too.",Graham Chin

The latest is RevoZport, which has previewed its bodykit for the Japanese hot hatch.Surprisingly, the Hong Kong-based tuner will be toning the styling down a bit by replacing the aforementioned wing with a small carbon fibre flap atop the tail lights. Not interested in the subtlety? RevoZport will provide a similarly massive rear wing, this time integrated into the tail lights, finally –  – fulfilling the promise Honda made with the .Elsewhere, the kit is mostly a standard fare aerokit, made from carbon fibre – a more aggressive front splitter, flaps around the front air intakes, front flics, a vented bonnet, new fender vents and carbon side skirts. The huge rear diffuser, however, is said to feature active aero – that’s quite a sophisticated addition for a tuner in our book. Large Klassen iD wheels complete the makeover.The Honda Civic Type R is powered by a new 2.0 litre direct-injection DOHC VTEC Turbo engine, producing 310 PS at 6,500 rpm and 400 Nm of torque at 7,000 rpm, with a six-speed manual transmission sending power to the front wheels through a limited-slip differential.

2015-12-21,VIDEO: Mercedes-Benz C 350 e sings “Silent Night”,"The  is the first vehicle to be used by the brand to convey its Christmas message. Entitled “,” the hybrid sedan is fittingly centred around the Christmas carol (in a heavy metal rendition of it), to showcase a car “that knows when to run on electricity only.”Said hybrid sedan is pretty clever, in that it has a “transmission mode” switch located at the centre console. It comprises of five different selections: Individual, Sport+, Sport, Comfort and Economy. The latter works better with the navigation system and Hybrid operation mode.In Economy transmission mode, the vehicle is consumption-optimised – the system will control the charge status of the high-voltage battery according to the route laid out by the navigation system. It ensures that electric operating mode is employed as far as possible in built-up areas.According to the video, the combined fuel consumption of the C 350 e is rated between 2.4 to 2.1 litres per 100 km. In addition to that, it produces a combined 54 to 48 grammes of CO2 emissions, while power consumption is weighted at 13.2 to 11.0 kWh per 100 km.Silent but powerful at the same time, the Mercedes-Benz C 350 e Plug-in Hybrid utilises the same 2.0 litre petrol engine from the regular C 250. Initial power output of the said engine is 208 hp and 350 Nm of torque. An 80 hp electric motor adds an additional 340 Nm, giving it a combined power output of 275 hp and 600 Nm.A 7G-Tronic Plus seven-speed automatic transmission that comes with a hybrid module that embodies the electric motor and an additional clutch, sends power to the rear-wheels.

2015-12-21,Uber is now officially legal in some parts of Australia,"The New South Wales (NSW) government has officially declared ride-sharing service Uber legal in Australia’s most populous state, with the Western Australia (WA) government expected to follow suit come July 2016. Earlier in October this year, Uber had its first Australian legalisation win when the when the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) legalised its UberX service. The move by the NSW state is accompanied by changes to its taxi and hire car industry as well. However, the Uber service is not yet legal throughout Australia, with some states banning the service altogether, like in Victoria. Uber is suggesting a $150 annual permit for drivers using its mobile app to accept trip requests in an attempt to legalise its services there (in Victoria).NSW transport minister Andrew Constance told  that the new laws, effective immediately, provides consumers with more choices in their commute, while also benefiting from increased competition in the industry, with the possibility of new entrants.“These reforms are expected to blow the doors of innovation wide open for ‘booked’ services, where customers can track their driver, provide direct feedback, hold them more accountable and choose from accessible price points,” Constance said.Even with the legalisation of UberX in NSW, taxi services there will still retain exclusive access to taxi ranks and the right to be hailed in the street. Safety will also get a boost, with the industry set to be overseen by a new regulator and Commissioner, to ensure that operators are abiding by the rules.The NSW government will also set up a $250 million compensation package for taxi licence-holders, where the holders can receive up to a maximum AUD$40,000 (AUD$20,000 each plate). This will be funded by passengers (Uber and conventional taxis), where they are required to pay an extra AUD$1 for every trip. This mandate will remain for up to five years to compensate taxi licence owners. Currently, ride-sharing services like Uber are operating in a legal (unregulated) grey area in Malaysia. However, the  is said to be reviewing possible regulations to legalise these services, a .",Gerard Lye
2015-12-21,"Taxi associations against legalising Uber, GrabCar","The Transport Ministry recently revealed that it will be  like Uber and GrabCar, in an effort to legalise these services. However, the move has come under fire from various taxi associations, according to a report by .The Malaysian Taxi, Limousine and Car Rental Operators and Drivers Association (Petekma) said that the Ministry’s decision is unwise because ride-sharing service operators will still fail to adhere to regulations put in place by the government. Petekma’s president Mohd Shahrir Abdul Aziz said, “it is very unlikely for Uber and GrabCar drivers to follow regulations like obtaining a Public Service Vehicle (PSV) licence, having their cars regularly inspected by Puspakom or to obtain insurance coverage to protect their passengers. “Furthermore, the persistence of legalising both Uber and GrabCar will just worsen existing tension between taxi drivers and Uber or GrabCar, especially now when the income of most taxi drivers is already badly affected by the ride-sharing services,” he added. The association might submit a memorandum to the government, urging it to reconsider the Transport Ministry’s move. However, Mohd Shahrir stated that it will not stage a . “In the memo, we will highlight to the ministry that there is no such need for another transport provider in the industry because the current supply of 37,000 taxis in Klang Valley is sufficient to meet demand,” he said.Malaysian Taxi Drivers’ Transformation Association (PERS1M) deputy president Kamarudin Mohd Hussain shared his thoughts, “instead of trying to legalise something that is already illegal, the government should try to come out with a holistic and comprehensive solution to solve some of the woes and problems faced by the taxi drivers like the high taxi vehicle rental per month charged on taxi drivers.”Other taxi associations that had a thing to say about the Ministry’s move include the Peninsular Bumiputra Taxi Operators Association (Perbumi). Its president branded the ministry’s suggestion as unreasonable, irrational and unacceptable.He said, “instead of accepting or legalising something that is not well received by most countries, the government should have a discussion with all the relevant industry associations and affected parties to garner their feedback before coming out with any announcement.”Meanwhile, Klang Valley Taxi Drivers Action Committee president Zailani Isa Usuluddin criticised deputy transport minister Datuk Aziz Kaprawi for doing something beyond his ministry’s scope of influence. He stressed that legalising Uber and GrabCar is similar to insulting the laws especially when it is against the law for any individual to utilise private vehicle for commercial purposes.“The announcement of legalising Uber and GrabCar should not have come from Aziz as any issues pertaining to land public transport should be done by Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) or the minister responsible for it and in this case, it should be Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Nancy Shukri,” Zailani said.What are your thoughts on the legalisation of the ride-sharing services in Malaysia?

2015-12-18,VIDEO: Lambo Murcielago vs Ford Mustang drift battle,"You’ll need your headphones for this one. Monster Energy recently dropped this video of a drift battle, aptly titled , where a heavily modified Lamborghini Murcielago goes head-to-head against a .The battle takes place in Niigata, Japan with professional drifter Vaughn Gittin Jr importing his Ford Mustang RTR to square off against a Japanese local, . If you’d like to know the full name of his drift machine, it’s referred to as the Monster Energy Nitto Tire Ford Mustang RTR.Under the hood, you’ll find a Ford Racing 5.0 litre Aluminator V8 XS engine that provides 550 hp, mated to a close-ratio six-speed transmission. Tein suspension, a RTR bodykit, Wildwood front and rear brakes and HRE wheels wrapped in Nitto NT05 tyres are just some of modification on the tricked-up pony.If you’re expecting Vaughn’s opponent to bring out a JDM special, think again. Instead, this Lamborghini Murcielago is his weapon of choice. Built by Liberty Walk and Phat Five Racing, the Italian supercar wears a bodykit from the Japanese tuner. Thankfully the trademark scissor doors are retained on this drift car.The Murcielago’s 6.5 litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine is retained here along with the six-speed manual. The engine is aided by HKS pod filters, a straight flow exhaust with a cross section and an ECU remap to now deliver 650 hp. Power is channelled to the rear wheels, as the car’s original all-wheel drive system has been ditched entirely for obvious reasons.In the video, both cars are seen battling it out on a touge run as they head into the abandoned Niigata Russian Village. This is accompanied by copious amounts of sliding around, tyre smoke and the glorious noises of the V8 and V12 engines. Certainly a great end to the week, don’t you think?",Gerard Lye
2015-12-18,VIDEO: Fiat Toro pick-up stars in new,"As if we haven’t had enough -themed marketing campaigns, here is Fiat getting in on some of the action.

2015-12-21,"Refusing to give way to VIP convoys with a police escort against the law, and a punishable offence – IGP","It’s against the law to refuse to give way to VIP convoys with a police escort, according to Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar.  reports that road users who defy police instructions – particularly in refusing to give way to VIP convoys when asked – can be penalised under three laws. Khalid explained that such behaviour can be considered as obstructing a civil servant from carrying out his duties and is an offence under the Police Act, Road Traffic Act and the Penal Code.“There have been , particularly on the road while escorting VIPs. VIPs are escorted mainly for safety reasons,” Khalid said. He was responding to a news report last week that had questioned whether it was required for the public to give way to a VIP convoy.The subject came about following a December 15 posting by a motorist on social media, in which the road user claimed that while driving on the road, several police outriders on motorcycles were ordering motorists to give way to a car which was ferrying a VVIP.The road user, however, refused to give way, a move that was matched by the car ahead of him. He applauded the move as Malaysians fighting for their rights, and continued on by stating that he wasn’t angry with police officers who were just performing their duties. Instead, he had asked for ministers to “practice what they preach”, as in to leave earlier to avoid traffic congestion.Khalid said such reports would only encourage lawlessness by telling people not to obey police instructions. “I request this stops because it won’t bring any good to the society or country – instigating people into lawlessness,” he said.",Anthony Lim
2015-12-20,DRIVEN: Porsche Cayenne facelift – to Johor and back,"En route to the local launch event of , Sime Darby Auto Performance (SDAP) was kind enough to grant us a test drive down and back in its new, facelifted Porsche Cayenne. Of the seven variants that , three were handpicked for our outing.Specifically, we were given a go in the new  Porsche Cayenne V6, the similarly-priced Cayenne Diesel, and the  Cayenne S. The variants effectively form the cheaper-end of the , leaving behind the remaining RM770k S E-Hybrid, RM780k S Diesel, RM900k GTS and the range-topping RM1.15 million Turbo.To briefly recap, the facelifted Cayenne saw the introduction of subtle exterior and interior enhancements. Up front, a reshaped bumper and redesigned headlamps were added. At the rear, the tail lights were made slimmer, with new graphics for a more modern look. Several other items like its rear bumper and tailgate were also tweaked.Lined up in front of us, these three variants look near identical to each other. Yes, all cars here have been specified very similarly, inside and out, save for their powertrain differences and a few other minor items.Without having to peek around the car to glance at their variant designations, the Cayenne Diesel is probably the easiest one to distinguish. It uses the standard bi-xenon headlamps that exclude the new daytime running lights with four LED spotlights. Those are, however, standard fare on the two other petrol variants.Another feature that sets the sole diesel apart from the two petrol variants are the Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) seen on the Cayenne V6 and S. The extra stopping power is optional, so keep in mind that full prices of these cars are expectedly higher than what’s listed above.The Cayenne Diesel also features dual exhaust tips, while the V6 and S get quad finishers. Wheels are identical across the board, being the optional 21-inch multi-spoke alloys in different paint finishes for each variant, all wrapped in 295/35 tyres. Smaller diameter 18-inch alloys are otherwise standard.With several upholstery colour options available, showcased here are three unique interior variations. The Cayenne Diesel is unquestionably the most ostentatious of the bunch, featuring red over black leather with contrasting red stitching on the leather-covered dashboard.The facelifted Cayenne also features a new 918 Spyder-inspired steering wheel that now includes proper shift paddles. Owners of the pre-facelifted model may recall the thumb-operated shifters of old. The new Cayenne also gets a set of reshaped seats that as promised, offer more back support.As before, the Porsche’s centre console is jam-packed with switches. It’s all beautifully crafted and give passengers instant one-touch access to almost every function of the car. However, working the controls isn’t easy while driving. Something as supposedly mindless as setting the climate control becomes a daunting task if you’re not familiar with the layout.Just like the cluttered centre console, drivers unfamiliar with the Cayenne may also find the five-binnacle instrument panel to be a bit overkill, initially. Four of the dials are analogue gauges, while one is a full digital display. The full-colour screen can call upon navigation, audio, trip data and several more key car visuals. Just like us, you may question its appearance at first. Give it some time and you’ll soon mould your intuition around it.There isn’t much else we could say about the rest of the cabin, apart from it being gorgeously crafted and sufficiently spacious. As ever, there isn’t a flaw about the standard of build quality here either. Personally, my only grief with the interior surrounds the cluttered centre console. A BMW iDrive-like system would definitely free up some space.The Cayenne Diesel features an updated 3.0 litre turbodiesel V6 engine that makes five hp more than before, for a total 245 hp and 550 Nm of torque. Its performance figures include a 0 to 100 km/h time of 7.3 seconds and a top speed of 221 km/h. Notably, all cars here feature the carry-over eight-speed Tiptronic S torque converter automatic transmission.The base petrol model’s 3.6 litre naturally-aspirated V6 has an unchanged 300 hp and 400 Nm of torque. On paper, the petrol-powered Cayenne is a tad slower than its diesel counterpart, clocking 7.6 seconds (Sport Chrono Package included) in its run up to 100 km/h from standstill.As introduced on the facelift cycle, the Cayenne S gets a new 3.6 litre twin-turbo V6 that replaces the previous normally-aspirated V8. Despite the fewer cylinders, turbocharging has left the Cayenne S with a steady 420 hp and 550 Nm of torque. It performs the century sprint in just 5.5 seconds, and has a top speed of 259 km/h.We were quick to single-out the Cayenne Diesel as a firm favourite, purely because of its on-paper bang-for-your-buck value. The Diesel has more than enough power listed, is styled next to no differently, and offers as much standard kit as the other two variants, bar the differences in power.Having driven the three back-to-back and several times over, it was the Cayenne Diesel’s powertrain that had us pulled. The diesel mill was immensely quick off the line and had good low- to mid-RPM torque. It’s an ideal package for city dwellers who enjoy lots of power at their toe tips.On highways, there’s healthy power delivery all the way up to 130 km/h. The diesel starts to lose its bite past that mark, but will still soldier on to higher speeds – only with a little less aggression as diesels do. This is where the petrol duo may excel, but they are not without faults of their own.The base Cayenne variant struggles to match the diesel’s brute force at lower speeds and thereafter still appears a little bit underwhelming for a Porsche SUV. The more powerful Cayenne S on the other hand, seems to have it all. But unless you plan on breaking speed limits on trips across state lines every other day, the RM120k premium over the Cayenne diesel wouldn’t feel justified.The full Sport Chrono Package with the additional Sport Plus drive mode was optionally added to the base Cayenne V6 petrol variant. The variable exhaust flap made a beastly noise and the Sport Plus button could summon every ounce of power available to it. Still, the effortless low-range power delivery of the Diesel remains this writer’s choice.Regardless of which variant you choose, the Cayenne is still a proper Porsche when it comes to holding its own in the corners. Despite its size and weight, lateral roll is kept to a minimum without sacrificing too much comfort, and the front wheels track corners surprisingly well. You should also know that all variants in this review were equipped with the optional Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) system.Again, do expect to cough up a fair bit of change for the air suspension. Dry your pockets doing so, however, and you aren’t likely to regret its significantly positive influence over the Cayenne’s handling and comfort. The PASM features an automatic ride-levelling function and has adjustable ground clearance for when a spot of off-roading is required.Unfortunately, we weren’t taken off-road to explore the PASM and all-wheel drive system’s capabilities. On the road, the dynamic features allow the Cayenne to switch from comfort cruising to tarmac abusing at the flick of a switch.With the drive mode set to Sport, the SUV is relentlessly hard and back-breaking, yet very rewarding under track-like situations. The steering is weighted too lightly for an SUV of this size and doesn’t do much to encourage you to drive more quickly. Although, some confidence is won back by the awesome stopping power provided by the optional Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB).Sadly, only the two petrol powered models here were specified with the PCCB system, leaving the Diesel with the standard discs at all fours. Porsche’s official technical materials also show that the Cayenne Diesel is fitted with a different Porsche Traction Management (PTM) all-wheel drive system to the other petrol variants.Simply put, all Cayenne models are capable of variably splitting engine torque between the front and rear axles. The only difference is that the Diesel relies on a more mechanical, self-locking differential PTM system to achieve this.The Cayenne V6 and S variants get a more advanced system. Its PTM combines the use of an electronically variable, map-controlled multi-plate clutch, an automatic brake differential (ABD) and anti-slip regulation (ASR) to achieve its resultsOn a circuit, yes, the petrol-powered Cayenne may run away with a slight advantage. But on more routine scenarios, we doubt that anyone will notice the difference. The Cayenne Diesel will still burst out of an intersection with as much traction as anyone would expect from a performance SUV.This writer isn’t prepared to go as far as to call the Cayenne an ideal family SUV. Likewise, Porsche doesn’t quite plainly position the car as such. It’s a performance SUV, anywhere you look in the line-up.Even with everything dialled back to optimise comfort, its ride is still too firm, further exaggerated by our terribly uneven roads. All that surrounds you in the Cayenne’s cabin serves as a reminder that this is a Porsche and that it loves to be driven quickly, all the time.Would I spend more than half-a-million ringgit on this to tour my family around? Maybe not. But should I be so lucky to one day require making a “statement” on wheels, then yes, the Cayenne Diesel with the optional sports exhaust and those 21-inch wheels would do very nicely, indeed.",Chris Aaron

2015-12-21,Perodua offers nitrogen tyre inflation – RM15.90,"has announced that it will be offering a new nitrogen tyre inflation service. Priced from RM15.90 per fill for all four tyres, the service is said to be available at selected service centres nationwide.But, why nitrogen? There are lots of benefits for filling your tyres with nitrogen. For one, tyre pressure is said to be retained for much longer that regular air. As a result of keeping your tyre pressures staying up, you also maintain better fuel efficiency than tyres which are under-inflated, or become that way without your notice.However, nitrogen tyres are generally believed to be best used in performance vehicles or race cars. Formula 1 racers, for example, rely on nitrogen to fill up their tyres largely because the substance is more stable under intensely hot conditions. It doesn’t change pressure under varying levels of intense heat, and also maintains that pressure for much longer than regular air could.According to its promotional materials, Perodua also claims that with nitrogen-filled tyres, you will also release less CO2 emissions into the air for driving with the right tyre pressures – a side effect also burning less fuel. It also lists better handling and improved braking performance, as well as longer tyre life spans.So, will you be filling up your tyres with nitrogen? Don’t be too surprised to see a few extra Nissan GT-Rs trying to do the same at your Perodua service centres next time you’re there.",Chris Aaron
2015-12-21,Acura Precision Concept previews future sedan styling,"With sharp lines and distinctive design features such as “Jewel Eye” LED headlights and beak-like grille, the latest Acuras are far from the typical boring styling descriptors like “milquetoast” and “middle of the road.” That hasn’t stopped Honda’s luxury brand from wanting to create a more striking design language for its cars, and will be unveiling a new Acura Precision Concept at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show to showcase it.Set to presage the styling of future Acura sedans, the Precision Concept certainly catches the eye, at least in the sole teaser image provided. The profile flows from the slim -style headlights, up along the long bonnet and over the sleek glasshouse, before terminating at a short tail. Strong haunches and a plunging shoulder line give the car added presence.The more premium BMW-like proportions suggest that the engine could at least be positioned longitudinally behind the front wheels, rather than transversely as on current models. However, the brand’s next sedans would probably still feature front-wheel drive as standard ( Audi), with the famed Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) offered as an option.“The Acura Precision Concept will signal the stronger and sharper focus of Acura styling on our core DNA we call ‘precision crafted performance’,” said global creative director Dave Marek. “It is our intention to more strongly express performance through design and the Acura Precision Concept will serve as the inspiration for the styling and proportion of the next-generation of Acura vehicles, especially for our sedans.”As the Acura lineup is still pretty fresh, it’s unclear which production sedan will be the torchbearer for the new design language. The oldest sedan in the stable is the -based , first introduced in 2012 and given a refresh last year. Could the next ILX grow into a more bespoke sports sedan, or does the Precision Concept foreshadow an entirely new entry altogether?",Jonathan Lee

Not yet, because I want to hit some of the other objectives first.” Nissan apparently plans to improve on the GT-R’s creature comforts, including a premium leather interior and high-end sound system.“I want to make the GT-R more premiere.

Something beyond that is huge energy to control,” said Tamura. “I don’t want to say anything about the reality of an ‘RS’, because the customer expectation might be 800 hp or 900 hp.“Is that OK for my philosophy on confident driving? Not just safety, but a stable feeling when you hit the gas? That connection is important to me. That’s why for an RS, it’s not so easy,” he said.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-18,"Taxi firm suing Uber, GrabCar for territory infringement","More on the  front, and this time it’s about a taxi company wanting to take the two transportation network companies to court.Earlier in the week,  reported that Big Blue Capital – the company behind Premium Big Blue Taxi Services – said it is thinking of suing the two ride-sharing service providers for illegally picking up passengers in its territory and using drivers and vehicles not approved by the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD). Big Blue operates its taxi service at Suria KLCC.Big Blue owner and adviser Datuk Shamsubahrin Ismail said the issue would be discussed in depth and brought to court in the next two weeks. He was speaking to reporters at a press briefing in which he also said that the upcoming .“We are suing them for trespassing, conducting illegal activities in our area, and allowing vehicles and drivers not approved by SPAD to pick up passengers,” he said, adding that there would not have been an issue had Uber and GrabCar worked with his company and used its taxis instead.“We let all taxis operate here (Suria KLCC), but first they must register with us for the record in case anything happens. Secondly, they must use the meter,” he said, saying this was for the benefit of passengers and their safety.“The public cannot think cheap all the time. You come to our counter, you want safety for your family, you have to pay for it. But if you don’t want to have safety, you have to go elsewhere,” he explained. He added that taxis were required to adhere to standards set by the SPAD and Puspakom, unlike the ride-sharing services.",Anthony Lim

2015-12-18,Ford to start testing autonomous vehicles in California,"Autonomous vehicles is the buzzword in the car world these days and plenty of testing is currently being done, from Tokyo to California. Among others,  and  are trying out self-driving cars in Japan while Kia recently received a special licence by the state of Nevada to  in the US state. Non carmakers like  are also in the frame. Now, Ford has secured California’s autonomous vehicle driving permit to begin testing the fully autonomous  Hybrid on public roads next year. This is part of Ford’s 10-year autonomous vehicle development programme and a key element of Ford Smart Mobility, the plan to take the company to the next level in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, customer experience, and data and analytics.Ford Research and Innovation Center Palo Alto is one of the largest automotive manufacturer research centres in the region, with a team of more than 100 engineers and scientists. A new research lab opened in January, expanding Ford’s presence in Silicon Valley that dates back to 2012. 80% of the Palo Alto team joined Ford from the tech sector; the remaining 20% are Ford employees from the US, China, Germany and Australia who bring automotive engineering and design expertise.Research that has been conducted in Palo Alto this past year includes virtual interaction between an autonomous car and pedestrians, sensors that detect and track objects in the vehicle’s view, and camera-based pedestrian detection.",Danny Tan
2015-12-18,That year that was – a 2015 Superbike roundup,"The year 2015 was an interesting one for the litre-bike class, as manufacturers kept upping the ante. Buyers were spoilt for choice as technology from both the MotoGP and WSBK championships trickled down into the showrooms. The horsepower war also heated up, with most manufacturers claiming their litre bikes to be pumping out at least 200 hp. This roundup is an overview of what some of the majors offered in 2015, and is presented in no particular order.Perhaps the bike with the closest DNA to its race sibling, the Yamaha R1 brought a full suite of electronic rider aids and controls to the everyday rider. With Yamaha’s proprietary six-axis inertial-measurement unit (IMU), the bike’s movement is measured and transmitted to the Ride Control processor, that then controlled power delivery, traction, and so on. Settings are fully-customisable on the dashboard.The 998cc inline-four appreciates an aggressive hand on the throttle, with the EFI perfectly mapped for everything from dawdling around town to carving the canyons. The R1 went on a diet as well, with an all-new aluminium Deltabox frame mated to a magnesium sub-frame, dropping the weight by 15 kg overall. Since the previous model wasn’t exactly a fatty, this is a significant saving in weight, and a credit to Yamaha’s engineering team.Make no mistake, the Yamaha R1 is very much a track weapon, and has perhaps the most aggressive riding position compared to the others. The bars are tight and are a long reach from the seat, letting the rider tuck under the tall screen. As suits a bike designed for the track, the KYB suspension is stiff on the road.The Yamaha YZF-R1 retails for RM126,000 while the race-ready R1M with carbon-fibre bodywork will drain your wallet for RM159,000.How far can you push a V-twin? The 1299 Panigale answers that question with, “a very long way.” Ducati made some major revisions to the Panigale in 2015, including fitting the slightly more comfortable seat from the 899. The fairing was also made slightly wider, to increase rider comfort.The one thing the Panigale offers over other superbikes is the gob-smacking torque at lower engine revs, great for rocketing out of corners. This point may seem moot in these days of traction control and ride modes, but there’s no mistaking the rush of seamless V-twin torque propelling the bike from leaned over to upright in the blink of an eye.In an effort to tame the slightly twitchy front-end, the bars are a little wider-set compared to other superbikes. Although not as wide as cruiser bars, the difference is noticeable, but aids control. The Brembo brakes as fitted are a perfect complement to the 1299 Panigale’s performance.Ducatis have always been at home on the track, and rewards fast riders with a smooth throttle hand. They can be hard work to ride, but the 1299 rewards rider input with a mind-blowing ride.Official Ducati distributor Next Bike only imports the Ducati 1299 Panigale S, which has an on-the-road price of RM193,000. The Aprilia RSV4 has been going great guns in WSBK, winning three titles since 2009. The RSV4 RR came with a slew of revisions for 2015, including a redesigned airbox that flowed more air with electronically-controlled intake tracts, and a reworked top end with reshaped combustion chambers and lighter titanium valves.The V-four is claimed to put out 201 hp at the crank, which translates to about 160 or 170 real-world hp. The swingarm was lengthened to improve stability and launches.A complete suite of electronic rider aids comes standard, with revised programming. These include launch control, wheel spin control, and on-board telemetry that talks to a smartphone app.The Aprilia RSV4 comes in three different flavours. The RSV4 RF SuperPole is race ready and retails at RM138,800. The RSV4 Factory and RSV4 R retail at RM110,000 and RM75,000 respectively.Honda has been going great guns in MotoGP, with Marquez winning in 2015, somewhat controversially in Sepang. The CBR1000RR has obviously benefited from Honda Racing Corporation’s (HRC) involvement in top-flight racing.The CBR1000RR came with a revised cylinder head for 2015 that bumped up hp and torque. While there were no revolutionary design changes for the year, Honda’s PGM-DSFI fuel injection was closely mapped to the revised head, giving better throttle response at low engine speeds.The Showa suspension front and rear gives added control and feel during hard cornering, and the rear shock featured a valveless damper design to allow for smoother damping and shock movement.  A full complement of electronics is fitted into the dash, including a lap timer.There were no huge changes for Suzuki’s big boy in 2015, aside from a slightly more over-square engine and a revised electronics suite. Suzuki’s renewed commitment to both MotoGP and WSBK has allowed for the development of an all-new 2016 model, which was unveiled at EICMA in Milan.The twin-spar aluminium frame has been reworked slightly to give more stiffness at track speeds, while the suspension remains largely unchanged. Perhaps more than its other rivals, the GSX-R performs well under almost all riding conditions. The suspension and brakes are very road-friendly, but give sterling service on the track. Riding position is also not as extreme as other superbikes that are more track-focused, but still along for rider control at high speed.The big Gixxer retails for a base price of RM91,000 before GST, tax and insurance.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-18,India bans sale of diesel vehicles in Delhi region,"In a radical move to combat against pollution in New Delhi, India’s Supreme Court has ordered a temporary ban on the sale of large diesel cars in Delhi and the surrounding region. The ban, which comes into immediate effect, will last until March 31, 2016.The mandate passed by the courts affects the sales of diesel vehicles with an engine capacity of 2,000 cc or more, and comes after India’s National Green Tribunal requested for a month-long ban on the registration of all diesel cars to help clean up the air in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world.The court said the order will not impact India’s “common man,” according to a  report. However, it did prohibit trucks from passing through the city to reach other states, while trucks that were more than 10 years old are banned from New Delhi altogether. Trucks making deliveries to Delhi itself are required to pay a now-doubled charge of 2,600 rupees (RM168).Other measures to counter the toxic smog in the city include replacing diesel taxis with natural gas-powered ones, along with a prohibition on burning solid waste. Come January next year, the courts will decide upon a green tax levied on all diesel cars sold in the country. The move has received the support from environmentalists, who are pushing for the order to be extended beyond Delhi to other cities that are experiencing high levels of air pollution as well. Analysts however say that this move could be detrimental to the automotive industry.According to data from the Society of Indian Automotive Manufacturers, until March this year, 37% of all passenger vehicles sold in India were diesel variants, while 90% of SUVs or other utility vehicles sold last year are diesel-powered, mainly because the fuel is cheaper than petrol.The Delhi region, for instance, accounts for almost a quarter of Mercedes-Benz’s sales in the country. The ban would “severely impact” growth plans and future investment in India, claimed the German marque. “We also have to consider the loss of jobs that this will result (in) at the dealerships, at the vendors producing diesel engines,” a spokesman said in an emailed statement.",Gerard Lye
2015-12-18,SPYSHOTS: 2017 BMW 5 Series GT spotted in the cold,"The second-generation BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo has been sighted by our European spy photographers as it undergoes testing in snowy conditions. The test mule seen here sports the familiar camouflage as seen in .Up front, the new 5 Series GT appears to sport a slightly resized version of BMW’s trademark kidney grille. The heavy camo may do well to conceal the more minor changes on the hatchback, but it can’t hide the sleeker roofline that appears to extend a little further towards the rear. This modification sees the bootlid positioned lower than on the current F07 5 GT. The profile of the test mule also suggests a lower ride height as well. The split-opening tailgate/bootlid of the current car is expected to feature on the new car as well.However, with the new 5 GT set to adopt BMW’s new modular and more versatile Cluster Architecture (CLAR) platform (previously referred to as 35up), the hatchback could see revisions made to its interior spaciousness and cargo space.Said platform also underpins the all-new  and . As the former adopts BMW’s new Carbon Core construction that incorporates lightweight materials like carbon fibre into the chassis, the new 5 Series GT could shed almost 100 kg off of the outgoing’s model’s kerb weight.Under the hood, the 5 Series GT should be offered with four-, six- and eight-cylinder engines, which will also be part of the G30 5 Series powerplant range. As the CLAR platform was developed with hybridisation in mind, a Power eDrive plug-in hybrid variant of the 5 GT could be on the cards as well.",Gerard Lye

Like its four-door sibling, the new , the new A5’s design looks to be more evolutionary rather than a complete overhaul.

2015-12-18,Mazda is the most fuel efficient brand in the US – EPA,"The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released its annual “Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends” report that ranks manufacturers based on their fleetwide adjusted fuel economy performance, as well as CO2 emissions. This year’s report saw Asian automakers dominate the list of most efficient brands.The EPA report only considers model year (MY) 2014 cars sold in the country, with MY 2014 fuel economy averaging 10.33 km/l, while CO2 emissions averaged 227 g/km. Preliminary values suggest that most manufacturers will improve in MY 2015 as well, though these projections are uncertain, as the EPA does not have final MY 2015 data until next year’s report.On to the number crunching then, with  topping the charts this year, with an average fuel economy rating of 12.5 km/l, an improvement of 0.55 km/l from the year before (11.95 km/l). CO2 emissions also saw a decline to 188 g/km from 196 g/km. This is followed by Subaru (11.73 km/l; 199 g/km) and Hyundai (11.69 km/l; 201 g/km). The full list, with MY 2015 projections can be viewed here:As you can tell, only BMW had a better year-over-year improvement, occupying the sixth spot with an average fuel economy of 11.22 km/l, 0.81 km/l less than the year before. C02 emissions also dropped by 16 g/km down to 210 g/km. Note that the US uses miles per gallon (mpg) to measure FC and g/mile to measure C02, instead of our km/l (or l/100 km) and g/km.American automakers Ford, GM and Fiat-Chrysler meanwhile, occupied the bottom three spots in the top 12 list. However, as the EPA’s report takes into account a fleetwide snapshot, this puts Detroit’s Big Three at an unfair advantage, with pick-up trucks being a major part of their vehicle line-ups. The same can be said about other automakers on the list as well.For next year’s report, the EPA predicts Mazda to retain its place at the top, with  harping in close behind it, followed by Subaru and Nissan (fifth place for MY 2014). With more fuel efficient vehicles and the push for electric vehicles in the future, the EPA expects manufacturers to improve upon their results in time for next year’s report.",Gerard Lye

Repairs are set to start early next year.The fixes are for VW’s 1.2 litre, 1.6 litre and 2.0 litre TDI engines; and Germany’s KBA motor transport authority approval applies across the European Union’s 28 national markets. As previously reported, there will be , only fixes.“After the measures have been implemented, the vehicles will fulfill the duly applicable emissions standards, with the aim of achieving this without any impairment of engine output, fuel consumption or performance,” VW said in a statement.The 1.2L and 2.0L engines will get a software upgrade that will take about 30 minutes of labour time. The 1.6L engine will need that plus the installation of a piece of mesh to regulate air flow. Less than an hour for the latter, VW says. Affected vehicles will be called in by batches. The 2.0L kicks things off in Q1 2016 before the 1.2L fixes start at the end of Q2. The 1.6L will be recalled in the third quarter.

2015-12-17,2016 Ducati XDiavel cruiser brings out the devil in you,"While Ducati has always been synonymous with high performance racetrack weapons, the 2016 XDiavel is its foray into the lucrative cruiser market. The previous incarnation of the Diavel, launched in 2011, was something of a disappointment, failing to sell well in the its target American market.The 2016 XDiavel is a different kettle of fish. Featuring a new liquid-cooled 1262 cc Testastretta V-twin, Ducati raised the stakes with the addition of its Desmodromic Variable Timing (DVT) system.  First seen in the 2015 Multistrada, Ducati’s DVT pushes the torque curve lower down the rev range.  Lower is relative in this case, since the 128 Nm of torque comes in at 5000 rpm, a point which most other cruiser engines don’t even reach.Major changes for the XDiavel include belt drive, seen as necessary for the US market. The low maintenance and noise level of the belt drive makes up for the reduction in power. Since the XDiavel’s target market doesn’t place much emphasis on power numbers, this makes sound marketing sense.  Other changes include tucking away the water pump, and hiding the coolant hoses, giving that “air-cooled” look favoured by the cruiser demographic. The trellis frame is very much front and center, tying the bike back to the famous Ducati racing heritage.Visually the XDiavel doesn’t break new ground, in the mold of the “streetfighter” style.  The four-position adjustable forward-set pegs are different for Ducati though, which has always favoured a sportier riding position for their bikes, rider comfort be damned.  Additionally, Ducati offers five different seat options, and three different handlebars for the XDiavel to help optimise rider position. Perhaps the greatest surprise is the lean angle the XDiavel is capable of, some 40 degrees, which would not put it out of place with some commuter and sport-touring bikes. The bike also includes a host of Ducati bike tech, including selectable riding modes, ABS, traction control, cruise control and fly-by-wire throttle.  There are two options available, the base XDiavel and the XDiavel S, which features gloss paint. Ducati has not confirmed a price for the XDiavel as yet, and deliveries are expected to start in February 2016.",Mohan K Ramanujam

Datuk Abdul Aziz Kaprawi, Deputy Transport Minister, stated that these services are operating in a legal (unregulated) grey area at the moment.He added that the ministry will soon conduct a workshop on the matter with the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD), with a report to be published after. “Among the factors that must be adhered to by these ride-sharing services is that they must possess a valid licence to offer this service and ensure their vehicles are checked periodically at Puspakom,” he said.SPAD is currently in the process of  that will allow them to take direct action against these ride-sharing app providers (Uber and GrabCar). With private vehicle owners offering transport services through these apps, often times without valid permits and licences, this has sparked an outcry from regular taxi drivers.However, the government recognises the popularity of these ride-sharing services, especially among the youth, hence it is paying close attention to the issue. The study of possible regulations for the emerging industry is among the steps taken for the continued existence of these services.To appease the  of unfair competition from , Abdul Aziz also said Putrajaya will consider easing existing regulations for taxi firms and drivers to provide some cost savings to the two parties, including the extension of the compulsory vehicle inspection period from six months to one year. A new mini-taxi system could also be part of the regulation revamp. Do you welcome this move by the Transport Ministry to introduce regulations for ride-sharing services in the country? Would such a move appease regular taxi drivers who feel like they have an unfair advantage compared to Uber and GrabCar drivers? Let us know what you think in the comments below.",Gerard Lye

2015-12-18,VIP convoys with police escort – must you give way?,"Recently, a posting by a motorist about not giving way to a VIP’s convoy went viral on social media. The subject became intensely debated shortly after, which begs the question, are you required to give way when a VIP convoy is coming through?According to legal expert Datuk Jahaberdeen Mohamad Yunos, the short answer is no, you don’t have to. This is because there is no such law that requires motorists to give way to a VIP convoy on the road. However, each situation has to be scrutinised on a case by case basis, he stated.In a report by , Jahaberdeen said: “We have to look at the situation in order for action to be taken. If the VIP concerned is going for an official meeting and the stationary motorist is preventing him from conducting his job, then yes, he (the motorist) can be forcibly asked to move. But if the VIP is using the road in his personal capacity, then the motorist is not obliged to move and give way to him.”In the December 15 posting, the road user claimed that while driving on the road, several police outriders on motorcycles were ordering motorists to give way to a car which was ferrying a VVIP.The road user however, refused to give way, a move that was matched by the car ahead of him. He applauded the move as Malaysians fighting for their rights, and continued on by stating that he wasn’t angry with police officers who were just performing their duties.Instead, he asked for ministers to “practice what they preach”, as in to leave earlier to avoid traffic congestion. In early November, Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan  to motorists as a way to get around the  by using toll-free roads. posed a question to Kuala Lumpur traffic chief Asst Comm Mohd Nadzri Hussain, asking if any action will be taken against the road user over his posting. He said he would have to verify the situation first before commenting on the issue. So,  Malaysians, what’s your view point on the matter? Do you approve of the road user’s actions, or is this practice of not giving way setting an unhealthy precedent?",Gerard Lye

2015-12-17,Novitec Torado Lamborghini Huracan N-Largo goes live with supercharged V10 – 848 hp and 960 Nm!,"German tuning company Novitec has laid its hands on the Lamborghini Huracan to create a special edition version of the Italian supercar, and as you’d expect, the results are pretty spectacular. Welcome to the Novitec Torado Lamborghini Huracan N-Largo, where only 25 examples will ever exist in the world.If the  naturally-aspirated V10 engine with its 610 hp/560 Nm was a little too tame for you, Novitec has got you sorted. Thanks to a supercharger kit, the total power output has been boosted to a more respectable 848 hp and 960 Nm of torque. That’s a whopping 238 hp and 400 Nm more than the car it is based on. To put that into perspective, those numbers trounce the  that “only” has 770 hp at its disposal. The Huracan N-Largo even has more torque than the . Should the numbers not be enough to emphasis the performance levels of the car, Novitec is offering a lightweight exhaust system as well. The exhaust system employs an alloy used in Formula 1 in its construction, and can be fitted with butterfly valves to further improve the engine’s vocals.To ensure that onlookers are able to differentiate the N-Largo from a regular Huracan, the car is treated to a carbon-fibre wide-body kit that widens the stance of the car by 120 mm more compared to the standard car. Additionally, there is a 35 mm drop in ride height as well, with new sports springs and damper settings implemented for performance purposes.The wider stance also warrants the installation of a new set of wheels, in this case, custom-developed NL2 alloys. The 20- and 21-inch front and rear wheels are fitted with Pirelli P Zero tyres of 245/30ZR21 (front) and 325/25ZR20 (rear) sizes.On top of this, the N-Largo Huracan gets new side skirts, fender flares, bumpers, aerofoil and rear diffuser, all of which have undergone wind tunnel testing. This means that they are designed for something more than aesthetic purposes, improving downforce and high speed stability. Customers can also specify the panels to be done in exposed carbon-fibre, along with a custom interior too.Unfortunately, Novitec did not disclose any performance figures for the N-Largo Huracan. However, we’d expect a faster 0-100 km/h time than the normal car’s 3.2 seconds. Neither did they provide any mention on prices but we reckon this is one of those “if you had to ask” kind of situations. Interested?",Gerard Lye
2015-12-17,Infiniti Drive Malaysia – getting hands-on with safety,"Step into any car showroom today and you’ll be bombarded with a slew of monikers that encompass a wide range of safety technologies. From the anti-lock braking system (ABS) to traction control system (TCS), electronic stability control (ESC) and vehicle dynamic control (VDC), today’s cars carry with them technology that can even automatically apply the brakes to prevent you from accidentally hitting a car directly in front of you.Of course, the salesman at the dealership will do his or her utmost best to convince you that these systems work as advertised. Nonetheless, there will always be skeptics who prefer the age-old “walk the talk” approach when it comes to such systems. It’s only natural for most people to be able to see something happen before they put any faith in them. Show me instead of telling me, right?To demonstrate that its safety systems are capable of doing what is claimed, Infiniti Malaysia recently took it upon itself to set up a driving programme held at Desa Park City, Kuala Lumpur. The two-day event allowed customers and members of the media to experience first-hand, the level of performance and innovation that goes into each Infiniti product.As with most practical driving programmes, the day kicked off with a short briefing, where we were introduced to our instructors for the day. Comprising of professional drivers from around the ASEAN region and beyond, participants were given a breakdown of the day’s activities before being split into separate groups and sent to each station.This writer, along with other members of the media present during the day, were piled into one group. Our first activity, which was a two-part section, involving one of Infiniti’s finest, the , where we will be testing it out its 3.5 litre naturally-aspirated V6 engine and 50 kW electric motor hybrid powertrain, along with its braking capability.The premise of the exercise is simple. Mash the accelerator pedal before braking hard when you enter a stop zone. To introduce a bit of competition, our instructors challenged us to get the car to come to a complete stop before a certain point in said zone, where the person who comes closest to that point will be rewarded. Overshoot that point and you’re disqualified.With a total system output of 364 PS and 546 Nm of torque, deciding when to slam on the brakes in the Q50S Hybrid is no mean feat. The car’s Direct Response Hybrid system allows it to sprint from 0-100 km/h in just 5.1 seconds, so carrying too much speed before braking is certainly a no-no. As our instructors explained, it’s all about getting the feel right and deciding which speed allows you to stop precisely where you can the car to be.Easier said than done then as I found out during my three tries that either involved overshooting the point or braking a tad too early, and coming to a stop a good 50 cm away from the point. The instructors themselves had a go and their best result was 5 cm – an impressive feat indeed. Following each acceleration and braking run, participants were then required to put their faith in the car’s Forward Emergency Braking (FEB) system that is standard on select variants of the Q50, including the , Q50 2.0t GT Premium Sport and Q50S Hybrid. In this hands-on demonstration, we were told to let the car roll towards a wall of crates. As we got closer to the crates, the car’s Predictive Forward Collision Warning (PFCW), with the aid of radar sensors at the front of the car, would beep to indicate that you are in close proximity to an object ahead, i.e., the wall of crates.Normally, you would apply the brakes at this point but what if you didn’t? Well, that’s what we are here to simulate as we strongly fought the urge to stomp on the brake pedal. As the car’s beeps got more frequent, I expected the inevitable “fender bender” with the wall of crates but that was not to be, because the car’s FEB system applied the brakes automatically while the seatbelts were pre-tensioned before the car came to a complete stop, all without any human intervention.On more than one occasion, the car did come into contact with the crates but the fault is with the driver, as our instructors explained. Should your foot lightly tap the brake pedal, the system detects and comes to a consensus that the driver is in control of the car, and thus disables the FEB system. Remember, this is a passive system that kicks into action during unintended incidents, i.e. dozing off while in traffic.After the first heart-stopping activity was concluded, we were given a short break to refresh, before being led to the gymkhana course. Here, we were told that we will be experiencing Infiniti’s Direct Adaptive Steering (DAS), the world’s first steer-by-wire system fitted on a production vehicle. The system is a result of more than 10 years of research and promised many benefits.Firstly, a little background info on the DAS. The steering system in the Q50 consists of three electronic control units (ECUs). These transmit the input from the wheel to the front wheels via data streams, instead of a traditional method of a having a physical shaft linking them. Two motors are responsible for generating the appropriate steering force and controlling the steering angle based on the driver’s input.Even though the steering is completely digital almost all of the time, Infiniti didn’t forgo the conventional steering mechanism altogether in the Q50. There is still a mechanical linkage but unless the steer-by-wire system fails, which isn’t likely as the three ECUs act as a backup for each other, a clutch disengages the steering wheel to the steering rack under normal conditions. Infiniti say the DAS system provides a comfortable ride and handling feel akin to driving on a smooth pavement surface, even though the vehicle is riding on grooved or rough roads. This means that drivers will not have to endure sudden jolts coming through the steering, as the system isolates these road disturbances and surface changes, improving straight-line ability.The system is even customisable, depending on your preference. If you’d like a heavier steering feel or a quicker response, simply key in the settings via the Q50’s touchscreen unit and you’re set. Obviously, we had to put the system through its paces and before being introduced to DAS, we set off in the entry-level Q50 2.0t GT (white car) that does not come with said system.Driving through the tight gymkhana course was a bit of a challenge, as the steering was still a little heavy to direct the car through each turn quick enough. Even riding through the bumps, I had to adjust my steering to ensure the car remained straight and true due to the shocks introduced to the steering wheel.Jumping into the silver Q50 2.0t GT Premium that comes standard with DAS and 18-inch five-spoke wheels, the differences were immediately apparent. Not only could I adjust the steering to respond quicker to suit the course, but while driving over the bumps, the car continued on its straight course, with zero “kickback” feel coming through the steering as the above video shows.After both car park activities were accomplished, the final day’s activity involved a short road drive in a selection of Infiniti cars, including the Q50, QX70 crossover and the behemoth that is the QX80. My driving partner and I decided to go with the Q50 that packed features such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and prevention, blind spot warning and distance control assist. On the 50 km route, our Q50 managed to keep a safe distance while adjusting its speed to match the car ahead on the highway. The car also warned us of any surrounding cars (blind spot included) whenever we indicated to switch lanes. It even lightly intervened to keep the car in lane with the aid of a camera at the front tracking the white lines on the highway. Should you try to switch lanes without using the indicators, the car will assume that you are drifting away from the lane and through the DAS, will ensure to keep the car on track, a little startling at first.The Infiniti Drive was certainly an eye-opener to the technologies that can be found in Infiniti’s vehicles. To be able to experience these systems in action is certainly a wonderful treat, knowing that they make your daily drive just that bit more convenient and pleasant, and safeguarding you during emergency situations.",Gerard Lye

2015-12-17,"VIDEO: Vozz RS 1.0, a new way of keeping your lid on","Vozz Helmets from Australia has a new take on the way motorcycle helmets are designed. Eschewing the traditional top-down entry and chin straps that have been used for over one hundred years, the Vozz RS 1.0 helmet features a hinged rear entry that eliminates the need for a chin strap.Called the Voztec system, Vozz claims this design allows for a smaller entry hole, allowing for a closer fit around the rider’s chin and neck. It is additionally claimed that this allows for an inner shell that follows the rider’s head shape closely, giving a safer and more comfortable fit.While a tighter, closer fit is better, the Vozz design doesn’t allow for one-handed removal of the helmet. The double lock design and adjustable chin cup allows medical personnel to remove the helmet safely in case of mishaps, while eliminating the tendency of the helmet to come of the rider’s head on impact.The Vozz RS 1.0 is DOT and ECE certified, and is available online at RM3,800.

2015-12-18,VIDEO: Lotus Exige Sport 350 makes lightness a virtue,"The famous Colin Chapman mantra, “simplify, then add lightness” is still alive at Hethel, it seems, with the new  – and the company is keen to stress that with a new video, showing how its latest offering shed the kilos.Replacing the , the Sport 350 drops 51 kg over its predecessor – plenty when the old car weighed just 1,175 kg in the first place. The savings come courtesy of, among many other changes, a louvred rear engine cover (-3 kg), an exposed gearshift design (-1.5 kg) and lighter HVAC piping (-3 kg). The battery and engine mounts are also lighter, while the sound insulation has been optimised for even more weight-shedding.The result is a kerb weight of just 1,125 kg, or 1,115 kg with the optional lightweight forged alloy wheels and vented two-piece brake discs. Although the Toyota-sourced supercharged 3.5 litre VVT-i V6 – producing 345 hp at 7,000 rpm and 400 Nm of torque at 4,500 rpm – is unchanged, the drop in weight has enabled the Sport 350 to sprint from 0-100 km/h in just 3.9 seconds, a tenth of a second faster than the Exige S.That’s with the standard, heavily-revised six-speed manual transmission from the ; with the optional six-speed auto, the car does the 0-100 km/h sprint slightly quicker at 3.8 seconds, but is accompanied by a lower top speed (261 km/h vs 274 km/h) and an extra 5 kg in weight.

2015-12-17,"Porsche 718 Boxster initial specs revealed: two turbo flat-fours offered, 295 hp/350 Nm and 355 hp/400 Nm","Porsche recently announced a new naming strategy for the upcoming Boxster and Cayman facelift models, dubbed the . The announcement was accompanied by news that the  will debut in these models. However, no preliminary details pertaining to these new engine are available, until now.According to a report by , who had the privilege of testing the new Boxster, the model will be offered with two versions of the  petrol engines. Both are developed from the new turbocharged flat-six engine (9A2B6T) that was made for the .The new turbo flat-four (9A2B4T) essentially drops two cylinders from the engine it is based on to fit the turbo unit. Fitted to the Boxster tested by  is the base 2.0 litre unit that is boosted by a single turbo to provide 295 hp and 350 Nm. The engine’s bore and stroke dimensions are 91 mm and 76.4 mm, respectively, while retaining the same cylinder pitch as that in the 911.A higher-spec Boxster S model will also be offered, where its engine is expected to have a larger bore and stroke, increasing engine capacity to around 2.4 or 2.5 litres. The larger engine is said to feature Porsche’s Variable Turbine Geometry , and is estimated to provide 355 hp and 400 Nm. With both engines listed, it appears that the existence of a smaller 1.6 litre unit is unlikely.Performance-wise, the new Boxster is said to have top speed exceeding 280 km/h, with the 0-100 km/h sprint accomplished in a claimed 5.5 seconds. As for the the Boxster S, it will make the same century sprint a tad quicker at 5.0 seconds. By comparison, the current Boxster’s a 2.7 litre naturally-aspirated flat-six pushes 265 hp and 280 Nm, while the Boxster S and its 3.5 litre NA flat-six outputs 315 hp and 360 Nm. According to Matthias Hofstetter, powertrain development head for the Boxster and Cayman, the new engines will benefit from a water-cooled intercooler that reduces turbo air temperature from 160 degrees Celcius to 50 degrees Celcius. They will also be held in place by four active engine mounts and mated to either a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch auto or a six-speed manual gearbox.As you can clearly see, the upcoming model trounces the current one in terms of power. However, the new model undergoes a weight gain from 1,315 kg to 1,400 kg thanks to its turbo bits. The current Cayman also shares the same engine of the present Boxster, albeit tuned for more power. The 718 Cayman is expected to follow this same path too.In the looks department, the exterior changes are minor for the 718 Boxster, with newly shaped wings, side panel air intakes and rear spoiler.

2015-12-17,VIDEO: 2016 Toyota Prius – from green car to drift car,"The fourth-generation Toyota Prius first broke cover in Las Vegas just a . Since that time, opinions has been split on the reinvigorated eco-car. Whether you’re a lover or hater of the all-new Prius, Toyota has released this new video dubbed “Beyond Possible – Follow your heart” to convert the latter to become the former, and keep the faithful entertained.In the sub two-minute clip, we are first introduced to a Prius that is in the midst of being put together. Shortly after, we are told the car will “awaken the senses” before being shown glimpses of the car’s exterior design, which is said to be inspired by . This is followed by what we presume to be a professional driver walking towards and getting into the car, as he will soon “push the boundaries” of what a Prius can do. If you were expecting a fuel-saving cruise sequence, this video will disappoint you severely.Resembling a variation of Ken Block’s Gymkhana video series, the Prius goes on a charge on the roads, power-sliding across asphalt or gravel. During the action-packed sequence, Toyota has included some pre-production test footage to highlights among other things, the car’s low drag coefficient of 0.24, winter testing and its new Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA).However, this isn’t just a video that places an emphasis on the wild side of the . The Japanese automaker also instilled a bit of subliminal messaging related to the environment-loving vehicle, as you can tell at the 1:33 mark of the video.So, if you’re tired of the common “Chris Harris drifting a LaFerrari” type of video, this should serve to be a worthy alternative, don’t you think?

2015-12-17,Kawasaki supercharges into the future with the SC-02,"Supercharging is apparently going to feature strongly in Kawasaki’s line-up. The unveiling of a sketch by Kenji Tomida, President of Kawasaki Motorcycle & Engine Company at the EICMA show in Milan last month showed the SC-02 “Soul Charger” concept motorcycle.  Complementing the Concept SC-01 which was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in October, the SC-02 features what Tomida calls the “scalability” of the supercharger in Kawasaki’s range of motorcycles. Following the launch of the H2 and H2R in the litre bike class in 2014, he said the design could be down-sized and applied to a smaller engine, perhaps 600 cc.Kawasaki’s concept bikes have usually been about performance, and the SC-02 is no different, showing an aggressive style meant for fast and short sprints. From the sketches, it appears the supercharger is fed by a fresh air intake from the left side, giving the bike a heavily asymmetrical look.Of note is the supercharger itself. The amount of air entering the charger is controlled by a shutter valve system, almost like the petals of a camera lens. At small throttle openings, the ECU restricts the amount of air coming in, improving rideability and fuel consumption.The styling is in the retro streetfighter look very much in vogue today, tied together by a silver, black and brown paint scheme. Tomida was silent if either the SC-01 or SC-02 would ever make it off the drawing board, but promised several new models would be forthcoming from Kawasaki in 2017 and 2018.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-17,Camal Ramusa concept – the birth of the hyper-SUV,"Italian design centre Camal Studio has come up with the Ramusa, a hybrid concept that bridges the supercar to that of a super-crossover, or something along those lines. Dubbed as a hyper-SUV, the study is claimed by the design studio to be the first concept of its kind derived from a pure sports layout.The Ramusa is shaped like a supercar, complete with a two-seat and mid-engined layout, but features increased ride height. Measuring in at 4,320 mm long, 2,020 mm wide and 1,300 mm high, the vehicle offers a ground clearance of 250 mm, and in keeping with the crossover leanings, features off-road wheel arches and lots of exposed carbon.The name, which means lizard in the Piedmontese dialect, is a tribute to Nuccio Bertone and design centre Stile Bertone, where Camal founder Alessandro Camorali’s worked early in his career. “Now that Bertone no longer exists, it seems right that someone should bring forward his legacy, also in the tradition of naming the cars from the famous Piedmontese coachbuilder strictly in the local dialect,” Camorali explains.The Ramusa is powered by a 3.5 litre, 60-valve V12 quad turbo taken from the Bugatti EB110, and that’s not all the Camal borrows – the Ramusa also sits on the latter’s carbon chassis and features a number of other components carried over from the Bugatti. Power is driven to the rear wheels via a six-speed gearbox, while a central electric motor powers the front wheels during quick acceleration and limited traction, bringing the total power output to over 800 hp.Camal says the design isn’t just a flight of fancy, but was created with the intention to build a limited production run in the near future.

Despite this, Inoue was able to move the speedometer to the maximum 180 km/h mark even when the car was stationary, and employed a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack to paralyse the car, making it unable to move.And while Inoue said that cars with no Internet access cannot be hacked through this method, he warned that as manufacturers are equipping vehicles with Internet connectivity for features such as autonomous driving, future cars could be made vulnerable to the exploit. The details of the experiment was shared at a symposium on cyber security in Okinawa this week.“Important [data] communication was in full view from outside. Other cars could also be subject to hacking in the same way,” Inoue said, adding that the data communication in cars needs to be encrypted, and steps have to be taken to protect systems from unauthorised external access.A Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) official said that the industry will cooperate with the government on solving this issue, while Toyota has said that it will continue to work on enhancing protection on information security.",Jonathan Lee

2015-12-17,Jaguar plays waiting game with semi-autonomous cars,"While semi-autonomous driving cars seem to be all the rage with major manufacturers, Jaguar prefers to take a step back and wait to see how the technology develops. It doesn’t mean that Jaguar doesn’t have the tech waiting in the wings. It does, but wants to hold back till issues about safety and reliability are addressed, said XF project manager Stephen Boulter during the launch of the 2016 Jaguar XF on Thursday.Boulter believes such self-driving technology could imbue drivers with a “false sense of security.”  He based this opinion on the fact that the technology has yet to be proven reliable under all weather conditions, and Tesla’s experience with drivers using the semi-autonomous system in ways it was not intended. He said in an interview with  Jaguar already had the system in place, with its Adapative Cruise Control, and all that was needed was the addition of electric steering.In a similar system, the 2016 Jaguar XF is equipped with digital cameras and radar sensors as Tesla’s Autopilot. Combined with electric steering, the car has the capability to be turned into a semi-autonomous vehicle.  Boulter, however, holds the view the technology is not ready as yet. “If something happens, it could set the technology back a decade.”  He fears that a mishap involving a semi-autonomous vehicle could bring about reactionary legislation from the authorities and scare drivers.This does not mean Jaguar is not testing such systems. Boulter said Jaguar would soon be conducting real-world testing on public roads around its Gaydon, England, facility.",Mohan K Ramanujam

Shamsubaharin said the company, which currently operates from Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC), had received a lot of enquiries since the announcement of the ERL ticket price increase.He said that while the number of trips made by the taxi service to KLIA was on the increase, the company will be going all out to promote its services via social media and also the newspapers to show how much cheaper it is compared to ERL.In a separate matter, Shamsubaharin said that the issue of SPAD taking action against taxi drivers, especially budget taxis drivers, was the wrong way to go about things. He said that if a taxi driver is found flouting the law, SPAD must come down hard on the permit holder to show they would not tolerate such activities.“Action should be taken against permit holders because they should be responsible for their drivers. They get close to RM2,000 a month from the drivers and their cost for the taxi is about RM700. Permit holders must ensure that all their taxis are up to the mark and clean and their drivers while being respectful and disciplined also follow the law,” he said.",Anthony Lim

2015-12-16,"Audi A6 3.0 TFSI quattro price revealed – RM484,900","Audi Malaysia has revealed the price of its  3.0 TFSI quattro variant. The range-topping facelifted sedan is listed at RM484,900, marking a RM160k leap from the only other  variant, the 1.8 TFSI.When the , Audi Malaysia wasn’t quite ready with its 3.0 TFSI quattro’s price, only suggesting that it would fall under the RM500k mark. True to its word, here is the second variant of the model, offering a bag of extra equipment and features.The most significant upgrade for the additional RM160k between the  and this car here is of course the more powerful 3.0 litre supercharged V6. The top-shelf A6 is good for 333 hp from 5,300 to 6,500 rpm and 440 Nm between 2,900 and 5,300 rpm.Audi Malaysia’s top-spec A6 3.0 TFSI boasts a zero to 100 km/h time of 5.1 seconds. Comparably, the front-wheel driven 1.8 TFSI can perform the century sprint in 7.9 seconds. A seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission is mated to the mighty V6.From the outside, the 3.0 TFSI gains Audi’s LED headlights as standard. These aren’t the top-range Matrix LEDs that are optionally available, but they are a step up from the 1.8 TFSI’s standard Xenon plus lighting.This A6 also gets larger 19-inch, 15-spoke alloy wheels to start with, wrapped in 255/40R19 rubbers. The base model settles for a set of 17-inch, 10-spoke alloy rollers. A power-operated boot lid is also standard kit.Inside, the more expensive Audi A6 gets a sportier-looking three-spoke multi-function, power-adjustable steering wheel. The cabin’s inlays feature an aluminium Delta finish, setting itself apart from the satin finish on the base model.Where the 1.8 TFSI had to settle for a more basic MMI system, the 3.0 TFSI gets the higher-end MMI navigation plus with MMI touch system as standard. This introduces a larger eight-inch retractable display screen which features 3D map displays and a touch pad on the centre console.Audiophiles will also appreciate the car’s 14-speaker, 600-watt Bose surround sound system. Connectivity for your entertainment needs include a DVD drive, MP3, WMA, MPEG-4, USB, Bluetooth and more. Equipped with Audi Connect, the system also offers WiFi hotspot capabilities and Google Earth navigation.For safety, the A6 3.0 TFSI sets out with a total of eight airbags – two more rear side airbags are included over the base model’s total six. A rear-view camera system has also been included as standard.Audi Malaysia’s A6 3.0 TFSI sets itself up as a sound alternative to the W212 Mercedes-Benz E 400, which retails at RM490,888. The E 400 similarly features a 3.0 litre V6 engine, but is turbocharged to produce 333 hp and 480 Nm of torque. To recap, the Audi 3.0 TFSI’s 3.0 supercharged V6 dishes out 333 hp and 440 Nm.The price difference between this and the A6 3.0 TFSI quattro’s RM484,900 is considerably negligible, especially at that price bracket. The top-range A6 is also more affordable than the pre-facelifted version which was sold here at RM515k.",Chris Aaron
2015-12-16,SPIED: 2016 Proton Perdana gets closer to production,"Yet more  of the  have been sent over by reader Saiful Azhar Musa – these photos give us a better view of what the national flagship D-segment sedan will look like.Evident in the front shot are the new, more rounded headlights that are a departure from the rectangular ones on the  on which the new Perdana is based. The sole teaser image released by Proton shows projector headlights with solid LED daytime running light strips, as opposed to the individual diodes as seen on the ,  and  Premium.Along the side, we notice the door shutline that runs up the windows ends much shorter than the one on the Accord. We already know that the Perdana will lose the Accord’s BMW-style C-pillar kink in favour of a more elegant teardrop shape.The rear windscreen also has a shallower rake compared to the Accord – that, combined with the longer rear overhang (where most of the 150 mm length increase over the Honda should reside) lends a more graceful, if rear-heavy, profile. Around the back, there’s the L-shaped LED tail lights that were already revealed at the  open day event, although the integrated twin rear exhaust exits are conspicuously missing here.It’s confirmed that the 2016 Perdana will be built at Proton’s Medium Volume Factory in Shah Alam, alongside the Exora MPV (the current government-use version is assembled at Honda Malaysia’s plant in Melaka).Engine wise, it’s set to retain Honda’s 154 hp/189 Nm R20A3 2.0 and 177 hp/222 Nm K24Z2 2.4 litre i-VTEC engines – for now, at least. Both engines will be mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The Perdana will be offered to civilian buyers in the first quarter of 2016.",Jonathan Lee
2015-12-16,Hyundai Ioniq teased again ahead of January debut,"Hyundai has released another  – including one of the interior – of its -rivalling hybrid (also available in fully-electric or plug-in hybrid forms), the Hyundai Ioniq, ahead of its world debut in South Korea next month.From the looks of it, the Ioniq will be a stylish, slick-looking vehicle with crisp lines, sharp head- and tail lights (the former with C-shaped LED positioning lights) and modern turbine-design alloy wheels – although we’re not really buying into the claim of a “coupé-like silhouette.” The styling is said to have been designed to minimise wind resistance and assist the efficient management of airflow around the body.Previous spyshots have already pretty much revealed the interior in full, so the teaser rendering doesn’t really hold many surprises. The hexagonal centre panel (incorporating the air vents and infotainment system), three-spoke flat-bottomed steering wheel, the instrument cluster with battery charge readouts – these are all things we’ve already seen before.Hyundai claims that the Ioniq will be the first car in the world to offer an electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid powertrain in a single body type. It also says that the Ioniq “combines class-leading fuel efficiency with a fun, responsive drive and attractive design, a unique mix not yet achieved by a hybrid vehicle.”Equipped with a fully-electric (EV) powertrain, the Ioniq is powered by a high capacity, ultra-efficient lithium-ion battery. The plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version combines a “fuel-efficient energy” with battery power that is obtained by charging the car via an external power socket. Finally, the hybrid (HEV) utilises the petrol engine and motion of the car to charge the on-board battery.To cater towards the multi-powertrain options, the Ioniq rides on a new platform that is said to be “optimised to deliver responsive handling while remaining efficient in each of its three powertrain configurations.”",Jonathan Lee
2015-12-16,"Shell FuelSave Euro 5 diesel now available outside Johor – five stations first, 10 sen more than Euro2M","Shell Malaysia has finally launched its FuelSave Euro 5 diesel outside Johor, with five Shell stations offering the fuel initially (more to follow). For those who favour a higher-grade fuel for their diesel engines, you’ll want to head on over to these stations at the NKVE-Damansara Highway north-bound (Selangor), Tapah rest stop (Perak), Tanjung Malim layby (Perak), Bandar Ayer Keroh (Melaka) and the Pasir Gudang Highway 2 (Johor).With an unregulated price of RM2.00 per litre, the Shell FuelSave Euro 5 diesel is 10 sen per litre more than the regular Euro 2M diesel. However, the fuel has a lower sulphur content of only 10 parts per million (ppm), compared to 500 ppm for the current Euro 2M diesel. This bodes well with current diesel engines in reducing the emissions of harmful pollutants.Shell FuelSave Diesel Euro 5 also features Active Efficiency Ingredients, which is designed to improve engine efficiency and fuel economy. It also has a special detergent designed to maintain engine condition by helping prevent the build-up of injector deposits.Shell Malaysia also announced a partnership with BMW Group Malaysia to promote the importance of fuel efficiency and emissions responsibility on the road. The German marque has been a strong advocate for the introduction of Euro 5 grade fuel since 2009, when it introduced its fleet of diesel vehicles as part of the BMW EfficientDynamics programme.The introduction of the Shell Euro 5 diesel here means the Dutch energy company  to customers outside Johor, with the latter introducing the fuel earlier in August 2015.Keep in mind that the availability of Euro 5 diesel is not mandated by the Government, meaning it is at the fuel provider’s initiative to supply the higher-grade fuel in select locations.

2015-12-16,2016 Toyota Prius gets two TRD Aerokits in Japan,"In addition to  for the , Toyota Racing Development (TRD) has come up with two different aerokits for the fourth-generation hybrid in Japan. According to the tuning division, the kits are developed with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis.A look at its Japanese website notes that the aerodynamic kits improves straight-line stability while increasing downforce. Both kits are made out of PPE and ABS plastic and comprise of different front bumpers, while the side skirts, rear bumpers and rear spoiler are of the same design. Version 1 (pictured above) features LED daytime running lights that that are integrated into the centre, near the front lip. As for version 2, it comes without integrated LED lights, but with a more elaborate front lip. The side skirts are designed to flow naturally with the Prius’ character lines. In the rear, the bumper comes with a diffuser-like piece that goes across the rear.Aside from the bodykit, TRD also offers a high-response stainless steel muffler with dual tips and a member brace set that’s reinforced and can be attached to the underbody of the Prius. In addition to that, the division is also offering motion control beams for the front and rear, TRD suspension set, 18-inch aluminium TRD TF8 wheels and a lug nut set.Smaller items include TRD fuel caps in two designs, a red TRD start/stop button, turn signal valve set, shoulder pads for seat belts and a stainless steel B-type TRD emblem. The price for the cosmetic enhancements are about USD$2,876 (RM12,410), though prices will balloon depending on items opted for.",Graham Chin
2015-12-16,Fiat Toro pick-up truck – official image of rear released,"The striptease for  continues. This time, the Italian brand has released an official image of the Fiat Toro’s rear end. We’ve previously seen the Toro’s bold front end and spyshots of the truck’s rear. It is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2016. The Toro is a double-cab pick-up truck measuring 4,915 mm long (shorter than ) with a one-tonne payload, accessible via a unique barn-style tailgate that splits open in the middle, . There’s enough space for five occupants “with the comfort of a luxury car,” Fiat claims.The Toro is based on the underpinnings of FCA family member , which is also made in Brazil. The compact Jeep’s wheelbase has been extended for the Toro, which means that unlike regular ladder frame trucks like the ,  and , this is a truck with unitary construction and fully independent suspension.  Brazilians can choose from a 1.8 litre E.torQ flex fuel (ethanol-petrol) engine with 138 hp or a 2.0 litre Multijet turbodiesel with 170 hp. The former is paired to a six-speed automatic and is FWD only, while the diesel engine gets either a six-speed manual or nine-speed automatic gearbox – the latter only in conjunction with 4WD. Note the “AT9” and “4X4” badging on the range-topper above.The Fiat Toro is expected to feature the latest iteration of the uConnect infotainment system with a five-inch touchscreen display screen, GPS navigation, a reverse camera and Bluetooth connectivity. Higher spec variants should also get an electric sunroof, part leather, automatic xenons, an upgraded sound system as well as rain-sensing wipers. Expected equipment on the flagship model are 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control, off-road suspension, Hill Descent Control, LED DRLs and chrome trimmings.",Danny Tan
2015-12-16,Mercedes-AMG SLC 43 gets downsized 3.0 V6 biturbo,"You’ve seen the , now let’s zoom in on the high-performance flagship variant, the Mercedes-AMG SLC 43.AMG’s SLC wears a ’43’ badge last seen on the W202, the first C-Class from the 90s. It replaces the SLK 55 AMG in the junior roadster’s line-up. Under the hood is a  with 367 hp and 520 Nm of torque, good for 0 to 100 km/h in 4.7 seconds and an electronically limited 250 km/h top speed. If you want six cylinders in your SLC, this is now the only variant that has it.For perspective,  had 54 more horses but 20 Nm less from its unique 421 hp/540 Nm naturally aspirated 5.5 litre V8 engine, back in the day when AMG model numbers still had a relationship with the engine size. The old car is faster to 100 km/h at 4.6 seconds, but only by one tenth. Downsizing is all about efficiency, and the SLC 43’s NEDC combined fuel consumption of 7.8 litres per 100 km is 0.6 litres better than its brawny predecessor, more than payback for the 0.1s slower sprint time.The V6 is mated to a 9G-Tronic sports transmission with specifically adapted software for shorter shift times. The ‘box features multiple downshifts and a double-declutching function in Sport and Sport + modes. In the latter, partial ignition interruptions provide even faster shifts. Merc says that shifts in Manual mode, activated via a separate button next to the gear lever, is twice as fast as in the other modes. Also, the gearbox stays in the selected gear and does not automatically shift up at redline. Steering shift paddles are included, of course.Moving on to suspension, there are two options – standard sports suspension or the optional AMG Ride Control suspension with adjustable damping. Common to both are the specially developed front and rear axles, which “guarantee” precise wheel location and high camber stability on compression and rebound.The three-link front axle has been provided with stiffer steering knuckles, improved elastokinematics and increased negative camber. In combination with the also new wishbone guide bearings, this design results in significantly more agile cornering, more precise and direct suspension feedback from the road and fast cornering speeds, Merc claims.The four-link rear axle with optimised elastokinematics, increased negative camber and special forged-aluminium track rods not only improves the driving dynamics, but also makes the SLC 43 more controllable at the limit. In addition, AMG mountings for the engine and rear-axle gear unit offer an ideal compromise between handling and comfort, plus contribute to the “snappy and highly stable driving impression,” according to its maker. There’s also an optional mechanical limited-slip differential on the rear axle.The AMG Ride Control suspension provides three settings – Comfort, Sport and Sport + – that can be selected by the driver via the transmission modes using the Dynamic Select button. The button provides two other modes, Eco and Individual. There are two steering power assistance modes – Comfort and Sport – depending on Dynamic Select position.An AMG car has to have appealing sound, and while the SLC 43 won’t have that “typical exhaust growl which only a large-displacement eight-cylinder engine can produce,” its exhaust system comes with two automatically map-controlled flaps. In the Eco and Comfort transmission modes, the flaps remain closed most of the time. In Sport and Sport +, the flaps open earlier and more spontaneously. The effect is “the typical, emotively appealing AMG engine sound.”There are changes to the exterior to mark the SLC 43 out as the AMG flagship. In addition to the , the 43 gets large air intakes with silver chrome fins, edged by black flics. Down below, the silver chrome front splitter ensures optimal airflow to the cooling modules and gives a ground-hugging look. The diamond grille features chrome-plated pins and a louvre in gloss black.On the sides, the 18-inch AMG multi-spoke black alloys are the highlight, but there are also black mirror caps plus a silver chrome fin and ‘biturbo’ lettering on the front wings. At the back, the 43 gets an AMG spoiler lip, quad pipes and the diffuser-look rear apron trim in silver chrome.Inside, the SLC 43 receives a sports steering wheel in black nappa leather with a flattened bottom section and red contrasting stitch. The sports seats are in sun-reflecting nappa leather/Dinamica microfibre with model-specific seat layout and red piping. The AMG instrument cluster boasts a 4.5-inch colour display, Racetimer and 280 km/h scale with a chequered flag design.An optional Handling package adds on the mechanical LSD, an additional engine radiator, red-painted brake calipers, a Performance steering wheel with Dinamica microfibre in the grip area and an analogue clock in IWC design. Other options include Merc’s LED Intelligent Light System, the AMG Night package and a Harman Kardon Logic 7 Surround Sound system, among other things.",Danny Tan

The first convertible C-Class is pretty much as you would expect – take one  and cut the roof off, and you basically end up with the cars you see here. That means that you get a front end that’s pretty much identical to the sedan, while the rear end is inspired by the big brother /.One thing we get to see here are the colour choices for the fabric roof – while the blue C 450 AMG gets a black roof, the black C 450 and the lower-spec grey unit are fitted with a bright red top; wallflowers probably won’t need to apply here.Also seen here is the windscreen header that features chrome trim around the edges. To our eyes, it looks a little incongruous, particularly next to the red roof – this writer prefers the ‘s completely silver header for added visual contrast. We can also spot the Airscarf neck warmers that are now  on a modern Mercedes convertible.Engine choices should be identical to the regular C-Class, with the use of four- and six-cylinder turbocharged petrol and diesel engines, a 476 PS (510 PS on the S model) 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 on the  as well as a 362 PS 3.0 litre twin-turbo V6 on the mid-level .

2015-12-16,2016 Infiniti QX60 facelift seven-seater revealed,"The facelifted  has just been revealed. In summary, the seven-seater now comes with two different engines and a total of four variants. This includes the QX60, QX60 AWD, QX60 Hybrid and QX60 Hybrid AWD – with both front- and all-wheel drive layouts.Like its siblings, design-wise, the QX60 features flowing lines, a double-arch front grille, double-wave hood and a crescent-cut D-pillar. In front it comes with a front underbody spoiler, while standard are bi-xenon headlamps with LED daytime running lights, LED front fog lamps and chrome finishers. The rear features an integrated spoiler, and the hatch with power lift function also features chrome finishers, while a new roof-mounted shark fin antenna has been added – it works in tandem with the in-glass antenna. Overall, the QX60 achieves the same drag coefficient numbers of 0.34 Cd.A new addition for the 2016 QX60 is the use of acoustic glass, which is made out of three layers. Infiniti claims that it provides better insulation from high frequency noise, while the side glass minimises wind noise and tyre noise, therefore contributing to better noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) at constant speeds. Inside, the seven-seater features a flat platform floor. The second-row seating has a 150 mm travel and can be adjusted for more legroom or cargo space. Getting into the third-row is more accessible with wide door openings. A 60:40 split-folding is available for the second-row seats, while the third row has a 50:50 split folding ratio. Both rows can be reclined for added comfort.“Graphite Weave” is the standard interior leather trim for the QX60. Soft-touch materials with contrast stitching can be found on the upper instrument panel – stitchings, which are also found on the door panels, are available in three colours: Graphite, Java and Wheat. Chrome accents are applied to the driver’s cockpit, while the gear knob and surround comes get a new design and finish.A one-touch open/close and tilting power sliding tinted moonroof with sliding sunshade is standard across the range. The brand says that it has revised the tri-zone automatic temperature control system with microfilter, to give better air insulation to the first- and second-row passengersIt comes with six-speakers, while the infotainment system features SiriusXM satellite radio. Bluetooth connectivity and a USB connection port are also available as well. The 3.5 litre models get three additional USB charging ports, one in the second row and two in the third-row seating.Infiniti Personal Assistant is also featured in the QX60. It gives owners 24-hour access to a team of professional assistants. One can make reservations, get directions, access gift services and much more at the touch of a button. Infiniti Connection services, which include 24-hour automatic crash notification, emergency call, enhance roadside assistance and much more, are also available in certain models. Two engine options are available, a 3.5 litre V6 that’s mated to a sport-tuned electronically controlled CVT transmission with D-Step Logic and manual shift mode. The engine produces 265 hp at 6,400 rpm and 336 Nm of torque at 4,400 rpm. Revised engine mounts are also present.Powering the hybrid variants is a supercharged 2.5 litre four-cylinder engine and an electric motor that is powered by a lithium-ion battery pack. It produces 250 hp and 329 Nm of torque. New, are electric active controlled, liquid-filled engine mounts that reduce in-cabin vibration and enhances cornering as well. At the front wheels are independent front struts and a multi-link rear suspension with new absorbers and springs. Standard are 235/65R18 T-rated all-season tyres.Safety tech updates are available in the QX60’s revised options package. A few of these tech include Forward Emergency Braking (FEB) with Pedestrian Detection function, Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Backup Collision Intervention (BCI) and for parking an Around View Monitor (AVM) with Moving Object Detection (MOD) is also present.An optional Deluxe Technology Package, that includes quilted seat bases with maple accents and an Advanced Climate Control with Plasmacluster, grape polyphenol filter and auto recirculation.

2015-12-16,Jaguar jumps back into motorsport with Formula E,"Jaguar leaps back into motorsport after a decade-long absence with its entry into Formula E, it was announced in London last Tuesday. Jaguar had been planning to participate in the electric car championship since early this year.Contracts were finalised in early December after a successful negotiation process. Jaguar Land Rover, together with technical partners Williams Advanced Engineering, will race in Formula E from 2016, the formula’s third season. The FIA is expected to make a formal announcement later today.Nick Rogers, group engineering director for Jaguar Land Rover, said that he was proud to make the announcement.  “Electric vehicles will absolutely play a role in Jaguar Land Rover’s future product portfolio and Formula E will give us a unique opportunity to further our development of electrification technologies. The championship will enable us to engineer and test our advanced technologies under extreme performance conditions. It is my belief that over the next five years we will see more changes in the automotive world than in the last three decades.”Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag said that Jaguar’s return to Formula E, bringing along its racing heritage, was a huge endorsement of the championship and its ability to influence the development of electric cars.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-16,2016 Ducati 959 Panigale now plays by Euro 4 rules,"The 2016 Ducati 959 Panigale carries on from the 899 Panigale with a host of changes to the engine and bodywork. The 959 Panigale was reworked to pass Euro 4 emissions and noise limits, which resulted in some major revisions over the 899.Most noticeable is the double-barreled exhaust, which was needed to pass the very stringent Euro 4 noise regulations. While many riders may like the howl of a straight-through V-twin exhaust, Euro 4 says no, at least not for road bikes. While the 899 Panigale managed to convey a svelte profile echoing Massimo Tamburini’s earliest iteration of the 916 Desmoquattro, expect to see more road-going machines with similar bulbous exhausts moving forward as manufacturers try to keep the noise down without sacrificing too much.What’s new for 2016 is the now regulation compliant Superquadro engine. The V-twin displaces 955 cc, producing 157 hp and 107.4 Nm torque. The additional 57 cc and 9 hp over the out-going 899 Panigale’s 148 hp was achieved by stretching the stroke from 57.2 mm to 60.8 mm. The bore remains the same at 100 mm, retaining the massively over-square design of the Superquadro.The short stroke of this engine is important, as it reduces the amount of friction internally, and allows the engine to meet regulations and reduce emissions. Ducati’s new Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) coating on the piston pins and a reworked piston top, combined with new cylinder heads and covers reduce engine noise, along with an all-new timing chain.The fly-by-wire throttle activates twin oval throttle bodies that now sport twin fuel injectors positioned above and below the butterfly. This helps maximise the efficiency of the fuel burn, while emissions are controlled with Ducati’s secondary air system.Ducatis have always been famous for their slipper clutches that prevent wheel hop during aggressive braking, but were never known for their “light” pull. The 959 comes with a new “self servo” that greatly reduces clutch effort without reducing the neccessary force required to transmit the engine’s power to the gearbox.Other changes to the 959 include a wider and taller fairing, based on feedback received from Ducati’s World Superbike team. Redesigned air intakes allow more air into the engine while the rear seat design now mimics the 1299 Panigale, as do the mirrors.The rest of the 959 Panigale follows Ducati’s MotoGP technology, including an optional data analyser. The LCD dashboard comes fully functional and track ready, including riding mode and stopwatch. The full suite of track gadgets comes standard, including ABS, traction control and quickshifter.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-16,"Next Renault Megane RS could feature smaller 1.6  turbo engine, dual-clutch auto transmission","The next-generation Renault Megane RS has  been tipped to feature a smaller, more efficient engine that will replace the current 2.0 litre four-pot turbo unit. It is said that the current engine has reached its “developmental potential,” and that the car maker may have to look elsewhere for new power. reports that the next-generation Megane RS that will be based on the  (pictured here) may adopt the smaller 1.6 litre four-pot turbo engine that currently serves in the . The idea was given life by Renault Sport’s vice president of sales, marketing and communication, Regis Fricotte, at the recent launch of the current Megane in Portugal.Speaking to attending media there, Fricotte said thats its 2.0 litre engine “was good in terms of what it could do in an RS, but it is an engine that is not suitable for further development in terms of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.”Fricotte sees no issue with the Megane RS using a smaller displacement engine, saying that, “we have never had a car with the biggest engine. So what? We still have the record at the Nurburgring.” He was referring to the ’s record for being the  to lap the the infamous Nordschleife circuit.The Renault Sport VP made no mention as to whether future RS models would offer more power than what is currently available, but stressed that power is not the key to its models’ success. He said, “with all the previous Megane RS variants, we have shown that power does not make the best car. Your engine output is part of the equation but not everything.”With the next Megane RS said to be a five-door model only, Fricotte suggested that the additional doors wouldn’t prevent the brand from exploring several variants of the car, including a  version.On the matter, he told reporters at the event that, “it makes it a bit awkward on a five-door if you take out the rear seats, I agree with that. But apart from that, a Trophy R is all about weight reduction and optimisation of the performance, brakes, engine and gearbox. So, the fact that it is not a three-door doesn’t restrict us technically at all.”Fricotte also suggested that based on the positive sales performance of the Clio RS, the Megane RS may also feature a dual-clutch automatic transmission exclusively, instead of its adored six-speed manual. However, while its , the Megane RS would continue to rely on a front-wheel drive chassis.He concluded by saying that, ”I think eventually it will create some questions about how to transfer the engine power to the road, and when you are around 300 hp it becomes a bit tricky.

2015-12-16,"W213 Merc E-Class shows new key fob, display visuals","Further details of the  have been revealed on  blog. The German site dedicated to the brand’s developments has spied several new key items from the car’s cabin, and has also provided us with a closer look at the new base  variant’s interior.First up is the W213’s new key fob design. Since the 1998 W220 S-Class, Mercedes-Benz has largely maintained a similar key fob for all its models, with minor updates added in between. As pictured here, it looks like an update has been ordered, with the E-Class seen with a unique key fob as pictured above.Unlike the previous fob, the new one is a lot slimmer and curvier. It features four buttons, with three traditionally being to lock, unlock and to remotely open the boot lid. The fourth button is the panic button, an alarm trigger which may be unfamiliar to Malaysians. Only the United States has this.Judging by the engine push start button itself, it doesn’t look like there’s no option for a key hole as well. The button is flush with the dashboard, and doesn’t look like it has a removable cover that would expose a slot for the key.Mercedes-Benz could be opting for a similar design route adopted by BMW for its key designs. The Bavarian carmaker has largely eliminated conventional “key in and turn” motions in favour of a push-start button-only method. We’ll have to wait and see what future Benz models offer before making any further assumptions.It also looks to us like that new key fob design will be available right from the base W213 E-Class and up. The photo here also reveals the new base model’s dashboard, which features a smaller 8.4-inch central display screen. Remember, however, that the  similar to the W222 S-Class.Included in our gallery below, the German site also revealed several new central screen displays for the higher-range variants with the dual 12.3 inch screens. Clearly, the graphics see here are an upgrade on what is currently available on the W222 S-Class.There are also close-ups of the lower-spec E-Class’s instrument panel and dashboard, with its smaller 8.4-inch central screen and seven-inch screen positioned within the analogue instruments.",Chris Aaron
2015-12-16,2017 Ford GT to come with Gorilla Glass windscreens,"No longer limited to just smartphones, the all-new  is set to receive a new windscreen made from Gorilla Glass. Officially called Corning Gorilla Glass hybrid windscreen, it’s 30% lighter than traditional glass, scratch-resistant, durable and not to mention tough. The material – jointly developed by the Blue Oval and Corning – is also applied to the rear engine cover.The new hybrid glass uses a multilayer approach. The inner layer consists of a toughened automotive-grade formed hybrid pane; in the centre is a noise-absorbing thermoplastic interlayer, while the outer layer is regular annealed glass. According to Ford, the Gorilla Glass hybrid window is about 25% to 50% lighter and has equal or greater strength than traditional laminated glass.While traditional laminated glass is 4-6 mm thick, the innovative Gorilla Glass hybrid window has a thickness of just 3-4 mm. The thinner properties allows for substantial weight reduction of each panel. In addition to that, it’s tough as well, thanks to a mix of processes including contaminant reduction, chemical strengthening, unique edge treatment and laminate construction.As you can see in the video, the glass was put through endurance tests, which also include stone and rough road conditions. In addition to that, the glass had to withstand specific projectiles,  rollover and wind tunnel tests. Ford says that this tough, lightweight glass might be introduced to other vehicles in the near future.Furthermore, a unique glass combination is used for the bulkhead panel between the passenger cell and engine bay. Together, the windscreen, rear engine cover and the bulkhead glass contribute to better fuel economy, acceleration, braking performance, while handling also benefits greatly from this.“During development, we tried different glass variations before we found a combination that provided both weight savings and the durability needed for exterior automotive glass,” said Ford body exteriors engineer Paul Linden. “We learned, somewhat counterintuitively, that the strengthened interior layer of the windshield is key to the success of the hybrid window.”The renewed Ford GT is a lightweight supercar, thanks to extensive use of carbon-fibre material. In the back of the rear-wheel drive, two-door coupe sits a 3.5 litre EcoBoost twin-turbo V6, which is claimed be able to churn out over 600 hp, it is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. While production is slated for late 2016, Ford has already indicated its return to .",Graham Chin
2015-12-16,Infiniti’s new 3.0 litre V6 twin-turbo promises much,"Infiniti heads into 2016 with an all-new 3.0 litre V6 twin-turbo engine that aims to deliver performance together with efficiency. Drawing on Infiniti’s decades of experience with V6 mills, the new engine in the VR series claims to offer a level of driver engagement using increased power and torque than previous engines.The engine comes in two flavours, 300 or 400 hp, packed into a lighter and more compact block. Drawing on the VQ series design, the VR delivers 400 hp at 6400 rpm and 475 Nm maximum torque at 1600-5200 rpm. Meanwhile, the lower rated engine puts out 300 hp at 6400 rpm and 400 Nm torque at 1600-5200 rpm.While looking outwardly identical, the 300 hp version is fitted with a single water pump, while the 400 hp V6 runs two pumps to deal with the increased output. In addition, the new engine uses an optical turbo speed sensor to get that power by allowing the turbine blades to spin faster, up to 220,000 rpm at a steady state. This lets the twin turbochargers produce high output numbers while still maintaining fuel efficiency. The turbine blades have also been designed to minimise lag, allowing the driver to get immediate response from the engine when required.Developments in the design of the water-cooled intercooler system also enhance performance and efficiency.  Rapid cooling of intake air reduces turbo lag and gives immediate acceleration. A secondary benefit is the new design is compact, allowing for a shorter flow path for air entering the turbocharger to enable quicker engine response. A new electronic wastegate actuator provides close control of exhaust gas flow, restricting the amount of exhaust gas flowing through the turbos to improve overall engine efficiency.The 3.0 litre V6 twin-turbo engine weighs 194.8 kg, dropping 14.1 kg from the previous engine. The new turbo system and intercooler piping add 25.8 kg, giving a total engine weight of 220.6 kg. This lower weight contributes to engine efficiency, and this is carried on inside the engine with the adoption of a new low-friction “mirror bore coating” for the engine block and integrated exhaust manifold for cylinder heads that claims to reduce mechanical friction by 40%. This makes the V6 the cleanest and most fuel-efficient engine of its type that Infiniti has offered, contributing towards the 6.7% improvement in fuel economy, according to Infiniti.Another feature is a new integrated exhaust manifold, built into the cylinder head, putting the catalytic converter closer to the exhaust header. This results in a shorter flow path for the hot exhaust gases, allowing the catalytic converter to heat up almost instantly – twice as fast as previous V6 engines – and reducing emissions from a cold start.The new 3.0 litre twin-turbo V6 engine is expected to enter production in 2016 and will be manufactured at the powertrain plant in Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan. The 2016 Infiniti Q50 sports sedan will be the first to have the VR engine installed.",Mohan K Ramanujam
2015-12-16,Rinspeed Etos – BMW i8-based self-driving concept,"Wacky concept car builder Rinspeed is at it again, this time showing its latest creation, the Rinspeed Etos, away from Switzerland for the first time – at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Like the  before it, the new self-driving car is based on a BMW i model, this time the .Somewhat surprisingly, Rinspeed has removed much of the styling flourishes of the i8, leaving behind a rather conventional, if low-slung, two-door sports car look. Bringing up the visual drama are the bright yellow paint and 20-inch two-tone Borbet GTX wheels with titanium protective edges.But it’s inside where the Etos is a real departure from the car on which it’s based. The i8’s swooping dashboard has been replaced by twin rectangular “shelves,” with one of them storing the  steering wheel when it is folded away in autonomous mode. There’s also a self-winding Patravi Traveltec mechanical clock, with an integrated camera for video calls.Twin curved 21.5 inch Ultra HD displays are connected to the  infotainment system, which aims to reduce distracting manual inputs by learning and anticipating the occupants’ needs and proactively offers suggestions all on its own. If need be, the system can also be controlled through voice commands, gestures, touch, a controller or the push of a button.Elsewhere, there’s wireless smartphone charging, NFC connectivity for conducting automatic payment for parking, as well as an on-the-go transaction system for secure payments. The front bucket seats are embroidered with the San Francisco skyline; at the rear, the BMW’s near-useless pews have been jettisoned in favour of a luggage shelf with a detachable umbrella holder.The real party piece is on the rear deck, where the Etos has a landing pad that doubles as a large display, made – as with the roof – from Corning Gorilla Glass. That pad is for a DJI drone, which Rinspeed says can do errands such as collecting flowers for a significant other, as well as taking selfies while on the road.Replacing the traditional exterior mirrors, eight HD cameras provide a 180-degree view of the front and rear of the vehicle – displayed on screens inside the car, they completely eliminate blind spots. Eye-tracking enables the Etos to recognise what the driver may or may not have seen, tailors the displayed warnings and notifications to suit, and enables the exterior views to be displayed only when the driver is looking at them.Autonomous driving is enabled through the precise mapping of roads and lanes, along with radar and car-to-x connectivity – the Etos can connect to traffic infrastructure, traffic management systems and other cars, and allows drivers and the car itself to “see” over the horizon and through obstacles. This, for example, enables the car to drive all the way in sync with phased traffic lights.",Jonathan Lee

Described as having the “highest offroad performance,” the G500 4×4² here is also described as king  the road, as it goes through the mud and rough terrain. The brand says that the “Extreme-G” is now set to enter into series production.The G500 4×4² features a Euro 6-compliant 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 engine that produces 422 hp and 610 Nm of torque. The 2,980 kg wagon goes from 0-100 km/h in 7.4 seconds and it hits a top speed of 210 km/h. The engine is derived from the  and the . Mercedes-Benz claims that the G500 4×4² will achieve combined fuel consumption figures of 13.8 litre per 100 km. On top of that, the top-of-the-range  emits a combined 323 g/km of CO2.In addition to that, the G500 4×4² uses a portal axle setup, which essentially means that the axle is above the wheel centre – the drive is transferred to the centre of the wheel hub through gears. It has a 450 mm ground clearance, a wading depth of 1,000 mm, a 52/54 degree approach and departure angle, and a 47 degree breakover angle.Apart from that, the G500 4×4² has adjustable damping with its Sport mode. Moreover, the luxury off-roader has huge 22-inch wheels wrapped in 325/55R22 tyres – undoubtedly adding to that elevated height. Underneath, one can be certain that the undercarriage will be kept well protected as it comes with stainless steel under guards. Permanent-all wheel drive is standard.While the Mercedes-Benz G500 4×4² may be a very desirable luxury offroader, we got a firsthand look at the massive  recently.

2015-12-16,2016 Infiniti Q50 – Red Sport model with 400 hp VR V6,"Besides the , Infiniti also previewed the 2016  to the media prior to the car’s 2016 Detroit show debut. Infiniti’s compact exec rival to the , ,  and  gets two new turbocharged engines and a new range topper.   Let’s start with the big hitter. The Infiniti Q50 Red Sport 400 will be powered by a 3.0 litre twin-turbo V6 engine with 400 hp at 6,400 rpm and 475 Nm of torque at 1,600 to 5,200 rpm. This , an in-house development, offers the highest standard horsepower in its class (non-specialty versions, excludes AMG or M cars) and is the most advanced V6 ever offered by the company.  Key engine features include a compact, lightweight aluminium-alloy engine block and cylinder heads, direct injection (DIG), optimised turbine blade design, turbine speed sensor, electronic wastegate actuator, water-cooled engine charging, e-motor valve timing control and an integrated exhaust manifold. There are two water pumps for more effective heat management, and the optical turbo speed sensor gives a 30% power boost to the turbo system by allowing the blades to spin faster. A new electric motor is fitted to the valve timing system, increasing the speed of the throttle for better response. It also aids efficiency, with closer control of cylinder combustion.This new V6 engine is 700 cc smaller than Infiniti and Nissan’s previous VQ-series 3.7L unit, and it’s lighter too – The VR’s core structure weighs 194.8 kg, 14.1 kg less than the engine it replaces. The new turbocharger and intercooler system componentry adds just an extra 25.8 kg, for 220.6 kg in total.Chief among the new weight-saving elements is the adoption of spray bore coating for the engine block and integrated exhaust manifold for cylinder heads. Not only does this make the engine lighter, but it also aids cooling as heat can dissipate more effectively through the aluminum alloy bore wall, a process boosted further by its physical design. The lower weight contributes to greater mechanical efficiency, with lower inertia from lightweight aluminium components.A milder version of the 3.0 litre twin-turbo V6 will also join the Q50 line-up, with 300 hp at 6,400 rpm and 400 Nm of torque at 1,600 to 5,200 rpm. All the above features are present except for the twin water pumps (single unit) and the optical turbo speed sensor. Both engines will be made in Japan from next year.The US market will also get a third new engine, a 2.0 litre turbo four-cylinder shared with Daimler/Mercedes-Benz. This is the . The current US line-up consists of the 3.7 V6 (RWD and AWD) and the Hybrid.Other “performance-intensifying enhancements” to the range-topping 2016 Q50 Red Sport 400 include a new Dynamic Digital Suspension, new rack-mounted electronic power steering or an updated version of Infiniti’s unique Direct Adaptive Steering, plus staggered 19-inch alloys. There , so this Red Sport is as good as it gets for the Q50. It will go up against the  (322 hp, 450 Nm) and the 362 hp/518 Nm , both with 3.0 litre turbocharged six-pot engines.",Danny Tan

According to , Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann said the company had “discussed” the potential for the V8 to be used in Sant’Agata’s current cars, but it was dismissed because it conflicted with Lamborghini’s “one car, one engine” ethos.“On the supersports cars we are convinced that the choices we have made with the naturally aspirated engines are still the right ones. We are not saying that future engines will never beat what we have in our cars; we are saying as long as there is nothing that is better, especially at low revs or in terms of the sound that the V10 and V12 have, we stick to them,” he said.“But we never said this is the only opportunity and by looking at a third model with a different mission, it is clear that for the purpose of the Urus, the turbo is the right choice,” the sharp-suited Winkelmann added.In a previous interview with the UK mag, Winkelmann talked up the performance of the Urus, having driven the SUV. “In early autumn I drove a prototype for the first time on a racetrack and the performance was great. I was astonished; it was more than any of us expected, which is a car that is very powerful but easy to drive, with very good handling, and also in terms of driveability and comfort, it has a limousine feel in an SUV.

It has been a long time since we first spotted the , but until now, MMM never has sold it here.Now, with a facelifted model already available in several markets around the globe, it looks like Malaysians will finally be able to get their hands on the new-look model. However, it looks like the PHEV variant may be given a miss for Malaysia, with MMM confirming that its car will be powered by a petrol MIVEC engine instead.Yang Won-Chul, CEO of MMM said, “we are excited to introduce a seven-seater SUV to the Malaysian market very soon. The  is MMM’s first model to be introduced with the ‘Dynamic Shield’ concept, and it comes with an array of safety and premium features.”On top of the confirmation of its arrival, MMM has revealed a few details surrounding its version of the coming SUV. Stating that it would be powered by the brand’s MIVEC engine, the Malaysian-market Outlander will also feature seven airbags, Active Stability Control (ASC), an electric tailgate, a sunroof, LED headlamps with integrated daytime running lights, 18-inch dual-tone alloy wheels and more.As mentioned, the facelifted Mitsubishi Outlander was revealed in earlier this year in April, at the New York Auto Show. The SUV featured the brand’s latest design language, particularly around its front end, which features twin, horizontal chrome bars flanked by new headlamps, effectively forming what Mitsubishi calls its Dynamic Shield concept design.At its global debut, the Mitsubishi Outlander was presented with a choice of two petrol-powered engines – a 3.0 litre V6 and a 2.4 litre inline-four. However, we believe that it is more likely for MMM to introduce the latter for Malaysia. The 2.4 litre four-pot offers 166 hp and 219 Nm of torque and is paired to a newly-developed CVT automatic transmission.Once upon a time, Mitsubishi Motors Malaysia did offer a previous version of its Outlander here. Priced at RM183k, the SUV then was also available with a 2.4 litre SOHC petrol engine that delivered 160 PS and 215 Nm of torque.

The new EV  is expected to go on sale in the Chinese and Swedish markets by the first half of 2017, according to a report from .The year after will see a flood of four other all-electric vehicles, built on a new Phoenix platform, into the NEVS line-up. This includes a “sporty urban SUV” (compact SUV), an “urban adventurer” (mid-sized crossover), a “distinctive family SUV” (mid-sized SUV) and an “active all-rounder” (mid-sized “fastback”).The electric 9-3 sedan will have most of its components produced in Trollhättan (180,000 capacity), and assembled in Tianjin (200,000 capacity). Even though the EV will be limited to just two markets initially, the company has intentions to introduce the model, along with its expanded portfolio of vehicles, for the European and American markets in the future.However, NEVS has yet to confirm if its new vehicles will adopt the Saab badge. During the conference, Bergman responded to a question on the matter by saying, “we will be very clear as to how the brand will look like in connection with the launch. We won’t be sharing these details today.”Bergman stated that NEVS decision to work with Dongfeng Motors, one of China’s largest car manufacturers with 3.7 million cars, opens up many possibilities. “We’re currently performing a pre-study to develop cars for them. This means we’ll be able to share the architecture and share development costs. Dongfeng is owning 14% of the PSA group and is also having access to other technologies.

Recently, BMW debuted its  at the 2015 Guangzhou Auto Show, which it described as a vision of a “four-door sedan for the compact segment.” Naturally, we’d expect some of the design cues of that concept to feature on the production version of the 1 Series Sedan as well.Underpinning the F52 BMW 1 Series Sedan is reportedly the UKL platform that can also be found on several MINI models and front-wheel drive BMWs like the 2 Series Active and Gran Tourer, and the X1. With that in mind, this could very well be BMW’s first-ever front-wheel drive sedan.On the powertrain front, the 1 Series Sedan is expected to adopt the 1.5 litre turbo three-pot mill found in the current F56 MINI Cooper and the B48 2.0 litre turbocharged four-pot in the Cooper S. The engine could be paired to a six-speed manual or eight-speed Steptronic gearbox.The BMW 1 Series Sedan is being touted as a China-only model for now, according to rumours. However, considering the fact that its competition are global models, do you think BMW should offer the model outside China as well? We certainly think so.",Gerard Lye

2015-12-15,"2016 Suzuki GSX-R 1000 L7, with bigger, badder balls","Suzuki’s litre-class GSX-R has always been known by Malaysian bikers as the “Highway King”. The latest iteration of the legendary motorcycle, designated the GSX-R 1000 L7, is all new for 2016, and is better and badder than ever, according to the manufacturer.Since the launch of the K5 model way back in 2005, the big Gixxer rapidly found itself outclassed by its rivals from Yamaha, Honda and Kawasaki. With the advent of the L7, launched at the Esposizione Internazionale Ciclo e Motociclo e Accessori (EICMA) motor show in Milan last month, Suzuki has brought an all-new engine and chassis to the fight.Suzuki claims 200 hp for the GSX-R 1000 L7, packed into a 200 kg estimated weight. The engine is a 999 cc inline-four, with a steel ball-driven variable valve timing (VVT) system that acts on the intake cam by sliding the lobes along the shaft to alter the profile.Suzuki says this will produce top-end power without sacrificing anything lower down the rev range. The VVT uses centrifugal force to retard the intake timing with the throttle wide open, allowing for more valve overlap and thus increasing horsepower numbers at the top-end.This setup is designed to work with Suzuki’s Exhaust Tuning-Alpha (SET-A) header exhaust valves. These valves remain closed at low rpm, coming into play as the rider increases engine speed and allowing for a greater header flow volume.Lifted directly from Suzuki’s MotoGP efforts is the Racing Finger valve train follower rocker arm that allows for better cam actuation at racetrack speeds.While Suzuki has elected not to pursue high horsepower figures, they say they intend to provide a balanced package for the rider.The chassis is also claimed to be lighter and more compact, with Showa’s fully adjustable and race developed Balance Free front fork, coupled with the Balance Free Rear Cushion (BFRC) fully adjustable shock from the same manufacturer to keep the  skeletal forged and welded swingarm in place. The big Gixxer comes with a full suite of electronics, as per its other rivals.  Traction control, ABS, electronic throttle, launch control, and quick shifting are included into a package designed for the racer and serious track day rider.",Mohan K Ramanujam

2015-12-15,Continental Intelligent Glass Control: auto window tint,"At the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which begins in Las Vegas on January 6, Continental will be showcasing an innovative automatic tint technology. The demo vehicle to be exhibited features “Intelligent Glass Control.” It uses special films inserted into the glass and it can change its transparency through electric control signals, at the touch of a button.Up until now, this kind of auto-tinting film has only been feasible in the roof area for a small number of high-end cars, such as Mercedes-Benz’s Magic Sky Control system (pictured below) that is offered on the , ,  and . Now, Continental says it’s ready to be used on all-around windows.Engineers at Continental will exhibit what it calls a “suspended particle device” film. It is based on embedded particles which can arrange themselves randomly when not activated. If a voltage is applied, the particles align themselves in parallel, so as to allow light to pass through in both directions.According to Andreas Wolf, head of Continental’s body and security business unit, the windows can automatically lighten when approaching the vehicle with a key or smartphone. In addition to that, the technology brings about several benefits, including lower CO2 emissions through a cooler interior. “We can keep the heat out of the vehicle and significantly reduce the interior temperature,” Wolf said. He added that with the tech, it “relieves” the air conditioning unit, which can then be smaller, more efficient and lighter. Furthermore, sun visors and mechanical blinds can be omitted as well. According to him, calculations showed reduced CO2 emissions by four grammes per km. This gives electric vehicles an increased range of 5.5%. Secondly, it provides added safety and privacy, “if the vehicle is parked, the windows darken automatically, so the inside of the vehicle cannot be seen from the outside,” Wolf said.It comes at a price, the technology. The brand says that the the self-tinting tech is still rather expensive, but it’s anticipated that prices will drop quickly as initial applications are taking place in the mobile area. As a reference, other film technologies are based on liquid crystal polymers or electrochromism.",Graham Chin

As the champions go up against themselves, so does the Porsche.

2015-12-14,McLaren P1 production finally comes to an end,"When the McLaren P1 was first introduced at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show, the British carmaker stated that only 375 examples of the hybrid supercar will ever come into existence. Well, you’re looking at the final P1 to ever be produced, as  has reached the end of the supercar’s production, two years after the first car rolled of the assembly lineEvery McLaren P1 is custom-built to the specifications laid out by the owner, who works with the team at McLaren Special Operations (MSO). As a result, no two cars that exit the Ultimate Series production line within the McLaren Production Centre (MPC) are alike. The centre takes an average of 17 days to complete each individual bespoke model.This tailor-made approach is found on P1 chassis number #375 that is finished in a pearlescent orange, achieved through a unique tinting process. According to McLaren, the colour resonates the shade of the 64th and final McLaren F1 (chassis number #75), resulting in the creation of the Volcano Orange paintjob that is offered across the McLaren vehicle line-up today.Other exterior visual details include the raw carbon-fibre weave clearly visible on the splitter, diffuser and the aerodynamic blades along the lower body. The lightweight wheels meanwhile, are finished in silver. Bespoke touches for the interior include gloss black trim, and the lightweight carbon-fibre racing seats are upholstered in black and orange Alcantara to mirror the exterior.In contrast, the first P1 to be produced in September 2013, seen here alongside #375, received an Ice Silver paintwork along with extensive levels of visual carbon-fibre. Closer to home, you might recall a , which is another creation by MSO. One thing that remains constant for all P1s is its hybrid powertrain – a  petrol engine developing 737 PS and 720 Nm, paired with a lightweight electric motor that outputs 179 PS and 260 Nm. Combined, the powertrain provides 913 PS and 900 Nm.So there you have it, McLaren closes another chapter in its illustrious supercar history. Do you think the McLaren P1 is the best hybrid supercar among the so called “” or are you more inclined towards the LaFerrari and Porsche 918 Spyder?",Gerard Lye

2015-12-14,VIDEO: Honda BR-V for Thailand previewed in detail,"As recently , here is another look at the new Honda BR-V for Thailand. Available as a five- or seven-seater there, the Active Sport Crossover is expected to go on . In the meantime, Honda Thailand has revealed a new video showcasing its BR-V in action.Having shown you the exterior of the car on several occasions already, it is safe to say that not much has changed since we last saw the new Honda BR-V. The only difference between this and the model we snapped in Thailand is that this one doesn’t wear the brand’s sporty Modulo styling kit.For power, the BR-V has only been known to feature the same 1.5 litre SOHC i-VTEC four-cylinder petrol engine as seen on the Jazz and City. The four-pot puts out 117 hp at 6,000 rpm and 146 Nm of torque at 4,700 rpm. Drive is sent to the front wheels via an Earth Dreams CVT automatic transmission.The  is also largely similar to what we’ve seen before. The BR-V adopts a similar cabin to the Honda Jazz and Honda City B-segmenters. The dashboard features a central touchscreen display, with climate controls and readouts positioned just beneath it.The triple binnacle instruments are also familiar, along with a steering wheel we’ve seen on the previous-generation Jazz and City models too – unlike the Brio’s thicker three-spoke wheel we saw featured in Japan and Indonesia.However, what this video best details is the BR-V’s seating and cargo functionality, both for five- and seven-seater variants. In the clip, it is obvious that the seven-seater’s rear-most bench is a 50:50 split-folding type, but do note that the third-row seat’s base across the bench is a single piece.As previewed by the video, if you want the third-row seats to tumble forwards for more cargo space, you’ll have to sacrifice seating for both seats at the same time. The arrangement is a familiar one adopted by Honda, unlike Toyota’s arrangement for its new seven-seater Avanza MPV. There, the rear-most seats are separated from each other, making it possible to fold just one half of the third row – using one side for seating, the other for cargo storage.On the five-seater, ample cargo room is available from the start. But, if you insist on having more space, the 60:40 split second-row seats can be folded away and tumbled very easily with a single pull of a lever. The middle-row seats are also a lot more flexible than Toyota’s 50:50 arrangement in its equivalent Rush or Avanza MPV. The BR-V’s 60:40 bench offers the ability to fold the shorter half of the bench for cargo use, whilst the longer half still offers seating for two.The Honda BR-V will almost certainly . Question is, would you prefer it if Honda offered both five- and seven-seater options here like it does in Thailand? Or, would you prefer just one over the other? Which will it be?

2015-12-14,"Petrol prices tumble in the UK, now under £1 per litre","The continually falling prices of crude oil have seen UK fuel prices drop below one pound per litre. The new 99 pence (RM6.50) price tabled by Morrisons supermarket has become the lowest recorded price in the UK since 2009.Likewise, Asda, another supermarket chain, has also announced that it will be offering a special 97 pence (RM6.35) per litre promotional price over the coming weekend. It’s important to remember that unlike Malaysia, petrol and diesel prices in the UK (Europe and US too) aren’t standardised on a monthly basis by the government. It is normal to encounter different fuel prices daily, and from one station to the next.As mentioned, the low fuel prices at UK pumps is attributed to the continually falling prices of crude oil. The assessment is made based on the current Brent Crude oil listing of USD$40 (RM173) per barrel. The index is used as a benchmark for fuel prices around the world.However, the gradual decline of fuel prices in the UK doesn’t come as much of a surprise. In November, the country marked a low average of 1.05 pounds (RM6.90) per litre at the pumps. Still, the drop in prices isn’t as rapid as it is in Europe, where countries like Spain sell petrol from as low as 83.5 pence (RM5.45).In Malaysia, our petrol and diesel prices are also based on a market float, with new rates only implemented on the first of every month, and standardised across all stations.

The international environmental advocacy group noted that the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report had failed to provide information of the hazards of air pollution,  reports.It’s understood that the EIA report was submitted to ELAW by ‘Say No to SUKE’ (SNTS), a local group opposing the project. As a response, the Oregon-based group stated, “without such information, the document cannot provide decision-makers with a basis to reach a rational decision about whether the environmental costs of the project exceed the claimed benefits of the project,” Protem chairman of SNTS, Agos Hasan described the report as a “flawed document,” and a generic statement without relevance as to how it would impact air quality, particularly in the project area. In this, he was referring to the hazardous air pollution that residents along the alignment of the expressway would have to bear with.“Without providing quantitative information on how the project would impact air quality and how this would impact the respiratory health of children and preventable death from coronary heart disease in adults, the document cannot be a reasonable basis for deciding whether the claimed benefits of the project exceeded its potential human costs,” Hasan reiterated.According to the chairman, three major schools will be affected. To add to that, he said that residents in Ampang and Bukit Mandarina will be exposed daily to a 150 Air Pollutant Index (API) – three times that of the national limit. Aside from air pollution, Hasan also stated that the project had exceeded the maximum permissible sound level, which is currently set at 65 dBA.“The noise level for the project is expected to be between 87 and 96 dBA for those living within 20 metres of the highway,” he said. Furthermore, citing the Town and Country Planning Act of 1972, Hasan stated that SUKE was not listed in the Ampang Jaya town and Kuala Lumpur city plans, a requirement underlined in the Act. Hasan also highlighted that based on the same report, 64% of the public were not aware of the expressway, while there has been almost no public engagement by relevant agencies, even until today. The group will be taking legal action against the Selangor state government and Ampang Jaya Municipal council, with affidavits to be submitted to the courts in January, next year.It’s time to hear it from you guys.

2015-12-14,AD: Tips and tricks of proper tyre care with TYREPLUS,"What do you drive? A Proton? A Honda or a Porsche? Regardless of what car you own or how much horsepower the engine produces, at the end of the day, only four contact points ensure that your vehicle remains planted on the road.We are of course referring to tyres. Like other components of a car, they need to be properly maintained, and should they wear out, replaced as well. However, not many people are aware of the complexity of those “black and round” things. Here are some pointers on the basics of tyres, how to pick the right ones, proper maintenance for safety purposes, and how to perform regular checks, brought to you by TYREPLUS. Let’s start with what makes a tyre.Tyres are made up of several components. Beneath the visible tread, you’ll find the crown plies that provide the tread’s rigid base, for fuel economy and comfort. This layer is reinforced by the carcass ply, thin textile fibre cables bonded into the rubber. These cables are responsible for determining the strength of the tyre.In modern tubeless tyres, an airtight rubber (normally butyl rubber) replaces the inner tube. Whenever you pump air into the tyre, it enters this chamber. Even though it is pretty impermeable to significant leakage, air loss can still occur over time so regular checks are still needed. The bead meanwhile, clamps the tyre firmly against the wheel rim.A tyre’s sidewall is its most visible part. This part of a tyre flexes to provide comfort and stability during driving, while protecting the tyre from impacts with curbs. Besides that, it also contains markings that tell you all the important information relating to a tyre. Take for example a tyre with the measurements 185/60 R14. In this instance, 185 refers to the tyre’s width, 60 refers to the sidewall’s height that is equal to 60% of the tyre width, R for radial (circular) tyre and 14 for the wheel diameter it fits on (14-inch).There are also additional information located on the tyre’s sidewall including its load index (maximum load carrying capacity of the tyre at the maximum pressure), speed index (maximum speed capability of the tyre) and maximum load and pressure. To ensure your tyres are pumped to its optimum pressure for your car, refer to the tyre placard (usually stuck on the driver’s door sill, rear door sill or inside fuel flap) or the vehicle owner’s manual.With the basics sorted, we move on to the process of buying a tyre. First, you need to consider the climate of the area you’ll be driving on. In Malaysia, we alternate between wet and dry roads, with both having distinct requirements of tyres. The best choice would be an optimum combination that reduces the risk of aquaplaning and provides sufficient grip.Secondly, consider the usage pattern. It wouldn’t make a lot of sense to fit tyres that aren’t able to tolerate high speeds on a Porsche 911 GT3 RS when tackling a race track. Similarly, standard road-going tyres won’t be appropriate for an off-road vehicle either. For standard daily use on highways and in cities, a tyre which provides minimum braking distance in wet and dry conditions are best. Those who cover plenty of highway miles will appreciate comfort and silence.After you’ve purchased the new tyres, you’ll need to make sure that they are properly maintained. This includes monitoring the tyre pressure, tyre wear and remaining tread depth, along with alignment and balancing. Additionally, it is important to look out for any damages or irregularities in tyre wear, which could reduce the life span of your tyre. It’s clear that tyres are certainly not something to be taken lightly, as they play an important role in keeping you safe on the roads. Therefore, it’s due diligence to ensure that you visit a proper tyre retailer that can guide and educate you further on getting the best “shoes” for your car. For more information on how to be safe and save with your tyre purchase decisions, visit the . TYREPLUS is an independent professional network of tyre retail stores that can be found in eight states across Malaysia – Johor, Kedah, Pahang, Perak, Pulau Pinang, Selangor, Terengganu, and Kuala Lumpur.

However, he also admitted that the company’s engineers had then found it impossible to meet the US’ tough regulations, which were even stricter than those in Europe at the time. Volkswagen’s own cost and timing targets presented an equal challenge.“Looking back, we regrettably have to recognise that the developers involved in the EA 189 project quite simply could not find a way to meet the tougher NOx (nitrogen dioxide) limits in the United States by permissible means,” the chairman explained.The rest, as you know, was history. Volkswagen had developed and utilised a cheating software to . The first model to feature the device was the Jetta in 2009. Equipped with the infamous EA 189 four-cylinder diesel engine, the car entered the US market and was quickly acclaimed for its great fuel efficiency and low NOx emissions.To date, it is believed that up to 450 internal and external investigators are involved in the ongoing case. Investigations are also underway to uncover responsible decision makers, and also those who knew about the company’s illegal activities and did nothing to report it.Poetsch said, “we are not talking about a one-off mistake but a whole chain of mistakes that was not interrupted at any point along the timeline. We still do not know that these people involved in this issue from 2005 to the present day were fully aware of the risks they were taking and of the potential damage they could expose the company to.”Thus far, nine  believed to be involved in the dieselgate saga  prior to the conclusion of the case.

But since then, Nissan has grown to be a more profitable company than its French partner, with a larger market value and greater sales figures. The  contributed 1.56 billion euros to Renault’s bottom line last year. Technically, it deserves a bigger say in the Alliance, and that’s even before a third actor stirred the pot.According to , France increased its stake in Renault to 19.74% without informing CEO Carlos Ghosn in advance. The move was meant to boost the government’s power at one of the country’s key manufacturers by pushing through a loyalty-shareholder program, which doubled the voting rights of investors who have held stock for over two years. Renault’s board includes two reps of the French state.  That would have effectively given France control over Nissan, which stake in Renault is non-voting. It’s a fundamental issue that could break up the 16-year old Alliance, although the fire has been doused, for now.  Following a Renault board meeting in Paris and a Nissan board meeting in Tokyo last week, Alliance chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn issued a statement:“After months of discussions, I am happy to say that an agreement has been reached that builds on our heritage and strong foundations to achieve further sustainable growth and success of the two partners. While there were important short-term issues to address, it was imperative that all involved took a long view,” Ghosn said. The agreement is based on three points:The last point is an important one in the so called “Stability Covenant” and the non-interference in Nissan’s governance will include Nissan shareholders’ decisions on the appointment, dismissal and compensation of Nissan board members. Nissan didn’t succeed in activating voting rights for its 15% shares in Renault, although the deal means that it will not need to cough out money to increase its stake in Renault to counter the French government’s influence. Crisis averted for now, but as long as the fundamental issue of Nissan’s under-representation in the Alliance isn’t solved, there will be rumblings. “This is only the first round of the battle. For the time being everybody will be comfortable, but there will be second round down the road,” said Koji Endo, an analyst at Advanced Research Japan who’s covered the sector for more than 30 years.It’s impossible to not have fights in a marriage, but when a third party is involved…",Danny Tan
2015-12-14,Audi debuts Gecko Air Freshener as official accessory,"Recently added to the list of many official accessories one can buy for their Audis, here is its latest air freshener gecko. Designed to reflect the lizard synonymous with the brand’s quattro all-wheel drive system, the item is priced at 7.50 euros (RM35) and is available at all German and UK dealerships.Despite the four colour options, only two scents are available, being pine and orange. On its website, the air freshener gecko’s description reads, “an original and efficient fragrance dispenser for your Audi. The gecko air freshener is inserted simply and quickly onto the ribs of the air vent and provides a pleasant fragrance in the vehicle for approx. 60 days.”It’s probably not the most creative non-car product commissioned by the Volkswagen Group, but it certainly makes for a clever Christmas gift idea, wouldn’t you say? Not to mention that it is incredibly cute.In the past, we’ve even seen the Group go as far as to sell Volkswagen-branded curry sausages. And, we all know too well about the extensive range of Porsche Design items that are often way too overpriced for the average bloke. This gecko ought to do nicely, at just RM35, thereabouts.",Chris Aaron
2015-12-14,SPIED: 2016 Proton Perdana shows us its side again,"The 2016 Proton Perdana has been spied testing again. This time,  reader Airul Amirul sent in a photo of the national carmaker’s upcoming flagship D-segment sedan that was sighted near Proton’s Shah Alam factory, When the  at this year’s  event, it was clear that the new Perdana will look largely different from its donor car, the eighth-generation Honda Accord. This side view of the Perdana appears to reinforce that opinion.Among the differences involve an increase in the car’s length by 150 mm from the donor car to 4,999 mm. As  have revealed, it appears the majority of that growth in length is centralised around the rear of the car. That extension has resulted in a reworking of the car’s rear doors that now “kink” outwards just after the top of it, as opposed to the Accord’s doors, which slopes inwards.There is also less camo on certain parts of the  here, beginning with the alloy wheels that match up to the ones we saw at the preview. Additionally, the headlights and tail lights seem to resemble the previewed car more closely, unlike the previous test mule that had the Accord’s light units.The 2016 Proton Perdana will be built at Proton’s Medium Volume Factory in Shah Alam, together with the Exora MPV. Engine wise, it’s set to retain Honda’s 154 hp/189 Nm R20A3 2.0 and 177 hp/222 Nm K24Z2 2.4 litre i-VTEC petrol mills, mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The Perdana will be offered to the public in the first quarter of 2016.",Gerard Lye
2015-12-14,Mercedes-Benz CLA wide-body kit by Fairy Design,"The  has just received a wide-body kit from custom specialists, Fairy Design. The relatively unknown company hails from Kyoto, Japan. It has taken a bold step to give the four-door coupe a style that might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but cool nevertheless. Before that, a quick look at the company’s website shows that it has done work on premium cars such as Porsche and a . It is also understood that the Japanese company has been involved in the  project too. That alone should give it some credibility, especially when it comes to the price of the wide-body kit on this Merc.On the front, the four-door coupe receives a front lip spoiler, while the sides are flanked with wide bolted flares, fitted to all four wheel arches. The front flares comes with air intakes as well. Down in the back, the boot gets a trunk spoiler and an aggressive bumper with a rear diffuser as well.No upgrades to the powertrain and drivetrain have been done here. As a refresher, beneath the hood of the CLA 200 is a 1.6 litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine that makes 154 hp and 250 Nm. It is mated to a 7G-Tronic seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. The 0-100 km/h sprint is achieved in 8.5 seconds. The  however, sports a larger 2.0 litre four-cylinder engine with 355 hp and 450 Nm. It is paired with an AMG Speedshift DCT seven-speed transmission and does 0-100 km/h in 4.6 seconds instead.In total, the entire aesthetic package is priced at 960,000 yen (RM34,250) if one opts for standard non-carbon-fibre material. However, should one be so inclined to have the front lip spoiler, rear diffuser and trunk spoiler in said carbon-fibre, the total package together with the flares will cost 1,200,000 yen (RM42,820).",Graham Chin

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) begins operating following the implementation of the  system at toll plazas,  reports.Works minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof told the publication that the system, which will be deployed in stages, will provide highway users with information such as estimated destination arrival times and traffic congestion alerts on highways, expressways and artery roads. The system will be able to provide motorists with alternative routes or detours during peak periods. “Users will be promptly informed from the traffic broadcasting system about the situation on toll roads and other routes. ITS will include communication between vehicle and vehicle and also with pedestrians,” he explained.“It can also inform the authorities to respond to hazards and road crashes quickly. This includes ‘intelligent speed adaptation’ for all road users to apply safe speed limits in view of the danger ahead,” he said, adding that in developed countries, the ITS provides hazard warning and traffic information to the public via mobile phone apps as well as through in-vehicle devices.Fadillah said that the ITS will be developed in stages after the implementation of the non-barrier MLFF system on highways and expressways nationwide in 2018 – the system will utilise a  concept. He said that Malaysia is serious about exploring the ITS system because of its many benefits to road users.“A national blueprint on ITS will be ready by the end of 2016. From there, we will identify which system to adopt. Our challenge will be funding and finding suitable and affordable technology that is sustainable,” he stated. He did not rule out public-private partnerships to develop the system, the report added.",Anthony Lim

2015-12-14,Audi claims easy fix for Dieselgate-affected 3.0 TDI V6,"According to Audi CEO, Rupert Stadler, the automaker has found a simple fix for vehicles equipped with the Volkswagen Group’s  engine that contain defeat devices, designed to foil emissions tests. In a report by , Stadler told a gathering of 7,000 workers at Audi’s Ingolstadt headquarters, “swift, straightforward and customer-friendly solutions are in discussion. Every day we are taking another step toward the solution.” In November, it was revealed that around 85,000 vehicles from Volkswagen, Porsche and Audi were affected by the widening “Dieselgate” scandal. The affected models were said to carry auxiliary emission-control devices (AECD) in its engines, which are capable of adjusting the working temperature of the vehicle’s catalytic, deemed illegal by US authorities.A notice of violation (NOV) issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated that the 3.0 litre TDI V6 engine carried defeat devices that detect when vehicles are undergoing emissions testing. To meet emission standards, it would configure the engine to a low NOx temperature conditioning mode. However, once the testing is completed, the device reverts back to its “normal” setting, where emissions of NOx increase up to nine times the EPA standard.Following this, the German carmaker claimed that it could repair the problem with just a software update. Stadler’s statement is an indication that such a simple fix might already be on the way. VW AG earlier revealed its fix for its EA189 four-cylinder TDI engines (1.6 and 2.0 litre capacities) at the end of November, which is more advanced that just a software update.",Gerard Lye

Earlier in a separate report, it was said that the requirement for students to show their student cards or be in uniform to benefit from this discount will be in effect only until January 7, 2016.After that point, only students with the KTMB Student i-Card would qualify for the 50% discount. To get the card, students would need to fill up a form and have it verified by their schools. An annual fee of RM31.80 would be charged. How this will work for University students has yet to be announced.For the ERL service, 1Malaysia Students Discount Card (KADS1M) holders, the disabled and senior citizens would get a 30% discount. ERL Putrajaya users would also benefit from a discount, but the amount wasn’t specified.Speaking of the recent price hikes, the Prime Minister said, “I know people are angry and because of that, I want to announce that there are several measures which we will take.” He was referring to the recent  for a one-way trip between KL Sentral and KLIA/KLIA2, and KTM Komuter’s increase from an 11 sen per km rate to 15 sen rate.Najib also referred to the recent hikes as “steep,” reportedly saying that the long term concession with the YTL-owned company had reached a point where the concessionaire is in a more favourable position than its service users.Having held off the price hikes for some 14 years now, it was said that should the Prime Minister prevent the concessionaire from affecting the public with its recent price hikes, the government would have to pay up to RM2.9 billion in compensation. He added, “we can renegotiate, but that means we have to extend (the deal) by another 30 years because the agreement has been signed.”The Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) echoed the Prime Minister’s sentiments.

Now, reports of a delay have surfaced, something that fans and well-wishers must be immune to by now.  An official document has purportedly revealed that the supporting cast will arrive later than expected. The original plan was for all eight new models, Giulia included, to surface by 2018. The target date has now been pushed back to mid-2020 at the earliest,  reports.The main reason behind the delay is the slowdown of the Chinese market. Also cited are reduced investment in Alfa Romeo from 2018 and the increased need for an expanding distribution network across the globe.Giulia aside, Alfa’s fresh line-up will have two SUVs codenamed Tipo 949 and Tipo 962. After those, an executive sedan codenamed Tipo 961 will go after the BMW 5 Series and rivals. Also planned are a new sports car (in coupe and Spider forms) and two compact models, one of the latter to replace .It is added that despite the delay, Alfa is still confident that annual sales will rise from 80,000 units , when all eight models work in unison. This comes after  reported that the Giulia Quadrifoglio sedan, , will now go on sale in Europe in the middle of next year,  than initially planned. Regular Giulias are set to debut in late 2016. The same report, which cites suppliers, adds that Alfa’s first SUV will not surface before early 2017, nine months later than planned. The US launches for both cars are scheduled to happen about three to six months after Europe. When it comes to Alfa Romeo, it’s best not to have any expectations, or trust any promises.

2015-12-10,US vehicle safety ratings may see inclusion of crash avoidance technology and pedestrian protection,"A proposal has been submitted by federal regulators in the US to revamp the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) five-star vehicle safety ratings. The proposal calls for the inclusion of scores relating to crash avoidance technology and pedestrian protection as well as a new test to measure the performance of frontal offset crash,  reports. Said proposal suggests that vehicles be allowed to obtain half-star increments for cars and trucks, beginning with the 2019 model year. If the proposal passes, it could possibly see features such as automatic emergency braking, blind spot detection, lane departure warning and pedestrian detection systems as standard.Some of the changes proposed include a front oblique crash test designed to simulate specific accidents that contribute to large number of deaths and serious injuries. Full frontal crash tests using a fifth percentile female dummy to measure safety of rear passengers and children in particular is also considered. The third addition calls for more human-like crash test dummies to measure the possibility of injuries to the chest, abdomen, lower spine and even the brain. Next, a pedestrian five-star rating that includes the availability and performance of frontal pedestrian automatic braking and rear automatic braking systems will also be added.The fifth proposed change includes a rating for crash avoidance and advanced technology features. These include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and automatic headlight beam switching. Lastly, is an updated criteria to gauge a vehicle’s resistance to rollovers. Anthony Foxx, US transportation secretary said, “the NHTSA’s 5-Star Safety Ratings have set the bar on safety since it began in 1978, and today we are raising that bar.” He added, “the changes provide more and better information to new vehicle shoppers that will help accelerate the technology innovations that save lives.”An increase in highway fatalities in the US (up by 8.1% in the first half of 2015) is said to have triggered the call for an enhanced safety rating system. The NHTSA is planning to engage with the public by collecting comments. Following that, a final decision will be issued by end 2016.",Graham Chin
2015-12-11,Nissan X-Trail Hybrid – first impressions from Japan,"The  is already a stand out in the midsize mass market SUV segment thanks to its extra two seats. The third row may be tight, but kids can be squeezed in at a pinch, avoiding certain “I think we’ll need two cars” situations. Three generations in three rows, a good family car.Also helping the third-gen X-Trail’s cause is its new styling direction that moves away from the  of the first two generations. Today’s T32 is handsome and has substantial size and presence to match. It’s a smooth and relaxing car to drive as well, typical of CVT-equipped Nissans. A likeable family SUV, as noted in  from earlier this year. There’s a new X-Trail Hybrid variant that’s already on sale in Japan and , promising superior economy and more grunt. Should it come to Malaysia – which has incentives for locally assembled hybrids – the petrol-hybrid T32 could add superb value to its arsenal as well, making a good product even more convincing. We briefly sample it in Japan.The X-Trail Hybrid’s internal combustion engine is the same 2.0 litre unit found in our 2.0 2WD variant, but the MR20DD has been optimised for the hybrid system – changes include a low-friction oil seal and the deletion of the auxiliary belt. Output is slightly higher compared to our 144 PS/200 Nm MR20DD, at 147 PS at 6,000 rpm and 207 Nm at 4,400 rpm. Partnering the ICE is an RM31 electric motor (that’s its name, not the price!) with 41 PS and 160 Nm of twist, powered by a lithium-ion battery pack with quick charge/discharge function.Nissan’s Intelligent Dual Clutch Control is a one-motor, two-clutch parallel hybrid system. Not to be confused with a twin-clutch gearbox (like the non-hybrid X-Trail, this car is CVT-only), “dual clutch” refers to the clutch between the engine and the electric motor, and the clutch between the electric motor and the Xtronic CVT. Engine and motor energy can be channeled mechanically to the transmission without a torque converter. The setup also allows electric-only driving and energy regeneration because the electric motor can power the wheels through the gearbox while leaving the engine disconnected. Coasting without the ICE is possible when your foot is off the gas pedal, at speeds below 120 km/h. There’s no button to force it into EV mode, like in the Toyota Prius. Nissan says that the lithium-ion battery’s ability to quickly charge and discharge allows for high-speed, precise control of the electric motor and optimum clutch control, which leads to smooth starts and quick shifts. See the video below for a better understanding of how Nissan’s one-motor, two-clutch hybrid system works.Coupled with a smoothened underbody and low-rolling resistance tyres, the X-Trail Hybrid is capable of a best in class 20.6 km/l in the Japanese JC08 cycle, as well as 75% lower NOx (nitrogen oxide) and NMHC (non-methane hydrocarbon) emissions over 2005 standards and SU-LEV certification.Claimed FC figures, especially JC08 ones, are impossible to achieve in real world Malaysian driving, but there should be significant savings over the regular 2.0L, which is rated at 16.4 km/l in the same cycle. Nissan says that the X-Trail Hybrid generates more torque than the 2.5 throughout the rev range, from low to high rpm, thanks to double propulsion. After sampling the SUV for one small inner lap of the Sodegaura Forest Raceway, we’ll take their word for it. The Hybrid certainly felt sprightly off the line, even if we didn’t have the benefit of back-to-back comparison with the non-hybrids. The extra punch from electric motor is palpable, too.  Of the two X-Trail variants currently on sale in Malaysia, we prefer the 2.0’s superior manners and adequate grunt over the muscular but gruff 2.5. Pending a more comprehensive drive, the Hybrid could be the best of both worlds.  Combining the grunt of the 2.5, manners of the 2.0 and best in class fuel economy would easily make the Hybrid the pick of the range. Unfortunately, fitting in the batteries that deliver the above-mentioned benefits means that the Hybrid is only available as a five-seater, removing one of the X-Trail’s unique selling points.  Located behind the rear seats, the battery also reduces cargo volume, from our car’s 550 litres to over 400 litres. These two points are not fatal shots to the Hybrid’s case; but if the original car’s two emergency seats appealed to you, sorry, you can’t have your cake and eat it too.Unique additions include Hybrid badges on the sides and tailgate, an Energy Flow page on the full-colour multi-info display, and a hybrid power meter that takes the place of the regular car’s temperature gauge (under the rev meter). Head to head with fellow five-seaters  and , the X-Trail Hybrid makes a compelling case. If Tan Chong can locally assemble and price it keenly, the T32 Hybrid could be a game changer in the midsize SUV segment.",Danny Tan

The Avantgarde models get sportier shapes, while AMG line models receive extended side bolsters and a wider shoulder section for more lateral support. The Exclusive line gets you longitudinal seat stripes; the designo seats are quilted and feature the lateral support of the sports seats.The second video listed here is a highlight reel of the W213 E-Class model’s development phase. The car is seen put through its paces on different surfaces, and even on the infamous Nordschleife circuit. And, was that the new AMG E63 we see at 0:14 in the clip?You’ll also be briefly shown the car undergoing several autonomous driving tests, including autonomous braking and lane changes. Remember that the new E-Class also features a . Best of all, you get to see the car drift on snow like a bat out of hell.The third video is essentially a shortened version of the first, quickly running through the key features of the car.

2015-12-10,W213 Merc E-Class gets Active Lane Change Assist,"Mercedes-Benz is expanding its Driving Assistance package with a new Active Lane Change Assist feature, which will first be seen on its coming .The new radar- and camera-based feature is capable of actively performing a highway lane change all on its own. It does so by using a long-range radar system and a stereo camera to monitor the area in front of the vehicle, while its multi-mode radar sensors permanently check its rear and sides.Both systems are also capable of factoring in the speed of detected vehicles in the vicinity. To engage the system, drivers need only to activate the turn indicator for more than two seconds before the car takes over to perform the lane change in either direction.The system will only be available for use on multi-lane roads and at speeds between 80 to 180 km/h when the Steering Pilot system is activated. If the system detects an oncoming vehicle that may interfere, it will not engage the lane change.The automaker stressed that nearly 15% of all accidents on German roads happen between two vehicles travelling in the same direction, almost 20% of them resulting from collisions when changing lanes.",Chris Aaron
2015-12-10,Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell sets top speed record,"A new video released by Hyundai USA highlights that the  has set a new land speed record of 152 km/h (94.6 mph). Shot at the Soggy Dry Lake Bed in the California desert, it seems that it’s not the only thing that the brand wants to put on record. It’s a clever (and discreet) way to showcase how the Korean brand has actually beaten other automakers to the hydrogen-power game. Hyundai highlights that the Tucson Fuel Cell was the first mass-produced fuel cell car with almost a hundred of its hydrogen-powered Tucsons already roaming the streets of California. The company further emphasises that the first vehicle was delivered to a customer back in June 2014. In addition to that, a look at its website shows that with the Tucson’s high ground clearance, it’s actually the first hydrogen-powered SUV to have travelled on off-road terrain (desert terrain).Inside the front-wheel drive Tucson Fuel Cell, is a 134 hp electric motor. In addition, it has hydrogen storage tanks with a capacity of 5.63 kg, which only require 10 minutes to fill up to full. Batteries are 24 kW lithium-ion polymer cells, that allow for a travel range of 426 km. It’s mated to a single-speed transmission.Based on the website, Southern California, where hydrogen refuelling is currently centred at, will see some 50 hydrogen infrastructures in operation by 2016. Here, the brand says that it’s ready to cater to increasing consumer demand in California and other future states, which are planning to introduce hydrogen fuelling.As mentioned, while Hyundai has already been in the picture for some years now, other brands have just begun to catch on in terms of fuel cell vehicles and production.

2015-12-10,GrabCar drivers assured that they will be taken care of,"Current or prospective  drivers have been told they need not worry about continuing to provide the services. The ride-sharing app developer has allegedly given its assurance that it will provide these “partners” with financial and legal assistance should they encounter any trouble with the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD). recently attended a briefing for new GrabCar applicants, who are only required to bring along their MyKad, valid driving licence and their vehicles insurance cover note. During the hour-long briefing, the organiser explained to participants how the GrabCar service operated, and what to do should they bump into a “SPAD brick wall.”“If you are issued with summons (fines), we will pay for it. If you have to go to court, we will provide you legal assistance. We will help you financially and legally. That’s our promise to support GrabCar drivers,” he claimed.Additionally, the facilitator also provided the participants with tips on how to identify a genuine customer from an undercover SPAD officer, when receiving a booking through the app. “When you see a customer with an ID of ‘0001’ from the last four digit, it means the person is a first time user and it is a high probability it is a SPAD officer. You can request full details of this customer by calling our customer service,” he said.On the other hand, should the customer be a lady requesting to ride into the vehicle alone, “then it is safe to accept booking.” The facilitator continued by detailing the  of undercover SPAD officers seeking to nab  drivers. “They would get in your car with one sitting at the back and the other person would sit as the front passenger,” he said. “The moment the front passenger asks you a lot of questions about GrabCar such as how much you are earning as GrabCar driver, since when and how you get involve with the service, who’s your boss and many other questions, this is surely an undercover officer,” he added.The officer at the rear seat would remain quiet and record the entire conversation by using a mobile phone as evidence, explained the facilitator. At the end of the trip, should the driver suspect that his/her passengers are SPAD officers, they should not accept any cash. “But if the officers just kept quiet during the journey, follow with the cash transaction and later if you are arrested, that is still okay,” said the instructor. GrabCar drivers should not resist arrest and must cooperate.“Just uninstall the app in your mobile phone before you are brought to SPAD headquarters in Subang. Your statement will be taken and SPAD would only impound your car for a while because there is still the court process. Don’t worry, we will take care of you,” guaranteed the facilitator.",Gerard Lye
2015-12-10,Lotus Exige Sport 350 introduced with added lightness,"Lotus has announced a new variant for its Exige. The new Exige Sport 350 replaces the Exige S, and has been updated to be lighter and faster than before. It also adopts the ‘Sport’ naming designation, similar to the .Tipping the scales at just 1,125 kg, the Exige Sport 350 is 51 kg lighter compared to the previous Exige S. This weight loss is attributed to the introduction of a louvered tailgate panel, a lighter battery, engine mounts, centre console, with the latter featuring an exposed gearshift mechanism, HVAC pipework and optimised use of sound insulation.Power still comes from a 3.5 litre supercharged V6 engine, providing 345 hp at 7,000 rpm and 400 Nm of torque at 4,500 rpm. Paired with a heavily revised six-speed manual gearbox, the Exige Sport 350 will make the century sprint in 3.9 seconds and continue on to a top speed of 274 km/h. A six-speed automatic (with paddle shifters) is also available here, capable of performing up-shifts in 240 miliseconds, while downshifts include an automatic throttle-blip when the car is placed in ‘Sport’ mode. With the auto box, the car does the 0-100 km/h sprint slightly quicker at 3.8 seconds, but is accompanied by a lower top speed (261 km/h) and a five kg bump in weight.Beneath the metal, the Exige Sport 350 suspension setup now receives firmer dampers and a revised geometry to deliver better handling. This is aided by the car’s aerodynamic styling that produces 42 kg of downforce at 160 km/h. The Exige Sport 350 is capable of lapping Lotus’ Hethel track with a time of 1 minute 29.8 seconds, which is 2.5 seconds faster than the previous model.Exterior features include LED headlights and tail lights and cast alloy wheels finished in gloss black, measuring 17 inches at the front and 18 inches at the rear, wrapped in Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tyres. The car’s front splitter, rear wing, front access panel, wing mirrors, rear transom, hard top and rear diffuser are finished in matte black, but can be repainted to another colour at no extra cost.Inside, the Exige Sport 350’s cabin remains familiar with minor tweaks being introduced. The Lotus Dynamic Performance Management (DPM) system that allows drivers to opt between three modes – ‘Drive’, ‘Sport’ and ‘Race’, now gets larger switches with improved haptics.Customers will also be able to select from a wide range of options as well. There are three trim pack offerings – Alcantara, leather, tartan, the latter of which is heritage theme that is a throwback to the Lotus Esprit S1, with a choice of red or yellow tartan. Other options include air-conditioning and a Clarion multimedia unit.Performance-focused options include lightweight forged alloy wheels, plus cross drilled and vented two-piece brake discs. Select these two, and the Exige Sport 350 sheds even more weight, down to 1,115 kg. For aesthetic purposes, the brake calipers can be painted black or yellow as well. The Lotus Exige Sport 350 goes on sale in Europe in February 2016, starting from 55,900 pounds (RM360,347), and will be available outside Europe, excluding North America from March 2016.",Gerard Lye

2015-12-09,"Devel Sixteen’s V16 quad-turbo engine makes 4,515 hp","Every now and then, an obscure carmaker will claim to produce a . An example of this is the Devel Sixteen, which debuted as a concept at the 2013 Dubai Motor Show. The Dubai-based company behind the car claimed at the time that the V16 engine in the Devel Sixteen was to have 5,000 hp, something which may just measure up given a new video released by the company.In the video, we are introduced to the Devel Sixteen’s powerplant as it undergoes testing on the dyno. A company called Steve Morris Engines is the brains behind the massive engine, and the maker is more than happy to share some details and performance figures of its creation, touted as the most powerful engine ever built for a production car.Unsurprisingly, the Devel Sixteen gets a 12.3 litre V16 quad-turbo engine, which the company claims is a world’s first. On the other hand, the  is powered by a W16 quad-turbo motor instead. The single billet block engine in the Devel features 32 titanium valves, custom cylinder heads, one billet cam shaft, one crankshaft and is linked to four 81 mm turbine turbochargers.On to the numbers, and we’ll start with the engine being tuned for road (day-to-day) use. Running on 93 octane fuel from the pump and with the boost set to 20 psi, the engine develops 3,006 hp at 6,900 rpm. If that isn’t enough, put in race fuel and bump the boost up to 36 psi, and the monstrous engine will output 4,515 hp and 4,771 Nm of torque!However, this is still shy of the carmaker’s initial 5,000 hp claim, leaving us a little “disappointed” to say the least, though development work is still ongoing. The Devel Sixteen is also claimed to make the 0-100 km/h sprint in 1.8 seconds, with a top speed of 560 km/h. Big numbers indeed, but we reckon it’ll take more than just a stonking engine (tyres, chassis, suspension, gearbox, etc.) to get that level of performance.On the company’s website, it states that the Devel Sixteen is “created with the passion of making a car to be a legend in the history of automobiles, to be born with extreme performance & unimaginable outstanding power of ten super cars, to pioneer a new era that never have been achieved before, a distinctive design of this new generation brings you the ultimate breakthrough feeling of a jet fighter with a power surpassing any car in the world.” That sound big enough for you?",Gerard Lye
2015-12-09,Alfa Romeo 4C by Pogea Racing – tuned to 314 hp,"If the  is your kind of coupe, then Pogea Racing’s 4C Centurion 1Plus might pique your interest. The German tuners have kitted-up the little Italian sports car and in addition to that, they’ve also found a way to squeeze out more power from the 4C’s mighty little engine. Underneath the compact coupe is a 1.75 litre four-cylinder turbocharged engine, which can also be found beneath the . In its original state of tune, it produces 240 hp and 350 Nm. Pogea Racing has managed to up those figures to 314 hp and 455 Nm, in the Centurion 1Plus. Furthermore, the boost in power is also matched to a tuned TCT dry twin-clutch transmission, which now changes gears by up to 55% quicker. The combination allows for the 895 kg 4C to go from 0-96 km/h (60 mph) in just 3.8 seconds (over 4.1 seconds) and achieve a top speed of 305 km/h (over 257 km/h).Aesthetic enhancements that comes with the 4C Centurion 1Plus include a carbon-fibre body that comprises of a front bumper, grille inserts, side skirts, a rear apron, a diffuser and a functional spoiler in the back. The rear wing is said to be able to generate an added 35 kg of downforce to the rear axle at speeds of 160 km/h.To give it better handling characteristics, the tuned 4C features a set of springs to also give it a lower stance by 50 mm. On top of that, a pair of 18-inch front and 19-inch rear ultralight forged XCUT rims wrapped in Michelin 225/40ZR18 (front) and 265/30ZR19 (rear) tyres, can be opted for.While the base car is already limited as it is (3,500 units), Pogea Racing says only 10 of the 4C Centurion 1Plus will be built. As to how much it will cost, the tuners have tagged the entire package including the base vehicle, paintwork and assembly at USD$87,100 (RM371,150) – that’s way more affordable than the !

2015-12-09,SPYSHOTS: Fiat 124 Abarth Spider takes to the streets,", here’s the first look at the coming Fiat Abarth 124 Spider. The hotter version of the  roadster was spied during a public road test in Europe, wearing about as much camouflage as can be fitted on it.There are, however, several cues that give it away as the 124 Abarth. For starters, a quick look at the rear of the car reveals that unlike the regular Fiat 124’s dual tips, quad exhaust tips are to be found.  At the front, there appears to be a seam in the covers that makes room for an air scoop on the hood.Peeking through the covers over the front bumper, it appears that the 124 Abarth will feature larger air intakes than the Fiat roadster. The gunmetal grey wheels also look larger than those on the Fiat 124, and in a design we’ve not seen featured before.Previously, we reported that , each using Fiat’s 1.4 litre MultiAir Turbo four-cylinder engine, tuned for different power outputs.There will likely be a base variant with 160 hp, a mid-spec version with 190 hp, and a range-topping variant that will pack more than 200 hp. All three variants are also expected to offer chassis upgrades for better handling, along with a more aggressive body, as these pictures confirm.Abarth is also said to be preparing to have its own version of .

2015-12-09,Japan plans to replace sales tax with new car levy,"Japan may see a new car levy coming in to replace the current vehicle acquisition tax, according to a report. The plan by the Liberal Democratic Party – which is being submitted today to the ruling party’s special tax investigative committee – proposes to have four grades of tax rates for regular passenger vehicles sold in the country. The rates, which range from zero to 3%, will be based on the fuel efficiency of vehicles, the news agency said. Minicars and commercial vehicles will be levied from zero to 2%, while electric vehicles, fuel-cell vehicles and plug-in hybrids will be exempted from tax.The new levy is similar to the current vehicle acquisition tax system, which offers lower tax rates for green vehicles. Japan’s automotive industry has campaigned for scrapping the car acquisition tax amidst plans by the government to increase the sales tax to 10% in 2017 – a decline in demand for vehicles came about when the tax rate was raised to 8% last year.Revenue obtained from the new tax would be about 89 billion yen ($725 million), according to information obtained by . If it goes through, the new levy will begin in April 2017, which is the date set by the government for the proposed tax rate increase.",Anthony Lim
2015-12-09,Genesis G90 (EQ900) revealed – new S-Class fighter?,"Hyundai has officially revealed its first model under its . Meet the Genesis G90, or if you live in Korea, the EQ900. The G90 was earlier  ahead of its debut, and will serve as the replacement for the  to occupy the top of the Genesis model line-up.Being the “Korean S-Class” in a sense, the G90 measures 5,205 mm long, 1,915 mm wide, 1,495 mm tall and has a wheelbase of 3,160 mm. By comparison, the dimensions of the actual W222 S-Class in long wheelbase form stands at 5,246 mm (L), 1,899 mm (W), 1,496 mm (H) and a wheelbase of 3,165 mm. The styling of the G90 is overseen by Peter Schreyer, and is a far cry from its predecessor, sporting a more upmarket look thanks to a longer hood with the Genesis badge at the front. There is also a chromed hexagonal grille dubbed the ‘Crest’ grille, which is expected to be a trademark for upcoming Genesis models.LED headlights take their place beside the grille, with LED daytime running lights occupying the corners of the lower fascia. Moving further back, there are multi-spoke alloy wheels available in 18- and 19-inch sizes. At the rear, there are LED tail lights flow down the edges of the car, plus twin exhaust tips.Hyundai touts the G90 as having “human-centered ergonomics, total interior harmony, absolute convenience and luxurious comfort.” The company claims to use the best materials in the cockpit, with specially-developed semi-aniline leather (for the seats), along with Nappa leather and glossy real wood elsewhere.Passengers inside have access to plenty of features starting with a 12.3-inch high definition display screen that occupies the centre console. The display is linked to the car’s infotainment system and camera, and boasts a Lexicon sound system with Quantum Logic surround sound and Clari-fi audio software. Rear seating is split into two (with a centre console running through the middle), each with a dedicated 9.2-inch screen and a smart phone wireless charging pad. A three-zone automatic air-conditioning system ensures maximum comfort for all occupants (front and rear) as well.The driver hasn’t been left out either, with an electronically-controlled seat that features 22 ranges of adjustment. Engineers have also implemented the world’s first Smart Posture Caring (SPC) system to determine the optimal position for the driver’s body to minimise stress on long journeys.Those long journeys are also made easier thanks to the ‘Highway Driving Assistance’ system that is reserved for the Korean market only. It includes Advanced Smart Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Assistance System and a combination of newly developed technologies.This level of luxury in the G90 is supplemented by low levels of NVH, thanks to a multi-link suspension setup front and rear. Hyundai’s engineers also introduced sound-absorbing materials throughout the cabin and sub-structure of the car. Even the 19-inch wheels get a special hollow design to minimise tyre noise.As for the G90’s powertrain, three engine options are available here, starting with a 3.8 litre GDI V6 that provides 315 PS and 397 Nm of torque. Next up is a 3.3 litre turbocharged GDi V6 engine that outputs 370 PS and 510 Nm of torque. The most powerful powerplant available for the G90 is the 425 PS/520 Nm 5.0 litre GDI V8 engine. An eight-speed automatic transmission is paired to all three engine options. Drive is directed to the rear wheels as standard, with all-wheel drive being an option.On the safety side of things, the G90 packs nine airbags, along with Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) with pedestrian detection, Active Blind Spot Detection (BSD), Driver Attention Alert, Smart High Beam Assist and an Around View Monitor.The Genesis G90 is just one of the . Other models that are expected to join the G90 include a , a new version of the , two SUVs and a possible replacement for the Genesis Coupe.",Gerard Lye

The news has been widely reported following the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.As part of an ambitious strategy to prevent negative climate change and promote green mobility, a zero-emissions alliance was formed earlier in August 2015. It aimed to speed-up acceptance and adoption of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV) around the world – particularly battery-electric and fuel-cell vehicles.The international alliance consists of countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. From the US, several states have individually signed up for the cause. These include, California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. Canada’s Quebec is also involved.All of these listed countries and states have agreed to enforce a new law that would ban all petrol and diesel-powered vehicles by year 2050. According to , a full ban on these vehicles would reduce “more than 1 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions per year, lowering global vehicles emissions by 40%.”A sum of 35 years stand between now and the implementation of the ZEV alliance’s action plan, which leaves car makers a lot of time to prepare for the change.

As we reported earlier, Naza World has commissioned Brabus to make 15 of these machines in right-hand drive guise, and they’re all coming to Malaysia. Every single one. The price? Well as people say, if you need to ask… One of these will cost you 698,888 euro (RM3,247,685), and that’s before any local taxes. Equally jaw-dropping is its size, at almost six metres long, 2.1 metres wide and 2.2 metres tall. Powering the near-four-tonne monster is a Brabus-tuned 5.5 litre twin-turbo V8 engine, making 700 PS and 960 Nm of torque. All that is transferred to the three axles, at a 30:40:30 split, through five differentials.There are a lot more interesting details on this vehicle, all of which you can see in the video above.

However, Naza World had specifically commissioned Brabus to produce it, but it was told that the minimum order possible was for 15 units. Unfazed by the relatively large number for a rare vehicle, the order was placed anyway.What that means is that the only RHD 6×6 units in the world are all only available in Malaysia – to buy one, you’ll have to visit the Naza World showroom in PJ. Mercedes-Benz has also ended its 6×6’s production run, which also means that these RHD models are also the last of its kind anywhere in the world.Details are scarce at the moment, but speaking to a helpful sales rep from Naza World, we understand that prices for the Brabus G700 6×6 start from 698,888 euro (RM3,247,685) before the necessary taxes are factored in.First revealed at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, Brabus has effectively worked its magic on an . The mammoth vehicle gains a Brabus performance kit which it claims “unleashes the inherent power slumbering in the turbocharged V8 engine.”The 5.5 litre biturbo V8 engine that originally produced 544 hp now makes 700 PS at 5,300 rpm and 960 Nm between 2,000 and 4,500 rpm. Brabus has replaced the two turbo units with those featuring a larger compressor for higher boost pressure. Mercedes-Benz’s AMG Speedshift Plus 7G-Tronic automatic transmission is fitted as standard.The six-wheeled, 3,850 kg monster can perform the century sprint in 7.4 seconds, but has its top speed limited to 160 km/h. This is because of the extraordinary heavy-duty off-road tyres that are fitted to the car.Additionally, a high-performance metal catalyst with 75 mm downpipes is installed to lower back pressure from the exhaust. The stainless-steel sport system with a controlled butterfly valve is custom-developed for power and control of the exhaust note. The exhaust offers a subtle “Coming Home” mode and a loud “Sport” position. The engine management system has also been retuned, of course.The 6×6’s exterior and interior styling has also been tweaked to fit the Brabus portofolio. Chrome and carbon-fibre is heavily featured, while on the inside, passengers are treated to leather and Alcantara upholstery. The Brabus 6×6 also gets a hood scoop and darkened LED headlights and tail lights.What do you think of this six-wheeled monster? Enjoy our detailed gallery and walk-around video below!",Chris Aaron

When queried about the SPAD survey, Zailani replied: “if that’s what the public is demanding, the government should just wipe out the taxi industry including taxi companies and legal taxi drivers.”He also lambasted a top government official that went for a ride in an Uber vehicle, before endorsing the ride-sharing service. “This is a senior government official giving his approval to illegal taxi services and indirectly asking the public to break the law as Road Transport Department (JPJ) has stated that Uber service is illegal. Is it legal now to use Uber ride-sharing?” Zailani questioned.However, others view the existence of Uber and GrabCar in Malaysia as a positive. Finance Ministry secretary-general Tan Sri Dr Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah had stated, “the existence of an alternative taxi service should not be a problem for taxi operators because users will choose them if they provide better service at reasonable fares.”He said this during a #MyUberPitch programme held that took place last Friday. He added that Uber’s business would provide opportunities to Malaysians, especially low income earners, to supplement their income, which is in line with the government’s efforts to attain a high-income economy.The Uber, GrabCar saga has left many taxi drivers disgruntled, with some taking their .

2015-12-09,2016 Toyota Prius goes on sale in Japan – 40.8 km/l!,"The all-new  has officially gone on sale in its home market in Japan, nary three months after it was . The world’s largest carmaker expects to sell 12,000 units of the fourth generation of the iconic hybrid a month in the Land of the Rising Sun.First things first, the most important statistic on an eco-minded car like this – fuel economy. Toyota has confirmed that the Prius has surpassed the , with a final combined figure of 40.8 km per litre on the Japanese JC08 cycle. That’s up from the 32.6 km per litre achieved by its predecessor.That’s with the base-spec two-wheel drive E; other 2WD models get slightly less at 37.2 km per litre, while those equipped with the  return 34.2 km per litre. Regardless, all exceed Japan’s 2020 fuel economy standards by at least 20%, and are eligible for local subsidies and tax incentives for eco-friendly vehicles.Powering the new Prius is a reengineered 97 hp/142 Nm 1.8 litre Atkinson-cycle VVT-i petrol four-pot – now the most efficient internal combustion engine in the world, with maximum thermal efficiency figure of 40% – mated to a pair of 71 hp/163 Nm electric motors that are now smaller and lighter than before.The optional E-Four system utilises a high-output rear motor to provide all-wheel drive as needed, such as in slippery conditions. The compact, lightweight system is fitted at the rear of the car underneath the boot floor, without compromising luggage space.First to ride on the , the new Prius has a lower centre of gravity than before, and torsional rigidity is up to 60% stiffer. There’s also a new double wishbone rear suspension that replaces the old torsion beam setup for improved ride and handling, as well as a new active hydraulic booster for regenerative braking to improve brake feel.The outlandish love-it-or-hate-it styling hides a car that’s now longer, wider and lower than before. Despite the lower roofline and rear deck, Toyota claims both improved headroom and luggage space (the latter to a sizeable 506 litres), as well as better visibility. Comfort is improved through new, more supportive seats, along with lower NVH thanks to a stiffer bodyshell as well as reduced distance between welded joints.The interior gets a a wraparound dashboard design that extends into the door cards, as well as a more upright centre console now finished in gloss black. Also added is a wider instrument cluster with two 4.2 inch full-colour TFT LCD displays, a new full-colour head-up display as well as an S-flow air-con system that focuses airflow only at where the occupants are seated, to maximise comfort and fuel economy.As standard, the base 2,429,018 yen (RM84,500) E is rather basic, coming with 15-inch alloy wheels with aero covers, black fabric four-way manually-adjustable seats, a basic console box with twin cupholders and a urethane steering wheel.Stepping up to the 2,479,091 yen (RM86,300) S gains an option of a cool grey interior scheme with turquoise stitching, synthetic leather-wrapped steering wheel, a six-way manually-adjustable driver’s seat, a front console tray and a centre armrest.For 2,777,563 yen (RM96,700), the A variant throws in front fog lights, gloss white trim pieces, soft-touch upper door pads and the Toyota Safety Sense P suite with Pre-Collision System, Lane Departure Alert, Automatic High Beam and Radar Cruise Control, an Intelligent Clearance Sonar (ICS) that prevents collisions resulting from pedal misapplication, Simple Intelligent Parking Assist and a Blind Spot Monitor.At the top of the range sits the 3,107,455 yen (RM108,100) A Premium, adding genuine leather upholstery and steering wheel wrap, an eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and a synthetic leather centre armrest.

2015-12-09,SPYSHOTS: 2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe,"Following the  from earlier today, our spy photographers have managed to spot the car’s coupe sibling being tested on public streets. The car is still very much under wraps, but is undoubtedly an E-Class Coupe.With no official information available yet, we hope that, at the very least, the new E-Class coupe will not be a re-skinned  like the current model is. The new car is expected to ride on a modular MRA architecture platform similarly sized to the .It’s hard to tell from these images alone, but it does look like its wheelbase is longer than its predecessor’s, also featuring short overhangs at the front and rear. Should that truly be the case, increased cabin space over the previous model is almost certain.From the side, the car’s silhouette is very familiar – you could easily pin this down to being a larger  or C-Class coupe. The stretched frameless front windows noticeably push the B-pillars way back to where they would usually be.At the rear, it looks like the E-Class coupe will get a boot-lid spoiler of some sort. Worryingly, the tail lights at this stage appear very similar to that of the ’s, and therefore the  as well. We’re hoping that the E doesn’t plainly end up being a middle-ground version plonked between the S and C coupe models.On top of being larger than before, the interior of the car is expected to follow the , combining elements from the new S- and C-Class models. Likewise, engine options should mirror that of the new W213 – more details of this are expected to be announced at its debut on January 11 next year.While Mercedes-Benz has no direct competitor for the  at the moment, Mercedes-AMG is expected to put forth a full-blown AMG E63 Coupe in the future.

2015-12-09,2016 SsangYong Rexton gets new diesel engine and a Mercedes-sourced seven-speed automatic gearbox,"The  has received a number of updates including a new engine and Mercedes-Benz-sourced gearbox. The 2016 SsangYong Rexton is now available in the UK in four variants the SE, EX, EX automatic and the top-range ELX automatic. Engine-wise, the Rexton gains a new 2.2 litre turbodiesel that’s Euro 6 compliant, producing 178 PS and 400 Nm from 1,400 to 2,800 rpm. In addition to that, it emits 184 grams per kilometre of CO2, down from 196 grams per kilometre on the previous 2.0 litre mill. The updated SUV claims better fuel consumption figures of 7.1 litres per 100 km on a combined cycle.Transmission-wise the Rexton comes with the option of a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic transmission; the latter, essentially the venerable 7G-Tronic gearbox, is supplied by Mercedes-Benz. For off-road use, drivers can go into low-range that will split torque equally between the front and rear axles. Furthermore, the Rexton has an estimated three-tonne towing capacity.Apart from that, not much else has changed – the Rexton is still built on a steel ladder chassis and uses a body-on-frame construction. On the SE and EX models, a double wishbone suspension is in front and a five-link rigid axle with coil springs is on the back. The EX automatic and ELX gain a new multi-link rear suspension instead.The SUV comes in either a five- or seven-seat layout, while the top-range ELX features new items which include 18-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, LED daytime running lights, parking sensors for the front and rear. Inside, a beige and grey leather interior is featured along with a new multifunction steering wheel, heated rear seats, a navigation system and an auto dimming rearview mirror.In the UK, all variants are available with a five-year unlimited-mileage warranty. The SE is priced at £22,995 (RM147,270) and the EX at £25,495(RM163,280). As for the EX automatic, it goes for £26,995 (RM172,890), while the ELX automatic costs £28,995 (RM185,715).",Graham Chin

But as you can see, we’ve certainly saved the best for last. The question is, which RM1.2 million sports car should you go for – the , the  or the ? Find out as we compare the three similarly priced sports coupes right here in Malaysia. They could not be more different from each other. The i8 is the future of sports cars, with a tiny 1.5 litre three-cylinder engine with powerful electric motors giving extra go. All combined, it pushes 362 hp through all four wheels, and is claimed to get to 100 km/h in 4.4 seconds, all the way to 250 km/h. Meanwhile, Mercedes went for the engine downsizing route, equipping the AMG GT S with a 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8. It sends all of 510 hp to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, enough for the best 0-100 km/h time and top speed here: 3.8 seconds and 310 km/h. Jaguar, on the other hand, stayed with more traditional means. The F-Type R gets a good ol’ 5.0 litre supercharged V8 making 550 hp, spinning the rear tyres with an eight-speed automatic torque convertor. It does the century sprint in 4.2 seconds, and tops out at an even 300 km/h. So which is best? Watch the video above for Harve, Hafriz and Jon’s final verdict of 2015.

2015-12-09,China develops world’s first mind-controlled vehicle,"Ah, yes, guess it wasn’t long before someone decided to come up with this.  (CCTV) reports that researchers in Tianjin have successfully developed China’s first mind-controlled car. Yes, you read right. A team from Nankai University has come up with a working mule to showcase the breakthrough technology. Made in collaboration with automaker Great Wall Motor, a Haval H9 SUV mule is able to move forward, reverse and come to a complete stop, driven completely from the rear seat. The system is also able to lock and unlock the vehicle.It’s all done with the help of a computer, a signal capture device and a dedicated program. The signal capture device is head-mounted, and is made up of 16 sensors that capture electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the ‘driver’s’ brain. The processing of the EEG signals is done via a computer program, which selects the relevant signals and translates them, enabling control of the vehicle.
The researchers explain that the computer processes the signals to categorise and recognise a driver’s intention, translating these to issue commands to control the car. Apparently, the system is said to be safe from the effects of absent mindedness, as concentration is only needed to change the vehicle’s moving status, such as changing lanes or turning the vehicle, the news agency reports.The research team says that as a concept, such a car has remarkable potential for drivers with special needs, such as disabled drivers, but the system can also be used to provide normal drivers with a new and more intellectualised driving mode. At present, trials are only able to drive the test vehicle in a straight direction, and word is that there are no plans to earmark it for production. We’ll see about that.

2015-12-09,Ford Mustang – Australian prices go up due to forex,"Over in Australia, news has come about that pricing for the  has gone up by as much as AUD$2,500 (RM7,700) due to the foreign exchange rate,  reports. The  hasn’t officially made its debut yet, but it’s due to sometime in January – the first  arrived in the country last week.The increase involves both 2.3L EcoBoost and 5.0L GT versions that will be available in the country, six variants in all. The EcoBoost fastback (coupe) manual and automatic as well as the auto version of the convertible will now be AUD$1,000 (RM3,077) more than when pricing was first announced in March. The 2.3L EcoBoost Mustang now starts from AUD$45,990 (RM141,970) for the six-speed Getrag MT82-equipped manual right up to AUD$54,990 (RM169,270) for the ZF-based 6R80-equipped six-speed auto convertible variant. The same three variant configuration is available for the GT, and the price hike for the 5.0 litre Coyote V8-equipped models are AUD$2,500 across the board. Pricing now begins at AUD$57,490 (RM177,000) for the fastback manual to AUD$66,490 (RM204,700) for the convertible.The report adds that buyers who have booked the now sold-out 2015 and 2016 build runs will be exempt from the price increase, with the hike affecting only new orders. New buyers will have a fair bit to wait before they can get their hands on a pony car – back in September, it was reported that  with Ford Australia, and in October the number of bookings had , making for a 10-month wait into September next year.Now, the latest news is that the order bank for the car is sitting at the 4,000 vehicle mark, with more than 80% of buyers having paid deposits. Based on this, the car is effectively sold through well into 2017. Like in the US, overwhelming early interest has been in the V8 GT models, with 86% of customers favouring it over the EcoBoost, and 88% have opted to go the fastback route.The news of the price increase won’t be what potential Malaysian buyers will want to hear – originally, the pricing for the 2.3L EcoBoost variant was expected to be in the sub-RM300k range, which was then revised to the RM350-400k mark when the car made its . Then, in June, when bookings for the S550 opened here, .With the ringgit’s rate against the US dollar having sagged even more since then, it remains to be seen if pricing will again be adjusted when the car eventually makes its debut here early next year. Yes, if you do the math, you can buy both a 2.3L EcoBoost and 5.0L GT Down Under for the price of a 2.3L EcoBoost here and still have change left over, but such is the way it rolls.As for the 5.0L V8, the last indicative price had it placed between the RM550,000 and RM565,000 mark, but that should change should the pricing for the 2.3L be adjusted. Our cars will likely follow the Oz-spec very closely – read what the specs are . Read our , which covers both 2.3L EcoBoost and 5.0L V8 variants.",Anthony Lim
2015-12-09,Automakers urging Thailand to join TPP – report,"The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) currently consists of 12 member countries that signed the agreement back in early October. A 13th member could soon join the pact as automakers are urging Thailand to be a part of the , to ensure the country’s automotive market continues to prosper in the long run.In a report by , it was revealed that Thailand boasts the strongest automotive industry in ASEAN, producing 49% of the 3.9 million vehicles that came out of the region each year. It also ranks second (26%) to Indonesia (35%) when it comes to ASEAN car sales, which amounted to 3.2 million units a year.Speaking at the recent 32nd Thailand International Motor Expo, CEO of Honda Automobile (Thailand) Pitak Pruittisarikorn said any free trade agreements, bilateral or regional, would be advantageous to Thailand’s automotive industry – which exports 70% of its overall production.“At present, Thailand has yet to lose much competitiveness against four ASEAN countries (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam) that joined the TPP. The pact will deliver a huge impact to Thailand once they develop their own automotive industries to support TPP members or Indonesia decides to join the trade pact,” Pitak said.Thailand’s automotive industry has a total production capacity of 2.9 million vehicles a year, of which only 70% is being utilised. Pitak identifies this as a weakness of the industry, and reckons that an increase in export destinations through the TPP will help it achieve full production capacity.However, he mentioned, “we don’t expect any projects under the second phase of the eco-car scheme to churn out in the foreseeable future, as the current production is bountiful.” Thailand’s vehicle output is estimated to hit , ranking it 12th among the world’s car-making countries, unchanged from the year before. Thailand’s automotive industry also stands to benefit when the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) officially comes into effect at the end of the year, of which it is a member along with Malaysia. Its exports involving completely built-up vehicles (CBUs), completely knocked-down kits (CKDs) and auto parts throughout the region are expected to increase with the absence of tariffs.This is according to Ong-arj Pongkijworasin, chairman of the automotive industry club under the Federation of Thai Industries Exports, who also added that the implementation of the AEC is unlikely to boost competitiveness in the regional automotive market, so long as Asean members are contending with one another.",Gerard Lye
2015-12-09,Nissan Elgrand VIP by Autech – 4-seater luxury MPV,"This is the Nissan Elgrand VIP, customised by Nissan’s conversion and tuning division Autech. Parked in a lonely corner at the  event, it looks like a  from the outside, save for discreet “VIP” emblems on the C pillars and tailgate, plus comfort-oriented Bridgestone Regno tyres. But it’s inside where Autech’s work shows. This is the ultimate Elgrand, and it’s even more luxurious than the  that was brought in by a grey importer last month. That’s because instead of the regular 2-2-3 seat formation, there are just two seats behind the front two in this big box. This is the four-seater version of the Elgrand VIP (a three-row version is available), and as you can see, the two very important people at the back have abundant legroom. It’s business class on the road, and the powered individual leather seats have ottomans, foldaway tables and LED reading spotlights. Also available are cupholders, power outlets and sunshades. The floor is thickly carpeted.There’s a console that separates the cockpit and passenger cabin, and this divider contains bins and a magazine pocket. Curiously, there’s an analogue clock above the latter – being so small, it can’t possibly be very useful. Just an ornament, perhaps. Both front and rear sections have its own sunroof. A full length panoramic roof would be nice when the weather permits, and bigger bosses might feel a bit constricted by the fixed separator. A chiller would be welcome, too. Other than that, what a way to travel. Fitted as such, the Elgrand VIP is an eight million yen (RM277,910) MPV, approximately three million yen more than the base car, an Autech staff tells me. Unlikely to appear here via the grey route as most approved permits will be used on Alphards and Vellfires, but VIPs can special order like they always do.",Danny Tan

Now, Stuttgart has revealed the interior in full, and it looks absolutely extravagant. showed a cabin that was rather reminiscent of the , and they were absolutely on point. It looks very nearly as plush as its larger cousin, with a dual-tier dashboard, two large screens on higher-end models and wraparound wood/metallic trim with four circular centre air vents. Other bits such as the outer air vents and the centre console are more closely related to the .At first glance, it really looks a cut above anything BMW and Audi can muster at the moment, and even though the current  and  are getting on a bit now, it’s hard to see even the next generation of these models topping this.Let’s start with the combined instrument and infotainment screen binnacle, since, like in the S-Class, it dominates the interior. Standard models come with twin analogue gauges with a seven-inch colour display in between, along with an 8.4-inch centre display.For the full S-Class-lite experience, opt for the COMAND Online system – you’d be greeted instead by a pair of widescreen 12.3 inch displays, each with a resolution of 1920×720 pixels. Unlike on the S-Class, the whole thing is enclosed by a single piece of glass for a more uniform flat panel look.The digital instruments can be configured in three modes – the regular Classic, Sport with distinctive yellow fonts, and Progressive with a large central rev counter, a speed readout in the middle and information screens on either side.The centre display on models equipped with COMAND Online also features new graphics compared with those on other current models in the Mercedes stable. Informative animations and graphics make up two-thirds of the screen at all times (except in navigation mode), with a supplementary panel on the other third. The use of animated displays is said to provide a more intuitive user experience.The range of three-spoke steering wheels are broadly identical to those on the C-Class, save for one key difference – touch pads on the left and right spokes, augmenting the usual multifunction controls. This enables the driver to swipe up and down and left and right to control every function of the infotainment system without the hands ever leaving the wheel.Of course, you can also utilise the usual touchpad and COMAND knob on the transmission tunnel instead, like on the C- and S-Class. There’s also the Linguatronic voice control system which can turn certain driver assist functions on and off for the first time.The materials have also been given a step up here. Customers will be able to choose from a range of new trim finishes – including open-pore woods, a yacht-style glossy wood finish with inlaid floating lines, and a fabric-like metal finish – while leather covers the door cards and beltline on certain models. Various shades of brown have also been added to the interior colour palette for a more personalised design.Additionally, there’s also an ambient lighting system – much like the S-Class, except the range of colours has grown from seven to a staggering 64 hues! Among other things illuminated by the system, the large pair of screens are backlit, which Mercedes says makes the whole binnacle look like it’s floating in space.The seats get a more torso-like form for a more ergonomic, sculpted look. Avantgarde models get sportier contours, while AMG line models receive extended side bolsters and a wider shoulder section for even better lateral support. Punting for the Exclusive line gets you longitudinal seat stripes; the designo seats are quilted like on the S-Class, and feature the lateral support of the sports seats.As standard, the E-Class gets a Frontbass sound system that utilises space in the cross-member and side member of the body structure as a resonance chamber for the bass speakers. Buyers can also opt for the second-generation Burmester 3D surround sound system that uses four roof-mounted speakers for a true three-dimensional experience.In total, the high-end system features 23 speakers with diaphragms of glass-fibre fabric for high level stability, low weight and higher power. These include two woofers in the front doors and seven mid-range speakers and aluminium ring radiator tweeters; the latter revolve out into the optimal position when turned on. They’re driven individually via separate channels and active crossovers by two amplifiers with a total output of 1,450 W; the 25-litre bass box has its own separate 400 W amplifier in the boot.As mentioned earlier, Mercedes-Benz has  that will make its way into the next-generation E-Class, including an  of the  that debuted on the ; diode count has been raised from 24 to 84. Smartphone integration has also been expanded – it can now serve as a key, as well as guide the car in and out of parallel and perpendicular parking spaces via the Remote Parking Pilot function.Safety technologies like Active Brake Assist also get a bump up, capable of scanning other lanes for cars and initiating braking earlier if it senses an evasive manoeuvre is impossible. Other features include the new Evasive Steering Assist, Distance Pilot Distronic with Speed Limit Pilot and Active Lane Keeping Assist, as well as an uprated Pre-Safe system – the latter now protects your ears in a crash, and pushes you closer to the centre of the car to provide more survival space in the event of a side impact.",Jonathan Lee
2015-12-08,Malaysia EEV incentives better than Thailand’s – F&S,"Thailand, the regional auto production champ majoring in pick-up trucks and eco cars, is  as well. However, support from the Thai government via incentives is not as strong as that given by Malaysia, says US-based consultancy Frost & Sullivan (F&S).All three major car producing countries in ASEAN – Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia – have initiatives for eco-friendly vehicles, but ours is considered the most advanced for energy-efficient vehicles (EEVs), F&S VP for Asia-Pacific Vivek Vaidya told a seminar hosted by the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand recently. One good thing about the Malaysian package is that manufacturers can localise EEV production into a variety of car segments including hybrid and electric with small production volumes, the  report stated. “Honda has started to localise assembly of its hybrid vehicles under Malaysia’s EEV incentives, while Mazda’s factory there exports the vehicles. That country has stimulated hybrid and electric demand to account for 5% of the 666,465 vehicles sold there last year,” Vaidya said. EEVs accounted for less than 1% of the 881,832 vehicles sold in Thailand last year. The consultancy’s rep added that while Thailand remained an  and one with the , the country’s  is focused on production volume and uses the traditional internal combustion engine platform. The Detroit of the East is used to big numbers, but Vaidya suggests that the Thai government push for hybrid and electric production by providing investment incentives, and not focus on production volume in the initial stage. Waiving import duties on CBU imported units and subsidising prices would be effective in the short term, he said. Don’t be too rigid, in other words.Now, it’s easy to confuse the “EEV” term as one used to solely describe hybrids and EVs, but  “vehicles that meet a defined specifications in terms of carbon emission level (g/km) and fuel consumption (l/100 km) – EEV includes fuel efficient vehicles, hybrids, EVs and alternatively-fuelled vehicles, e.g. CNG, LPG, Biodiesel, Ethanol, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell.”That includes non-hybrid, regular ICE-powered cars that are fuel efficient. Such cars that have attained EEV status in Malaysia include the , , ,  and the , models that vary greatly in size and type. Incentives are customised, not explicitly spelled out. Separately, companies that locally assemble hybrid models get special incentives. Notable examples of CKD hybrids are the ,  and the . The just-launched, plug-in hybrid  will also be assembled locally.",Danny Tan
2015-12-08,Proton considering to increase prices in January 2016 to compensate for the effect of the lower ringgit,"Proton has announced that it is re-evaluating its pricing structure for 2016. The local carmaker says that due to the weakening ringgit, it is considering to increase the prices of its cars starting from January 2016. “We do feel the impact of the fallen ringgit as many raw materials are purchased in foreign currency. The weaker ringgit affects the company’s operation cost and the entire eco-system chain from the vendors to us. Hence, we are evaluating our price structure and the percentage of the price increase will depend on the models,” explained Datuk Abdul Harith Abdullah, CEO of Proton.Proton further added that the price increase is “seen as an industry situation,” with prices having to be raised to compensate for the effects of the lower ringgit.

2015-12-08,"Mazda CX-3 – 2,000 CBU units to be sold out soon, Malaysian CKD assembly under “consideration”","Following the official launch debut of the Mazda CX-3, Bermaz expects all 2,000 CBU Japan models of the crossover to be sold out within two months of its launch. The Malaysian-spec Mazda CX-3 originates from Mazda’s main plant in Hiroshima. The CX-3 is also produced in Thailand at the AutoAlliance Plant in Rayong. However, Bermaz CEO Datuk Seri Ben Yeoh said during a press conference that it has no plans to bring in any units from Thailand due to the model being unable to meet the 40% local content requirement for tariff exemption under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA).On the other hand, Malaysia’s free-trade agreement with Japan entitles Bermaz to more incentives to import the CX-3 from Japan, hence why the Malaysian-spec model originates from there. Hiroshi Inoue, executive officer at Mazda Motor Corporation also added that the Hiroshima plant itself is at near-full capacity. Currently, Bermaz is pursuing to locally assemble (CKD) the CX-3 here in Malaysia at its Kulim plant, which currently produces the Mazda 3 and CX-5 as well.  Should its CKD plans come into fruition, it is very likely that the CX-3’s price may be reduced from its introductory RM131,218 figure.It is yet unknown if a locally-assembled Mazda CX-3 (if it does happen) will retain the same specifications as the CBU model. For instance, when the Mazda 3 was reintroduced as a CKD model, it came without a sunroof or the trademark Soul Red Metallic colour option.Nonetheless, does the prospect of a locally-assembled Mazda CX-3 entice you to place an order? What price would be fitting for you? The crossover’s nearest rival, the Honda HR-V, is already a CKD model here in Malaysia, produced in Melaka.",Gerard Lye

Previewed by the  earlier, the E-Mehari is jointly developed by the Bollore Group and the French automaker.The E-Mehari measures in at 3,810 mm in length, 1,870 mm in width and 1,650 mm in height. It has a total boot capacity of 200 litres, and with the folding rear bench down, space is expanded to 800 litres in total.Exterior of the two-door cabriolet consists of signature dual headlights, a smiling fascia and a ribbed door pattern from the original Méhari. Apart from that, the E-Mehari features black wing extenders, lower valance and a black front bumper. It also comes with a removable top, closed at the side by a foldaway system with large windows. It can be used to cover the front, the sides, rear or the whole vehicle.It sits on a raised chassis, that allows for all-terrain driving. The bodywork is made from corrosion-free thermoformed plastics, which has the elasticity to hold out against minor impacts. It comes with a choice of four different colours that includes blue, orange, yellow and beige. On top of that, the roof can be specified in either black or orange-red.Inside, it’s a four-seater, while two interior trim colours can be opted for. This includes beige and orange-red, which comes with a water sports-inspired central pattern. Materials are made from plastic-coated fabric that makes the interior waterproof. On that note, Citroen says that the interior can be hosed down as well.Powering it, is an electric motor that makes 68 hp, which allows the vehicle a top speed of 110 km/h. Juice is provided by lithium metal polymer “dry” batteries developed by the Bollore group. In total, the E-Mehari has a travel range of 200 km. Recharging the batteries requires a total of eight hours on a 16A socket and 13 hours on a European 10A domestic socket.Produced at the PSA Peugeot Citroen plant in France, the EV is expected to be launched in the country sometime at the start of the second quarter next year and other European markets by end 2016.",Graham Chin
2015-12-08,KTM Komuter fare hike necessary to reduce losses,"Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) has come out to defend the  for its  service, saying that the move would not increase profits but rather lessen the losses that the service is incurring,  reports. On November 2, KTM had , a move it said was necessary to prevent further losses being incurred by the company – KTM said fares are supposed to cost at least 20 sen per km, and its operating couldn’t cover its operating cost.Its president Lt Col (Rtd) Sarbini Tijan said the rail operator was expected to make losses of RM55 million this year despite the fare increase, the first such revision for the KTM Komuter service since February 2003.He said that the firm had requested RM200 million this year to cover the funding gap for all its operations, and the government had only allocated RM60 million. As such, the fare hike is anticipated to reduce the funding gap for its Komuter service component from RM150 million to around RM106 million.He added that the increase in ticket prices was offset by a vastly improved service, which has seen Komuter trains become more reliable in terms of scheduling, with a 97% on-time service compared to before – the company showed through a fact sheet that only 17% of its Komuter trains were on time in 2011, but this was now 97% as of October this year.Sarbini disagreed with the notion that the hike in Komuter ticket prices will lead to more commuters switching to other forms of private transport. He said that the increase will be offset by multiple discounts given to regular users of the Komuter service as well as those with Touch ‘n Go cards.",Anthony Lim
2015-12-08,"Mazda CX-3 2.0 launched in Malaysia – RM131,218","The  has finally made its official launch debut here in Malaysia, a year after the crossover .  Available in just a sole variant, the fully-imported (CBU Japan) crossover is priced from  (on-the-road without insurance).On offer here is the SkyActiv-G 2.0L that can be had with a choice of five colours – Soul Red Metallic, Crystal White Pearl, Jet Black, Meteor Grey and Deep Crystal Blue. Each purchase will also include a three-year warranty and free service from Bermaz as well.If the variant name isn’t a dead giveaway already, under the hood of the CX-3 you’ll find a 2.0 litre SkyActiv-G petrol engine that outputs 154 hp at 6,000 rpm and 204 Nm of torque at 2,800 rpm. By comparison, the  and ‘s 2.0 litre mill outputs 162 hp/210 Nm and 154 hp/198 Nm, respectively.The SkyActiv-G engine is mated to a SkyActiv-Drive six-speed automatic gearbox, directing drive exclusively to the front wheels (2WD). The engine also benefits from Mazda’s i-Stop engine idling stop system, which automatically shuts down the engine when the vehicle is stationary in order to save fuel.Proudly wearing Mazda’s signature Kodo styling, the CX-3 is quite the looker, measuring 4,275 mm in length, 1,765 mm wide and 1,535 mm tall. The B-segment crossover rides on the same SkyActiv-Chassis that underpins the smaller , and has a kerb weight of 1,211 kg.On the exterior, the CX-3’s standard equipment list includes automatic LED headlights with adaptive front lighting system, auto-levelling and LED daytime running lights. The rear tail lights are LED as well, as are the front fog lamps (rear fogs make do with halogen bulbs instead).The CX-3 also gets a bump in aesthetics thanks to gunmetal trim pieces located at the front, sides and rear of the crossover – something not found on lower variants of the Thai-spec model. Wheel options are limited to just a sole 18-inch five twin-spoke option, wrapped in 215/50R18 tyres. Other standard equipment include automatic wipers, power-folding side mirrors (with turn indicators) and a sunroof.Moving inside, the cabin layout is nigh identical to the Mazda 2, save for a few differences in trim colour pieces. Here, the brand’s MZD Connect 7.0-inch touchscreen multimedia system dominates the dashboard. The system can either be controlled via touch or the Commander Control dial.Like the Mazda 2, the system can be upgraded with navigation functionality for an extra RM1,270. Other highlights in the cabin include the leather-suede combo seats (60:40 split folding at the rear) and single-zone automatic air-conditioning (front vents only). Boot space is rated at 350 litres.As for the driver, there is Mazda’s Active Driving Display (heads-up display) and a multi-function (multimedia and cruise control) leather steering wheel (electric power assisted) that comes with paddle shifters. There is also a drive selection switch (Sport mode), reverse camera and keyless operation (entry and engine start).The safety suite on the CX-3 is pretty comprehensive as well, with DSC electronic stability control, traction control and ABS with EBD and BA all being present. The crossover is fitted with six airbags as well (dual frontal, side and curtain). Hill launch assist and emergency stop signal are also part of the package, but there’s no i-ActivSense suite (Smart City Brake System, Rear View Monitoring, Lane Departure Warning etc.) here. For RM1,900 extra, Mazda’s Skytint (safety tint) can be specified as well.As we were previously told, the initial batch of CBU models total up to just 2,000. After this first run of cars, considerations are being made to locally-produce (CKD) the model. This could see a reduction in price for the CX-3, although whether the spec sheet will remain the same is yet to be known. In the event that Bermaz continues importing CBU models, it will not be from . The Mazda CX-3 comes into the Malaysian crossover market to directly rival the .

2015-12-08,VIDEO: Kia Sportage promoted in a weird GTA-style ad,"In a bid to promote the fourth-generation , the brand has just released a very unique clip that carries with it a  theme. It even features the same “GTA” initials, however in this case, it stands for “Generation Today’s Action.” Yes, it reads exactly that.While the rest of the video game-styled ad might be interesting to watch, it appears that it’s actually attempting to showcase the efficiency of the 1.7 litre U CRDi diesel mill with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and the power of the 2.0 litre R CRDi turbodiesel engine. The former claims to manage 15 km/l, according to the video. Let’s ignore the weird fight scene and go to the next part of the ad that pulls in the 2.0 litre diesel Sportage. Although no consumption figures are stated, the 2.0 litre diesel shown here is the one with the higher 186 PS and 400 Nm output and is paired with a six-speed auto transmission. Alternatively, the other state of tune produces a lower 134 hp and 373 Nm of torque.In relation to the 2.0 litre variant, a two- and four-wheel drive layout is also mentioned here. Furthermore, it goes on to promote the motor driven power steering system (MDPS) and the vehicle stability management (VSM) in the new SUV.As a refresher, aside from its new bold design, the new Kia Sportage is now larger in size. It comes with a new turbocharged 1.6 litre T-GDi engine paired exclusively to the seven-speed dual clutch transmission. The new engine produces a total of 174 hp and 265 Nm of torque. It features quite a bit of kit on the inside too, including an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment unit. A slew of safety features such as Blind Spot Detection System (BSD) with Lane Change Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA), Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Pedestrian Detection System and Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) can also be found in the new Sportage.",Graham Chin

2015-12-08,Selangor to use more durable asphalt for state roads,"Road conditions in Selangor are set to improve a little – the state is set to begin using a new asphalt premix for its roads, one that it says will result not just in better and more durable road surfaces but also in cost savings for local authorities,  reports.The new premix, called Cold Mix Carboncor, was trialled in a three-month long pilot project, and positive results from the evaluation has seen the compound been given the green light for use on state roads.According to the report, the trial was conducted along stretches of Jalan Sungai Jati in Klang, with the new asphalt laid on 100 metre stretches alongside the current AC14 polymer-modified asphalt in use now. Both non-destructive and destructive testing were conducted.Findings revealed that the Carboncor was durable and perfect for Malaysian weather, state infrastructure and public facilities committee chairman Zaidy Abdul Talib said. Compared to AC14, which isn’t very resistant to the effects of rain, the new asphalt can be used during the rainy season, because it needs water to be laid.Zaidy added that testing also revealed that only a 25 mm layer depth of the Carboncor was needed for resurfacing works compared to twice the amount for AC14, which also needed a good foundation. This translates to less raw material being needed, cost savings. “The Cold Mix is estimated to save up to 25% for resurfacing existing premix roads, 32% for new medium-to-high traffic urban roads and 40% for medium-to-high traffic rural roads,” he said, adding that its use would not involve the need for new machinery.The state will however use the cold asphalt to patch up existing roads for now, according to Zaidy. “From these tests, we concluded that there was not enough friction created by the new premix, but it could be enhanced to be used as a surfacing premix in the future,” he explained.Zaidy said the new asphalt would be recommended to all 12 local authorities in Selangor as well as the Public Works Department. The councils, he added, can utilise the Malaysian Road Record Information System (Marris) funds allocated to them by the state government to purchase the cold asphalt.",Anthony Lim

2015-12-08,GALLERY: Volvo Museum – 88 years of Swedish pride,"Officially founded in 1927, on the same day its first-ever production vehicle was rolled out of its factory in Gothenburg, Sweden, Volvo Car has its history books filled like no other. During our  of the  in Sweden, we managed to squeeze in a quick stop at its museum to check it out for ourselves.Arriving there in the , the Volvo Museum is located roughly 10 kilometres away from Gothenburg’s city centre. For a fee of 100 SEK (RM50) apiece, we were let into a world of iconic models, ground-breaking innovations and utter Swedish pride.The display of Volvo’s heritage is filled with passenger vehicles, busses, heavy trucks and more from the brand’s 88-year-long history. It’s often the case that we sum up the time passed by drumming up the invention of the three-point seat belt and how its patents were given away for nothing. Unfortunately, far too many great Volvo establishments between its founding go easily unnoticed. Volvo is a proud company, but not one that loudly proclaims its achievements to the world.Hopefully, this post brings life to some of those forgotten developments in the brand’s rich history as we highlight a few of the its more significant hallmarks. Just short of being there for yourself, you can get the full tour in our gallery below.One of the first things that grabbed our attention as we entered the museum was the Volvo Experimental Safety Car (pictured above, left), despite it being displayed near the exit of the venue. Developed as a “rolling safety laboratory” in 1972, the VESC was a key milestone in Volvo’s history, being one of the most advanced road-worthy vehicles of its time.The elongated body is a signature look, and you may recognise the long bumpers of the car from later Volvo production models such as the 240 and 260 series. The bumpers actually feature a telescopic function that would retract under impact to absorb energy. The car also featured lots of high-tech equipment such as a rear-view camera, anti-lock brakes, airbags and more.Also positioned near the exit but managing to catch our early attention was the Volvo Electric Prototype from 1976 (pictured above, right). While the  reserves the honour of being one of the first production electric vehicles Volvo ever produced, it was actually the Volvo Electric Prototype that holds the honour of being one of the earliest electric vehicles Volvo ever made.The humble VEP was conceived in the 1970s — a time when Volvo experimented heavily with new and radical ideas. The four-seater VEP was designed as a delivery vehicle and was actually used on Gothenburg’s city streets. It had lead batteries, thyristor-controlled electric motors integrated in the rear axle and boasted a top speed of 70 km/h.Moving along, we discovered the Volvo ÖV 4 (above, left) – the first-ever production-ready passenger Volvo car, introduced at the company’s founding in 1927. On that proud morning Volvo’s engineers had prepared to show the vehicle to the world, the car was rolled out past the factory’s gates and its engine was started.Unwittingly, the ÖV 4 was only capable of driving backwards! It turned out that an engineer had wrongly installed a differential gear in the rear axle. Luckily, the car was fixed in just 10 minutes and the brand’s first-ever model was toured in the right direction.Given that the ÖV 4 was a convertible, Volvo later introduced a closed-roof version of the car, calling it the PV 4. Both models were fitted with a 2.0 litre four-cylinder engine that delivered 28 hp. The car itself was capable of a top speed of 88 km/h.Several other body styles were later introduced, including an LV 4 bus that was based on the ÖV 4’s chassis. Coach builders were also known to use the chassis for their own creations, one famously being the  that was delivered to a customer in 1933. That version of the car featured a 75 hp six-cylinder engine from a bus – the engine was an optional item that cost 2000 SEK (RM1,000) back in the day.The Volvo P1900 (above, bottom right) revealed in 1954 was the company’s first attempt at a proper sports car. The two-seater roadster featured a 1.4 litre four-cylinder engine with 70 hp at 5,000 rpm, mated to a three-speed manual transmission. It had a recorded top speed of 175 km/h. Sadly, only 67 units were ever made.A more refined product of the brand’s inaugural sports model was later revealed in the form of the P1800. Volvo claims that thanks to a certain TV show called “,” sales of the P1800 skyrocketed, forcing a production run totalling 39,385 units. The car featured a 100 hp 1.8 litre four-cylinder engine and a four-speed manual transmission with an optional overdrive function.Later, a sportier estate version called the 1800 ES was revealed in 1971, offering a stylish look that has inspired today’s  and  models. The updated car also introduced a new 2.0 litre four-cylinder engine with fuel injection that churned out 135 hp. Sadly, the 1800 ES was only produced in very limited numbers between 1971 and 1973.In 1977, Volvo had sought the help of Italian coach-builder, , to design a sporty two-door coupe based on the Volvo 260 series sedan. With sales limited to the US, the cool-looking 262C (above, left) began life with a 125 hp 2.7 litre engine, but later traded up to a 2.8 litre mill that made 155 hp. The coupe was also only available with a three-speed automatic – one of the brand’s early attempts of using a torque-converter auto.Several years later, another Volvo breakthrough was made, with the brand revealing its first-ever front-wheel drive vehicle at the 1986 Geneva Motor Show. The compact Volvo 480 (above, right) first offered buyers a choice between a 95 hp 1.7 litre engine or a 110 hp 2.0 litre one.Later, turbocharging increased the 1.7 litre mill’s output to 120 hp. The car offered the option of either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed torque converter automatic. The 480 was also known for its four-wheel disc brake system.The Volvo Museum is also where the brand’s iconic concepts are stored. Missing out on the newer  and , here is the Volvo Adventurous Concept Car (above, left) from year 2000. Can you guess which production model it previewed? That’s right, it’s the first-gen XC90 SUV.Volvo’s first signal of intent to produce an SUV was revealed at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show. The concept promised first-class protection for all occupants, a powerful and efficient engine with low emissions and lots of interior space. Little did we know then that the production version of the  would serve a staggering total of 13 years in the market before being replaced.Its second SUV also proved to be a hit, and was previewed by the XC60 Concept that was shown in 2007. More importantly, the concept also previewed the next generation of Volvo’s design language – one that you will still find on existing S60, V60 and V40 models. Omitting the glass roof visible here and a few other items, the  is still in service to date, nearing an eight-year production span.If ever you were fortunate enough to land yourself in Gothenburg, a visit to the Volvo Museum is an absolute must – it doesn’t matter if you are a Volvo fan or not. The brand’s rich heritage and culture is captivating and insightful, providing a small glimpse of its humble yet technologically-advanced history.Given that Volvo Car is on the verge of reinventing itself, a look back at its development through the ages was a timely affair for this writer. Especially so, knowing that its latest XC90 that we rode in to the museum would become Volvo’s longest serving existing model in a matter of just four years from now.We hope you enjoy the gallery below and that it does some justice to being a hint of what the full experience would be like.

2015-12-08,"Inferno hypercar from Mexico packs 1,400 hp, 670 Nm","Many startups are jumping on the supercar/hypercar bandwagon. Inferno, as this one is called is the latest by a company from Mexico and will be produced in Italy. Of course the first thing that’s noticeable is that bizarre look! A glance at the company’s website hints that the Inferno is filled with “luxury and detail.”It further states that the hypercar is “formed by entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers as well as national and international brands (from) Mexico, Italy, United States.” Antonio Ferraioli, automotive engineer who has collaborated with Lamborghini and currently employed at Lotus, is also participating in this hypercar project.Interestingly, the company says that it employs a “metal foam” which comprises of zinc, aluminium and silver. It’s claimed to be be able to decrease and absorb impact in a car crash; furthermore, the company says the material’s strength is “compared with that of a commercial armoured vehicle, but with a big weight difference.”In addition to that, the metal can be stretched to “100 times of its original length without affecting its properties.” The company asserts that the material is ideal for a hypercar, claiming that because it’s lighter, it helps improve performance (the text actually said “increase hp,” which must be a case of being lost in translation), reduce fuel consumption, provide better driving response and improve security of the driver.Beneath it is an unknown twin-turbo V8 engine, which will give the Inferno a total of 1,400 hp and 670 Nm of torque. The hypercar will have a top-speed of 395 km/h and from 0-100 km/h, the Inferno is claimed to achieve this in less than three seconds. Other specifications notes that it has an aerodynamic efficiency ratio of 1.4 and lateral acceleration of over 1.33 .So guys, what do you think of the Inferno’s wild looks, is it a little too “hot” to handle?",Graham Chin

According to the brand, the meeting is a treat for fans and one that coincides with the Golf GTI’s 40th birthday next year.The Golf GTI Pirelli came with a 1.8 litre engine that made 112 PS and was based on the original  (just before its production ended). It represented the brand’s first-ever anniversary model. As for the new Clubsport, Volkswagen says that its the Golf GTI Pirelli’s modern counterpart.To recap, the Golf GTI Clubsport is based on the Mk7 Golf GTI. With its 2.0 litre TSI engine, it produces a power output of 265 PS and 350 Nm of torque. A temporary boost function is available in the Clubsport, which upon activation, calls up 290 PS and 380 Nm of torque. Said power comes in by just kicking down on the throttle and is delivered for up to 10 seconds. Squeezing out that extra power will propel the Golf GTI Clubsport from zero to 100 km/h in just 5.9 seconds. A launch control feature can be had with the dual-clutch gearbox (DSG).Other items that can be found on the Clubsport include a two-tone colour scheme on the outside, a unique front bumper, a rear spoiler and a diffuser> A set of semi-slick tyres approved for road-use comes as an option. Inside, standard sports bucket seats or classic GTI sports seats can be specified. With that said, the Golf GTI Clubsport and the Golf GTI Pirelli are not the only special series to have ever been produced, the company states.

However, these new photos sent in by reader Farizul Jaafar do show the new flagship D-segment sedan in a slightly different perspective.This is the first time we’re seeing the new Perdana flat from the side, giving us a better view to properly take in the new proportions. From here, it’s clear that most of the 150 mm length increase over the donor  (4,999 mm vs 4,849 mm) has come from the rear of the car, with the glasshouse stretched at the rear to suit. The result is a more elegant-looking profile, even if it does look rather rear-heavy.Other things to note on this particular mule are the poor-fitting Accord head- and tail lights standing in for the , along with a rear bumper that looks closer to the Accord’s than the sportier item with twin integrated exhaust exits that will actually go on. The character line along the side also looks to be lower here than on the Honda, although that could really just be an illusion created by cladding.It’s confirmed that the 2016 Perdana will be built at Proton’s Medium Volume Factory in Shah Alam, alongside the  (the  is assembled at Honda Malaysia’s plant in Melaka).Engine wise, it’s set to retain Honda’s 154 hp/189 Nm R20A3 2.0 and 177 hp/222 Nm K24Z2 2.4 litre i-VTEC engines – for now, at least.

Parent company of RBR’s title sponsor Nissan will also stop providing light commercial vans to the F1 team.It has been  as Red Bull won four consecutive Formula One constructor and driver world championship titles between 2010 and 2013. Infiniti and Red Bull started their commercial partnership in 2011 before Infiniti became the title sponsor of the team in 2013. It is said that the deal was worth $70 million per year.“We would like to say a big thank you to Infiniti for their contribution to the team since they joined us as a commercial partner in 2011. They became the title sponsor of the team in 2013 when Infiniti enjoyed greater visibility than any other manufacturer in the sport. We wish them all the best with their plans for the future,” said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner.This news follows Red Bull announcing an engine-branding tie up with new sponsor TAG Heuer, the Swiss watchmaker moving over from its long-time partner McLaren. We’re presuming that it also means the end of RBR’s association with Casio. Having failed to secure an engine deal with Ferrari, Mercedes or Honda, RBR will continue to use Renault engines next season, but there will be no branding for the latter – RBR’s challenger will be called Red Bull Racing-Tag Heuer RB12.

To accompany the announcement, Hyundai has also dropped this sole teaser image of the Ioniq, which is said to be a rival to the Toyota Prius.With just a view of the car’s silhouette, the Ioniq certainly appears to be a mellowed down version of the  that surfaced at the Geneva Motor Show three years ago. LED positioning lights at the front and LED taillights can be seen in the teaser image as well. The Ioniq has already been caught testing recently, where spyshots revealed the interior of the eco-car. Unsurprisingly, the interior isn’t too futuristic in its outlook. Instead, the Ioniq adopts a more conventional design that is similar to its sibling, the Sonata. Hyundai claim that the Ioniq will be the first car in the world to offer an electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid powertrain in a single body type. It also claims that the Ioniq “combines class-leading fuel efficiency with a fun, responsive drive and attractive design, a unique mix not yet achieved by a hybrid vehicle.”Coupled with a fully-electric (EV) powertrain, the Ioniq is powered by a high capacity, ultra-efficient lithium-ion battery. The plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version combines a “fuel-efficient energy” with battery power that is obtained by charging the car with electricity. Finally, the hybrid (HEV) utilises the petrol engine and motion of the car to charge the on-board battery.To cater towards the multi-powertrain options, the Ioniq rides on a new platform that is said to be “optimised to deliver responsive handling while remaining efficient in each of its three powertrain configurations.”Woong-Chul Yang, Head of Hyundai Motor R&D Center said, “Hyundai Motor has a heritage of building innovative, fuel-efficient vehicles, so we are proud to advance our eco-friendly car line-up with the introduction of Ioniq. “Our vision for future mobility focuses on choice, with a variety of powertrain options to suit customers’ varied lifestyles, without compromising on design or driving enjoyment. Ioniq embodies Hyundai Motor’s vision to shift the automotive paradigm and future mobility; Ioniq is the fruit of our efforts to become the leader in the global green car market,” he added.",Gerard Lye

The 308 Active still carries an estimated price tag of RM120,888, and enters the model range just below the standard 308 THP.Being more affordable than the original sole variant that was introduced back in August 2015, the 308 Active relinquishes a few features and equipment to reflect its price tag.Starting with what is retained, the 308 Active’s powertrain setup still consists of a 1.6 litre four-cylinder twin-scroll turbocharged engine paired to an Aisin-sourced AT6 six-speed torque converter automatic transmission (with Quickshift). The petrol mill still outputs 150 hp at 5,000 rpm and 240 Nm from 1,450 rpm.As for the list of changes, the exterior of the 308 Active now sees the use of halogen reflector headlights instead full LED ones. They still retain their automatic on/off function. The bumper has also been modified to accommodate the repositioned LED daytime running lights and fog lamps, with the front parking sensors being omitted.The 308 Active now comes with smaller 17-inch “Rubis” alloy wheels this time round, instead of the larger 18-inch “Sapphire” wheels on the current model.

Just as Petronas introduced its new formulas for the Mercedes-AMG team at the 2015 Italian GP, Shell had also injected its Prancing Horses with new fuel.Shell claimed that the Ferrari team gained up to half-a-second a lap with the new fuel, amounting to nearly a 30-seconds advantage over a full race. Mercedes-AMG Petronas team boss, Toto Wolff, responded to the claims by saying that it was, “interesting, but probably not quite where the reality lies.”Global manufacturer liaison and motorsport manager in research and technology at Petronas, Andrea Dolfi, said that his company will keep pushing its own development to match that of Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains (HPP).“Since F1 solutions are truly tailor made to co-engineer with the fluids, we have to move along with them. If you want to visualise it, yes, it’s a technical race, and what matters at the end of the day are the results on the track,” said Dolfi. “There are contributions from all sides. We are working together, moving together and we are striving to achieve tangible, sensible improvements,” he concluded.Petronas, title sponsor and key technical partner of the , has said that it will be introducing a major fuel and oil upgrade for the 2016 Formula 1 World Championship season.Speaking to  at a recent event, , fuel technology and oil business manager, said, “we tend to launch a (new) fuel when we have sizeable gains, something we are sure can be taken advantage of.”An often overlooked aspect of the sport by its fans, fuel and oils play a massive role in a Formula 1 car’s performance.

Rumours have been circulating that to celebrate this milestone, Bayerische Motoren Werke will unveil an all-new supercar as a birthday gift to itself.However, those rumours now appear to be shut down according to BMW development boss Klaus Fröhlich. While speaking to German site , he said BMW will not be celebrating its 100th anniversary with a “super sports car” that packs a V8 or V10 engine.However, that’s not to say BMW will completely shy away from releasing a new sports car. Fröhlich explained that an all-electric supercar is well within the realms of possibility, akin to . This is subject to the development of battery technology, where major leaps are expected in the coming years.As such, BMW would prefer to wait for the arrival of more advanced batteries that are possibly smaller, lighter and more powerful, before deciding to build an electric supercar in the future.

Design-wise, it takes the falling shoulder line of the Bugatti Type 57 C Atalante and styling elements of the Type 41 Royale.The unique hull shape is derived from Palmer Johnson’s SuperSport series that comprises of a mono-hull with two sponsons for added stability at speeds and at anchor. In addition, it comes with a two-tone colour scheme, while on the side, there is a contrasting blend of titanium and dark blue carbon-fibre.

2015-12-07,Bespoke supercar not ruled out by Nismo bosses,"More from , this time from . When asked if there is a possibility of a bespoke Nismo supercar – developed from the ground-up, as opposed to improving on a Nissan model – he had this to say. “Nismo is still a baby brand. And the baby needs protection. So not yet. But someday… yes,” he told TG. The publication must have drew comparison with the performance divisions of Audi, Mercedes-Benz and BMW when he elaborated. “RS, AMG and M have been around for years, so for them, they can diversify. Right now, for me, it’s important to get new customers – the high-life seeker,” Tamura san explained. As explained in , the “high-life seeker” is one who focuses on style and appearance, and this group includes women. To cater, Nismo branded cars will feature aesthetic enhancements in and out, with function to match. The other group is the traditional performance seeker who desires more power, better brakes and improved sound, among other things.“There’s too much motorsport and performance orientation, which means [some customers] cannot enjoy this very narrow scope,” Tamura told .Not satisfied with the far from concrete response by Tamura, TG tried its luck with Bob Laishley, Nismo’s programme director. The example quoted was AMG, and how it started out tuning Mercedes models before graduating into a factory outfit and rolling out supercars like the SLS.  “AMG are a good benchmark for us. It’s an interesting road and journey that they’ve been on. AMG started in a shed 20 years ago. They started very small, with a small group of guys outside of the business. We’re a small group of guys inside the business, and we’re going to build on that,” he said.It’s something nice for Nismo to aim for, he admits. “I would like to aspire to that. Whether we can, or whether that’s what the next GT-R should be, it’s a question of where we take it,” he added. So there you go, safe and non-committal responses from Nismo bosses, keeping the question alive for another day. Not sure about you, but this writer doesn’t see the need for a ground-up performance halo car when the Nissan GT-R already serves that purpose to great effect. With , Nismo gets to tune the GT-R and put its name on the Godzilla, something that didn’t happen before. Performance wise, the  is 10 seconds quicker than the regular car around Nurburgring, and can comfortably dispatch exotics costing much more in the Green Hell.",Danny Tan
2015-12-07,Volkswagen – UK sales dropped 20% in November,"It appears the whole  might be affecting sales across the Pond, too.  reported that the Das Auto brand has seen a near-20% sales slump in Britain in November, compared to the same month last year, according to new car registration figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).Wolfsburg registered 12,958 cars in Blighty last month, a drop of 19.99% compared to the 16,196 cars it rolled out of dealer forecourts in November 2014; fellow VW Group brands Audi, SEAT and Skoda saw similar decreases of 4.41%, 23.83% and 10.98% respectively. This is despite UK car sales as a whole rising 3.8% in the same period, with 178,876 cars registered last month.However, Volkswagen is reportedly still bullish of its fortunes, as it expects the overall year’s sales to be up on 2014 by the year end. “The gap is not a true representation of our overall sales trend,” said a spokesperson. “These ‘spikes’ in volume manufacturer results can be explained by, for example, delivery schedules of major customers and suchlike.”Indeed, despite the poor November showing, Volkswagen’s sales for the year to date are up 4.50% compared to the same period the year before. As for the other VW Group brands, Audi’s sales are up by 4.37%, but both SEAT and Skoda are down by 8.16% and 1.40% respectively.The news comes hot on the heels of a  – it sold 23,882 cars there last month, 8,000 units less than in November 2014.

2015-12-07,"Next-gen Land Rover Defender in 2018, five bodystyles – will put commercial success ahead of hardcore ethos","While the year 2015 may  of the , a replacement is already in the pipeline. Slated for an introduction by 2018, the next-generation Defender is expected to be on showroom floors by 2019, with five different body styles,  reports. Similar to the previous-generation’s offerings, the upcoming variations include two two-door models, a four-door variant with an extended wheelbase, alongside two- and four-door pick-ups.Land Rover seems to be facing a couple of challenges coming up with the new Defender. Labelling it as “tough,” Joe Eberhardt, CEO of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said, “any replacement for an iconic vehicle is tough because the enthusiasts are certainly very vocal. They have an opinion on how to do it, but it’s a huge opportunity at the same time,” he disclosed.That said, the brand will be putting commercial success first over the hardcore ethos of the outgoing Defender, so as to appeal to more buyers. “A lot of people love the idea of the previous Defender, but they never buy one,” Gerry McGovern, Land Rover design director said.He added, “while I’m a designer, and I love designing, I’m also a businessman. We need to build a critical mass in order to sustain ourselves in the long term and reinvest.” According to him, the brand will be looking to sell over 100,000 Defenders per annum globally instead of just 10,000 a year. McGovern noted that the production Defender, when ready, will not resemble the concepts that the brand has . “When this vehicle comes out, people will know it’s a Defender, it’s a modern Defender,” McGovern said.Drawing on the success of the ’s positioning, Ed Kim, vice president of industy analysis at AutoPacific said the new Defender will need to be both rugged and approachable. “I think Jeep has figured out a good balance of staying true to its heritage but building in just enough refinement and conveniences to live with on a daily basis,” he said.",Graham Chin

2015-12-05,Touring Nissan’s amazing Zama Heritage Collection,"It’s great to have a , as we did at the recent , but sometimes it’s good to take a pause and look back – not to dwell on the past, but to see how far we’ve come. Worth it, even if it’s just for the warmth that nostalgia brings. Nothing like the good old days indeed.That’s why the visit to Nissan’s Zama Heritage Collection was the favourite segment of the recent  for this writer, and one that I will remember for years to come. The visit was unfortunately short, but then again, this is the kind of place that one could spend an entire day in, and still say “not enough time”.For a collection of such value and significance, it is housed in a very unassuming building. Located in Kanagawa prefecture about 25 km from , Zama was previously a car producing factory (a veteran media colleague in the group had visited Zama in its previous life) and looks like just another old warehouse. An old warehouse that’s bursting at the gates. The collection of significant Nissan cars over the decades is over 450 strong and around 300 are packed very tight in the relatively bare facility – nothing fancy like interactive displays or even carpeting, just lights and backdrop. Amazingly, 70% of the vehicles are in running condition, and while we were there, some were being brought home from the Nismo Festival that happened at Fuji Speedway over the weekend.Keeping the collection sparkling and running is no mean feat. A couple of organisations share the task as guardians of the galaxy – Nismo takes care of the race cars, a firm called Safari Motors maintains the production cars and a volunteer organisation is in charge of the race cars that are production car-based. The latter, established in 2006, has a core group of 30 members and consists mostly of Nissan employees, although there are occasional open recruitment intakes. They restore one or two cars per year, and the 1995 Le Mans GT-R is an example of the club’s good work. Speaking of selflessness, it’s amazing to note that half of the production cars in the collection were donated by private owners. Yes, donated. The race cars are from the Nismo motorsports division. The collection occasionally buys cars from the open market, and would be happy to accept a clean S13 Nissan 180SX (I’d think that it shouldn’t be too hard to find one, or have all of them morphed into ?) and a racing 310 Bluebird from the 1950s. Otherwise, the collection is pretty complete. It’s not quite the full live catalogue of all the cars that Prince Motor Company, Datsun and Nissan have produced (you won’t find a Grand Livina here, and the house is full anyway), but all the significant ones are represented. It’s impossible to elaborate on each car you see here (and we didn’t get to see every car in the hall due to lack of time), but they can be divided into a few categories. Nissan has a rich if not always jubilant motorsport history, and rally machines from all eras are present here – from the Bluebird and jacked-up Fairlady that won the East African Safari Rally in the 70s, to the SR20DET-powered NME Sunny GTI-R WRC car from the 90s. Nissan didn’t reach the rally heights of Japanese rivals Toyota, Mitsubishi and Subaru (which is also why the WRC Sunny isn’t half as famous as the “Castrol Celica”, “Marlboro Evo” and “555 Impreza”) and shifted its focus to Le Mans. Endurance racing enthusiasts can enjoy the sight of Nissan’s “R” family of racers at Zama, including the R391 that was created to win the 1999 Le Mans 24 Hours (it failed) and the R91CP that won the 1992 Daytona 24 Hours. Retired JGTC and Super GT cars also call Zama home.The production car collection starts from the company’s first four-wheeler. Launched over 80 years ago, the Datsun Model 12 “Phaeton” was where it all started for Yoshisuke Aikawa’s Jidosha Seizo Co (he earlier acquired the manufacturing business from DAT Jidosha Seizo Co), which changed its name to Nissan in 1934. The Datsun 12 made 12 PS from its 747 cc four-cylinder engine.The leaping creature on the Datsun grille above is a rabbit, which was subsequently removed because it kept falling off due to owners supporting themselves on the emblem when hand-cranking the engine. That’s the reason why we never had a Bunny on a Sunny.The Prince Motor Company merged with Nissan in 1966, and a couple of the former’s significant models are housed in Zama. The Tama, an electric car from 1947, was an answer to the scarcity of oil after World War 2. The four-seater could travel up to 96 km on a single charge and had a top speed of 35 km/h. , bow to your ancestor.With the Prince merger, Nissan inherited a very famous name – Skyline. The Prince Skyline ALSID-1 is the original luxury car from 1957, and it’s parked next to two Prince Skyline Sport coupes from the 60s, the blue and gold cars above.Next up is the first Nissan Skyline, and the first one to wear the now iconic GT-R badge – the  based on the C10 series. The legend from 1969 was powered by a S20 2.0 litre four-cylinder engine with 160 hp and 177 Nm, good for a top speed of 200 km/h – sensational at that time. The S20 is a descendant of the GR8 engine that powered Prince’s R380 racing cars. We showed you the engine and the race car in . Both the PGC-10 GT-R sedan and the KPGC-10 GT-R coupe are in the gallery below for a closer look. Only 197 units of the next-generation C110 series GT-R – killed by strict exhaust emission regulations – were made and sold in Japan from 1972-1973, making Zama’s two units very rare. The GT-R badge would not surface again until 1988 with the R32 Skyline.Another famous Nissan nameplate is Fairlady. But before the sexy 240Z, the Fairlady badge was stuck on Datsun roadsters like the truck-based, Corvette-inspired four-seater SPL213; and the pretty little SR311 a.k.a. Datsun Sports 2000. The latter’s 2.0 litre engine with 150 hp, 7,000 rpm redline, five-speed manual and 950 kg still sound yummy today.The first Z-car needs little introduction. The PS30 Fairlady Z/240Z combined a gorgeous shape, high performance and good pricing to great effect – Nissan sold over 520,000 units of “the poor man’s Jaguar E-Type” from 1969 to 1978. The smash hit is seen here as a rare JDM Fairlady Z 432 (yellow car) powered by the Skyline GT-R’s S20 engine. ‘432’ refers to the six-pot motor’s four valves, three carburettors and two camshafts. Magnesium wheels were standard. The Japanese police used this Z, and a patrol car is in the gallery below.   Other interesting cars I managed to see include the first Silvia (clearly inspired by the Lancia Fulvia), a Bluebird that was signed by Japan’s Mexico 1968 Olympic team, Skyline 2000 RS-Turbo (in signature red-black), Sunny RZ-1 Coupe (Twincam Nismo Series), the famous Datsun 510 Bluebird 1600 SSS coupe and the boxy KP910 Bluebird 1800 SSS, the last of the RWD ‘birds.Two cars in the hall will be familiar to all Malaysians, car nut or not –  Nissan Sunny (B11) and the Datsun 720 pick-up truck. A personal mission to find the Datsun 1200 (the driving school car) and Datsun 160J SSS that my grandfather and dad once owned was successful, although Zama only had the two-door Violet. Lastly, you’ll find a 90s supercar that never was in the gallery below. Under the MID 4 II’s curious shell (you have to check out that behind) was a mid-mounted VG30DETT 3.0 litre twin-turbo V6 engine with 330 PS and 382 Nm going to all wheels, with HICAS four-wheel steering. Another one that never took off is the fuel cell X-Trail FCV concept. Hope you will enjoy browsing this gallery as much as I did snapping the pics.",Danny Tan
2015-12-07,"Mazda CX-3 Malaysian brochure, spec sheet leaked","It appears that dealers just can’t wait to get the word out on the Mazda CX-3. Merely days after the crossover’s , this time, the full brochure for the CX-3 has been uploaded by the Mazda CX-3 Club Malaysia , confirming much of what we already know.Based on this low-res brochure, it appears the CX-3’s standard equipment list includes automatic LED headlights with adaptive front-lighting system, auto-levelling and LED daytime running lights. LED front fog lamps are also provided, although the rear units do not feature the light-emitting diode. Automatic wipers are also offered here, along with power-folding side mirrors (with turn indicators).Inside, Mazda’s MZD Connect 7.0-inch multimedia system with Commander Control will occupy the dashboard, linked to six speakers. Navigation functionality will be a cost option (RM1,270) in the form of an inserted SD card, similar to the Mazda 2 hatchback/sedan. Automatic air-conditioning, leather suede seats, 18-inch wheels and a sunroof are also standard equipment for the CX-3.The driver meanwhile, benefits from Mazda’s Active Driving Display (heads-up display) and a multi-function (multimedia and cruise control) leather steering wheel (electric power assisted) that comes with paddle shifters. There is also a drive selection switch (Sport mode), reverse camera and keyless operation (entry and engine start).On the safety side of things, the CX-3 comes well equipped with DSC, traction control and ABS with EBD and BA. As for the airbag count, the crossover is fitted with six (dual frontal, side and curtain). Hill launch assist and emergency stop signal rounds up the safety suite. The brochure also confirms the absence of the i-ActivSense suite, possibly due to cost reasons. Powering the CX-3 is a 2.0 litre SkyActiv-G petrol engine that outputs 146 hp at 6,000 rpm and 204 Nm of torque at 2,800 rpm. The SkyActiv-G engine is linked to a SkyActiv-Drive six-speed automatic gearbox, which directs drive to the front wheels only (2WD). Mazda’s i-Stop engine idling stop system is present here as well, automatically shuts down the engine when the vehicle is static to save fuel.Five colours will be offered for the fully-imported (CBU) from Japan crossover – Soul Red Metallic, Crystal White Pearl, Jet Black, Meteor Grey and Deep Crystal Blue. We’ve been told during its  that only 2,000 units will be offered initially, with plans to locally-produce (CKD) the model being heavily considered.What do you think of the Mazda CX-3’s spec sheet? Is the RM131,218 (OTR without insurance) price tag enticing enough for you to place an order when it is launched on December 8? There’s no hiding the fact that the Honda HR-V will be the Mazda’s direct competitor. Which one takes the cake for you?",Gerard Lye

It was also stressed that the betterment of their service is SPAD’s responsibility.“If an accident happens, who will pay?” asked Federal Territories and Selangor Taxi Association president Datuk Aslah Abdullah. “They want nice cars and a service that comes in five minutes. But, the consequence is, who will pay?” Aslah told the English daily.It was also reported that because Uber and GrabCar’s drivers mostly have private insurance arrangements, they would not be able to claim for any damages because ride-sharing is deemed a commercial activity.The SPAD poll also revealed that 89.1% of its voters were unhappy with taxi drivers overcharging customers and not using their meters. Also, another 86.1% had previously used ride-sharing apps before, and 71.3% found these services more reliable than taxis.Deputy chairman Kamarudin Mohd Hussain of the Malaysian Taxi Drivers’ Transformation Association (PERS1M) suggests that SPAD is to be blamed for Uber and GrabCar’s rise. By not improving the service, public demand for these ride-sharing services grew.Apriman Darlis, secretary for the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Application Taxi Drivers Association (PERTAPPS) said that it was SPAD’s responsibility to educate its drivers about not cheating their customers. He was referring to the 89.1% of voters who were unhappy with drivers overcharging customers.Aslah echoed the secretary’s statement, saying that taxi drivers would not cheat their customers if SPAD’s enforcement on them was a lot stronger.

2015-12-07,SPAD to take over issuing vocational driving licences,"According to , the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) will soon have the power to issue vocational driving licences across Malaysia by 2017. The move will see the Road Transport Department (JPJ) transfer its authority to do so over to SPAD, allowing it (JPJ) to focus on producing safer drivers and motorcyclists for private vehicles instead.The long term plan will effectively provide SPAD total solitary control of the enforcement of commercial vehicles, including taxis. SPAD’s plans include centralising the vocational driving courses according to zones and to minimise cost by implementing the practices of Rapid Academy, a training arm under Prasarana Malaysia Berhad.Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak has already given the green light to SPAD’s proposal, which will allow it take control of vocational driving courses, plus the issuance of licences for Goods Vehicle Licence (GDL), Public Service Vehicle (PSV) and conductor.SPAD will look to overhaul the vocational driving curriculum syllabus should it be granted the power to do so, sources told . Under its new training regime, the commission aims to produce better vocational drivers by full-scale regulation of the commission’s Safety, Health and Environment Code of Practice.SPAD chief executive officer Mohd Azharuddin Mat Sah, when speaking to the newspaper, confirmed the commission’s intention to take control of vocational driving licence nationwide. “That is the plan but we need to present it to the Cabinet and finalise discussions with RTD. But this matter will take some time,” he said.To ensure a smooth transition, the commission is required to discuss with various stakeholders that include the Transport Ministry, police, JPJ, Road Safety Department, Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (Miros), driving school establishments and industry players. A detailed paper is expected to be presented to Cabinet for approval in January.However, the move drew some doubt on the commission’s capability to tackle the task. A senior JPJ officer told the newspaper, “Does SPAD have the resources and capabilities for this job? It is not easy as it also involves medical check-up, annual licence renewal and the candidate for PSV and GDL must also possess the D car licence with at least a two-year probationary period with a clean record, which is currently under JPJ’s authority.”Additionally, a Transport Ministry official stated that SPAD’s authority is limited to Peninsular Malaysia. With zero absence in Sabah and Sarawak, the official questioned on the feasibility of a dual system (Peninsular and East Malaysia) for vocational drivers in the country.Do you think SPAD should assume control of the enforcement of commercial vehicles in the country, or should the JPJ continue on with this duty?",Gerard Lye

It should look similar to the concept – which has a shorter wheelbase over its hardtop cousin and a wraparound front windscreen – but the stylish rear buttress design will probably have to be redesigned to fit an actual roof mechanism. We’re also not sure if a transparent boot cover is very practical, either.Whatever the production i8 Spyder will look like, it will almost certainly feature the regular i8’s mid-mounted 231 hp/320 Nm 1.5 litre TwinPower Turbo three-pot engine and six-speed automatic gearbox, supplemented by a front-mounted 131 hp/250 Nm electric motor, effectively providing all-wheel drive.Total output is at 362 hp and 570 Nm, enough to get the coupé version from 0-100 km/h in 4.4 seconds before hitting a top speed of 250 km/h. Fuel consumption is rated at 47.6 km per litre, with carbon dioxide emissions at 49 grams per kilometre.",Jonathan Lee
2015-12-04,Fiat Chrysler releases five Star Wars-themed ads,"Star Wars fever has gripped the world, with many brands wanting to cash in on the popular sci-fi franchise. This includes Fiat Chrysler Automobile (FCA), who are looking to promote its Year End Blockbuster Sales Event with a series of TV spots starring some of the group’s models.Ram Trucks’ approach includes a modified take on the trademark wide shot that is seen in the movies. In the 30-second video titled ‘Family’, we see a Ram 3500 driving across a wide open desert field, while a voiceover highlights an all-powerful “force” that customers can “harness.” Basically, 0% annual percentage rate for 75 months.Moving on, Jeep’s ‘Shooting Star’ ad features some actual Star Wars space combat scene, complete with a cameo by BB-8. However, the scene then shifts millions of light years away back to planet Earth where a couple are enjoying the peace and comfort in a Jeep Renegade parked in a remote location. The spot then ends with the phrase, “enjoy the freedom to go far, far away.”Fiat meanwhile, plays on your allegiance to either the dark or light side of the Force with two Fiat 500 Abarths facing off in the middle of a dried lake bed. Befitting the theme, a black and white Fiat 500 Abarth race towards each other before kicking up dirt on one another, complete with lightsaber sound effects.Chrysler on the other hand, took the nostalgic path for its ad. The “First Time” spot recalls the feelings you had when you first saw Star Wars when the movie was released in back in 1977. The focus is on a young boy as he progresses through each important stage of his life from meeting his wife to watching The Force Awakens with his son, all with a Chrysler car being a part of it.However, the most impressive of them all comes from Dodge. In its “The Force Gathers” 30-second spot, a black Dodge Viper ACR leads a convoy of Dodge Chargers down a road, ala Darth Vader and his legion of Stormtroopers. This “horsepower” convoyThe muscle car convoy are headed to a showing of The Force Awakens, and upon arrival, the valets certainly are short-handed to park them all. At the end of the video, a voiceover introduces a twist to a popular line from the movie, “join the Dodge side.”Of all the Fiat Chrysler Star Wars-themed ads, which is your favourite?

This was revealed at the 2015 Professional MotorSport World Expo (PMW) in Cologne.Having seen a fair share of aftermarket tuners producing their own unique versions of the , none of them have ever dabbled with the sports car’s hybrid powertrain before. As standard, the BMW i8 features a 231 hp 1.5 litre TwinPower three-cylinder engine and a 131 hp electric motor. Its total system output is rated at 362 hp and 570 Nm of torque.The regular i8’s figures aren’t bad at all, so good in fact that the sports car manages to perform its century sprint in just 4.4 seconds. However, the team at GRT isn’t known to be satisfied easily.The German tuner has announced that it will be removing the hybrid powertrain entirely and retrofitting its version of the  with a 4.4 litre TwinPower V8 engine sourced from the  and . The engine is mounted up front where the electric motor used to be, paired with a new six-speed sequential transmission.But rather than leave things at that, the GRT powertrain will feature a tune-up by Alpina, adding an extra 200 hp. Do the math, and it all adds up to this i8 featuring nearly 800 hp! Unfortunately, no further performance details were mentioned.As posted on its Facebook page, the GRT team said, “We have revealed our secret that GRT’s supercar is based on the high-tech and futuristic BMW i8. The great challenge of the project is to switch the hybrid driveline to pure racing technology.”It continues, “At the PMW Expo, the team of Gabura Racing Technologies gave visitors an inside view of the development process, everybody can check out the current state of the project. As we expected, there is enormous interest in GRT’s supercar, so we are proud to say that the show is a great success for us.”",Chris Aaron
2015-12-04,"VIDEO: Volvo FMX truck vs Sophie, the four-year-old","Volvo Trucks’ latest video is remarkably cute, but highly effective. Pitting a four-year-old girl named Sophie against its mighty FMX truck doesn’t sound like a fair challenge. However, giving her the controls to its truck in a construction yard does balance the equation.To prove its strength and durability, Volvo parked the FMX in a booby-trapped construction yard, fitted it with remote controls, and handed the four-year-old its controller. And as Sophie explains, “I stood there, and I drive it. Left and right, back- and forwards.”Clearly, Volvo isn’t too worried about the possibility of Sophie completely annihilating its FMX here. But do they change their minds when she rolls it off a cliff? Check out the video above and find out, and see how the truck is built to withstand the punishment Sophie unwittingly dishes out in the film below.",Chris Aaron

Bob Carter, Toyota Motor Corporation’s top sales executive foresees that the  will outdo the  in terms of sales in the next five years, with millennials being the majority of buyers. “I’ll bet you lunch that will happen,” the exec asserted. Carter noted that many of those under the age of 35, entering the market “in a big way,” spent their lives growing up with an SUV. The exec admitted that five years ago, he never thought that one day, compact SUVs would outsell sedans. “There’s a really dramatic shift in consumer preference going on,” he said.According to Carter, millennials and baby boomers are shifting to compact SUVs as they are economical, affordable and not harsh in terms of ride seeing that it shares the same underpinnings as compact cars. “Compact SUVs, have the comfort of mid-sized sedans, they’ve got competitive fuel economy, they’ve got all the amenities and the price is almost the same.”He stated that compact SUVs such as the ,  and  sell better than sedans like the  and .

Last month, sales of the RAV4 in the US shot up to 30%, while the Camry rose by only 7.3%, however, total sales of the Camry is down by 1.2% for the year.To cater to the great demand of the RAV4, Toyota will also be importing the model directly from Japan. In addition to that, the brand will be setting up a second plant in Canada, where it will be able to produce over 400,000 RAV4 models a year in North America, Carter disclosed.

Just to clarify, the monster inside the Huracan is a naturally-aspirated 5.2 litre V10 mill that produces 610 hp and 560 Nm of torque. With Underground Racing’s dual air-induction system, power can be maxed to 2,200 whp.The base twin-turbo system costs USD$49k (RM206k). This package gives the Huracan 800 whp on 93 octane and with some tuning done to the standard ECU. The stage one twin-turbo system without engine mods costs USD$59k (RM248k). While stage one provides the same amount of power at the wheels, on race fuel however, the output rises to 900 whp.As for the stage two twin-turbo system, it gives the Huracan 850 whp on 93 octane and 1,000 whp on race fuel. This one costs USD$69k (RM290k). In addition to that, it’s upgradeable to stage three, which requires engine modifications. The package is priced at USD$99k (RM416k) and it enables the supercar to churn out 1,000 whp on octane and a massive 1,250 whp on race fuel. If all that is not enough, then Underground Racing has two more twin-turbo packs in store. However, it’s not yet available for the DCT dual-clutch transmission, according to the company. The race version twin-turbo requires a modified engine and when fitted it will push out 1,150 whp on octane and 1,500 whp on race fuel.The final package, called the X Version twin-turbo system, requires a “highly modified” engine. Once fitted, the Huracan will churn out 1,500 whp on normal petrol and over 2,200 whp on race fuel. No prices have been quoted for both, but seeing as how the the other stages go, it’s likely to be over the hundred-thousand dollar mark.All that power is assisted with the help of launch control and a little more boost, controlled by Underground Racing’s proprietary JRR MoTec M1 electronics and firmware. With all that speed at the wheels, the company says, “driving an Underground Racing TT Huracan is something that can only be experienced, not explained.”",Graham Chin

Of course, a massive truck like this with such ridiculous styling riding on massive wheels is probably as far away as stealthy as you can get.On top of that, it features a pop-up DJ booth that rises from the middle of the large body, so you can literally bring the party with you anywhere.

2015-12-04,"“Gangster” taxi groups threaten livelihood and safety of other taxi drivers, claims association chairman","According to a report by , “gangster” groups that claim to be from taxi companies, are said to be a threat to other taxi drivers’ safety and livelihoods. These groups that also include fellow taxi drivers, control major areas in Kuala Lumpur, forcing other  to submit to their own set of requirements in order to operate in them.Speaking to the news agency, Klang Valley Taxi Driver Action Committees Association chairman, Zailani Isausuludin claimed the “gangster” problem had existed for over 10 years. Throughout that time, these thuggish taxi drivers seemed to be impervious to any action against them by the authorities.He said, “they have been controlling the areas which are public haunts such as shopping complexes, luxurious condominiums, premier hotels and the LRT stations. If we want to pick up passengers from the areas ‘controlled’ by them, we will first have to each pay RM200 a month to them for each area.”If the taxi drivers did not comply with this demand, they would be threatened with physical harm and damage to their taxis, according to Zailani. This has forced taxi drivers to pay “area money” to these groups, by taking advantage of not using the meter and charging high fares, especially on foreign tourists in areas controlled by the “gangsters.”Zulkiflie Aminuddin, a taxi driver, said these groups make it hard for taxi drivers operating within the Klang Valley to earn a healthy income. “It’s difficult to earn RM150 a day as our movements are restricted by these thuggish groups of taxi drivers,” he said, adding that taxi permits issued by SPAD allowed taxi drivers to pick up any passenger within the Klang Valley. “For instance, recently I wanted to pick up a passsenger who made a booking through the   but when I drove to the waiting area of the shopping complex, I was prevented from picking up the passenger by a group of men who said only taxis with a special sticker were allowed to do so,” Zulkiflie recalled.Zailani stated that the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) has been informed of this issue, but no action has been taken against these “gangster” taxi groups until today. The association also suggested that SPAD form a group of volunteers made up of selected taxi drivers, supported by a mobile unit in the hot spots to monitor such activites.This is similar to the Road Transport Department’s Skuad Muda 1JPJ, which also carries out community service activities. Additionally, Zailani recommends SPAD to set up mobile stations in busy areas around the city centre such as Bukit Bintang including KL Pavilion, Jalan Petaling, Brickfields and KL Sentral to reduce the number of taxi drivers not using the meter.What are your thoughts on the matter? Do you think more should be done by the authorities to tackle this “gangster” problem? Have you ever encountered a situation as described above? Let us know in the comments below.",Gerard Lye

There’s also now silver instead of white on the roof to reflect the harsh Argentine sunshine – temperatures in the South American nation can exceed 50 degrees Celsius.The new design complements the significant changes made to the 2008 DKR to be more competitive, including shorter front and rear overhangs that significantly alter the weight distribution and make it easier to tackle obstacles. The bodywork has also been revised to improve downforce and airflow, while the suspension has been redesigned, matched to lighter magnesium wheels and Michelin tyres.It’s also more powerful than before – the 3.0 litre twin-turbo V6 diesel has been tweaked to produce 10 more horsepower, so outputs now stand at 350 hp and 800 Nm.

The acquisition will give Mahindra access to the host of high-end styling and engineering services provided by the Italian company, while Pininfarina will benefit from an ability to leverage Tech Mahindra’s presence across 90 countries and access to about 780 customers – the aim is to upsell and cross-sell to the combined client base that will now be available to both sides.Mahindra says that Pininfarina will continue to remain an independent company, with Paolo Pininfarina continuing as the chairman of its board.Founded in 1930, Pininfarina has designed numerous vehicles for world renowned manufacturers, and the model list includes Ferraris, Fiats, Alfa Romeos and Maseratis. The design house also penned the original Jaguar XJ6 and Rolls-Royce Camargue, and in recent times, notable creations have been the  and  (which became the limited-run ).The decision by the Turin-based firm to sell out is no surprise – it hasn’t been doing well commercially, losing money in 10 of the last 11 years, due to debt and a dwindling business to build cars for other companies.",Anthony Lim

Plans to list Ferrari on the Italian stock market have also been set in motion.Currently, 80% of Ferrari’s shares are parked under the FCA, 10% are publically traded, while the remaining 10% is held by Piero Ferrari, son of company founder, Enzo Ferrari. FCA’s remaining stake will be distributed within Ferrari to its own investors starting early next year, effectively completing the de-merger of Ferrari from the Italian-American group.Even though Ferrari will soon be trading independently, it will need to demonstrate that a supercar maker is able to operate on its own, without a large group pumping capital into it. This includes companies like Koenigsegg and Pagani. Other carmakers like Lamborghini and Bentley meanwhile, are both under the Volkswagen Group.Sergio Marchionne, FCA’s CEO and current chairman of Ferrari, plans to increase the carmaker’s yearly output. The move contradicts a strategy put in place by previous chariman  of intentionally restricting production to heighten the sports car’s scarcity value. Last year, Ferrari sold 7,300 cars but Marchionne plans to increase that number to 9,000 by 2019.“An independent Ferrari will be better positioned to realise its potential and will have increased access to capital,” Marchionne told shareholders, according to the .

2015-12-04,Shell Helix Ultra ECT tested in an R56 MINI One 1.6,"Shell Malaysia recently unveiled an all-new formulation to its Helix Ultra engine lube, called the  – with ECT denoting Emissions Compatible Technology. The Helix Ultra ECT, which retails at RM338 for a four-litre pack, features the company’s most advanced lube formulation and is designed to work well with the latest low-emissions engines. It is claimed to help protect your car’s emissions control systems, including particulate filters, and it is made to work with various engine types including diesel, petrol, gas, biodiesel and ethanol-blend engines. It is also backwards-compatible with various OEM standards. According to Shell, ECT pretty much helps keep the engine free of dirt and carbon build-up, which then translates to a more efficient and longer-lasting engine.The Shell Helix Ultra ECT also features the , which is based on natural gas. It is actually a gas-to-liquid (GTL) process, which converts natural gas into a crystal-clear base oil without impurities, which are normally found in crude oil. With PurePlus, you would already enjoy protection against sludge and corrosion, plus as a whole, it helps to ensure longer engine life. Fuel economy is also improved, by about 1.4%.With the help of ECT, the overall claimed fuel economy improvement hits the 2.6%, along with three times better corrosive wear protection, four times better wear protection as well as 45% cleaner pistons, against the latest industry standards. It also offers improved sludge protection.Well, all the above sounds very nice as you read away, but at the end of the day, how does it affect your daily driving? We have decided to give the Shell Helix Ultra ECT a go, by filling the lube up in a 2012 R56 MINI One featuring a 1.6 litre four-cylinder Prince engine, which makes a very modest 98 hp and 150 Nm of torque, linked to a good-old six-speed auto box. We used it for about a month.For that duration, we drove the MINI is various conditions including city driving. We also did an extended drive to Ulu Yam. The MINI, which normally uses 5W-30 fully-synthetic engine oil, usually returns about 10 km/l under mixed driving conditions. Following the change, the fuel economy change was hard to notice as the hatch was still returning pretty much the same mileage, but that would likely be due to the mixture of road conditions.One thing that we did notice, however, was slight improvement in power delivery during normal acceleration. Acceleration felt a little more effortless, while we didn’t notice any difference in engine noise. As for the other claims mentioned by Shell such as cleaner pistons and improved protection, we were unable to test accurately at this point, but with the improved smoothness in acceleration, we can only assume that the lube is working like a charm.So overall, based on the fact that the power delivery is now better, we do consider the new Shell Helix Ultra ECT as one of the better lubes out there. But at the end of the day, it still boils down to the price, which is set at RM338. This then points to wether you feel it is worth the amount or not, which, if you ask us, it is.",Harvinder Sidhu

2015-12-04,"FIA announces changes to Formula 1 regulations – 2016 Malaysian GP now in October, after Singapore","The FIA has announced that the World Motor Sport Council has approved a number of changes to ‘s technical and sporting regulations, and these are set to come into effect from the 2016 F1 season on. The number of races in a season has been increased from 20 to 21, and in-season engine development is set to go on until 2019 at the very least. The token system – introduced in 2014 – will be continued, with allocation rates for the next four seasons determined; for 2016, 32 tokens will be allowed, and this will be reduced to 25 in 2017, 20 in 2018 and 15 by 2019.Meanwhile, power units homologated in previous seasons may now be re-homologated – prior to this, no engine manufacturer could supply more than a single specification. This has allowed the FIA to agree for Ferrari to supply a fourth customer team with a 2015-specification engine in 2016.Changes to tyre regulations have also come about, to encourage differing race strategies in 2016. Pirelli will now supply three dry-weather compounds instead of two. Thirteen sets of tyres will be available to each driver in a race weekend, and the tyre maker will choose two sets of tyres for a race (only one of which must be used) as well as one set of the softest available that can only be used in Q3.Each driver may then choose his remaining 10 sets from the three available compounds. The existing regulation for a driver to use at least two different types of dry-weather compounds during a race, unless intermediate or wet-weather tyres have been used, continues.Elsewhere, the race calendar for the 2016 FIA Formula One World Championship season was also announced. Provisionally, the 19 races from the have been retained, and the German GP will be returning to the calendar, the event to be held at Hockenheim. Azerbaijan will play host to the also returning European GP – the race will be held on a street circuit in the city of Baku, the country’s capital.Notably, the Malaysian GP is now placed further along in the 2016 calendar – the  has been moved from its usual second slot to become the 16th race.

2015-12-04,"McLaren 675LT Spider – topless Longtail, 500 units","The McLaren 675LT Spider has been revealed. The topless Longtail comes less than a year since the  became the first model in nearly 20 years to resurrect the name, and is in response to significant customer demand, Woking says. It is limited to only 500 examples worldwide.The fixed roof 675LT focused on light weight, enhanced aerodynamics, increased power and track-focused dynamics, and was sold out before the first deliveries commenced. What is being described as the most focused, fastest and exhilarating open top car to ever wear a McLaren badge should follow the same trend.Under the skin sits the heavily revised 3.8 litre twin-turbo V8 from the coupe with 675 PS at 7,100 rpm and 700 Nm available between 5,000 to 6,500 rpm. 0-100 km/h takes just 2.9 seconds, and 200 km/h is achieved in 8.1 seconds, 0.2 seconds slower than the lighter and more slippery coupe. Top speed is 326 km/h. The three-piece folding hardtop can be opened at speeds up to 30 km/h. It stows below a colour-coded tonneau cover, and the engine remains visible through a lightweight vented polycarbonate engine cover.Plenty of carbon fibre here. As with the coupe, the front bumper with larger splitter and end plates, front under body, side skirts, side intakes, lower side intakes, rear bodyside lower, rear fenders, rear deck, rear bumper, diffuser and ‘Longtail’ Airbrake are all CF. They contribute to a dry weight of just 1,270 kg, a full 100 kg lighter than the . McLaren says that due to the inherent strength of the carbon fibre MonoCell chassis, no further strengthening – and associated weight increase – has been added through the removal of the roof, and the McLaren 675LT Spider is only 40 kg heavier than the Coupe, all due to the retractable roof system.The car’s titanium crossover twin exhausts exit below the active ‘Longtail’ Airbrake which is 50% larger than other Super Series models. Despite the larger size, carbon fibre construction means it’s actually lighter. A pair of CF-shelled racing seats, modelled on those on , save 15 kg. Air con is not standard, but the 16 kg system can be specified as a no-cost-option.The Spider is fitted with 10-spoke “Ultra-Lightweight” forged alloys – 19-inch at the front, 20-inch at the rear – and Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tyres as standard, but the set you see here is a new 20-spoke design from the “Super-Lightweight” options list.A Club Sport Professional Pack adds further visual carbon fibre and stealth detailing, but the Coupe’s Club Sport Pack (titanium rollhoop, four-point harnesses, fire extinguisher) is not available here. Deliveries of the £285,450 car (RM1.82 million before Malaysian taxes) start in summer 2016.",Danny Tan
