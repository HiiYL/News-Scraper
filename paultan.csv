Ford GT ownership includes tough selection process,,Gerard Lye,"[(u'calcutta', u'damn!no wonder my submission fail'), (u'PeterGriffin', u'250 Ford GT in the world, 250 Ford GTs,'), (u'Black Dog', u'\nOne bought by Sultan Brunei, 249 Ford GT left in the world,')]","Cars,Ford,International News",2016-02-02,"At last year’s North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the Blue Oval surprised everyone when it revealed the . The highly-anticipated model is set to go on sale this year, but the process of owning one isn’t just about how large your bank account is, as potential owners will have to go through a rigorous selection procedure for the 250 GTs that will be available at the end of 2016.In a report by , the process to Ford GT ownership starts with online applications, which are expected to go live later this month. “There’s a loyal following to the car,” Raj Nair, Ford’s product chief, said in an interview. “We want to prioritise people who are going to care about the car, keep the car and drive the car,” he added.Questions in the application form include how many Ford vehicles the applicant has previously owned, how active they are on social media and how often they plan to drive it. “It will try to understand what your relationship with Ford is,” Nair said.Successful applicants will be required to sign a legal document, whereby they formally agree that they will not sell the vehicle for a certain amount of time to help prevent buyers from flipping them quickly for a quick buck (ala property). That should scare way buyers who simply want to turn a quick profit on the supercar. This selection process mirrors the LaFerrari buyer selection method. The Italian automaker similarly requires die-hard Ferrari owners to submit their names to a list. Corporate bigwigs in Maranello will then decide upon the potential candidates from the list, before they are then granted permission to purchase a LaFerrari. Rumour has it that you’ll need to own at least five Ferraris (in good condition) to even be considered.It’s easy to see why the Ford GT is attracting this much attention. Beyond its contemporary styling, the American supercar packs the most powerful EcoBoost motor ever produced – a 3.5 litre EcoBoost V6 delivering over 600 hp. The GT’s return also marks the 50th anniversary of Ford’s first Le Mans win, where coincidentally, a  will make its debut in said race this year."

The outdoor audio system gives a bunch of sheep singing lessons, and they do pretty well with Queen’s “Somebody to Love.”Honda says that the ad will be shown in the third quarter and that it studied the movement of sheep’s mouths to determine how their facial muscles might react while singing. What? “Great Super Bowl spots are entertaining for the fans while communicating an essential value of the product, and we believe our Honda Ridgeline commercial accomplishes both objectives in dramatic fashion,” said Honda senior VP Jeff Conrad.

Munich’s limo and flagship saloon, now in its sixth generation (check out this nice ), will provide competition to the , ,  and . The G11 (we only get the long-wheelbase variant, so it’s G12 technically) is available here in 730Li and 740Li forms.The long-wheelbase 7 Series has a larger footrpint than before, at 5,238 mm long (+19 mm), 1,902 mm wide (unchanged) and 1,479 mm tall, with a 3,210 mm wheelbase (also unchanged). To compare, the LWB W222 S-Class is 5,246 mm long and 1,899 mm wide, with a 3,165 mm wheelbase. So, the BMW is 8 mm shorter overall, but has a 45 mm longer wheelbase than the Merc.While it might not look worlds apart from its predecessor, the new 7 Series is all-new and high-tech underneath. BMW’s Carbon Core construction – with tech gleaned from  development – utilises a combination of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), magnesium, aluminium and steel, resulting in increased strength and rigidity of the passenger cell  weight savings of up to 130 kg compared to the F01. Core aside, the use of aluminium for the doors and (for the first time) the bootlid also contributed to the weight loss. BMW says that unsprung mass has been cut by 15%, centre of gravity made lower and 50:50 weight distribution maintained. The 740Li is powered by a 3.0 litre inline-six engine with 326 hp from 5,500 to 6,500 rpm; and 450 Nm of torque from 1,380 to 5,000 rpm. The B58 twin-scroll turbo unit is from a new engine family and its crankcase, cylinder head and oil sump are all made from aluminium. The turbo features an indirect system of charge air cooling that is incorporated into the intake manifold, and this water-to-air intercooler provides a shorter route for the air. BMW claims better efficiency and response than the old N55 motor, which has 320 hp/450 Nm.Paired to a ZF eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission with Steptronic, the 740Li is capable of 0-100 km/h in a swift 5.6 seconds, on to a limited top speed of 250 km/h. Claimed combined fuel consumption is 6.6 litres per 100 km.The  is powered by a hero of a downsized motor, a 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder tasked to haul a big limo. This entry-level petrol engine for the 7 Series puts out 258 hp from 5,000 to 6,500 rpm; and 400 Nm of torque from 1,550 to 4,400 rpm. The B48 is a relatively new engine and has been seen in the , BMW / sisters and , but we’re seeing the most powerful version of it in the G11. Using an eight-speed auto, performance is far from shabby, with the benchmark 0-100 km/h sprint taking just 6.3 seconds. Top speed is at the regular 250 km/h mark, while fuel consumption is rated at 5.8 litres per 100 km, 0.8 l/100 km better than the 740Li. Not sold here, the  also uses this engine, but with an electric motor and lithium-ion battery in the mix., but the big cat’s 240 PS, 340 Nm and 7.5 seconds pale in comparison. Also weaker is the outgoing 730Li – powered by a NA 3.0 litre six-pot, it does 258 hp, 310 Nm and 7.5 seconds. No reason to fear downsizing, then.Both variants ride on air suspension (both axles) and 19-inch alloys (different styles) with 245/45 front tyres and fatter 275/40 rear ones. There’s also Dynamic Damper Control, and the 740Li adds on a new Executive Drive Pro “active chassis” system with electromechanical active roll stabilisation. The fancy  with LCD colour display and touch control panel (one can turn on the lights, open/close the windows, check fuel level and schedule the climate control, among other things, Remote Control Parking not available here) is standard across the board, as is the Design Pure Excellence package, which is basically an exterior chrome trim pack.Also standard are a four-zone auto air con, head-up display, Surround View, Welcome Light Carpet,  (Intelligent Emergency Call, Teleservices, Concierge Services and Remote Services), BMW Gesture Control for the infotainment system, Navigation System Professional with 10.25-inch touch display and HDD, plus a rear seat entertainment system with two 10-inch screens. The latter is controlled via the BMW Touch Command seven-inch tablet housed in the rear centre console. The removable tablet is made by Samsung.Speaking of rear seats, the big shots at the back can enjoy eight massage programmes including the Vitality programme, which allows one to engage in active physical exercise for recuperation purposes. Comfort seats at the back for 730Li, front and back for 740Li. Note that right-hand drive cars do not get the Executive Lounge Seating option featured in our  story until the second half of 2016. Both variants get a panorama glass roof, but only 740Li occupants get to enjoy the “Sky Lounge”. When it gets dark, the light emitted from side-mounted LED modules is directed evenly onto the glass surface, where it hits an imprinted graphic for a starry sky effect. Also exclusive to the 740Li is a 600w Harman Kardon sound system with nine channels with 16 speakers. The 730Li comes with a 205w “HiFi” system with 12 speakers. Not available here is the 7er range topping 1400w Bowers & Wilkins Diamond audio with 10-channel amp and 16 speakers.The 740Li also gets BMW Laserlight headlamps, which can be identified by a central blue-tinted horizontal bar. These top shelf items have a range of 600 metres in high-beam mode – twice the range of the LED headlights of the 730Li.The 730Li receives BMW Driving Assistant, a safety pack that includes Approach Control and Person Warning with light city braking, rear collision prevention, lane change and lane departure warning and rear cross traffic warning. BMW Driving Assistant Plus on the 740Li adds on stereo cameras and a radar for steering and lane control assist, lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection, traffic jam assistant for semi-autonomous driving, front/rear rear cross traffic assist, and Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go. Eight airbags are standard. Trim wise, the 740Li is lined with Nappa leather with diamond-pattern stitching and Poplar Grain Grey wood trim, with real leather dash top wrap, while the 730Li makes do with Dakota leather and Fineline wood. Both leather types can be had in Black, Canberra Beige or Cognac.We finally come to the price, which starts from  OTR without insurance for the 730Li and  for the 740Li. Decent pricing by BMW Group Malaysia for CBU imports (the  benefits from CKD hybrid tax exemptions), but the figures quoted are “exclusive prices” in conjunction with BMW’s 100-year anniversary, valid until further notice or while stocks last. Add RM100k to both numbers for the regular RRP (RM698,888 and RM888,800 respectively)."
SPYSHOTS: Maserati Levante – interior finally revealed,,Chris Aaron,,"Cars,International News,Maserati,Spyshots",2016-02-02,"Spied before  and once again , here is another early look at the coming  – the Italian car maker’s first shot at producing an SUV. To give you a bit of a recap, the Levante will face-off against the likes of the  and the popular .While the car seen here is still a heavily disguised mule, it is very likely hiding a dedicated SUV body – one that is far closer to being production-ready than we’ve seen before. Previous spyshots were of the mule wearing a Ghibli’s body, albeit with much higher ground clearance, thanks to an adapted chassis from the Quattroporte and Ghibli sedans.Here, the front grille with its trident emblem is seen peeking through the camo up front, while bits of the front apron and large air intakes are also visible. Sleek headlights can be seen, and if you look closely, underbody skid plates are visible just under the front bumper of the car.The rear of this prototype is properly disguised, revealing just its quad exhaust tips and Gran Turismo-inspired tail lights. Needless to say, the Levante also has a healthy amount of ground clearance. Apart from the headlamps, Maserati’s renders of its Kubang SUV concept looks to be carried over very well here.More importantly, this is also the first time the Levante’s interior has been seen. Naturally, there are a lot of test instruments in the vehicle, but this is as clear a view as it gets for now. The steering looks like it’s a carbon copy of what’s available in the Ghibli and Quattroporte, in three-spoke fashion, with column-mounted shift paddles.The dashboard gets an integrated display screen, just like we’ve seen on the Levante’s sedan siblings too. While the layout of the centre console remains familiar, there’s a new rotary dial on the centre console – one we reckon would be for the infotainment system.Previously, it was reported that the Levante would offer a similar range of engines available to its sedan siblings, including a petrol 3.0 litre turbo V6 that would offer 350 hp and 425 hp, and a 3.8 litre turbo V8 powerhouse good for 560 hp. Three diesel versions of the Levante have been tipped, each potentially offering 250 hp, 275 hp and 340 hp tunes.The Italian SUV is expected to make its global debut in a matter of a months now, at the coming Geneva Motor Show in March 2016. The car will begin its production much later in Turin, Italy, after which, a hotter Levante GTS has been rumoured to become available in Europe too."

The publication, which doesn’t reveal its source, says that the Elantra Sport will feature a 1.6 litre turbocharged engine with up to 200 hp, and a six-speed manual, or seven-speed dual-clutch auto transmission.Currently, the US market gets just one variant of the Elantra, which uses a 147 hp 2.0 litre four-pot MPI petrol engine. Naturally, a turbocharged unit may increase the model’s appeal against new competition from the turbocharged .However, do note that Hyundai does already have such a powertrain combo in the US – one that it could lift straight out of the . The four-pot turbo makes 200 hp and 265 Nm of torque, and likewise, can be paired with either a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.It has also been confirmed that a new turbocharged 1.4 litre Kappa GDI four-cylinder mill is reserved for the .

News reports from the republic quoted local Suzuki arm PT Suzuki Indomobil Sales (SIS) saying that the Ertiga will be exported to Malaysia in knocked down form, from the second quarter of 2016.SIS will export 1,500 units of the Ertiga to Proton per month, which translates to a significant 18,000 units per year.

The new 10th-gen Civic is expected to be launched in Indonesia some time this year, turbo engine in tow.As available in the US, the 1.5 litre turbocharged engine delivers 174 hp at 5,500 rpm and 220 Nm from 1,800 to 5,000 rpm. A 2.0 litre, naturally-aspirated, four-cylinder engine is also available, offering 158 hp and 187 Nm of torque. Both mills are paired with an updated CVT automatic transmission.The new Civic has also been , and we expect Honda Malaysia to launch the model this year as well. However, news of Indonesia getting the 1.5 turbo engine does contradict about the improbability of it being offered in Asian markets – somewhat opening the doors for us too.“Depending on the market and region, but particularly in Asia and other emerging markets, we will continue offering our naturally-aspirated line-up, which tends to be less costly.

This makes them highly collectible, and among the many variants that were created, the rarest and priciest of them all is the Nismo Z-tune, and one has popped up for sale. This one here is up for sale for USD$510,000 (RM2,123,155).The dealer behind this exceptional beast is Contempo Concept HK Motors, which as the name suggests, is based in Hong Kong. The Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune in this case, is a 2005 model, and only has 3,100 km registered on its mileage. As far as condition goes, this one would certainly be appropriately labelled as “immaculate.”But what makes the Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune so rare, desirable, and in this instance, ridiculously expensive? Time for a history lesson. The Z-tune was intended to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Nismo in 2005, where only 20 units of the special edition will be made during the day. The one on sale here is #9 from that total.Unfortunately, production of the GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R came to an end in 2002. Therefore, Nismo had to purchase 20 used R34 GT-R V-Spec models that needed to have less than 30,000 km on the odometer, and meet strict body and mechanical condition assessments by Nismo before they can even be considered to be made into Z-tunes.Even then, only 12 examples of the 20 were individually-picked and acquired by Nismo (including this one). The remaining examples from number 13 through 20 were donated by owners who wanted to convert their V-Spec to Z-tune cars. Although Nismo planned on building 20 cars, only 19 (including two prototypes) were made before production of the Z-Tune was ceased.The Z-tune transformation process isn’t by any means simplistic either. Let’s start with the engine, which is based on Nissan’s Le Mans GT2 and GT500 racing experiences. Firstly, the original RB26DETT engine gets bored out from 2.6 litres to a new displacement of 2.8 litres. From there, Nismo provided the Z-tune’s engine with a strengthened block, stroked crankshaft, new forged and fillet-rolled camshafts, forged pistons, IHI turbocharger, new exhaust manifold, carbon-fibre driveshaft, and a redesigned intake plenum.But wait, that’s not all. The engine is further aided by twin oil coolers, an improved radiator and intercooler, high-flow fuel injectors with a more forceful injection pump and a Z-tune electronic control unit. How dramatic are these modifications? Very. For starters, the heavily-revised engine is now allowed to rev up to 8,000 rpm. As for power, where the standard GT-R V-Spec’s straight-six produced 276 hp, the Z-tune yielded 493 hp along with 540 Nm of torque.In terms of performance, the Z-tune was capable of hitting the quarter-mile in just 10.06 seconds, according to Nismo. To put that into perspective, the current  will make the quarter-mile in 10.80 seconds. Other performance highlights include a 0-100 km/h time of 3.8 seconds, while the top speed is said to be well over 327 km/h.The engine isn’t the only highlight here. Nismo also completely stripped and rebuilt the car from the chassis up as part of the Z-tune transformation. Nismo engineers reinforced and stiffened the chassis seam welding in key areas, and added carbon-fibre to the strut towers and transmission tunnel and the engine bay. An upgraded suspension setup from Sachs, along with a specially designed Brembo handbrake system are also part of the upgrades.On the surface, the bodywork also gets redesigned to feature the same functional components used in Nismo’s GT500 race cars, including engine bay vents on the hoods and fenders, plus wider fenders for wider wheels. Also fitted are aggressive new bumpers and adjustable rear wing done in carbon-fibre. Completing the look are 18-inch alloys in black, Z-tune silver paintjob and new front seats.What makes the Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune so special? Well, now you know. Keep in mind that this car can essentially be declared “handmade,” given the amount of work that has gone into it. However, does the comical price tag justify a car like this? Let us know what you think in the comments below."

Here to rival the ,  and , the premium compact sedan is available in three variants. As listed below, prices, ranging from RM341k to RM582k, are OTR without insurance and inclusive of GST.The compact XE’s arrival completes Jaguar Land Rover’s sedan range, joining the  and . It is also the first model to be underpinned by JLR’s new modular architecture, featuring an aluminium-intensive monocoque which allows the XE to shed weight whilst retaining a robust structure.The car measures 4,672 mm long, 1,850 mm wide and 1,416 mm tall. Its wheelbase chimes in at 2,835 mm long. To help you put that in perspective, a F30 3 Series is 48 mm shorter, 39 mm narrower and 13 mm taller than the Jag, while giving away another 25 mm at its wheelbase.Each of the three XE variants offer different levels of power output. At its base, the XE Prestige gets a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbocharged Ford EcoBoost engine that’s rated at 200 PS at 5,500 rpm and 280 Nm of torque between 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The mill allows the XE to complete a zero to 100 km/h sprint in 7.7 seconds, and have a top speed of 237 km/h. All variants feature a ZF-sourced eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission.The mid-range XE R-Sport gets the same 1,999 cc four-pot turbo, but has its output increased to 240 PS at 5,500 rpm and 340 Nm from 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The added power equated to a quicker 6.8-second century sprint and a top speed of 250 km/h. Note that this variant has a “25t” badge at its rear which signifies the 2.0 litre engine’s higher state of tune.At the top of the range sits Jaguar’s 3.0 litre V6 twin-vortex supercharged engine, residing in the top-shelf XE S. The engine is good for 340 PS at 6,500 rpm and 450 Nm at 4,500 rpm, giving the range-topping XE a zero to 100 km/h time of 5.1 seconds, and a top speed of 250 km/h. Interestingly, the engine is also featured in the base-spec variant of the brand’s F-Type sports car.Outside, the base Prestige variant offers bi-function HID xenon headlamps with LED daytime running lights and high-intensity LED tail lamps which have been inspired by the F-Type. It gets 17-inch “Turbine” 10-spoke sparkle silver alloy wheels as standard, and has its front radiator grille in black with a chrome surround.The R-Sport variant adds slightly sportier looks, courtesy of the R-Sport body kit – this adds an R-Sport front bumper, body-coloured side sills, satin chrome side power vents and a rear spoiler. The variant also gets 18-inch “Star” five-spoke alloy wheels as standard. Note that the R-Sport pictured here is equipped with the optional 19-inch “Venom” five, twin-spoke alloys in black.The XE S is by far the most aggressive variant in the line-up. On the outside, it features enlarged air intakes on the front bumper, side sill extensions, a rear spoiler, a gloss black rear valance and brake calipers painted in red. As standard, the S gets 18-inch “Templar” five, twin-spoke alloy wheels, but optionally, buyers may specify a set of 20-inch “Propeller” alloy wheels.Inside, the three variants feature very similar equipment and features – only trim and upholstery options appear to be different between them. A three-spoke multi-function steering wheel is standard across the board, while the centre console features a rising gear selector dial.The InControl Touch infotainment system introduces an eight-inch touchscreen display with a new graphical interface. Media options range from USB and auxiliary sockets to iPod and Bluetooth connectivity.As standard, all XE variants get a basic 80-watt, four-channel, six-speaker sound system. Optionally, buyers may spec-up the audio to a 380-watt Meridian sound system, specifically designed for the XE – audio reproduction here is via a greater 12-channel, 11-speaker system.Moving towards specifics of each variant’s interior, the base Prestige 2.0 starts things off by offering Taurus leather upholstery with contrasting stitching – based on your preferred colour theme. The signature Jaguar Riva Hoop that spans across the door trim and dashboard is in brushed aluminium, while the steering wheel is wrapped in soft grain leather.The R Sport adds to the above a set of Sport Perforation seats with Taurus leather upholstery and mesh fabric inserts. The Riva Hoop and door finishers are in etched aluminium, with additional “R-Sport” badges on the steering wheel and tread plates to remind you of your RM365k purchase.The S variant’s cabin is the sportiest of them all. With suede cloth inserts on the Taurus leather seats, this variant also gets a generous serving of gloss black trim. The steering wheel and tread plates get “S” badges, and the Riva Hoop and door trim here feature a dark mesh aluminium material.There’s a decent amount of driver assistance systems in the XE. The JaguarDrive Control allows you to switch the vehicle’s performance characteristics on the fly, offering Normal, Eco, Dynamic and Winter driving modes that modify the XE’s throttle and steering characteristics.The XE is also the first Jaguar model to be offered with an electric-powered steering. Officially known as the Speed Proportional Electric Power Steering, the system claims to accurately optimise steering feel to match your demands. A Torque Vectoring by Braking system is also on deck, designed to mitigate understeer situations. Notably, only the R-Sport variant appears to feature a Sports-tuned suspension.Another world debut for the brand is its All Surface Progress Control, which gets its first application in the XE. The traction management system functions similarly to a low-speed cruise control and gives the rear-wheel driven XE better all-weather capabilities. Typically used to optimise grip in the snow, the system functions between 3.6 km/h and 30 km/h and provides maximum take-off grip in slippery conditions – not that we’ll ever be driving in snow, anytime soon.For safety, the all XE variants get on nicely with six airbags as standard. Active safety features include Hill Launch Assist, Emergency Brake Assist, Dynamic Stability Control and Traction Control.To recap, the Jaguar XE is priced from RM340k to RM580k, with three variants available. The prices include a five-year or 150,000 km warranty and three years roadside assistance. The Prestige 2.0 and R-Sport 2.0 variants come with a five-year or 80,000 km free scheduled maintenance package, while the S 3.0 variant gets the same deal under five-year or 65,000 km terms.Early buyers will also get the XE Launch Accessories kit worth RM10,000 for free. The package includes illuminated tread plates up front, aluminium red-painted paddle shifters, a specially-designed gear selector with a premium dark leather top and a rubber bezel with a soft-touch grip and unique tyre valve caps which are available in four designs.On top of this, there are also several items for buyers to add on, including a chrome front splitter (RM1,538), aluminium gearshift paddles (RM3,559), an iPad Mini holder (RM1,504) and a headrest-mounted coat hanger (RM337).

Hublot MP-05 LaFerrari Sapphire – an updated tribute,,Graham Chin,"[(u'john', u'So expensive but use swatch straps. Thats like equipping LaFerrari with tayar celup')]","Cars,Ferrari,Hybrids, EVs and Alternative Fuel,International News,Watches",2016-02-01,"Since 2013, Hublot has been paying tribute to the  hypercar. In partnership with the brand, the watchmaker has unveiled an updated version of the MP-05 model. Called the MP-05 LaFerrari Sapphire, the mechanical timepiece comes with a sapphire case (hence the name) and only 20 pieces will be made.Pieced together over a period of 18 months, the case was carved out from seven blocks of sapphire, requiring over 600 hours of work. The 3D construction of the case middle in sapphire gives off a unique setting for the movement, which can be seen from all angles and looks as though it’s “suspended in mid-air.”Within the 53.5-gramme encasing, a total of 637 components and a suspended vertical tourbillon have been carefully fitted. The seconds are shown on the transparent cylinder on the suspended tourbillon cage. As for the hours and minutes, they’re situated to the right of the barrels, while the power reserve is on the left – shown via transparent cylinders too.The mechanical art comes attached with a transparent silicon strap with a clasp that also features pieces carved out from sapphire. To get the clock ticking, the watch is wound by a mechanism that requires a miniature power drill. This concept is inspired by the tyre-changing tool in Formula 1. No prices quoted here, but seeing that the first LaFerrari MP-05 was priced at USD$300,000 (RM1.2 million) this should cost more.As for the hybrid hypercar, at the heart of it, sits a naturally-aspirated 6.3 litre V12 engine that churns 800 hp at 9,000 rpm and 700 Nm at 6,750 rpm. It’s matched to a Hybrid Kinetic Energy Recovery System () with a 163 hp electric motor. Combined, the LaFerrari churns out 950 hp and 900 Nm of torque. The engine is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission."

Some have questioned why there is a need for so many engine variants to be introduced, especially when they share close capacities. According to Proton chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa, this is to allow for variable vehicle packaging for different market needs.As a brief refresher, these are the  that are currently in Proton’s pipeline:Rashid stated the new engines utilise a modular design, whereby the 1.3 and 1.5 litre four-cylinder units use the same bore of 75 mm, but with different strokes to achieve the desired capacities. The 1.0 litre and 1.2 litre mills meanwhile, are a result of one cylinder being cut off from the above-mentioned engines. The new engines also uses  obtained earlier, ensuring lower development costs. By comparison, all six engines cost RM600 million to engineer, compared to the two CamPro engines that cost RM450 million to develop.“The engine will be for small cars, even though it’s a 1.3 litre four-cylinder, the engine is too big to be inserted into the engine room for an A-segment car, for example. That’s why we need the 1.0 or 1.2 litre three-cylinder, which is smaller to be packaged into the car. So, it’s not just about the size of the engine but the packaging consideration, that’s why they are so close in proximity in terms of capacity (1.2 and 1.3 litre) but differ in purpose,” Rashid said.“In fact, I ask this question about other OEMs as well. Why they have 1.4 and then 1.5 litre engines. I think one of the considerations by other OEMs is related to packaging as well. So, in Proton’s case, it was meant and intended for smaller car. To achieve better fuel efficiency, it’s not just about the engine, we need to make the car lighter, more aerodynamic for better fuel economy,” he added.When the Proton Saga was brought up, Rashid mentioned, “the current Saga can fit a four-cylinder engine. The  may not fit the four-cylinder engine. This means that the three-cylinder engines will only be introduced beyond the new Saga that will be introduced this year, because the new engines will only be ready by 2017.”When asked if the next Saga will be smaller to make room for the , Rashid replied saying it depends on market needs. As these engines are modular in design, it provides Proton with options to produce the appropriate engines without excessive cost. It’s also allows the flexibility to package the required powertrain. “Looking at Malaysia’s TIV, Perodua’s Axia 1.0 litre car is commanding nearly 10,000 units per month, so there is a big opportunity for Proton to participate in this area,” he added.Rashid also touched upon Proton involvement in the total value chain of automotive business, which includes operating its own casting, engine machining and assembly plants, as well as mould and die-making (via Miyazu). These early investments stretch back many years and have a role to play in Proton’s future.“Because we are a small volume player, we have to find a means on how to produce these small numbers economically. The only way to do that is by having modular engine design, so we can communalise maximum possible part and components, be it three- or four-cylinder engines,” he said."

Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport Lightweight coming?,,Graham Chin,,"Cars,International News,Volkswagen",2016-02-01,"Here’s something interesting – according to a high-ranking official, Volkswagen has built a lightweight version of the  (pictured here),  reports. While it may already be ready, sitting at the company’s facility in Germany, it seems that Volkswagen is contemplating as to whether such a sporty car should be introduced at this point in time due to the ‘’ scandal.Billed the Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport Lightweight, the front-wheel drive hatchback is claimed to be inspired by the Porsche 911 GT3 Clubsport. The model is a road-legal car that’s aimed at those who want to enter track-day events, motorkhanas and hill climbs. The model will also see the EA888 turbocharged 2.0 litre four-cylinder engine revised as well.While it’s the same mill as the standard Golf GTI Clubsport, said revisions include increased turbocharger boost pressure and a higher ignition cut-out. With this, the Lightweight version will deliver a total of 300 PS.“We’ve increased the threshold so it delivers a permanent 300 PS, which is only achieved momentarily on the overboost in the Golf GTI Clubsport,” the source said. Torque however, will stay put at 380 Nm. As for the gearbox, the hatch will come paired with either a six-speed manual or a dual-clutch automatic transmission, with an electronic differential.As for weight, the company has employed less sound deadening materials to bring the standard car’s kerb weight (1,375 kg) down. Currently, the Golf GTI Clubsport does 0-100 km/h in a matter of 5.9 seconds, it is claimed that the new version will outdo that time. Interior-wise, there will be modifications as well, including a different seat in the back.Production of the Lightweight version is still on the fence as the final verdict lays with the newly-elected supervisory board. The board is said to be apprehensive about the message that the model will send in light of the ongoing investigations. That said, the model may be unveiled at Wothersee before a final decision is made. If it does get the go-ahead though, it is said that less than 100 units will be made."

The  in the engines should also lower maintenance costs.Rashid mentioned that the new engines’ focus isn’t sports car-like high-performance. “I’m not saying superb performance, but good performance, low maintenance. Performance doesn’t necessarily mean horsepower. Performance also relates to fuel efficiency, emissions, and others as well,” he said. He also said that, like safety, there are three tiers to conducting maintenance on the engine – protection, prevention and prediction. The first tier of maintenance is the protective kind, whereby the car protects itself from further damage such as in the case of overheating. The second level, preventive, concerns routine maintenance that helps prevent engine damage altogether, such as fixed service intervals. It’s the final tier, predictive or cognitive maintenance, that Proton is looking to implement into its future vehicles – Rashid said that the company is future-proofing the new engines to be able to adopt Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). With this method, the car will analyse its actual condition to determine when to change the engine oil, rather than relying on fixed cycles.Rashid gave an example of stop-start driving, which can shorten the interval between oil changes, as the engine will continue to run even though the car spends less time moving. The technology has already been implemented by companies such as BMW, and Rashid said Proton wants to bring this level of maintenance to the masses."

The second-gen notably offered a fax machine, an integrated telephone and even a wine cooler as optional equipment – imagine that, in 1986. The E32 is also known to be the first vehicle that featured a 12-cylinder engine in the post-war era.The third-gen E38 7 Series cleared a path for itself by being the first to emphasise rear-seat luxuries as much as driving dynamics. Satellite navigation and an onboard television were included as optionally available items, but not forgetting an Alpina sports suspension and Dynamic Stability Control too. The E38 also famously starred in movies like The Transporter and James Bond’s Tomorrow Never Dies.And then came the Bangle-era 7er, the E65. Popularly known for its “Bangle Butt,” the fourth-gen 7 Series’ design faced tough criticism. The  even included the model in its list of “50 Worst Cars of All Time.” Even still, it was one of the most technologically advanced BMW vehicles of its time, introducing items such as Active Roll Stabilisation, a self-levelling air suspension, the world’s first application of electronic adaptive headlights and more.The F01/F02 BMW 7 Series arrived in 2008, and needless to say, design critics were a lot easier on the fifth-gen model. The list of “firsts” for this 7er included having its entire line-up powered by turbocharged engines (bar minority markets’ availability of N/A engines, like our 730Li), having an eight-speed auto transmission and being the first 7er to feature an electric motor (ActiveHybrid7).The F01/F02 was also the first BMW model to feature the “F” designation in its codename, and now, the sixth-gen model repeats this honour by being the first model to feature the “G” designation. Which leaves us at today, where we find ourselves at the launch of the G11/G12 BMW 7 Series. And just in case you’ve missed it, ."

An agreement has been reached between both companies, where a unified strategy for the small car segment will be employed for the purpose of developing better cars. In addition to that, the share exchange is set to add more value to both brands. With the shared strategy, it will enable both Toyota and Daihatsu to overcome obstacles that they may face in the future. This includes resource-intensive activities like the development of next-generation technologies and the entry into business areas that have growth potential.In detail, the agreement will see Toyota and Daihatsu combine their base of operations, which will have them share expertise in various areas. In turn, this will allow for the two entities to develop more appealing products that are competitive on a global scale. Three key areas have been underlined, the first, being small cars. Here, Daihatsu will lead in developing products offered within the small car lineup of both brands. It will continue to maintain its focus on developing vehicles where the brand already has a strong presence. On top of that, it will sharpen its expertise and processes related to product planning and tech development for mini vehicles.The second area, will be technology. Both will share development and deployment strategies for new technology from early stages. Toyota will focus on technologies associated with the environment, safety, user experience and comfort. Daihatsu, on the other hand, will turn technologies into packages and will lead the development of cost and fuel efficient technology. Further to that, Daihatsu will contribute to the development of next-gen tech with a focus on cost-efficiency and down-scaling said tech. Manufacturing expertise will be shared amongst the Toyota group with the aim of achieving better cost competitiveness of larger vehicles.The third area, will have both companies utilising each other’s base of operations in developing markets. Daihatsu will lead in elevating efficiency as well as adaptability in development, procurement and production. Across Japan, Toyota’s sales expertise and infrastructure will be shared by both to strengthen Daihatsu’s branding and profitability at that.“This is an opportunity for us both to stop feeling that we need to go it alone and trust each other to take full advantage of our respective strengths. In other words, we can now focus on our core competencies. That, I believe is the key to achieving and sustaining global competitiveness,” said Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota.“I believe we have now found a course of action that will enable us to continue our growth for the next 100 years. We see this as the perfect opportunity to cement our relationship with Toyota and, by doing so, to embark on a new period of growth and to elevate the Daihatsu brand to a global standard,” said Masanori Mitsui, president of Daihatsu."

We’re aware of those of you who have been clamouring for Proton to use a timing chain for the longest time, but what is exactly so great about it, and why only now?The reason why it has taken so long, according to Proton’s chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa, is that Mitsubishi – which Proton had learned how to design and build engines from – had used timing belts for its engines until a few years ago, and as such, Proton followed suit as well. But Rashid admitted that market demands and technology trends have influenced the company to do the switch.As for the advantages, Rashid said that they were as much about actual reliability and serviceability – timing chains tend to last the life of the engine with very little maintenance – as the perception of reliability. He added that the public has been very critical of Proton for certain decisions, like continuing to use timing belts – even though other brands use it too – and that the company needed to do things perfectly under the scrutiny of the public eye."

SPIED: Next Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe spotted,,Gerard Lye,"[(u'weee', u'Is it me or the shape of the deck lid looks a lot like the E63/64 6 series')]","Cars,International News,Mercedes-Benz,Spyshots",2016-01-29,"Now that the , it’s time to turn our attention to the other body styles that are expected to join the sedan in the model’s line-up. This time, it is the coupe version of the W213, which our spy photographers managed to capture as it undergoes winter testing.As you can tell, Mercedes-Benz has gone to great lengths to wrap the entire car in heavy camo, as well as adding on false body panels to ensure no design element of the coupe is revealed prematurely. Based on what we can see on the test mule, the new E-Class Coupe appears to feature the same hood design as found on the sedan, and will most likely carry over the same front end with minor revisions to project its more sporty persona. Along the side, the coupe element is clearly apparent with a raked roofline that starts from the B-pillars and continues on to the rear of the vehicle. Based on these images, the E-Class Coupe does appear to have a smaller window area as a result.The roofline extends towards what looks to be a spoiler element, although given the amount of camo, and how awkward-looking the fixture is, we reckon it will be reworked for the final production version.At the rear, a small part of the W213’s tail lights can be seen, but it is uncertain if they have been revised in terms of size to accommodate the reworked roofline of the vehicle. The same can be said of the tailgate as well, though it appears unchanged from the sedan.As for the other elements that weren’t covered up, the E-Class Coupe retains the same side mirror design found on the sedan with built-in indicators. The blacked-out roof also appears to mask a sunroof based on what we see.At the time of its reveal, the W213 E-Class was offered with just two engines – one diesel and one petrol, with more to be introduced in the future. Both 2.0 litre mills are paired to the latest 9G-Tronic torque converter automatic transmission. The coupe E-Class is expected to follow suit as well."

A number of Proton owners reported on social media not too long ago regarding an issue with the engine’s oil cooler hose, which broke prematurely.He said, “oil cooler hoses are subject to high temperature and humidity, but sometimes the failure is not because of the cycle (mileage). For rubber materials, it’s normally because of time and life. Like tyres, even though the threads is still present, after two years, cracks may appear on the tyre surface because the rubber has degraded.”“In our service manual – I believe other OEMs also mention – rubber parts are not subject to cycle (wear) only. Normally we do our testing of 100,000 km cycles, and subject the part to a certain number of cycles. Rubber parts are definitely not just affected by cycle, but by time (as well),” Rashid said.“Proton is addressing the issue. Consumers are advised not to change or modify the component on their own. Please come back to us, get original parts from us. Custom jobs can void the car’s warranty,” he added. The custom job referred to in this case is the use of braided metal hoses to replace the original rubber items on the oil cooler unit.On its official Facebook page, Proton has officially acknowledged the issue, and said that it’s currently working on a fix. Stay tuned to  for updates on this matter."

He admitted that the company was late in introducing variable valve timing (VVT) technology – which only came onto the market with the  at the tail end of 2014 – but added that the company is catching up to established players.As was revealed during the official announcement, the new engines are modular, with commonalities both in design and the components used. The 1.3 litre and 1.5 litre GDI and TGDI engines are four-cylinder engines, sharing an identical bore but differing stroke measurements; the 1.0 litre and 1.2 litre VVT engines are three-cylinder versions of those four-pot mills.The engines feature a higher compression ratio of 12:1 on GDI engines and 10.5:1 on the TGDI engines – these compare favourably to 10:1 on the Iriz’s VVT engines and 8.9:1 on the 1.6 litre CamPro CFE/Turbo engine. Also incorporated is a split engine cooling system that enables the cylinder head and block at different temperatures for optimised efficiency. On TGDI engines, a single-scroll turbocharger is used, with the most powerful 1.5 litre TGDI projected to be capable of producing 180 hp and 250 Nm.Elsewhere, the fuel injectors on the GDI and TGDI engines are capable of spraying fuel at 200 bars of pressure, compared to just 2-3 bars in a standard port injection system. The technology used on the new GDI engines are based on the  when it  in 2012, some of which are shared with development partner Ricardo.The engines are also designed to be future-proof, with features like cylinder deactivation (using a collapsible roller finger follower), mild hybrid operation (through the use of a belt starter-generator), a Miller cycle and spray-guided direct fuel injection able to be added on.The workings of a Miller cycle engine would require a separate article to be explained fully – but essentially, in such an engine, the intake valve is left opened for part of the compression stroke, which pushes some of the air/fuel mixture back into the intake port. This reduces the effort required to compress the remaining mixture, aiding efficiency.On the other hand, spray-guided direct injection, which uses injectors mounted at the top of the combustion chamber to spray fuel downwards – rather than from the side against a walled chamber in the piston in traditional systems – results in improved fuel efficiency. The aim, according to Rashid, is for the engines to eventually achieve a thermal efficiency of almost 40% – the same as on the newest hybrids like the  and .Rashid said that while Proton isn’t a technology leader, it wants to bring these technologies down towards a more affordable level – as it has done in terms of safety. “The technologies aren’t cheap, but we are contributing significantly in making them more affordable,” he said."

The updated app is said to be lighter and provide even faster access to ride bookings.“The updated Grab app is about improving the core experience – we want to make it as simple as two clicks to book a ride,”  said Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling. She explained that pick-up and drop-off points will now be pre-filled based on a user’s favourite places. Preferred locations will be ranked by the day, time and users’ physical location, which will enable bookings to be made faster.She also said that the registration process for new users had been simplified. Android users can now sign up more quickly for Grab using their Facebook profile – the app will automatically confirm the user’s identity and mobile phone number. The feature will be rolled out to iOS in the near future.Other enhancements include a better estimation of pick-up times in the app’s live driver tracking function. With real-time driver tracking on the map, users can better estimate the arrival time of their driver. The app also has an “auto-retry” feature, which minimises repeated booking attempts if a passenger does not get a vehicle within the first attempt, without having to manually go through the booking process again.A feature called Flash has also been introduced  – now, with the touch of just one button, Flash searches all of the closest taxis and GrabCars to find the best vehicle for users across both services, meaning there will be more choices available to consumers at any single time.

Offenders can be fined up to 20 times the value of the vehicles or face three years’ jail, or both, upon conviction.In a move to curb such abuse, Labuan Customs and the Road Transport department (JPJ) introduced the e-Vehicle system to monitor the movement on Labuan-registered vehicles, targetting those with unpaid summonses, compounds, taxes and duties, and those which exceeded the 90-day mainland visit."

Munich’s limo and flagship saloon, now in its sixth generation (check out this nice ), will provide competition to the , ,  and . The G11 (we only get the long-wheelbase variant, so it’s G12 technically) is available here in 730Li and 740Li forms.The long-wheelbase 7 Series has a larger footrpint than before, at 5,238 mm long (+19 mm), 1,902 mm wide (unchanged) and 1,479 mm tall, with a 3,210 mm wheelbase (also unchanged). To compare, the LWB W222 S-Class is 5,246 mm long and 1,899 mm wide, with a 3,165 mm wheelbase. So, the BMW is 8 mm shorter overall, but has a 45 mm longer wheelbase than the Merc.While it might not look worlds apart from its predecessor, the new 7 Series is all-new and high-tech underneath. BMW’s Carbon Core construction – with tech gleaned from  development – utilises a combination of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), magnesium, aluminium and steel, resulting in increased strength and rigidity of the passenger cell  weight savings of up to 130 kg compared to the F01. Core aside, the use of aluminium for the doors and (for the first time) the bootlid also contributed to the weight loss. BMW says that unsprung mass has been cut by 15%, centre of gravity made lower and 50:50 weight distribution maintained. The 740Li is powered by a 3.0 litre inline-six engine with 326 hp from 5,500 to 6,500 rpm; and 450 Nm of torque from 1,380 to 5,000 rpm. The B58 twin-scroll turbo unit is from a new engine family and its crankcase, cylinder head and oil sump are all made from aluminium. The turbo features an indirect system of charge air cooling that is incorporated into the intake manifold, and this water-to-air intercooler provides a shorter route for the air. BMW claims better efficiency and response than the old N55 motor, which has 320 hp/450 Nm.Paired to a ZF eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission with Steptronic, the 740Li is capable of 0-100 km/h in a swift 5.6 seconds, on to a limited top speed of 250 km/h. Claimed combined fuel consumption is 6.6 litres per 100 km.The  is powered by a hero of a downsized motor, a 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder tasked to haul a big limo. This entry-level petrol engine for the 7 Series puts out 258 hp from 5,000 to 6,500 rpm; and 400 Nm of torque from 1,550 to 4,400 rpm. The B48 is a relatively new engine and has been seen in the , BMW / sisters and , but we’re seeing the most powerful version of it in the G11. Using an eight-speed auto, performance is far from shabby, with the benchmark 0-100 km/h sprint taking just 6.3 seconds. Top speed is at the regular 250 km/h mark, while fuel consumption is rated at 5.8 litres per 100 km, 0.8 l/100 km better than the 740Li. Not sold here, the  also uses this engine, but with an electric motor and lithium-ion battery in the mix., but the big cat’s 240 PS, 340 Nm and 7.5 seconds pale in comparison. Also weaker is the outgoing 730Li – powered by a NA 3.0 litre six-pot, it does 258 hp, 310 Nm and 7.5 seconds. No reason to fear downsizing, then.Both variants ride on air suspension (both axles) and 19-inch alloys (different styles) with 245/45 front tyres and fatter 275/40 rear ones. There’s also Dynamic Damper Control, and the 740Li adds on a new Executive Drive Pro “active chassis” system with electromechanical active roll stabilisation. The fancy  with LCD colour display and touch control panel (one can turn on the lights, open/close the windows, check fuel level and schedule the climate control, among other things, Remote Control Parking not available here) is standard across the board, as is the Design Pure Excellence package, which is basically an exterior chrome trim pack.Also standard are a four-zone auto air con, head-up display, Surround View, Welcome Light Carpet,  (Intelligent Emergency Call, Teleservices, Concierge Services and Remote Services), BMW Gesture Control for the infotainment system, Navigation System Professional with 10.25-inch touch display and HDD, plus a rear seat entertainment system with two 10-inch screens. The latter is controlled via the BMW Touch Command seven-inch tablet housed in the rear centre console. The removable tablet is made by Samsung.Speaking of rear seats, the big shots at the back can enjoy eight massage programmes including the Vitality programme, which allows one to engage in active physical exercise for recuperation purposes. Comfort seats at the back for 730Li, front and back for 740Li. Note that right-hand drive cars do not get the Executive Lounge Seating option featured in our  story until the second half of 2016. Both variants get a panorama glass roof, but only 740Li occupants get to enjoy the “Sky Lounge”. When it gets dark, the light emitted from side-mounted LED modules is directed evenly onto the glass surface, where it hits an imprinted graphic for a starry sky effect. Also exclusive to the 740Li is a 600w Harman Kardon sound system with nine channels with 16 speakers. The 730Li comes with a 205w “HiFi” system with 12 speakers. Not available here is the 7er range topping 1400w Bowers & Wilkins Diamond audio with 10-channel amp and 16 speakers.The 740Li also gets BMW Laserlight headlamps, which can be identified by a central blue-tinted horizontal bar. These top shelf items have a range of 600 metres in high-beam mode – twice the range of the LED headlights of the 730Li.The 730Li receives BMW Driving Assistant, a safety pack that includes Approach Control and Person Warning with light city braking, rear collision prevention, lane change and lane departure warning and rear cross traffic warning. BMW Driving Assistant Plus on the 740Li adds on stereo cameras and a radar for steering and lane control assist, lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection, traffic jam assistant for semi-autonomous driving, front/rear rear cross traffic assist, and Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go. Eight airbags are standard. Trim wise, the 740Li is lined with Nappa leather with diamond-pattern stitching and Poplar Grain Grey wood trim, with real leather dash top wrap, while the 730Li makes do with Dakota leather and Fineline wood. Both leather types can be had in Black, Canberra Beige or Cognac.We finally come to the price, which starts from  OTR without insurance for the 730Li and  for the 740Li. Decent pricing by BMW Group Malaysia for CBU imports (the  benefits from CKD hybrid tax exemptions), but the figures quoted are “exclusive prices” in conjunction with BMW’s 100-year anniversary, valid until further notice or while stocks last. Add RM100k to both numbers for the regular RRP (RM698,888 and RM888,800 respectively)."

So short answer is, it shud not run with E2M RON95, but can run with E4 RON95.')]","Cars,Local News,Proton",2016-01-29,"Proton’s recent announcement of its new  is certainly a statement of intent for the national carmaker. While the engines’ technical specifications and performance certainly does hold a lot of promise, it is also dependant on the type of fuel that goes into the combustion chamber. So the question is, will the current fuel grades in Malaysia be compatible with Proton’s upcoming engines?Gasoline (petrol) direct injection technology is generally more sensitive towards fuel quality. The use of lower-quality, higher sulphur fuels will pollute the more advanced catalytic converters used on newer GDI engines – required as modern lean-burning direct-injection engines inherently produce higher nitrous oxide (NOx) pollutants – which will “poison” them, rendering them useless.In Malaysia, consumers have access to three separate types of petrol – Euro 2M RON 95,  and . With a large majority of Malaysians preferring the more affordable of the bunch – Euro 2M RON 95 – will its usage have any adverse implications on Proton’s new engines? According to Proton’s chief technology officer Abdul Rashid Musa, who spoke exclusively to , the short answer is no – Euro 2M RON 95 fuel will work fine with its new engines.Proton is also in continued discussions with its development partner, Ricardo on the RON requirements for the engine in different markets. Given that Proton’s GDI/TGDI engines are Euro 6c-compliant, exporting their cars is certainly part of their plans.Rashid added that in some markets with even lower fuel quality, the company will continue using the current VVT engines. “That’s why we’re still maintaining our VVT engine,” he said. “Even some markets in the Middle East are still using RON 82.”“Markets are so diverse. Developing countries might not have that quality of fuel so we might not be able to put a high technology engine in that market – even in Malaysia as well. But currently, our engines can go as low as RON 88, and up to RON 105,” he added.In conclusion, should you be worried? Well, no. Apart from the fact that the engines are capable of running Euro 2M RON 95, the first production application of the new engines is only slated to come into the market in 2018, while Euro 4 RON 95 is gazetted to go on sale in Malaysia from October 2018. Therefore, the new engines shouldn’t be an issue to consumers."

"MyTeksi and GrabTaxi rebranded, now known as Grab",,Anthony Lim,"[(u'john', u'PT, no post on ongoing French taximen protest kah? Their demo level can even put Bersih to shame.')]","International News,Local News,Public Transport",2016-01-28,"– which is known regionally as GrabTaxi – has been rebranded, and is now known as Grab. The unveiling of the new name was made today in Singapore, where it was also announced that all of the company’s services will simply be known as Grab.Essentially, its core services, namely taxis (GrabTaxi), private car services (GrabCar), motorcycle taxis (GrabBike), social carpooling (GrabHitch) and last mile delivery (GrabExpress) will now operate under one umbrella brand.The rebranding exercise also saw the introduction of a new logo, which the company says has been designed with freedom at its core. Design-wise, the dual lines are apparently inspired by roadways, and represent the endless road of possibilities.“We’ve grown over the years, and we’re now much more than a taxi app. This new brand is an important evolution that represents our goal to outserve our customers. We are not only providing passengers with a transport service, we are saving them time and ensuring they have a safe ride,” said Grab’s co-founder Anthony Tan, who is also the group CEO.“Grab aims to make transportation accessible to everyone in Southeast Asia. We have set the benchmark in the industry, with the most number of transport services that cater to all price points, all available in one app. We have something for everyone, and are committed to delivering the best possible user experience,” he added.The company said that since its , it has evolved from a humble taxi-booking app to Southeast Asia’s largest land transport company. As of 2015, notable stats include 200,000 drivers, with its range of services available in 28 cities over six countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam).The company also said it had 1.5 million app bookings a day last year, and its app had been downloaded on to 11 million mobile devices around the region. In terms of market penetration, Grab said it had 95% market share in terms of third-party taxi-hailing apps as well as more than 50% of the market share in the private car segment, covered by GrabCar.Since mid-2015, the company said it has experienced a 35% average monthly growth in GrabCar rides and a 75% average monthly growth in GrabBike rides across the region.Last December, Grab had announced that it had  with China-based Didi Kuaidi, India-based Ola and United States-based Lyft apps, where these services will collaborate to collectively cover “nearly all of South East Asia, India, China and the US,” with joint partner products rolling out early next year.To usher in the rebranding, the company will be holding a Grab Freedom Day this week in the capital cities of the six countries it operates in. During this event, over a hundred Grabbers – including the management team across the region – will spend a day as Grab drivers. Passengers who book vehicles driven by Grabbers will ride for free, and the value of the ride will be donated to charities across the region.  In Malaysia, the beneficiary is Persatuan Mobility Selangor dan Kuala Lumpur (Mobility Association of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur), where the main objective is to operate a “door-to-door” transport service for wheelchair users. In KL, Grab Freedom Day will take place on January 30."

The newcomers – the Custom Vehicle Operations (CVO) Pro Street Breakout and Low Rider S – are aimed at the young urban rider, and a sign that HD is serious about consolidating its share of the US large-displacement motorcycle market – currently at almost 50%.Featuring a muscular stance patterned after drag racers, the limited edition CVO Pro Street Breakout features a new, darker look with twin-disc front brakes and custom paintwork. The inverted forks add to the brawny look, and the 240 mm width rear tyre reinforces the drag bike ethos.Both motorcycles use the Twin Cam 110 engine which displaces 1,801 cc. In the case of the 2016 Low Rider S, the engine is mated with a Screamin’ Eagle Heavy Breather performance intake and Fat Bob-style two-into-two exhaust that lets the V-twin mill put out 156 Nm of torque at 3,500 rpm. This makes the Low Rider S the most powerful non-CVO motorcycle HD has produced. This trimmed-down cruiser also features premium suspension and brakes as part of its performance package.

While we know that the new name draws upon the , but how do you illustrate that importance? Well, a couple of videos should address that question.In essence, the 718 moniker dates back to the year 1957, when turbocharged flat-four engines won the brand many races – including the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Targa Florio. The glory years of the Porsche 718s continued on into the 1960s and that’s how it all came about. Of course, the biggest change would be the swapping of the  to turbocharged four-cylinder units. In the new 718 Boxster sits a turbocharged 2.0 litre flat-four mill that makes 300 hp and 380 Nm. The 718 Boxster S, gets a turbocharged 2.5 litre flat-four that produces 350 hp and 420 Nm. Top speed is 275 km/h for the Boxster and 285 km/h for the S.Both engines are mated to a six-speed manual gearbox, while a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transmission can be had as an optional extra. Also detailed in the video, the Boxster with with the PDK and launch control (Sport Chrono package) does 0-100 km/h in 4.7 seconds, 0.8 seconds faster than before. The Boxster S with the same mechanical items does it in 4.2 seconds (0.6 seconds faster)."

That said, the construction needed to be carried out nonetheless as the council wanted to complete the project as soon as possible.A new system has been implemented where patrols will be conducted every two days, to look out for any potholes, according to Ismail Shafie, engineering department director of MBPJ. He noted that traffic congestion could not be avoided due to the project.Illegally parked vehicles are also partly responsible for the traffic congestion.“There are many buses and cars parked illegally along the stretch of these projects that are also contributing to the traffic problem,” Ismail said.To assist pedestrians, the council will create temporary walkways along paths currently under construction. “There are six pedestrian crossings at traffic lights and three pedestrian bridges that can be used to cross the road,” Ismail said, adding that temporary lights are also in place as well."

Here to rival the ,  and , the premium compact sedan is available in three variants. As listed below, prices, ranging from RM341k to RM582k, are OTR without insurance and inclusive of GST.The compact XE’s arrival completes Jaguar Land Rover’s sedan range, joining the  and . It is also the first model to be underpinned by JLR’s new modular architecture, featuring an aluminium-intensive monocoque which allows the XE to shed weight whilst retaining a robust structure.The car measures 4,672 mm long, 1,850 mm wide and 1,416 mm tall. Its wheelbase chimes in at 2,835 mm long. To help you put that in perspective, a F30 3 Series is 48 mm shorter, 39 mm narrower and 13 mm taller than the Jag, while giving away another 25 mm at its wheelbase.Each of the three XE variants offer different levels of power output. At its base, the XE Prestige gets a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbocharged Ford EcoBoost engine that’s rated at 200 PS at 5,500 rpm and 280 Nm of torque between 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The mill allows the XE to complete a zero to 100 km/h sprint in 7.7 seconds, and have a top speed of 237 km/h. All variants feature a ZF-sourced eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission.The mid-range XE R-Sport gets the same 1,999 cc four-pot turbo, but has its output increased to 240 PS at 5,500 rpm and 340 Nm from 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The added power equated to a quicker 6.8-second century sprint and a top speed of 250 km/h. Note that this variant has a “25t” badge at its rear which signifies the 2.0 litre engine’s higher state of tune.At the top of the range sits Jaguar’s 3.0 litre V6 twin-vortex supercharged engine, residing in the top-shelf XE S. The engine is good for 340 PS at 6,500 rpm and 450 Nm at 4,500 rpm, giving the range-topping XE a zero to 100 km/h time of 5.1 seconds, and a top speed of 250 km/h. Interestingly, the engine is also featured in the base-spec variant of the brand’s F-Type sports car.Outside, the base Prestige variant offers bi-function HID xenon headlamps with LED daytime running lights and high-intensity LED tail lamps which have been inspired by the F-Type. It gets 17-inch “Turbine” 10-spoke sparkle silver alloy wheels as standard, and has its front radiator grille in black with a chrome surround.The R-Sport variant adds slightly sportier looks, courtesy of the R-Sport body kit – this adds an R-Sport front bumper, body-coloured side sills, satin chrome side power vents and a rear spoiler. The variant also gets 18-inch “Star” five-spoke alloy wheels as standard. Note that the R-Sport pictured here is equipped with the optional 19-inch “Venom” five, twin-spoke alloys in black.The XE S is by far the most aggressive variant in the line-up. On the outside, it features enlarged air intakes on the front bumper, side sill extensions, a rear spoiler, a gloss black rear valance and brake calipers painted in red. As standard, the S gets 18-inch “Templar” five, twin-spoke alloy wheels, but optionally, buyers may specify a set of 20-inch “Propeller” alloy wheels.Inside, the three variants feature very similar equipment and features – only trim and upholstery options appear to be different between them. A three-spoke multi-function steering wheel is standard across the board, while the centre console features a rising gear selector dial.The InControl Touch infotainment system introduces an eight-inch touchscreen display with a new graphical interface. Media options range from USB and auxiliary sockets to iPod and Bluetooth connectivity.As standard, all XE variants get a basic 80-watt, four-channel, six-speaker sound system. Optionally, buyers may spec-up the audio to a 380-watt Meridian sound system, specifically designed for the XE – audio reproduction here is via a greater 12-channel, 11-speaker system.Moving towards specifics of each variant’s interior, the base Prestige 2.0 starts things off by offering Taurus leather upholstery with contrasting stitching – based on your preferred colour theme. The signature Jaguar Riva Hoop that spans across the door trim and dashboard is in brushed aluminium, while the steering wheel is wrapped in soft grain leather.The R Sport adds to the above a set of Sport Perforation seats with Taurus leather upholstery and mesh fabric inserts. The Riva Hoop and door finishers are in etched aluminium, with additional “R-Sport” badges on the steering wheel and tread plates to remind you of your RM365k purchase.The S variant’s cabin is the sportiest of them all. With suede cloth inserts on the Taurus leather seats, this variant also gets a generous serving of gloss black trim. The steering wheel and tread plates get “S” badges, and the Riva Hoop and door trim here feature a dark mesh aluminium material.There’s a decent amount of driver assistance systems in the XE. The JaguarDrive Control allows you to switch the vehicle’s performance characteristics on the fly, offering Normal, Eco, Dynamic and Winter driving modes that modify the XE’s throttle and steering characteristics.The XE is also the first Jaguar model to be offered with an electric-powered steering. Officially known as the Speed Proportional Electric Power Steering, the system claims to accurately optimise steering feel to match your demands. A Torque Vectoring by Braking system is also on deck, designed to mitigate understeer situations. Notably, only the R-Sport variant appears to feature a Sports-tuned suspension.Another world debut for the brand is its All Surface Progress Control, which gets its first application in the XE. The traction management system functions similarly to a low-speed cruise control and gives the rear-wheel driven XE better all-weather capabilities.

"Alfa Romeo confirms product rollout delay till 2020, drops ambitious 400,000 volume target",,Danny Tan,,"Alfa Romeo,Cars,International News",2016-01-28,"to little surprise, it is now confirmed that Alfa Romeo’s business plan will take two years longer than planned to complete. An ambitious-sounding volume target has also been dropped,  reports. According to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ revised plan for Alfa Romeo, the Italian brand will still launch eight new models including the Giulia, but instead of now till 2018, the time frame has been extended to 2020. So it’s eight new models from now until 2020.The original plan was for global Alfa Romeo sales to reach , but FCA’s new plan has no volume indications for Alfa and Fiat Chrysler as a whole. In a presentation on FCA’s website, the company said that its commitment to Alfa’s overall brand and product strategy “remains in place.” Alfa’s 2015 global sales are expected to be 65,000.In line with the current economic climate, the revised Alfa plan will focus mainly on Europe and , with reduced expectations for China where the premium car market is slowing down along with the general economy. The original forecast had annual Alfa sales in North America and Europe at 150,000 units each by 2018. China was expected to contribute 80,000 to the total despite Alfa not having any history in the Middle Kingdom.What’s going on with the Giulia, you ask. Alfa has delayed the launch of the BMW 3 Series-rival due to technical problems. The high-performance , unveiled to much fanfare in June 2015, was due to launch in Europe by the end of last year to kickstart things, but the muscular sedan is now expected to reach European showrooms in June. The  tasked to bring in the numbers is set to make an appearance in Geneva in March, but it is not yet clear when it will arrive in dealerships. FCA boss Sergio Marchionne has gone on record to say that Giulia production will begin in this quarter.FCA’s latest business plan also touches on the other planned models. , which will be based on the Giulia, will launch in Europe by late 2016 or early 2017. US launches for the Giulia and “Giulia SUV” will follow the European debuts by three to six months. Other cars in the plan are not so high on the priority list and will not appear until between 2017 and 2020, according to the new plan. They are a full-size sedan, two crossovers/SUVs, two  and a hatchback. No , thankfully.Will this new plan hold firm? Alfa fans and well-wishers would by now have learned to not raise expectations. As for me, I’ll believe it when I see it in showrooms."

We will launch it in a few more months,” Mudzhar said. The second-generation Jaguar XF was globally revealed nearly a year ago. The new model’s styling is heavily inspired by the smaller XE, which it also shares a common architecture with.When quizzed about the new , Mudzhar claimed, “it is coming, yes. But not as soon as we would like. We should have it ready by early next year.” Only just making its global debut last September at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, the managing director explained that it’s just a matter of formalities, but a launch in the first quarter of 2017 would be realistic.Like the XF and XE that was just launched here, the F-Pace will be fully-imported (CBU) from the UK. There, prices for the F-Pace start from 34,170 pounds (RM210k) for the very base-spec, 180 PS, 2.0 litre RWD diesel variant. The new XF’s prices start from 32,300 pounds (RM195k) for the 163 PS, 2.0 RWD diesel.Considering the high prices of the brand’s XE range, we asked the managing director if local assembly would ever be on the cards for JLRM. He said, “It depends on our principal. It’s their decision. There has been some discussion, but we don’t know what the outcome will be yet. Generally, we should and would definitely like to have locally assembled models – that would make us a lot more competitive. But, we need the volume to come in first.”"

Touring mode sets the suspension on medium for comfortable, long-distance riding, even when two-up. All 160 hp is allowed out, and ABS and suspension is set to medium and firm, respectively, for balanced braking and safety.In Sport mode, the power level is the same as Touring, but the suspension is set to firm, while ABS is set to medium-soft.  In Enduro and Urban modes, the suspension is set to soft for maximum comfort and ability to follow rough terrain. In Urban mode, the suspension and ABS get dialled up to the highest setting, while Enduro sets them on the opposite end of the dial.Also show-cased is the ergonomic riding position of the Multistrada 1200 Enduro, along with the frame mounted skid-plate, high-level exit exhaust to prevent water ingress and high-bend handlebars for maximum rider control.The Multistrada 1200 Enduro is expected to arrive in Malaysia in February or March 2016, and is estimated to retail between RM140,000 and RM150,000.

To this end, Bosch is pushing forward its next-generation ABS10 braking system, a hub-mounted electric motor for e-scooters and a slew of electronic riding aids for motorcycles.Some studies have suggested that the global motorcycle market will expand by 160 million units a year till 2021, and 90% of those bikes are expected to be produced in Asia. Called the Two-Wheeler and Powersports division, the company is based in Yokohama, Japan, with branches in the US, Europe, India and China.“Bosch technology for more efficiency and safety should be part of any car and in the future the same will go for motorcycles,” said Bosch management board member Dr. Dirk Hoheisel. “We are aiming to become a leading supplier in the motorcycle market, too. The portion of the market relevant for Bosch which covers driving safety systems, powertrain technology and infotainment systems will double over the next five years.”Setting the pace with a proposed 2016 introduction is the ABS10, complemented by the MM5.10 inertial measurement unit, its famed Motronic engine management system and other sensors. Safety aids such as Side View Assist and Vehicle Hold Control are also on offer, all in an effort to make motorcycles safe and controllable under various road conditions.The ABS10 is not meant to supplant Bosch’s previous generation ABS9, but to complement it. The ABS10 system was developed for bikes up to 250 cc, being 30% lighter and 45% smaller. It is offered in front wheel only and two-wheel (front and rear) versions. An eye was kept on costs during development, especially important for developing countries where the cost of safety can be prohibitive to potential buyers.Another intriguing development from Bosch is the wheel hub motor, an electric powertrain offered exclusively in the China market. It can be used in most twist-and-go scooters and mopeds by simply substituting the conventional rear wheel.Producing just 2.4 hp, it has an electronically controlled boost function that should provide lively take-offs. The eScooter motor is equipped with a controller module that can be programmed with specific functions such as detecting whether the seat is occupied, before activating the electric motor."

Opel/Vauxhaull GT Concept – minimalist MX-5 rival,,Graham Chin,"[(u'shawal', u'They should build it\u2026')]","Cars,International News,Opel,Vauxhall",2016-01-27,"Vauxhall and Opel are bringing out the avant-garde GT Concept, which will debut at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The minimalistic concept is inspired by many motor vehicles, such as the 1966 Vauxhall XVR and 1965 Opel Experimental GT. Apart from that, it’s an evolution of the  that was first seen in 2013. The GT Concept appears to be a  rival seeing that it weighs less than 1,000 kg and a similar front-mid engine, rear-wheel drive layout. The lightweight GT Concept is designed by British designer Mark Adam and it showcases his philosophy of ‘Sculptural Artistry meets Technical Precision.’ Its name comes from the 1964 GT Concept, produced by the Vauxhall Design and Engineering Centre in Luton.Exterior design of the GT Concept is described as “pure, minimalistic, yet bold and uncompromising” –  like the vehicles that it draws its inspiration from. As for the red strip that streams across the car, the brand says that it’s a signature line that “splits the vehicle body horizontally and proportions it.” The windscreen flows towards the top, acting as a glass panorama roof as well. Those red Hankook rubbers are wrapped around rims with a ‘roller-skate’ design. It’s a reference to the 1920 Opel Motoclub 500, which had red-coloured tyres too. The long bonnet, central dual exhausts and lack of a boot lid is shared with both the Vauxhall XVR and the Opel Experimental GT Concept’s design. To add to that, the exterior has some pretty smart features as well.These include integrated headlamps and indicators that’s based on Vauxhall/Opel’s IntelliLux LED matrix lighting. Utilising “ultra-modern” projection tech, the headlamps have a 3D beam that provides for glare-free high beam driving. Down the back, the rear lamps are in a three-dimensional design, the company says. As for the doors, they’re electric, with integrated windows that appears as a “seamless transition from glass to painted surfaces.”The doors are opened by pressing a touchpad integrated into the red line on the roof. Employing patented mountings, they open into the front arches and allows for wide opening angles in tight parking spaces. There are no exterior mirrors too, as two cameras behind the wheel arches are in their places. Said to allow for better visibility during urban drives, images are transmitted to two monitors on the left and right sides of the cabin.As for power, the GT Concept features a front-mid engine configuration to keep the centre of gravity low. Underneath the hood is an all-aluminium turbocharged 1.0 litre three cylinder engine that makes 145 PS and 205 Nm of torque. A six-speed sequential transmission operable via paddle shifters, sends power to the rear wheels. It will sprint from 0-100 km less than eight seconds and it has a top speed of 215 km/h."

Unlike here in Malaysia, the Thai-spec  Altis is not available with the 3ZR-FE 2.0 litre Dual VVT-i four-cylinder petrol engine (145 PS, 187 Nm). Instead buyers there have the option of either a 1.6 litre or 1.8 litre four-cylinder Dual VVT-i petrol engine.

On the other hand, the ESport Nurburgring Edition gets a completely new body kit that is less aggressive but curvier than the one fitted on the standard ESport. The body kit is accompanied by sporty 17-inch wheels and Nurburgring Edition badging as well.Inside, the Corolla Altis gets a new instrument cluster featuring new graphics, repositioned indicator lights and multi-info colour display (similar to that found in recent Toyota/Lexus models). Other cabin updates include a new leather steering wheel, rear seats that can now be reclined and a new Nanoe water-coated ion technology for the air-con system, which provides moisturising to occupants’ skin and hair and even deodorises the cabin. The Corolla Altis ESport Nurburgring Edition meanwhile, gains a few additional interior touches to differentiate it from the standard car, including black leather seats with red highlights and “ESport” embroidery, red trim, leather steering wheel, new shift knob, black-red floor mats and an uprated infotainment system featuring DVD playback and navigation functionality.

The 320 km/h (200 mph) F-Type SVR will make its world debut at the Geneva motor show in March. The first Jaguar SVR car is developed to exploit the two-seat aluminium F-Type’s full potential while retaining day-to-day usability. Jaguar also says that the lighter, faster and more powerful SVR takes performance, dynamics and driver involvement to a new level, although comfort and duality of character inherent to all Jaguar cars are retained.“The new F-Type SVR is the first series production Jaguar to be developed by Special Vehicle Operations and benefits from everything we know about precision engineering, performance and design.

The mid-engine roadster is armed with a new name and turbocharged four-cylinder engines that phase out the .The 718 in the name refers to the  that won numerous races back in the 1950s and 1960s, among them being the legendary Targa Florio and Le Mans. Porsche had last used a four-cylinder engine in the 968 from the early 1990s. Plenty of torque on tap. The Boxster’s 2.0 litre turbo makes 300 hp and 380 Nm of twist, available from 1,950 to 4,500 rpm. That’s a huge gain of 100 Nm compared to the outgoing 2.7 litre flat-six. In the new Boxster S, a 2.5 litre flat-four develops 350 hp and 420 Nm of torque, available from 1,900 to 4,500 rpm, a 60 Nm boost from today’s S, which uses a 3.4 litre flat-six. The bigger engine uses a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry. Porsche says that it is the only manufacturer to offer VTG in production cars with petrol engines, both in the  and the 718 Boxster S.Both cars are faster than before. The 718 Boxster – with PDK and the Sport Chrono package – does the 0-100 km/h sprint in 4.7 seconds, which is eight tenths faster than before. The 718 Boxster S with the same equipment completes this sprint in 4.2 seconds, 0.6 seconds faster. Top speed is 275 km/h and 285 km/h, respectively.The reason for the move from six to four is efficiency, and the 2.0L turbo delivers with NEDC fuel consumption of 6.9 litres per 100 km, a significant 1.0 litre per 100 km less. The 2.5L turbo does 7.3 litres per 100 km, which is 0.9 litres less for every 100 km travelled. Both 718s come with a six-speed manual gearbox as standard, with Porsche’s seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic as an option. The PDK has new “fuel-saving virtual gears”, which are supplemental virtual intermediate gears that reduce engine speed during constant cruising when the next higher gear would reduce engine speed too much. This function is achieved by partially engaging two adjacent gears simultaneously while slipping both clutches slightly to achieve an effective added ratio. When one steps on the gas, the PDK downshifts out of this mode. Porsche says that as its DCT is bathed in oil, this new virtual gear function does not bring added wear. The PDK also has enhanced stop-start which shuts off the engine when coasting to a stop. Additionally, the coasting function disengages the clutches when coasting at speed, leaving the engine at idle and the car in neutral. This boosts cruising economy.Other drive-related changes include a retuned chassis that enhances cornering performance, a 10% more direct electromechanical steering system, the optional Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) with a 10 mm lower ride height (20 mm lower in the S) and an Individual programme in the optional Sport Chrono pack. A Sport Response button has been added to PDK cars.Not too hard to tell a 718 apart from the pre-facelift. The front end has a wider appearance with larger air intakes, and there are new design bi-xenon headlights with integrated LED DRLs. LED headlights with four-point DRLs are optional. New wings and side sills, plus larger air inlet panels with two fins, can be found on the flanks. New 19-inch wheels are standard on the Boxster S and 20-inch rims are on the options list.The redesigned rear gives a wider impression due to the accent strip with integrated Porsche badge between the new tail lights,  which feature three-dimensional LED technology and four-point brake lights.Inside, a newly designed dash panel frames the Porsche Communication Management (PCM) unit with mobile phone preparation, audio interfaces and Sound Package Plus with 110 watts of audio power. The PCM can be extended with optional modules such as navigation with voice control and Connect Plus for extended online services.Next up, the turbo four-cylinder 718 . There should be a 718  in the works, too."

The model was officially previewed during the 2015 Guangzhou Auto Show, where the Bavarian automaker introduced the , described as a vision for a “four-door sedan for the compact segment.” Rumours are rife that the decision to launch the concept in China was an indicator of the 1 Series Sedan’s target market.BMW has also kept mum on the details of the F52 BMW 1 Series.

A six-speed manual or eight-speed Steptronic gearbox should be employed as well. As BMW’s xDrive is available for the X1, the all-wheel drive system may find its way here as well.Recently, BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA), a joint venture between BMW and Brilliance Auto, announced that it will open a brand new engine plant with a light metal foundry in Shenyang. The new plant will be responsible for producing BMW’s TwinPower Turbo three- and four-cylinder engines, which does co-relate to the above-mentioned item. Considering the fact that the 1 Series Sedan’s rivals are available globally beyond just one market, we reckon BMW will want to introduce its compact sedan in various markets as well.

For the first time, the brand’s signature tiger nose grille is curved inwards, while new wraparound LED headlamps are seen underlined by a chrome strip that extends from the front grille. The brand’s signature four-point LED daytime running lights are also present.The side profile of the car reveals the K7’s typically long bonnet and sloping roofline. The variant pictured here also appears to feature 19-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels, wrapped in 245/40R19 rubbers. New, wider tail lights are also featured, with squared-off twin exhaust tips finishing off the exterior’s bold new look.Spec-wise, the Korean site reveals several key highlights of the new Cadenza. These include a Krell Premium Sound audio system, wireless charging capabilities, an around-view monitor, head-up display screen and quilted Nappa leather seats.For safety, the Cadenza is equipped with up to nine airbags and has active safety features such as Autonomous Emergency Braking, Advanced Smart Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning System and High Beam Assist.As expected, the Korean market K7 will offer a 290 PS 3.3 litre V6 GDI engine, and not the 3.3 litre twin-turbo V6 that was rumoured. A 190 PS 2.4 litre GDI four-pot, and a 2.2 litre e-VGT turbodiesel with 202 PS and 441 Nm are also available. Korea will be the first market to get the new model, with the European and the US markets set to follow after. With initial specs and details already up on the car maker’s website, it won’t be long before a full market launch happens. Prices for the K7 in South Korea start from 30.1 million won (RM106,363) for the base 2.4 GDI variant."

We’ve even shown you  to disguise its new curves. Here, however, we bring you the best look at the car’s interior we’ve ever seen yet.Snippets of the cabin from a distance have been uncovered before, but here, the next-gen Panamera’s centre console, steering and parts of its dashboard are in clear view. Notably, the centre console is one area that stands out.Look closely, and it appears that Porsche has dropped its previous button-heavy arrangement for what looks here like a fully touch-sensitive panel that surrounds the gear lever. All of the car’s controls which previously had dedicated switches or buttons have been replaced by a far simpler layout.We reckon that some of the car’s controls have even been shifted to the dashboard-integrated touchscreen display. This could be a new route for Porsche models in the future, so do take note of what you see here.The three-spoke steering wheel is also new to the Panamera, and like other new Porsche models, is inspired by the . The five-binnacle instruments are familiar, and while the top half of the dashboard is completely covered up, we do spot that the air-conditioning vents have been relocated, and that all buttons that used to surround the multimedia display screen have been removed.Outside, these spy photos don’t show us anything we haven’t already seen. The front end of the car is sculpted as you’d expected it, but it is the rear that has drawn some attention. While the first-gen Panamera’s rear end was a bit ungainly to some, the next-gen model seems to have been heavily revised in the area.We also know that this Panamera will be underpinned by Volkswagen’s new Modular Standard Platform (MSB). To be applied in all high-end Volkswagen Group models, such as the future  range, MSB will bring about weight significant shavings as well – said to be up to 100 kg, in the case of the new Panamera against the old one.Few changes are expected in the next-gen model’s powertrain department, with it likely carrying forward the current range of V6 and V8 turbocharged units. The  version should remain available, with the Panamera Turbo sitting at the top of the range."

Just over a month later, former F1 driver Justin Wilson also passed away after being struck by a large piece of flying debris during an IndyCar race.Former F1 driver and GPDA president Alex Wurz told the BBC that he saw no reason for closed cockpits not to be introduced in time for the 2017 season.
“Obviously structural changes are required to the chassis but, with almost a one-year lead time, I don’t see any technical person speaking against such substantial safety improvements, especially given the last big accidents in open-wheel racing involved head injuries,” he said. “So all the drivers, and I, hope that passing the additional head protection will be a formality.”Closed cockpit designs have been seen before on concept cars that envision the future of F1 racers, including fighter jet-style canopies on the Red Bull X2010, X2011 and X2014 in the  video game series, as well as the more recent . However, tests conducted by the FIA on these designs have exposed strength and safety issues that could hamper their chances of being implemented.On the other hand,  – featuring two protective arms above the driver’s head, joined by a central support ahead of the driver – has apparently emerged as a favourite following further tests.“The research the FIA experts have done is very thorough and the process has brought forward a clear solution,” Wurz added. “Now the drivers feel it’s time to implement the extra protection at the latest in 2017.”"

Both Daihatsu and Suzuki specialise in compact cars and are direct rivals in Japan.The report notes that full control of Daihatsu could help Toyota leverage the lower-cost brand better and cut procurement costs for the former, while capital ties with Suzuki would help the the big T make inroads into India, where Suzuki commands around half the passenger car market via .Toyota-Daihatsu ties started in 1967 and the giant took a majority stake in Daihatsu in 1998. It currently owns 51.2% of the compact car maker, and taking Daihatsu private would cost Toyota US$3.2 billion at current market prices. Daihatsu shares jumped 20% today in reaction to Toyota’s statement.“We are constantly considering a number of possibilities relating to Daihatsu, such as partnerships or business restructuring, including making the company a fully owned subsidiary,” Toyota said in a statement, adding that no decisions had been made.As for the links with Suzuki, Japanese business daily  reported that Toyota and Suzuki were discussing ties from various angles, including the possibility of cross-shareholding as they look to take capitalise on demand for compact cars in India and other emerging markets.“I can easily see the Daihatsu brand used in the same way that VW uses , or Renault uses , or Nissan uses  as a low-cost, sub-premium brand to the core brand,” said CLSA senior research analyst Christopher Richter. “That could be a very effective weapon against Suzuki in places like India. If I were Suzuki that would sound like a risk to doing business with Toyota,” he added.Others noted that a Toyota-Suzuki partnership could be win-win. Suzuki has an unrivalled distribution network in India that Toyota can benefit from, while Suzuki would be getting a stable shareholder, plus access to Toyota’s hybrid,  and other next-gen tech geared towards future vehicle electrification, JP Morgan analysts noted.However, Suzuki is expected to tread carefully with any potential tie-up with a giant carmaker after its previous capital alliance with Volkswagen soured, leading to a lengthy legal dispute that only ended last year with the unwinding of their cross-shareholdings.

The highly-anticipated model is set to go on sale this year, but the process of owning one isn’t just about how large your bank account is, as potential owners will have to go through a rigorous selection procedure for the 250 GTs that will be available at the end of 2016.In a report by , the process to Ford GT ownership starts with online applications, which are expected to go live later this month. “There’s a loyal following to the car,” Raj Nair, Ford’s product chief, said in an interview. “We want to prioritise people who are going to care about the car, keep the car and drive the car,” he added.Questions in the application form include how many Ford vehicles the applicant has previously owned, how active they are on social media and how often they plan to drive it. “It will try to understand what your relationship with Ford is,” Nair said.Successful applicants will be required to sign a legal document, whereby they formally agree that they will not sell the vehicle for a certain amount of time to help prevent buyers from flipping them quickly for a quick buck (ala property). That should scare way buyers who simply want to turn a quick profit on the supercar. This selection process mirrors the LaFerrari buyer selection method. The Italian automaker similarly requires die-hard Ferrari owners to submit their names to a list. Corporate bigwigs in Maranello will then decide upon the potential candidates from the list, before they are then granted permission to purchase a LaFerrari. Rumour has it that you’ll need to own at least five Ferraris (in good condition) to even be considered.It’s easy to see why the Ford GT is attracting this much attention. Beyond its contemporary styling, the American supercar packs the most powerful EcoBoost motor ever produced – a 3.5 litre EcoBoost V6 delivering over 600 hp.

The tiger-badged MPV won’t be called Ertiga, of course, and there’s a chance of Proton giving the donor car a different face, so this serves as merely an idea of what to expect. Theo delivered three sets with Proton badges – one of the  that surfaced in 2012, one based on  that debut at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show (GIIAS) 2015 show in August 2015, and another of the range topping  (below left), which has a completely different (and rather bizarre) face from the standard car. Also included is a pic of the Ertiga’s  with Proton’s emblem on the steering boss. What do you think? Should the national car company just keep it simple as seen here, or should a “more Proton face” be used?  The confirmation of the Ertiga as a fruit of Proton’s collaboration with Suzuki . News reports from the republic quoted local Suzuki arm PT Suzuki Indomobil Sales (SIS) saying that the Ertiga will be exported to Malaysia in knocked down form, from the second quarter of 2016.SIS will export 1,500 units of the Ertiga to Proton per month, which translates to a significant 18,000 units per year. Production of the knocked down kits headed for Malaysia will start at SIS’ factory in Cikarang from May this year. Proton had previously announced that the first Proton-Suzuki joint model will . Presently, Suzuki exports the Ertiga from Indonesia to various Asean countries such as the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Brunei in CBU form. However, exports to the four markets are at the rate of 400 units per month combined, which pales in comparison to the Proton deal. Suzuki also produces the , a rebadged Ertiga, for the Indonesian market. The Suzuki Ertiga is a three-row, seven-seater MPV that shares a platform with the  and SX4. Its 2,740 mm wheelbase is competitive with the Perodua Alza’s 2,750 mm and the Proton Exora’s 2,730 mm. In Indonesia, the Ertiga – which competes in the Low-MPV segment against the market-leading  and  – is powered by a 1.4 litre engine with 92 PS and 130 Nm of torque, and the K14B motor is paired to a five-speed manual and four-speed automatic gearbox."
SPYSHOTS: Maserati Levante – interior finally revealed,,Chris Aaron,,"Cars,International News,Maserati,Spyshots",2016-02-02,"Spied before  and once again , here is another early look at the coming  – the Italian car maker’s first shot at producing an SUV. To give you a bit of a recap, the Levante will face-off against the likes of the  and the popular .While the car seen here is still a heavily disguised mule, it is very likely hiding a dedicated SUV body – one that is far closer to being production-ready than we’ve seen before. Previous spyshots were of the mule wearing a Ghibli’s body, albeit with much higher ground clearance, thanks to an adapted chassis from the Quattroporte and Ghibli sedans.Here, the front grille with its trident emblem is seen peeking through the camo up front, while bits of the front apron and large air intakes are also visible. Sleek headlights can be seen, and if you look closely, underbody skid plates are visible just under the front bumper of the car.The rear of this prototype is properly disguised, revealing just its quad exhaust tips and Gran Turismo-inspired tail lights. Needless to say, the Levante also has a healthy amount of ground clearance. Apart from the headlamps, Maserati’s renders of its Kubang SUV concept looks to be carried over very well here.More importantly, this is also the first time the Levante’s interior has been seen. Naturally, there are a lot of test instruments in the vehicle, but this is as clear a view as it gets for now. The steering looks like it’s a carbon copy of what’s available in the Ghibli and Quattroporte, in three-spoke fashion, with column-mounted shift paddles.The dashboard gets an integrated display screen, just like we’ve seen on the Levante’s sedan siblings too. While the layout of the centre console remains familiar, there’s a new rotary dial on the centre console – one we reckon would be for the infotainment system.Previously, it was reported that the Levante would offer a similar range of engines available to its sedan siblings, including a petrol 3.0 litre turbo V6 that would offer 350 hp and 425 hp, and a 3.8 litre turbo V8 powerhouse good for 560 hp. Three diesel versions of the Levante have been tipped, each potentially offering 250 hp, 275 hp and 340 hp tunes.The Italian SUV is expected to make its global debut in a matter of a months now, at the coming Geneva Motor Show in March 2016. The car will begin its production much later in Turin, Italy, after which, a hotter Levante GTS has been rumoured to become available in Europe too."

VIDEO: Hyundai shows teasers of its upcoming super bowl ads – will feature Genesis G90 and 2017 Elantra,,Graham Chin,,"Cars,Hyundai,International News,Koreans,Videos",2016-02-02,"Super Bowl Sunday is always a great place to present creative ads. Hyundai, in its first year as an official NFL sponsor, will be showcasing four ads during the Super Bowl 50. Apart from celebrities such as Kevin Hart and Ryan Reynolds, the  and the  flagship sedan will also be the main stars. The first 60-second ad titled “First Date” features Kevin Hart, and will showcase the Genesis’ tech with an emphasis on  feature.“The Chase” appears to have a thriller-like theme to it and with relatively good reason too. It will attempt to highlight Hyundai’s voice-activated  feature, which can be found on the Elantra. The company says that the 30-second ad will show viewers how said feature “can truly be a lifesaver.”“Ryanville,” will star Hollywood heartthrob, Ryan Reynolds. While it’s quite obvious what the Korean brand is trying to convey in the teaser, it should be entertaining nevertheless. The ad will test two women in an Elantra and their ability to keep their eyes on the road in “the most distracting neighbourhood ever.” It’s safe to assume that Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection will be shown in this one.The final ad (not shown here), titled “Better” will focus on the company’s new branding campaign. The ad follows the life of a boy from birth, all the way to adulthood. His aspiration? To make the world a better place.It depicts the company’s mission to make its vehicles and the whole consumer experience better. “Through human-focused technology, distinctive design and uncompromising workmanship, Hyundai strives to make things better for drivers everywhere,” Hyundai states."

The range of increase is from RM312 to RM2,021 depending on model, although the new price list will only be released at a later date, according to the company.The national carmaker says that the move to increase prices is due to the impact of foreign exchange and that “many raw materials are purchased in foreign currency.” The weaker ringgit affects Proton’s operating costs and the entire eco-system chain, Proton said in a release.

This makes them highly collectible, and among the many variants that were created, the rarest and priciest of them all is the Nismo Z-tune, and one has popped up for sale. This one here is up for sale for USD$510,000 (RM2,123,155).The dealer behind this exceptional beast is Contempo Concept HK Motors, which as the name suggests, is based in Hong Kong. The Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune in this case, is a 2005 model, and only has 3,100 km registered on its mileage. As far as condition goes, this one would certainly be appropriately labelled as “immaculate.”But what makes the Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune so rare, desirable, and in this instance, ridiculously expensive? Time for a history lesson. The Z-tune was intended to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Nismo in 2005, where only 20 units of the special edition will be made during the day. The one on sale here is #9 from that total.Unfortunately, production of the GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R came to an end in 2002. Therefore, Nismo had to purchase 20 used R34 GT-R V-Spec models that needed to have less than 30,000 km on the odometer, and meet strict body and mechanical condition assessments by Nismo before they can even be considered to be made into Z-tunes.Even then, only 12 examples of the 20 were individually-picked and acquired by Nismo (including this one). The remaining examples from number 13 through 20 were donated by owners who wanted to convert their V-Spec to Z-tune cars. Although Nismo planned on building 20 cars, only 19 (including two prototypes) were made before production of the Z-Tune was ceased.The Z-tune transformation process isn’t by any means simplistic either. Let’s start with the engine, which is based on Nissan’s Le Mans GT2 and GT500 racing experiences. Firstly, the original RB26DETT engine gets bored out from 2.6 litres to a new displacement of 2.8 litres. From there, Nismo provided the Z-tune’s engine with a strengthened block, stroked crankshaft, new forged and fillet-rolled camshafts, forged pistons, IHI turbocharger, new exhaust manifold, carbon-fibre driveshaft, and a redesigned intake plenum.But wait, that’s not all. The engine is further aided by twin oil coolers, an improved radiator and intercooler, high-flow fuel injectors with a more forceful injection pump and a Z-tune electronic control unit. How dramatic are these modifications? Very. For starters, the heavily-revised engine is now allowed to rev up to 8,000 rpm. As for power, where the standard GT-R V-Spec’s straight-six produced 276 hp, the Z-tune yielded 493 hp along with 540 Nm of torque.In terms of performance, the Z-tune was capable of hitting the quarter-mile in just 10.06 seconds, according to Nismo. To put that into perspective, the current  will make the quarter-mile in 10.80 seconds. Other performance highlights include a 0-100 km/h time of 3.8 seconds, while the top speed is said to be well over 327 km/h.The engine isn’t the only highlight here. Nismo also completely stripped and rebuilt the car from the chassis up as part of the Z-tune transformation. Nismo engineers reinforced and stiffened the chassis seam welding in key areas, and added carbon-fibre to the strut towers and transmission tunnel and the engine bay. An upgraded suspension setup from Sachs, along with a specially designed Brembo handbrake system are also part of the upgrades.On the surface, the bodywork also gets redesigned to feature the same functional components used in Nismo’s GT500 race cars, including engine bay vents on the hoods and fenders, plus wider fenders for wider wheels. Also fitted are aggressive new bumpers and adjustable rear wing done in carbon-fibre. Completing the look are 18-inch alloys in black, Z-tune silver paintjob and new front seats.What makes the Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune so special? Well, now you know. Keep in mind that this car can essentially be declared “handmade,” given the amount of work that has gone into it. However, does the comical price tag justify a car like this?

Munich’s limo and flagship saloon, now in its sixth generation (check out this nice ), will provide competition to the , ,  and . The G11 (we only get the long-wheelbase variant, so it’s G12 technically) is available here in 730Li and 740Li forms.The long-wheelbase 7 Series has a larger footrpint than before, at 5,238 mm long (+19 mm), 1,902 mm wide (unchanged) and 1,479 mm tall, with a 3,210 mm wheelbase (also unchanged). To compare, the LWB W222 S-Class is 5,246 mm long and 1,899 mm wide, with a 3,165 mm wheelbase. So, the BMW is 8 mm shorter overall, but has a 45 mm longer wheelbase than the Merc.While it might not look worlds apart from its predecessor, the new 7 Series is all-new and high-tech underneath. BMW’s Carbon Core construction – with tech gleaned from  development – utilises a combination of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), magnesium, aluminium and steel, resulting in increased strength and rigidity of the passenger cell  weight savings of up to 130 kg compared to the F01. Core aside, the use of aluminium for the doors and (for the first time) the bootlid also contributed to the weight loss. BMW says that unsprung mass has been cut by 15%, centre of gravity made lower and 50:50 weight distribution maintained. The 740Li is powered by a 3.0 litre inline-six engine with 326 hp from 5,500 to 6,500 rpm; and 450 Nm of torque from 1,380 to 5,000 rpm. The B58 twin-scroll turbo unit is from a new engine family and its crankcase, cylinder head and oil sump are all made from aluminium. The turbo features an indirect system of charge air cooling that is incorporated into the intake manifold, and this water-to-air intercooler provides a shorter route for the air. BMW claims better efficiency and response than the old N55 motor, which has 320 hp/450 Nm.Paired to a ZF eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission with Steptronic, the 740Li is capable of 0-100 km/h in a swift 5.6 seconds, on to a limited top speed of 250 km/h. Claimed combined fuel consumption is 6.6 litres per 100 km.The  is powered by a hero of a downsized motor, a 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder tasked to haul a big limo. This entry-level petrol engine for the 7 Series puts out 258 hp from 5,000 to 6,500 rpm; and 400 Nm of torque from 1,550 to 4,400 rpm. The B48 is a relatively new engine and has been seen in the , BMW / sisters and , but we’re seeing the most powerful version of it in the G11. Using an eight-speed auto, performance is far from shabby, with the benchmark 0-100 km/h sprint taking just 6.3 seconds. Top speed is at the regular 250 km/h mark, while fuel consumption is rated at 5.8 litres per 100 km, 0.8 l/100 km better than the 740Li. Not sold here, the  also uses this engine, but with an electric motor and lithium-ion battery in the mix., but the big cat’s 240 PS, 340 Nm and 7.5 seconds pale in comparison. Also weaker is the outgoing 730Li – powered by a NA 3.0 litre six-pot, it does 258 hp, 310 Nm and 7.5 seconds. No reason to fear downsizing, then.Both variants ride on air suspension (both axles) and 19-inch alloys (different styles) with 245/45 front tyres and fatter 275/40 rear ones. There’s also Dynamic Damper Control, and the 740Li adds on a new Executive Drive Pro “active chassis” system with electromechanical active roll stabilisation. The fancy  with LCD colour display and touch control panel (one can turn on the lights, open/close the windows, check fuel level and schedule the climate control, among other things, Remote Control Parking not available here) is standard across the board, as is the Design Pure Excellence package, which is basically an exterior chrome trim pack.Also standard are a four-zone auto air con, head-up display, Surround View, Welcome Light Carpet,  (Intelligent Emergency Call, Teleservices, Concierge Services and Remote Services), BMW Gesture Control for the infotainment system, Navigation System Professional with 10.25-inch touch display and HDD, plus a rear seat entertainment system with two 10-inch screens. The latter is controlled via the BMW Touch Command seven-inch tablet housed in the rear centre console. The removable tablet is made by Samsung.Speaking of rear seats, the big shots at the back can enjoy eight massage programmes including the Vitality programme, which allows one to engage in active physical exercise for recuperation purposes. Comfort seats at the back for 730Li, front and back for 740Li. Note that right-hand drive cars do not get the Executive Lounge Seating option featured in our  story until the second half of 2016. Both variants get a panorama glass roof, but only 740Li occupants get to enjoy the “Sky Lounge”. When it gets dark, the light emitted from side-mounted LED modules is directed evenly onto the glass surface, where it hits an imprinted graphic for a starry sky effect. Also exclusive to the 740Li is a 600w Harman Kardon sound system with nine channels with 16 speakers. The 730Li comes with a 205w “HiFi” system with 12 speakers. Not available here is the 7er range topping 1400w Bowers & Wilkins Diamond audio with 10-channel amp and 16 speakers.The 740Li also gets BMW Laserlight headlamps, which can be identified by a central blue-tinted horizontal bar. These top shelf items have a range of 600 metres in high-beam mode – twice the range of the LED headlights of the 730Li.The 730Li receives BMW Driving Assistant, a safety pack that includes Approach Control and Person Warning with light city braking, rear collision prevention, lane change and lane departure warning and rear cross traffic warning. BMW Driving Assistant Plus on the 740Li adds on stereo cameras and a radar for steering and lane control assist, lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection, traffic jam assistant for semi-autonomous driving, front/rear rear cross traffic assist, and Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go. Eight airbags are standard. Trim wise, the 740Li is lined with Nappa leather with diamond-pattern stitching and Poplar Grain Grey wood trim, with real leather dash top wrap, while the 730Li makes do with Dakota leather and Fineline wood. Both leather types can be had in Black, Canberra Beige or Cognac.We finally come to the price, which starts from  OTR without insurance for the 730Li and  for the 740Li. Decent pricing by BMW Group Malaysia for CBU imports (the  benefits from CKD hybrid tax exemptions), but the figures quoted are “exclusive prices” in conjunction with BMW’s 100-year anniversary, valid until further notice or while stocks last.

Hublot MP-05 LaFerrari Sapphire – an updated tribute,,Graham Chin,john : So expensive but use swatch straps. Thats like equipping LaFerrari with tayar celup,"Cars,Ferrari,Hybrids, EVs and Alternative Fuel,International News,Watches",2016-02-01,"Since 2013, Hublot has been paying tribute to the  hypercar. In partnership with the brand, the watchmaker has unveiled an updated version of the MP-05 model. Called the MP-05 LaFerrari Sapphire, the mechanical timepiece comes with a sapphire case (hence the name) and only 20 pieces will be made.Pieced together over a period of 18 months, the case was carved out from seven blocks of sapphire, requiring over 600 hours of work. The 3D construction of the case middle in sapphire gives off a unique setting for the movement, which can be seen from all angles and looks as though it’s “suspended in mid-air.”Within the 53.5-gramme encasing, a total of 637 components and a suspended vertical tourbillon have been carefully fitted. The seconds are shown on the transparent cylinder on the suspended tourbillon cage. As for the hours and minutes, they’re situated to the right of the barrels, while the power reserve is on the left – shown via transparent cylinders too.The mechanical art comes attached with a transparent silicon strap with a clasp that also features pieces carved out from sapphire. To get the clock ticking, the watch is wound by a mechanism that requires a miniature power drill. This concept is inspired by the tyre-changing tool in Formula 1. No prices quoted here, but seeing that the first LaFerrari MP-05 was priced at USD$300,000 (RM1.2 million) this should cost more.As for the hybrid hypercar, at the heart of it, sits a naturally-aspirated 6.3 litre V12 engine that churns 800 hp at 9,000 rpm and 700 Nm at 6,750 rpm. It’s matched to a Hybrid Kinetic Energy Recovery System () with a 163 hp electric motor. Combined, the LaFerrari churns out 950 hp and 900 Nm of torque. The engine is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission."
Proton’s new engine line-up – why so many variants?,,Gerard Lye,"hailthepurist : where the 2.0..,Henry : Don’t try to be clever. With so many different engines the inventory will kill you. Learn from the other established manufacturers were they use one or two engines throughout the whole range of cars but differently tuned.,cat : Its just one engine split into 6.They need something to justify 600 mill spent.

Just like all the current Proton engines.  ,firdaus : No power, easily breakdown and high fuel consumption.,Silthice : Do u know why so many variants? Then oni can use ppl money for own use…","Cars,Local News,Proton",2016-02-01,"When Proton announced its new engine family, a total of six engines were listed, including VVT, GDI and TGDI mills. Some have questioned why there is a need for so many engine variants to be introduced, especially when they share close capacities. According to Proton chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa, this is to allow for variable vehicle packaging for different market needs.As a brief refresher, these are the  that are currently in Proton’s pipeline:Rashid stated the new engines utilise a modular design, whereby the 1.3 and 1.5 litre four-cylinder units use the same bore of 75 mm, but with different strokes to achieve the desired capacities. The 1.0 litre and 1.2 litre mills meanwhile, are a result of one cylinder being cut off from the above-mentioned engines. The new engines also uses  obtained earlier, ensuring lower development costs. By comparison, all six engines cost RM600 million to engineer, compared to the two CamPro engines that cost RM450 million to develop.“The engine will be for small cars, even though it’s a 1.3 litre four-cylinder, the engine is too big to be inserted into the engine room for an A-segment car, for example. That’s why we need the 1.0 or 1.2 litre three-cylinder, which is smaller to be packaged into the car. So, it’s not just about the size of the engine but the packaging consideration, that’s why they are so close in proximity in terms of capacity (1.2 and 1.3 litre) but differ in purpose,” Rashid said.“In fact, I ask this question about other OEMs as well. Why they have 1.4 and then 1.5 litre engines. I think one of the considerations by other OEMs is related to packaging as well. So, in Proton’s case, it was meant and intended for smaller car. To achieve better fuel efficiency, it’s not just about the engine, we need to make the car lighter, more aerodynamic for better fuel economy,” he added.When the Proton Saga was brought up, Rashid mentioned, “the current Saga can fit a four-cylinder engine. The  may not fit the four-cylinder engine. This means that the three-cylinder engines will only be introduced beyond the new Saga that will be introduced this year, because the new engines will only be ready by 2017.”When asked if the next Saga will be smaller to make room for the , Rashid replied saying it depends on market needs. As these engines are modular in design, it provides Proton with options to produce the appropriate engines without excessive cost. It’s also allows the flexibility to package the required powertrain. “Looking at Malaysia’s TIV, Perodua’s Axia 1.0 litre car is commanding nearly 10,000 units per month, so there is a big opportunity for Proton to participate in this area,” he added.Rashid also touched upon Proton involvement in the total value chain of automotive business, which includes operating its own casting, engine machining and assembly plants, as well as mould and die-making (via Miyazu). These early investments stretch back many years and have a role to play in Proton’s future.“Because we are a small volume player, we have to find a means on how to produce these small numbers economically. The only way to do that is by having modular engine design, so we can communalise maximum possible part and components, be it three- or four-cylinder engines,” he said."

Naza is not the best choice (reputation wise), but they have a lot of unused production capacity as both of their main franchises, Kia and Peugeot are not doing so well currently. Tan Chong Motor is the obvious choice, but they may not want a second European franchise (they already have Renault). But as far as I know, TCM doesn’t import the ‘luxurious’ Renault models, let alone assemble them, so who knows.","Cars,Jaguar,Local Car Launches,Local News",2016-01-28,"The new  has finally been launched in Malaysia. Here to rival the ,  and , the premium compact sedan is available in three variants. As listed below, prices, ranging from RM341k to RM582k, are OTR without insurance and inclusive of GST.The compact XE’s arrival completes Jaguar Land Rover’s sedan range, joining the  and . It is also the first model to be underpinned by JLR’s new modular architecture, featuring an aluminium-intensive monocoque which allows the XE to shed weight whilst retaining a robust structure.The car measures 4,672 mm long, 1,850 mm wide and 1,416 mm tall. Its wheelbase chimes in at 2,835 mm long. To help you put that in perspective, a F30 3 Series is 48 mm shorter, 39 mm narrower and 13 mm taller than the Jag, while giving away another 25 mm at its wheelbase.Each of the three XE variants offer different levels of power output. At its base, the XE Prestige gets a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbocharged Ford EcoBoost engine that’s rated at 200 PS at 5,500 rpm and 280 Nm of torque between 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The mill allows the XE to complete a zero to 100 km/h sprint in 7.7 seconds, and have a top speed of 237 km/h. All variants feature a ZF-sourced eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission.The mid-range XE R-Sport gets the same 1,999 cc four-pot turbo, but has its output increased to 240 PS at 5,500 rpm and 340 Nm from 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The added power equated to a quicker 6.8-second century sprint and a top speed of 250 km/h. Note that this variant has a “25t” badge at its rear which signifies the 2.0 litre engine’s higher state of tune.At the top of the range sits Jaguar’s 3.0 litre V6 twin-vortex supercharged engine, residing in the top-shelf XE S. The engine is good for 340 PS at 6,500 rpm and 450 Nm at 4,500 rpm, giving the range-topping XE a zero to 100 km/h time of 5.1 seconds, and a top speed of 250 km/h. Interestingly, the engine is also featured in the base-spec variant of the brand’s F-Type sports car.Outside, the base Prestige variant offers bi-function HID xenon headlamps with LED daytime running lights and high-intensity LED tail lamps which have been inspired by the F-Type. It gets 17-inch “Turbine” 10-spoke sparkle silver alloy wheels as standard, and has its front radiator grille in black with a chrome surround.The R-Sport variant adds slightly sportier looks, courtesy of the R-Sport body kit – this adds an R-Sport front bumper, body-coloured side sills, satin chrome side power vents and a rear spoiler. The variant also gets 18-inch “Star” five-spoke alloy wheels as standard. Note that the R-Sport pictured here is equipped with the optional 19-inch “Venom” five, twin-spoke alloys in black.The XE S is by far the most aggressive variant in the line-up. On the outside, it features enlarged air intakes on the front bumper, side sill extensions, a rear spoiler, a gloss black rear valance and brake calipers painted in red. As standard, the S gets 18-inch “Templar” five, twin-spoke alloy wheels, but optionally, buyers may specify a set of 20-inch “Propeller” alloy wheels.Inside, the three variants feature very similar equipment and features – only trim and upholstery options appear to be different between them. A three-spoke multi-function steering wheel is standard across the board, while the centre console features a rising gear selector dial.The InControl Touch infotainment system introduces an eight-inch touchscreen display with a new graphical interface. Media options range from USB and auxiliary sockets to iPod and Bluetooth connectivity.As standard, all XE variants get a basic 80-watt, four-channel, six-speaker sound system. Optionally, buyers may spec-up the audio to a 380-watt Meridian sound system, specifically designed for the XE – audio reproduction here is via a greater 12-channel, 11-speaker system.Moving towards specifics of each variant’s interior, the base Prestige 2.0 starts things off by offering Taurus leather upholstery with contrasting stitching – based on your preferred colour theme. The signature Jaguar Riva Hoop that spans across the door trim and dashboard is in brushed aluminium, while the steering wheel is wrapped in soft grain leather.The R Sport adds to the above a set of Sport Perforation seats with Taurus leather upholstery and mesh fabric inserts. The Riva Hoop and door finishers are in etched aluminium, with additional “R-Sport” badges on the steering wheel and tread plates to remind you of your RM365k purchase.The S variant’s cabin is the sportiest of them all. With suede cloth inserts on the Taurus leather seats, this variant also gets a generous serving of gloss black trim. The steering wheel and tread plates get “S” badges, and the Riva Hoop and door trim here feature a dark mesh aluminium material.There’s a decent amount of driver assistance systems in the XE. The JaguarDrive Control allows you to switch the vehicle’s performance characteristics on the fly, offering Normal, Eco, Dynamic and Winter driving modes that modify the XE’s throttle and steering characteristics.The XE is also the first Jaguar model to be offered with an electric-powered steering. Officially known as the Speed Proportional Electric Power Steering, the system claims to accurately optimise steering feel to match your demands. A Torque Vectoring by Braking system is also on deck, designed to mitigate understeer situations. Notably, only the R-Sport variant appears to feature a Sports-tuned suspension.Another world debut for the brand is its All Surface Progress Control, which gets its first application in the XE. The traction management system functions similarly to a low-speed cruise control and gives the rear-wheel driven XE better all-weather capabilities. Typically used to optimise grip in the snow, the system functions between 3.6 km/h and 30 km/h and provides maximum take-off grip in slippery conditions – not that we’ll ever be driving in snow, anytime soon.For safety, the all XE variants get on nicely with six airbags as standard. Active safety features include Hill Launch Assist, Emergency Brake Assist, Dynamic Stability Control and Traction Control.To recap, the Jaguar XE is priced from RM340k to RM580k, with three variants available. The prices include a five-year or 150,000 km warranty and three years roadside assistance. The Prestige 2.0 and R-Sport 2.0 variants come with a five-year or 80,000 km free scheduled maintenance package, while the S 3.0 variant gets the same deal under five-year or 65,000 km terms.Early buyers will also get the XE Launch Accessories kit worth RM10,000 for free. The package includes illuminated tread plates up front, aluminium red-painted paddle shifters, a specially-designed gear selector with a premium dark leather top and a rubber bezel with a soft-touch grip and unique tyre valve caps which are available in four designs.On top of this, there are also several items for buyers to add on, including a chrome front splitter (RM1,538), aluminium gearshift paddles (RM3,559), an iPad Mini holder (RM1,504) and a headrest-mounted coat hanger (RM337).

Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport Lightweight coming?,,Graham Chin,,"Cars,International News,Volkswagen",2016-02-01,"Here’s something interesting – according to a high-ranking official, Volkswagen has built a lightweight version of the  (pictured here),  reports. While it may already be ready, sitting at the company’s facility in Germany, it seems that Volkswagen is contemplating as to whether such a sporty car should be introduced at this point in time due to the ‘’ scandal.Billed the Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport Lightweight, the front-wheel drive hatchback is claimed to be inspired by the Porsche 911 GT3 Clubsport. The model is a road-legal car that’s aimed at those who want to enter track-day events, motorkhanas and hill climbs. The model will also see the EA888 turbocharged 2.0 litre four-cylinder engine revised as well.While it’s the same mill as the standard Golf GTI Clubsport, said revisions include increased turbocharger boost pressure and a higher ignition cut-out. With this, the Lightweight version will deliver a total of 300 PS.“We’ve increased the threshold so it delivers a permanent 300 PS, which is only achieved momentarily on the overboost in the Golf GTI Clubsport,” the source said. Torque however, will stay put at 380 Nm. As for the gearbox, the hatch will come paired with either a six-speed manual or a dual-clutch automatic transmission, with an electronic differential.As for weight, the company has employed less sound deadening materials to bring the standard car’s kerb weight (1,375 kg) down. Currently, the Golf GTI Clubsport does 0-100 km/h in a matter of 5.9 seconds, it is claimed that the new version will outdo that time. Interior-wise, there will be modifications as well, including a different seat in the back.Production of the Lightweight version is still on the fence as the final verdict lays with the newly-elected supervisory board. The board is said to be apprehensive about the message that the model will send in light of the ongoing investigations. That said, the model may be unveiled at Wothersee before a final decision is made. If it does get the go-ahead though, it is said that less than 100 units will be made."

With  like , turbocharging and a higher compression ratio, will maintenance costs be bumped up as well? During an exclusive interview with , Proton chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa has said it should be lower than the current CamPro engines.He stated that the engines, which are slated to come into the market in 2018, will have a longer service interval. “The service interval will be double than the current VVT engine and I believe the technology has matured for this, that the components’ life cycle is longer, quite reliable,” he said.Rashid said that Proton is targeting to extend the service cycle of the new GDI engines from 10,000 km as on the Preve, Suprima and Iriz to 20,000 km, per service. “But of course you need to check other things in the engine,” he said. “Sometimes, people get confused when high technology is used. It’s not only necessary to check the engine oil, there are other things to monitor about the engine depending on your usage.”“[The service costs] will be [lower] definitely.

The  in the engines should also lower maintenance costs.Rashid mentioned that the new engines’ focus isn’t sports car-like high-performance. “I’m not saying superb performance, but good performance, low maintenance. Performance doesn’t necessarily mean horsepower. Performance also relates to fuel efficiency, emissions, and others as well,” he said. He also said that, like safety, there are three tiers to conducting maintenance on the engine – protection, prevention and prediction. The first tier of maintenance is the protective kind, whereby the car protects itself from further damage such as in the case of overheating. The second level, preventive, concerns routine maintenance that helps prevent engine damage altogether, such as fixed service intervals. It’s the final tier, predictive or cognitive maintenance, that Proton is looking to implement into its future vehicles – Rashid said that the company is future-proofing the new engines to be able to adopt Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). With this method, the car will analyse its actual condition to determine when to change the engine oil, rather than relying on fixed cycles.Rashid gave an example of stop-start driving, which can shorten the interval between oil changes, as the engine will continue to run even though the car spends less time moving. The technology has already been implemented by companies such as BMW, and Rashid said Proton wants to bring this level of maintenance to the masses."

One bought by Sultan Brunei, 249 Ford GT left in the world,","Cars,Ford,International News",2016-02-02,"At last year’s North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the Blue Oval surprised everyone when it revealed the . The highly-anticipated model is set to go on sale this year, but the process of owning one isn’t just about how large your bank account is, as potential owners will have to go through a rigorous selection procedure for the 250 GTs that will be available at the end of 2016.In a report by , the process to Ford GT ownership starts with online applications, which are expected to go live later this month. “There’s a loyal following to the car,” Raj Nair, Ford’s product chief, said in an interview. “We want to prioritise people who are going to care about the car, keep the car and drive the car,” he added.Questions in the application form include how many Ford vehicles the applicant has previously owned, how active they are on social media and how often they plan to drive it. “It will try to understand what your relationship with Ford is,” Nair said.Successful applicants will be required to sign a legal document, whereby they formally agree that they will not sell the vehicle for a certain amount of time to help prevent buyers from flipping them quickly for a quick buck (ala property). That should scare way buyers who simply want to turn a quick profit on the supercar. This selection process mirrors the LaFerrari buyer selection method. The Italian automaker similarly requires die-hard Ferrari owners to submit their names to a list. Corporate bigwigs in Maranello will then decide upon the potential candidates from the list, before they are then granted permission to purchase a LaFerrari. Rumour has it that you’ll need to own at least five Ferraris (in good condition) to even be considered.It’s easy to see why the Ford GT is attracting this much attention. Beyond its contemporary styling, the American supercar packs the most powerful EcoBoost motor ever produced – a 3.5 litre EcoBoost V6 delivering over 600 hp. The GT’s return also marks the 50th anniversary of Ford’s first Le Mans win, where coincidentally, a  will make its debut in said race this year."

The outdoor audio system gives a bunch of sheep singing lessons, and they do pretty well with Queen’s “Somebody to Love.”Honda says that the ad will be shown in the third quarter and that it studied the movement of sheep’s mouths to determine how their facial muscles might react while singing. What? “Great Super Bowl spots are entertaining for the fans while communicating an essential value of the product, and we believe our Honda Ridgeline commercial accomplishes both objectives in dramatic fashion,” said Honda senior VP Jeff Conrad. Audio system aside, the new Ridgeline’s has a lockable In-Bed Trunk and a dual-action tailgate that can swing downwards or sideways, all unique in its class. , the mid-size truck is powered by a 3.5 litre i-VTEC V6 mated to a six-speed auto, available in both FWD and AWD.

SPYSHOTS: Maserati Levante – interior finally revealed,,Chris Aaron,,"Cars,International News,Maserati,Spyshots",2016-02-02,"Spied before  and once again , here is another early look at the coming  – the Italian car maker’s first shot at producing an SUV. To give you a bit of a recap, the Levante will face-off against the likes of the  and the popular .While the car seen here is still a heavily disguised mule, it is very likely hiding a dedicated SUV body – one that is far closer to being production-ready than we’ve seen before. Previous spyshots were of the mule wearing a Ghibli’s body, albeit with much higher ground clearance, thanks to an adapted chassis from the Quattroporte and Ghibli sedans.Here, the front grille with its trident emblem is seen peeking through the camo up front, while bits of the front apron and large air intakes are also visible. Sleek headlights can be seen, and if you look closely, underbody skid plates are visible just under the front bumper of the car.The rear of this prototype is properly disguised, revealing just its quad exhaust tips and Gran Turismo-inspired tail lights. Needless to say, the Levante also has a healthy amount of ground clearance. Apart from the headlamps, Maserati’s renders of its Kubang SUV concept looks to be carried over very well here.More importantly, this is also the first time the Levante’s interior has been seen. Naturally, there are a lot of test instruments in the vehicle, but this is as clear a view as it gets for now. The steering looks like it’s a carbon copy of what’s available in the Ghibli and Quattroporte, in three-spoke fashion, with column-mounted shift paddles.The dashboard gets an integrated display screen, just like we’ve seen on the Levante’s sedan siblings too. While the layout of the centre console remains familiar, there’s a new rotary dial on the centre console – one we reckon would be for the infotainment system.Previously, it was reported that the Levante would offer a similar range of engines available to its sedan siblings, including a petrol 3.0 litre turbo V6 that would offer 350 hp and 425 hp, and a 3.8 litre turbo V8 powerhouse good for 560 hp. Three diesel versions of the Levante have been tipped, each potentially offering 250 hp, 275 hp and 340 hp tunes.The Italian SUV is expected to make its global debut in a matter of a months now, at the coming Geneva Motor Show in March 2016. The car will begin its production much later in Turin, Italy, after which, a hotter Levante GTS has been rumoured to become available in Europe too."

Also included is a pic of the Ertiga’s  with Proton’s emblem on the steering boss. What do you think?

Presently, Suzuki exports the Ertiga from Indonesia to various Asean countries such as the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Brunei in CBU form.

While it’s quite obvious what the Korean brand is trying to convey in the teaser, it should be entertaining nevertheless. The ad will test two women in an Elantra and their ability to keep their eyes on the road in “the most distracting neighbourhood ever.” It’s safe to assume that Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection will be shown in this one.The final ad (not shown here), titled “Better” will focus on the company’s new branding campaign.

BMW’s Carbon Core construction – with tech gleaned from  development – utilises a combination of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), magnesium, aluminium and steel, resulting in increased strength and rigidity of the passenger cell  weight savings of up to 130 kg compared to the F01. Core aside, the use of aluminium for the doors and (for the first time) the bootlid also contributed to the weight loss. BMW says that unsprung mass has been cut by 15%, centre of gravity made lower and 50:50 weight distribution maintained. The 740Li is powered by a 3.0 litre inline-six engine with 326 hp from 5,500 to 6,500 rpm; and 450 Nm of torque from 1,380 to 5,000 rpm. The B58 twin-scroll turbo unit is from a new engine family and its crankcase, cylinder head and oil sump are all made from aluminium. The turbo features an indirect system of charge air cooling that is incorporated into the intake manifold, and this water-to-air intercooler provides a shorter route for the air. BMW claims better efficiency and response than the old N55 motor, which has 320 hp/450 Nm.Paired to a ZF eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission with Steptronic, the 740Li is capable of 0-100 km/h in a swift 5.6 seconds, on to a limited top speed of 250 km/h. Claimed combined fuel consumption is 6.6 litres per 100 km.The  is powered by a hero of a downsized motor, a 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder tasked to haul a big limo. This entry-level petrol engine for the 7 Series puts out 258 hp from 5,000 to 6,500 rpm; and 400 Nm of torque from 1,550 to 4,400 rpm. The B48 is a relatively new engine and has been seen in the , BMW / sisters and , but we’re seeing the most powerful version of it in the G11. Using an eight-speed auto, performance is far from shabby, with the benchmark 0-100 km/h sprint taking just 6.3 seconds. Top speed is at the regular 250 km/h mark, while fuel consumption is rated at 5.8 litres per 100 km, 0.8 l/100 km better than the 740Li. Not sold here, the  also uses this engine, but with an electric motor and lithium-ion battery in the mix., but the big cat’s 240 PS, 340 Nm and 7.5 seconds pale in comparison. Also weaker is the outgoing 730Li – powered by a NA 3.0 litre six-pot, it does 258 hp, 310 Nm and 7.5 seconds. No reason to fear downsizing, then.Both variants ride on air suspension (both axles) and 19-inch alloys (different styles) with 245/45 front tyres and fatter 275/40 rear ones. There’s also Dynamic Damper Control, and the 740Li adds on a new Executive Drive Pro “active chassis” system with electromechanical active roll stabilisation. The fancy  with LCD colour display and touch control panel (one can turn on the lights, open/close the windows, check fuel level and schedule the climate control, among other things, Remote Control Parking not available here) is standard across the board, as is the Design Pure Excellence package, which is basically an exterior chrome trim pack.Also standard are a four-zone auto air con, head-up display, Surround View, Welcome Light Carpet,  (Intelligent Emergency Call, Teleservices, Concierge Services and Remote Services), BMW Gesture Control for the infotainment system, Navigation System Professional with 10.25-inch touch display and HDD, plus a rear seat entertainment system with two 10-inch screens. The latter is controlled via the BMW Touch Command seven-inch tablet housed in the rear centre console. The removable tablet is made by Samsung.Speaking of rear seats, the big shots at the back can enjoy eight massage programmes including the Vitality programme, which allows one to engage in active physical exercise for recuperation purposes. Comfort seats at the back for 730Li, front and back for 740Li. Note that right-hand drive cars do not get the Executive Lounge Seating option featured in our  story until the second half of 2016. Both variants get a panorama glass roof, but only 740Li occupants get to enjoy the “Sky Lounge”. When it gets dark, the light emitted from side-mounted LED modules is directed evenly onto the glass surface, where it hits an imprinted graphic for a starry sky effect. Also exclusive to the 740Li is a 600w Harman Kardon sound system with nine channels with 16 speakers. The 730Li comes with a 205w “HiFi” system with 12 speakers. Not available here is the 7er range topping 1400w Bowers & Wilkins Diamond audio with 10-channel amp and 16 speakers.The 740Li also gets BMW Laserlight headlamps, which can be identified by a central blue-tinted horizontal bar. These top shelf items have a range of 600 metres in high-beam mode – twice the range of the LED headlights of the 730Li.The 730Li receives BMW Driving Assistant, a safety pack that includes Approach Control and Person Warning with light city braking, rear collision prevention, lane change and lane departure warning and rear cross traffic warning. BMW Driving Assistant Plus on the 740Li adds on stereo cameras and a radar for steering and lane control assist, lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection, traffic jam assistant for semi-autonomous driving, front/rear rear cross traffic assist, and Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go. Eight airbags are standard. Trim wise, the 740Li is lined with Nappa leather with diamond-pattern stitching and Poplar Grain Grey wood trim, with real leather dash top wrap, while the 730Li makes do with Dakota leather and Fineline wood. Both leather types can be had in Black, Canberra Beige or Cognac.We finally come to the price, which starts from  OTR without insurance for the 730Li and  for the 740Li. Decent pricing by BMW Group Malaysia for CBU imports (the  benefits from CKD hybrid tax exemptions), but the figures quoted are “exclusive prices” in conjunction with BMW’s 100-year anniversary, valid until further notice or while stocks last. Add RM100k to both numbers for the regular RRP (RM698,888 and RM888,800 respectively)."

This makes them highly collectible, and among the many variants that were created, the rarest and priciest of them all is the Nismo Z-tune, and one has popped up for sale. This one here is up for sale for USD$510,000 (RM2,123,155).The dealer behind this exceptional beast is Contempo Concept HK Motors, which as the name suggests, is based in Hong Kong. The Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune in this case, is a 2005 model, and only has 3,100 km registered on its mileage. As far as condition goes, this one would certainly be appropriately labelled as “immaculate.”But what makes the Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune so rare, desirable, and in this instance, ridiculously expensive? Time for a history lesson. The Z-tune was intended to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Nismo in 2005, where only 20 units of the special edition will be made during the day. The one on sale here is #9 from that total.Unfortunately, production of the GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R came to an end in 2002. Therefore, Nismo had to purchase 20 used R34 GT-R V-Spec models that needed to have less than 30,000 km on the odometer, and meet strict body and mechanical condition assessments by Nismo before they can even be considered to be made into Z-tunes.Even then, only 12 examples of the 20 were individually-picked and acquired by Nismo (including this one). The remaining examples from number 13 through 20 were donated by owners who wanted to convert their V-Spec to Z-tune cars. Although Nismo planned on building 20 cars, only 19 (including two prototypes) were made before production of the Z-Tune was ceased.The Z-tune transformation process isn’t by any means simplistic either. Let’s start with the engine, which is based on Nissan’s Le Mans GT2 and GT500 racing experiences. Firstly, the original RB26DETT engine gets bored out from 2.6 litres to a new displacement of 2.8 litres. From there, Nismo provided the Z-tune’s engine with a strengthened block, stroked crankshaft, new forged and fillet-rolled camshafts, forged pistons, IHI turbocharger, new exhaust manifold, carbon-fibre driveshaft, and a redesigned intake plenum.But wait, that’s not all. The engine is further aided by twin oil coolers, an improved radiator and intercooler, high-flow fuel injectors with a more forceful injection pump and a Z-tune electronic control unit. How dramatic are these modifications? Very. For starters, the heavily-revised engine is now allowed to rev up to 8,000 rpm. As for power, where the standard GT-R V-Spec’s straight-six produced 276 hp, the Z-tune yielded 493 hp along with 540 Nm of torque.In terms of performance, the Z-tune was capable of hitting the quarter-mile in just 10.06 seconds, according to Nismo. To put that into perspective, the current  will make the quarter-mile in 10.80 seconds. Other performance highlights include a 0-100 km/h time of 3.8 seconds, while the top speed is said to be well over 327 km/h.The engine isn’t the only highlight here. Nismo also completely stripped and rebuilt the car from the chassis up as part of the Z-tune transformation. Nismo engineers reinforced and stiffened the chassis seam welding in key areas, and added carbon-fibre to the strut towers and transmission tunnel and the engine bay. An upgraded suspension setup from Sachs, along with a specially designed Brembo handbrake system are also part of the upgrades.On the surface, the bodywork also gets redesigned to feature the same functional components used in Nismo’s GT500 race cars, including engine bay vents on the hoods and fenders, plus wider fenders for wider wheels. Also fitted are aggressive new bumpers and adjustable rear wing done in carbon-fibre. Completing the look are 18-inch alloys in black, Z-tune silver paintjob and new front seats.What makes the Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune so special? Well, now you know. Keep in mind that this car can essentially be declared “handmade,” given the amount of work that has gone into it. However, does the comical price tag justify a car like this? Let us know what you think in the comments below."

Naza is not the best choice (reputation wise), but they have a lot of unused production capacity as both of their main franchises, Kia and Peugeot are not doing so well currently. Tan Chong Motor is the obvious choice, but they may not want a second European franchise (they already have Renault). But as far as I know, TCM doesn’t import the ‘luxurious’ Renault models, let alone assemble them, so who knows.","Cars,Jaguar,Local Car Launches,Local News",2016-01-28,"The new  has finally been launched in Malaysia. Here to rival the ,  and , the premium compact sedan is available in three variants. As listed below, prices, ranging from RM341k to RM582k, are OTR without insurance and inclusive of GST.The compact XE’s arrival completes Jaguar Land Rover’s sedan range, joining the  and . It is also the first model to be underpinned by JLR’s new modular architecture, featuring an aluminium-intensive monocoque which allows the XE to shed weight whilst retaining a robust structure.The car measures 4,672 mm long, 1,850 mm wide and 1,416 mm tall. Its wheelbase chimes in at 2,835 mm long. To help you put that in perspective, a F30 3 Series is 48 mm shorter, 39 mm narrower and 13 mm taller than the Jag, while giving away another 25 mm at its wheelbase.Each of the three XE variants offer different levels of power output. At its base, the XE Prestige gets a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbocharged Ford EcoBoost engine that’s rated at 200 PS at 5,500 rpm and 280 Nm of torque between 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The mill allows the XE to complete a zero to 100 km/h sprint in 7.7 seconds, and have a top speed of 237 km/h. All variants feature a ZF-sourced eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission.The mid-range XE R-Sport gets the same 1,999 cc four-pot turbo, but has its output increased to 240 PS at 5,500 rpm and 340 Nm from 1,750 to 4,000 rpm. The added power equated to a quicker 6.8-second century sprint and a top speed of 250 km/h. Note that this variant has a “25t” badge at its rear which signifies the 2.0 litre engine’s higher state of tune.At the top of the range sits Jaguar’s 3.0 litre V6 twin-vortex supercharged engine, residing in the top-shelf XE S. The engine is good for 340 PS at 6,500 rpm and 450 Nm at 4,500 rpm, giving the range-topping XE a zero to 100 km/h time of 5.1 seconds, and a top speed of 250 km/h. Interestingly, the engine is also featured in the base-spec variant of the brand’s F-Type sports car.Outside, the base Prestige variant offers bi-function HID xenon headlamps with LED daytime running lights and high-intensity LED tail lamps which have been inspired by the F-Type. It gets 17-inch “Turbine” 10-spoke sparkle silver alloy wheels as standard, and has its front radiator grille in black with a chrome surround.The R-Sport variant adds slightly sportier looks, courtesy of the R-Sport body kit – this adds an R-Sport front bumper, body-coloured side sills, satin chrome side power vents and a rear spoiler. The variant also gets 18-inch “Star” five-spoke alloy wheels as standard. Note that the R-Sport pictured here is equipped with the optional 19-inch “Venom” five, twin-spoke alloys in black.The XE S is by far the most aggressive variant in the line-up. On the outside, it features enlarged air intakes on the front bumper, side sill extensions, a rear spoiler, a gloss black rear valance and brake calipers painted in red. As standard, the S gets 18-inch “Templar” five, twin-spoke alloy wheels, but optionally, buyers may specify a set of 20-inch “Propeller” alloy wheels.Inside, the three variants feature very similar equipment and features – only trim and upholstery options appear to be different between them. A three-spoke multi-function steering wheel is standard across the board, while the centre console features a rising gear selector dial.The InControl Touch infotainment system introduces an eight-inch touchscreen display with a new graphical interface. Media options range from USB and auxiliary sockets to iPod and Bluetooth connectivity.As standard, all XE variants get a basic 80-watt, four-channel, six-speaker sound system. Optionally, buyers may spec-up the audio to a 380-watt Meridian sound system, specifically designed for the XE – audio reproduction here is via a greater 12-channel, 11-speaker system.Moving towards specifics of each variant’s interior, the base Prestige 2.0 starts things off by offering Taurus leather upholstery with contrasting stitching – based on your preferred colour theme. The signature Jaguar Riva Hoop that spans across the door trim and dashboard is in brushed aluminium, while the steering wheel is wrapped in soft grain leather.The R Sport adds to the above a set of Sport Perforation seats with Taurus leather upholstery and mesh fabric inserts. The Riva Hoop and door finishers are in etched aluminium, with additional “R-Sport” badges on the steering wheel and tread plates to remind you of your RM365k purchase.The S variant’s cabin is the sportiest of them all. With suede cloth inserts on the Taurus leather seats, this variant also gets a generous serving of gloss black trim. The steering wheel and tread plates get “S” badges, and the Riva Hoop and door trim here feature a dark mesh aluminium material.There’s a decent amount of driver assistance systems in the XE. The JaguarDrive Control allows you to switch the vehicle’s performance characteristics on the fly, offering Normal, Eco, Dynamic and Winter driving modes that modify the XE’s throttle and steering characteristics.The XE is also the first Jaguar model to be offered with an electric-powered steering. Officially known as the Speed Proportional Electric Power Steering, the system claims to accurately optimise steering feel to match your demands. A Torque Vectoring by Braking system is also on deck, designed to mitigate understeer situations. Notably, only the R-Sport variant appears to feature a Sports-tuned suspension.Another world debut for the brand is its All Surface Progress Control, which gets its first application in the XE. The traction management system functions similarly to a low-speed cruise control and gives the rear-wheel driven XE better all-weather capabilities. Typically used to optimise grip in the snow, the system functions between 3.6 km/h and 30 km/h and provides maximum take-off grip in slippery conditions – not that we’ll ever be driving in snow, anytime soon.For safety, the all XE variants get on nicely with six airbags as standard. Active safety features include Hill Launch Assist, Emergency Brake Assist, Dynamic Stability Control and Traction Control.To recap, the Jaguar XE is priced from RM340k to RM580k, with three variants available. The prices include a five-year or 150,000 km warranty and three years roadside assistance. The Prestige 2.0 and R-Sport 2.0 variants come with a five-year or 80,000 km free scheduled maintenance package, while the S 3.0 variant gets the same deal under five-year or 65,000 km terms.Early buyers will also get the XE Launch Accessories kit worth RM10,000 for free. The package includes illuminated tread plates up front, aluminium red-painted paddle shifters, a specially-designed gear selector with a premium dark leather top and a rubber bezel with a soft-touch grip and unique tyre valve caps which are available in four designs.On top of this, there are also several items for buyers to add on, including a chrome front splitter (RM1,538), aluminium gearshift paddles (RM3,559), an iPad Mini holder (RM1,504) and a headrest-mounted coat hanger (RM337).

Hublot MP-05 LaFerrari Sapphire – an updated tribute,,Graham Chin,john : So expensive but use swatch straps. Thats like equipping LaFerrari with tayar celup,"Cars,Ferrari,Hybrids, EVs and Alternative Fuel,International News,Watches",2016-02-01,"Since 2013, Hublot has been paying tribute to the  hypercar. In partnership with the brand, the watchmaker has unveiled an updated version of the MP-05 model. Called the MP-05 LaFerrari Sapphire, the mechanical timepiece comes with a sapphire case (hence the name) and only 20 pieces will be made.Pieced together over a period of 18 months, the case was carved out from seven blocks of sapphire, requiring over 600 hours of work. The 3D construction of the case middle in sapphire gives off a unique setting for the movement, which can be seen from all angles and looks as though it’s “suspended in mid-air.”Within the 53.5-gramme encasing, a total of 637 components and a suspended vertical tourbillon have been carefully fitted. The seconds are shown on the transparent cylinder on the suspended tourbillon cage. As for the hours and minutes, they’re situated to the right of the barrels, while the power reserve is on the left – shown via transparent cylinders too.The mechanical art comes attached with a transparent silicon strap with a clasp that also features pieces carved out from sapphire. To get the clock ticking, the watch is wound by a mechanism that requires a miniature power drill. This concept is inspired by the tyre-changing tool in Formula 1. No prices quoted here, but seeing that the first LaFerrari MP-05 was priced at USD$300,000 (RM1.2 million) this should cost more.As for the hybrid hypercar, at the heart of it, sits a naturally-aspirated 6.3 litre V12 engine that churns 800 hp at 9,000 rpm and 700 Nm at 6,750 rpm. It’s matched to a Hybrid Kinetic Energy Recovery System () with a 163 hp electric motor. Combined, the LaFerrari churns out 950 hp and 900 Nm of torque. The engine is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission."

Proton’s new engine line-up – why so many variants?,,Gerard Lye,"hailthepurist : where the 2.0..,Henry : Don’t try to be clever. With so many different engines the inventory will kill you. Learn from the other established manufacturers were they use one or two engines throughout the whole range of cars but differently tuned.,cat : Its just one engine split into 6.They need something to justify 600 mill spent. Cut off a cylinder, reduce stroke size, add a turbo, change flywheel mass a bit, u now have 5 more engines to milk the rakyat,Atilla : Just because p2 is doing well in a certain segment it doesnt mean p1 should enter it. Theres a reason why folks buy p2 even when p1 offers a close alternative. Only p1 people are blind to the reasons.,ioma : Why so many variant you asked?,Absolute Rider : 
This is a company that think more is better as opposed to reliability. Just look at their plan to launch 4 models this year.,seancorr : Proton,,Satria : just make sure the project run smoothly. All working together, work hard and smart. Please do not delay this project. Of course, in other developments including doing good designs of your future cars and getting all vendors to do their work. Come out with good quality products, that is very important.,Sam Loo : Thank you. 1.5L TGDI can ready by end of 2017 with a hot hatch please…. in very early of 2018?,Donkey John : Yep that pretty much confirms no flying turbo Sagas on the road next time.,Proton & Electron : The key here is modular engine design so it can derive variants.

Just like all the current Proton engines.  ,firdaus : No power, easily breakdown and high fuel consumption.,Silthice : Do u know why so many variants? Then oni can use ppl money for own use…","Cars,Local News,Proton",2016-02-01,"When Proton announced its new engine family, a total of six engines were listed, including VVT, GDI and TGDI mills. Some have questioned why there is a need for so many engine variants to be introduced, especially when they share close capacities. According to Proton chief technical officer Abdul Rashid Musa, this is to allow for variable vehicle packaging for different market needs.As a brief refresher, these are the  that are currently in Proton’s pipeline:Rashid stated the new engines utilise a modular design, whereby the 1.3 and 1.5 litre four-cylinder units use the same bore of 75 mm, but with different strokes to achieve the desired capacities. The 1.0 litre and 1.2 litre mills meanwhile, are a result of one cylinder being cut off from the above-mentioned engines. The new engines also uses  obtained earlier, ensuring lower development costs. By comparison, all six engines cost RM600 million to engineer, compared to the two CamPro engines that cost RM450 million to develop.“The engine will be for small cars, even though it’s a 1.3 litre four-cylinder, the engine is too big to be inserted into the engine room for an A-segment car, for example. That’s why we need the 1.0 or 1.2 litre three-cylinder, which is smaller to be packaged into the car. So, it’s not just about the size of the engine but the packaging consideration, that’s why they are so close in proximity in terms of capacity (1.2 and 1.3 litre) but differ in purpose,” Rashid said.“In fact, I ask this question about other OEMs as well. Why they have 1.4 and then 1.5 litre engines. I think one of the considerations by other OEMs is related to packaging as well. So, in Proton’s case, it was meant and intended for smaller car. To achieve better fuel efficiency, it’s not just about the engine, we need to make the car lighter, more aerodynamic for better fuel economy,” he added.When the Proton Saga was brought up, Rashid mentioned, “the current Saga can fit a four-cylinder engine. The  may not fit the four-cylinder engine. This means that the three-cylinder engines will only be introduced beyond the new Saga that will be introduced this year, because the new engines will only be ready by 2017.”When asked if the next Saga will be smaller to make room for the , Rashid replied saying it depends on market needs. As these engines are modular in design, it provides Proton with options to produce the appropriate engines without excessive cost. It’s also allows the flexibility to package the required powertrain. “Looking at Malaysia’s TIV, Perodua’s Axia 1.0 litre car is commanding nearly 10,000 units per month, so there is a big opportunity for Proton to participate in this area,” he added.Rashid also touched upon Proton involvement in the total value chain of automotive business, which includes operating its own casting, engine machining and assembly plants, as well as mould and die-making (via Miyazu). These early investments stretch back many years and have a role to play in Proton’s future.“Because we are a small volume player, we have to find a means on how to produce these small numbers economically. The only way to do that is by having modular engine design, so we can communalise maximum possible part and components, be it three- or four-cylinder engines,” he said."

These images, from a sales-oriented website in Indonesia, show a refreshed TRD Sportivo version of the budget SUV. According to local reports, Toyota will be giving the Rush TRD Sportivo 7 and a new range-topping Rush TRD Sportivo Ultimo three rows of seven seats, while the Rush G from a rung below will continue in two-row/five-seater form. The latest TRD Sportivo gets a red highlight strip above the grille as well as decals on the shoulder line and spare wheel cover. The Ultimo seen here sports new wheels. Apparently, there will be a TRD Sportivo suspension set (shocks and springs) that will be softer and more comfortable than the standard suspension. It goes against the convention of TRD Sportivo = sporty = firmer, so it should be something unique tailored to Indonesian carbuyer requirements.
