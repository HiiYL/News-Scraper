Running a successful website or blog is a cut throat business now days and you need to make sure your website stands out and looks professional. On face value the readers are happy with the appearance, but what about the tech stuff in the background? A great WordPress theme will serve as the framework for your blog and makes life easy for the webmaster. Back in the old days if you wanted to change a theme or template for a website it was a major drama. But now we have push button professionally designed themes that even do a lot of the SEO work for us too! There are several great SEO friendly themes which are available for WordPress, however in this article I will mention 3 of the most-friendly SEO themes. The Thesis theme is ideal for people who are serious about their blog and have a bit of tech know how. This theme framework is the bare bones of a theme and you need to either install a skin for design or build your own through css and code. Thesis is extremely innovative and has very detailed SEO settings in the themes settings. For example you can “no index” any page or post from within the post settings. You can also add meta description, title, and tags. Having Thesis means you do not have to install too many plugins as there is a lot built in already. I am not here to   as they are both very different. They both are great for SEO in their own way. Elegant themes have perpetual updates that insure compatibility to the newest version of WordPress which in itself stays in tune with SEO. It also provides you with current updates regarding the status of your website and secure codes which are compliant to W3C.

2012-01-09,http://comluv.com/dont-hire-a-website-designeryou-dont-need-one/,Donâ€™t Hire A Website Designerâ€”You Donâ€™t Need One - ComLuv,"Before you hire a website designer to build your new small business or personal website, consider that you can build your own professional website for free in about five minutes. Use a Content Management System (CMS) to take care of all the website building, so you can focus on writing your website. The most popular CMS in the world is WordPress, a free software application that can be instantly installed on most affordable website hosting plans. Of course if you are a big wig with a big budget then you cannot go wrong with a customized designed website, but for the average person, see the cheap and stress free way to get a website. WordPress works immediately “out of the box”. All you need to do is enter a username and password to get started. After that you can choose your website theme from hundreds of free choices (and hundreds more paid choices). Customizing themes can be done in a simple point-and-click interface. You can see more details in my   about Building a WordPress Website. The link is in my authors bio above. You don’t need to spend much time choosing your website theme because you can always change it later using the same simple interface. I know people who change their theme every month. Other people never change it. I now definitely try to leave my theme alone as it might look old and boring to you, but to new visitors it still looks great! After you choose the  , you can start adding pages to your site. You can add unchanging (static) pages, blog posts, forms, images, videos, and all sorts of content to your WordPress site just by clicking a few buttons Hey, don’t get me wrong here. Not all web designers are bad people but some are taking advantage of new webmasters. Website designers also use WordPress because it’s free and easy to setup. Then they sell you expensive layout customization sometimes costing thousands of dollars, when in actual fact, they have used a theme that you could have purchased yourself for hundreds of dollars cheaper. Most designers have certain WordPress themes in their   ready to use on new sites. I know I even have a few developer licenses just in case I need to use a Theme on someones elses website, other than my own. But you don’t need to customize your layout beyond adding your company logo (which you can do from the WordPress menu). Any professional-quality layout, like those included with WordPress, will put your customers and clients at ease. Spending extra money to create a custom layout won’t attract new customers or increase your sales-it’ll just waste your money on something you don’t need. Too many things on the Internet sound too good to be true, and a free content management system that’s easy to use, requires no programming, and can be set up in less than five minutes certainly sounds too good to be true. Of course there have been many   that people love to talk about, but nothing is ever related to WordPress. But the truth is that WordPress is even better than I make it sound. If you don’t believe me-try it yourself for free. You can register a free account on   and create a sample blog. After you get your feet wet with WordPress, I highly recommend you buy your own hosting so you have maximum control over your business or personal website. Hosting is cheap, so you don’t have to worry about losing money-plus, by choosing WordPress, you’ve already saved hundreds of dollars in website design fees.",Mitz Pantic,1

It will help you choose the best apps for taking the photos, process them and even add the fancy effects that make you jealous when you see outstanding iPhone photos on social sites and other blogs. This ebook has 173 pages of tips, advice and examples and will give anyone, from newbie to pro something to take away. The book is broken down in to a number of different sections, each one having screenshots and example images taken by the author and her friends to show exactly what each section helps you to achieve. There are a number of different app reviews which are written with enough detail and show great examples to give you a good idea if you should buy it or not.

The book will be good for There are sections that deal with Instagram and Pinterest and how to use them with the promotion of your blog in mind and even goes in to details on how to prepare your photos to be sold and distributed so you don’t lose out. My first impression when I opened this on my iPad was ‘wow’ . This is no hastily slapped together pdf, this is a beautiful looking book and would (if it was physical) go perfectly on anyones coffee table. The pages and images contained in the book were mostly made using the iPhone and various apps and I must say that the whole feel of the book is very professional. A real keeper! I’ve always been jealous of my friends who seem to have some sort of magic touch when it comes to producing great looking photos but since getting this ebook and following some the nice tips like keeping the shutter button pressed until you get the scene properly framed and then releasing it when all is good or turning on HDR and how to use fancy filters in Instagram I have started to produce some half decent photos. Here’s a couple of examples that I took after reading the book. (don’t laugh, they’re a million times better than my previous photos from before reading the book!) Overall, I was really impressed with this book and took a good few mornings reading it on my iPad while I had my morning coffee. It was great to flick through and pick and choose which things I wanted to learn how to do and get some real inspiration on what I might like to do in the future like add great text to photos and creating montages. I just wish it had a bit more theory on how to frame a photo and how to position the camera when taking the photos but that’s probably because I’m a coder and I need to see the.exact.steps 🙂 If you’re a blogger, marketer or business owner then I am pretty sure that you’ll find something in this book that will bring you a sense of value for money.

2013-03-02,http://comluv.com/why-blog-post-length-must-always-be-secondary-to-creating-value/,Blog Post Length Must Always be Secondary to Creating Value,"The people behind the rationale for producing low word count content will often argue that readers struggle with their attention spans. These same readers it would seem much prefer a chunk of information, with the minimum opportunity of distraction. This blog post will take a closer look at both sides of this argument and perhaps more importantly explore the best scenario. As we have already discussed, shorter posts run less risk of the reader getting bored and losing interest. There are fewer things more disappointing than coming across a bloated piece of content. Often these will make their point within the first paragraph or two and then spend the remaining 800+ words almost beating their reader to death. In many respects this type of writing is similar to when an individual was in secondary school. Maybe you can remember scrambling like mad to get as much fluff and filler into the writing as possible. Desperately trying to get over the magical quota line, well long worded posts can often be a little like this. The reality is that is that if something can be said quickly in a snappy fashion then it should. In a world where there is already far too many distractions, should you really be wanting to add to them? Four or five hundred words is barely enough to determine an issue, let alone explore it properly. However, the internet is chock a block full of short content. A lot of this content offers just about as much use as a chocolate teapot. Why? Because content writers are frightened to death about scaring their readers off. If you believe that your writing cannot hold a readers interest over say 800 or even 1,000 words then now is the time to hang your head Great writing is worth much more attention than this. Having read the above, you might well be unsure of the best approach to take. The reality is that there is probably no clear winner when it comes to just how long a   or article should be. When writing for the web it is essential to always deliver value. Without it your readers simply won’t return. What’s more they won’t share your “great” post with others. The time that you spend putting it together will have been by and large wasted. It’s extremely unlikely that a reader will stop reading after 500 words or so if they are finding your content informative and interesting. The reality is that they will want more! However, on the flip side, if you are being a little long winded in your approach then people are much more likely to stop reading. Most of the time they won’t even bother to hang around for you to make your point, assuming that there actually is one. The easiest way to guarantee successful content is to follow a very simple, but essential pattern. This will ring true for the vast majority of all non-fiction written material. Put simply a great writer will be able to provide an interesting introduction. They will then have the ability to   a little; of course this is achieved by simply discussing the roots of the problem. After this stage they will then be able to provide a conclusion, or in other words they will solve the issue that the reader has faced. Putting content together in the above fashion can take a little practice; however, with some perseverance great results can be achieved. Without a doubt it is the most likely way that value can be delivered, without the risk of missing something or worse still droning on till the cows come home.",Glenn C,0

2013-03-03,http://comluv.com/whats-the-difference-between-repeat-business-customer-loyalty/,What's The Difference Between Repeat Business & Customer Loyalty,"Building a community of customers who will stand by you is stronger than a relationship built merely on repeat business. Lets look a bit deeper, repeat business is when people do business continually with you over a period of time. Loyal customers are those who stand beside you and enjoy working with you, no matter the better offers that are out there to entice them. Repeat business can be won, loyalty is an ongoing commitment to build a relationship by a clear shift in perception where you move from a service provider (with a host of competitors) to one who is seen as making their lives better. Building customer loyalty is all about being seen as being able to solve problems A good example of the two sides between repeat business and loyalty has been my experience with Blackberry. Over the past six years, I depended on my Blackberry and didn’t really pay much attention to the added benefits. The apps were a bit clunky, nothing was really tweaked to make the user experience more interactive, I just paid my line rental every month and because my contacts were on the phone it was just easier to upgrade to a new Blackberry when the time came round. Last week I moved to iPhone (so now alongside the Mac and iPad have the hat-trick), it’s where a lifestyle is drawn to. It’s clear that the Apple aim is to empower the individual and this is where we move from repeat business to loyalty. When the focus moves to the individual, this is the key in switching to loyalty. If we can champion the brands that we represent and move to a way of working that is focused on ‘how can I help you’ and others believing in what we represent then the path changes from a repeat customer to a loyal advocate.",Mark Masters,0

If you are freelancing or running an online business, having a reliable internet connection is one of your absolute priorities. Unfortunately, many people easily overlook this issue and realise the problem when it is already too late. In addition to frustration, having connection problems in crucial times can lead to a missed deadline, a lost opportunity, and a bad reputation for your future prospects. To avoid the problems of an unreliable internet connection, here are some of the things you should look for in a broadband provider: Ideally, you should opt for a wired broadband connection that guarantees a more stable internet connection.

It can give anyone peace of mind, especially to those who truly value their investments. For businesses, it is a critical component for long-term security which could save you thousands of dollars down the road.

They can provide a person with a considerable amount of money for a long period of time, if the lawsuit turns out to be successful. Receiving structured settlements can be very beneficial, since they are all about the taxes. They are extremely tax-efficient, which is why many people opt for them, instead of receiving a cash settlement. Read on to learn everything about structured settlement payments, as well as what you would need to do if you decided to sell them.    is a legal settlement that provides the injured victim, who claims the personal injury lawsuit, with a certain amount of money for a fixed period of time. The claimant receives a tax-free annuity payment, instead of receiving a lump sum of money. For instance, if you have been injured in a car accident and received a cash settlement from the other driver or the insurance company, that amount of money is tax-free. However, if you decide to invest it, the earnings of your investment will be taxable. On the other hand, if you receive a structured settlement instead of cash, you will get payments for either a fixed period of time or your lifetime, which is up to you, and each of those payments will be completely tax-free. Therefore, your after-tax earnings will successfully convert into a tax-free return. That is the main reason why many people opt for structured settlement payments, as it offers them greater benefit than a lump sum of money they would have received otherwise.   There are several main  , including Life Annuity, Temporary Life Annuity, Lump Sum Annuity, Life Contingent Lump Sum Annuity, Life Only Annuity and Joint Survivor Annuity, all of which slightly differ from one another. Apart from those, there are two different methods of payment regarding structured settlements, namely the buy-and-hold method of payment and the assigned method of payment. If the party that   If you happen to be in a situation in which the amount of money you are receiving by the means of structured settlement payments is not enough for you to cover your expenses, you can decide to sell your payments. Many people choose that option when their financial needs change and they need additional capital for emergency situations. It’s important to know that you can sell either a portion or all of your future settlement payments. That means that you can either sell all of your remaining payments for a lump sum of money or sell a portion of each of your payments, for which you will get a lump sum of money, and still receive part of your payments on a regular basis. There are several steps you need to take in order to successfully  . You need to thoroughly research structured settlement companies to find the one that best suits your needs. It should be a reputable company that will offer you the best deal with the lowest discount rate. Once you choose the buyer of your payments, you need to take care of all the legal paperwork (your ID, application, your annuity policy, the settlement agreement for the verification of your payments), before you file it with the court for the sale approval. When the judge approves the sale, you can get your lump sum of money.   Structured settlement payments can offer great benefits and can provide you real comfort for a long period of time, but if you happen to need liquid assets to take care of your financial situation, you can always choose to sell them. It is crucial that you gather all the information you need before you make your final decision about selling your structured settlement payments, regardless of whether you sell them in entirety or you sell just a portion of them. If you do decide to sell, you need to be absolutely sure that it is the right decision for you and that it will help you with your current financial situation.",Ivan Dimitrijevic,7

Any successful entrepreneur will tell you that the key to success is getting (the right) things done. Productivity is a combination of technique, self-discipline and sheer will that entrepreneurs must master if they want to reach their goals. Every entrepreneur has had days where they just can’t seem to get anything done. Not only is this frustrating, but it can also be debilitating to your business! 
 
 
 This article will help you find the motivation to peel yourself off the couch when you know you should be working. We’ll discuss eliminating distractions, how to handle breaks and why you should wake up early. We’ll also teach you how to say no, the importance of doing one thing at a time and how to prioritize your tasks. Follow this article throughout the day when you start to feel overwhelmed! 
   This is basic but too important to be ignored. Email, social media, and your phone are sinkholes for your time. If you want to be more productive, you’ll have to remove these distractions. The best way to do this, at first, is by taking drastic measures. If you find your phone to be a distraction, leave it in a different room while you work. If you find social media sites addicting, download add-on’s that block them for you. While distractions can be addicting, it’s important to remember the power is 100% in your hands. You have complete control over whether or not you’ll be distracted by these things. In the following section, we’ll discuss the importance of breaks, which will help you reduce distractions. 
   Entrepreneurs have to work hard, and it’s easy to forget to take breaks. Taking a break will help you mentally reset and give you more energy when you return to work. Taking regular, short breaks will help keep your mind fresh and make it easier to concentrate. It takes discipline to take regular breaks; you won’t have anyone telling you when it’s time to get back to work. When used properly, breaks will help  . Another reason we need to take breaks is because sitting for long periods causes levels of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to plummet. When this happens fat, cells build up which increases your risk of having heart complications. Sitting for extended periods of time zaps our energy and sacrifices our health. Remember that productivity doesn’t translate to how many hours you spent sitting at your desk. Productivity is all about getting things done. Taking breaks will help you approach your work with a renewed focus that will help you complete tasks. 
   I know it’s painful, but waking up early can double or even triple your productivity. An early rise allows you to seize control of the day, provided you use your time well. The solitude of the early morning is the perfect time to take a look at your long-term goals as well as plan your day. You’ll find yourself better able to manage your time and feel less overwhelmed by little tasks that interrupt your day. Waking up early is the perfect time to fuel your body and help it give you the brainpower you need to excel at your work. Eating a complete breakfast and working out in the morning benefits both your body and your The key to making waking up early as painless as possible starts with changing your mindset. It’s not as bad as you think and the benefits far outweigh the consequences. After about a month you won’t even struggle with waking up. Gradually getting up earlier each day is a good way to prevent yourself from getting overwhelmed by sudden change. Get up earlier by an hour every day this week and watch how productive you get! 
   Entrepreneurs need to protect their time. Successful entrepreneurs need to treat time as their most valued asset. The alternative is can have severe  . Learning to say no is different from saying   These responses clearly leave the possibility of you saying yes open in the attempt of softening a no. Saying no requires you to be a bit selfish, but it’s something you have to do. You shouldn’t feel bad or awkward about respectfully saying no or declining requests. You can’t say yes to everyone, especially when you run your own business. As an entrepreneur is basically up to you how much time you want to spend on your business. Remember that being generous with your time is counterproductive to achieving your business goals. The choice is 100% up to where you want to put your time. 
   Being an entrepreneur is always going to be overwhelming. Your success lies in how you choose to handle all of what’s required of you. You’re only one person, and you need your rest. Multitasking is a trap we fall into when we try and get more out of ourselves. Multitasking makes everything frenetic and disrupts our ability to focus. We can use more of our brainpower when focusing on one task at a time. Instead of multitasking, focus on switching tasks. Focusing on one thing at a time helps you get things were done, and you’ll feel less overwhelmed. If you can master switching your focus from one task to another, you’ll be surprised at how productive you can be throughout the day. 
   Be honest with yourself. With every task you work on, you need to ask yourself if it’s truly moving your business forward. As an entrepreneur, there is  , so you’ll need to practice the art of prioritizing. Part of prioritizing is setting a difference between urgent and important tasks. You’ll need to set deadlines and schedule your work in a way that allows you to complete all tasks on time. It’s also important to understand the value that working on certain tasks bring to your business. Creating and organizing invoices and doing your taxes, are important because your business cannot run properly without them. However, time needs to be spent on urgent tasks like finishing client work or finding new business. Prioritizing is a balancing act between these two types of tasks. Becoming a productive entrepreneur won’t come to you overnight. It’s going to take some time and some off days before you master the art of running your business. A productive day will give you a sense of pride in both your business and yourself. Remember that it’s up to you to remove distractions and try new techniques until you find something that helps you be consistent with your work. How will you choose to manage your team?

Here are four of the best ways to personalise and treat your blog like a princess: One of the joys of owning a blog is having the freedom to style it as you see fit. Choosing a theme that suits your personal style is just like how a dress worn by a woman speaks volumes of her temperament at the moment. You must also pay attention to every single detail and make sure every visual element contributes something to the reader’s experience. If you are setting up your blog for the first time, the best way to go is to use WordPress as your Content Management System. First of all, there are countless themes and design schemes to choose from. These are available from the WordPress theme directory or third-party resources like  . After applying a theme, don’t forget to modify the layout basics such as colours, logos, and menus. You can access these settings by going to your WordPress dashboard      . Apart from this, it also has the flexibility needed in case you choose to transition your blog into a business website, affiliate site, or online store. It is also robust enough to incorporate all sorts of interactivity with its host of useful plugins. This leads to the next thing you should do for your blog. With  , you can incorporate just about any functionality you need to improve your visitors’ experience. For a blog, you should not need anything too fancy to please your readers. A contact form A rule of thumb when using WP plugins: do not keep a plugin that you do not use. Remember that using too many plugins in one page can slow down your site’s loading speed. Furthermore, certain plugins may conflict with other incompatible plugins and lead to problems such as crashes, slowdowns, and security issues. Don’t forget that you should treat your blog with extra care and nurture. Do not neglect your blog too long and keep up with an  . Not only will this make sure regular posts are published, but it will also help you develop a strategy and plan topics that will attract the most readers and maximise engagement. Remember that you should not rush articles and write about anything that could be irrelevant to your niche. Focus on providing value for your readers by offering actionable tips and avoiding fluff. Writing about recent news and updates is also a good idea to attract new users, but you should also write about evergreen topics from time to time. Remember that consistent updates will not only make your site more visible to search engines. It will also keep your readers happy and build a much bigger following. Any visitor can detect if a blog has been deserted for a while. This means the site’s content could be outdated, or the blogger is inactive and unavailable for contact. As a blogger, it is your job to play knight in shining armor by making sure all your digital assets are safe from harm. There are several threats out there that could compromise the integrity of your beloved blog, and this is not limited to just security issues (hackers, dirty competitors, and malware). First of all, make sure you employ the   for your blog, including the installation of security plugins. The   plugin is one of the most popular options for bloggers. It covers all the essential security of your sites – from protection against “Brute Force Login Attacks” to file system security. As a failsafe, you should also create secure backups of your blog. Most security plugins offer automatic backups as an add-on, but it is better to plan your backups using the necessary tools. Apart from plugins, remember that you can also count on comprehensive online security solutions such as   and  . A blog takes more than just writing skills to be made successful. You need genuine passion, gallant effort, and the right toolset to get every job done. Today, WordPress has all the resources that bloggers need to check all these prerequisites. The only significant obstacle is to muster up the courage to get started.",Christopher Jan Benitez,1

2016-04-20,http://comluv.com/threat-real-extra-security-tools-protect-site-hackers/,Extra Security Tools to Protect Your Site from Hackers,"2015 was a tough year for companies and government employees. It was the year when millions of unsuspecting users lay victims to hackers. The most notable of these hacking incidents is that of Ashley Madison’s, where the Impact Team hacked the accounts of 32 million users of the site.  , Ashley Madison’s parent company, offered $500,000 to anyone who could capture the culprits. Other   were too notorious to be ignored — with the nude photos of celebrities leaking over the net as one of the most shocking news. In other reports, North Korea allegedly hacked technology giant Sony. Even Kaspersky Lab, a Russian security firm, was reportedly hacked by government-sponsored hackers. That same year, hundreds of personal and confidential data from government employees and White House correspondents were leaked online. With hackers breaching even the most protected websites, reinforcing online security for your site is no longer an option. You need to deploy the right security tools that can ensure your website is protected from hackers and malware. Below are some of the best tools you should consider. For regular users, a hacker attack could mean a stolen identity or credit card number. However, for online enterprises, it could mean so much more. This is why online businesses see to it that their web host offers sound security solutions, especially with threats such as Distributed Denial of Service or DDoS attacks. The idea behind DDoS is to put your website offline. When successful, a DDoS attack consumes the entire bandwidth allocation. The attack renders your site along with other sites within the whole server and maybe even the whole network, depending on the setup, inaccessible to real users. This is a major blow to the experience of your users. Without the necessary damage control protocols, a DDoS attack may last for several days. This, in turn, may also negatively affect your search engine rankings. The only way to protect against DDoS attacks is to use DDoS mitigation provider. Unfortunately most of them cost thousands of dollars per month or don’t work. However there is one option that is working really well and costs only 29.90 EUR a month. That is OrangeWebsite DDoS mitigation service. You can protect your valuable information and prevent DDoS attacks with OrangeWebsite’s   solutions. It can protect your site from ALL types of threats, including Layer 7 (an application attack), protocol and volume-based attacks. OrangeWebsite uses hardware and cloud-based mitigation systems to filter your databases and track down foreign or unknown parties – preventing them from stealing your information. It has Unlike most consumer security apps, SaaS or “Software as a Service” security tools can easily be integrated with any network – usually for a website. You no longer have to install your something from a disc or the internet. Everything is cloud-based, meaning you can have your site protected with a click of a button. This is perfect for small businesses that do not have an in-house security team to set everything up. SaaS security tools specialise in online security. They cover everything – from your databases to other cloud applications like Google Analytics to Salesforce. Most of them also offer comprehensive malware solutions that can help you with detection and removal. If you are running an e-commerce store, a network of affiliate websites, or simply your blog, using SaaS security tools is an excellent way to secure your digital extensions. One example is Qualys – a  . By analysing data on existing security threats, Qualys deploys a wall that filters everything that travels to your system. Qualys also offers malware detection as well as clean-up solutions to keep your systems safe. Whether it is a web app you use or a piece of software you download – Qualys has got you covered. Some of its key features include continuous monitoring, vulnerability management, web app scanning, and a cloud-based firewall. If you are serious about security, then you should always have a failsafe in case things go wrong. Furthermore, self-inflicted malfunctions through bad coding or the installation of faulty plugins are also entirely possible. Remember that even with an efficient clean-up, there still could be irreversible damages to your site. You may have several free options when it comes to backup plugins, especially if you are maintaining a WordPress site. However, if you have big databases that require secure backups along with other features such as performance reports and site migration, then you should opt for   such as DropMySite. Another critical data that can be compromised by hacker attacks is your email list. Don’t forget that it takes a long time to build a subscriber list and increase your reputation as an information provider. This is why you should also   using services like DropMyEmail – the email counterpart of DropMySite. It can be integrated with major email services such as Hotmail,   Gmail, and Yahoo! Mail. With a proactive approach, you can easily protect yourself from malicious entities that threaten your online security and privacy. Remember that in most hacker attacks, including DDoS attacks, the damages are usually irreversible.  With companies like OrangeWebsite, Qualys, DropMyMail, and DropMySite, you can avoid suffering the same losses as Kaspersky, Ashley Madison, and Sony.",Christopher Jan Benitez,2

2016-03-12,http://comluv.com/13-anticipated-motorbikes-2016/,13 Most Anticipated Motorbikes of 2016,"Packed with exciting and unique motorcycles, 2016 brings you a horde of new models to enjoy. From adventure tourers and cruisers to scooters and sports motorbikes, there are going to be a lot of tough choices that bikers will have to make this year, considering the variety at their disposal. Here are some of the most anticipated motorbikes of 2016 that we can’t wait to throw a leg over: We have been waiting for a long time to see Suzuki make a proper effort for getting back on top just like it did in 2001 with the original K1 and in 2005 with the K5. From then on, there was a slump due to heavy competition, but the GSX-R1000 seems to be turning the game around as it is introducing the variable   and this technology could turn out to be very transformative if it works properly. This is basically a stripped down version of YZF-R1. In order to provide performance that’s more suitable for street riding, some reworking has been done in the cross plane crack engine. This machine is going to offer you the excitement you have come to expect from all Yamaha superbikes. While this bike may not be used that much off-road, it is bound to be much more capable and fun. The Multistrada is a small step into the world of adventure touring and is both compact in size and lightweight. It also boasts the highest level of electronic adjustment and comes with a long travel suspension. You will change your outlook of an adventure-tourer once you try out the Multristrada Enduro. With the launch of the DiavelX, Ducati dipped their toe in the cruiser market, but this was only half a step as it is less a cruiser and more a muscle bike. As it has a relaxed riding position, it does function as a true cruiser and also has an imposing styling and torquey bottom-end performance. There is a new 1262cc,  , which gives the machine about 117kW power and at 5000rpm around 130Nm of torque. It also has a number of electronic controls and a belt final drive. TVS in India and BMW have teamed up together for producing a range of sub-500cc motorcycles and the first one off this rank is the G310R. TVS is providing high-volume production capability and low production costs and this will be combined with the technological know-how of BMW. This is bound to be a great machine and at a very reasonable price as well. Triumph seems to have another winner at its hand with the Thruxton R. It has successfully managed to combine the old and new in this machine. The old-school looks are apparent in the 1200cc two-cylinder engine whereas features such as Ohlin’s suspension Take the most gnarly naked bike you can find, add on a wide handlebar and fairing and you have got yourself a tourer that also boasts a fun factor. A semi-active suspension is the ideal feature as it helps the machine work as a tourer and it is also friendly due to mapping and new heads. The KTM Super Duke GT is an excellent addition because it is a bike that you can ride on the track or on the road while enjoying the same level of fun and comfort. This is a limited edition machine, which is uniquely styled and also technology advanced. It has become a part of the cruiser market and is also referred to as the Flying Fortress. The MGX-21 simply drips carbon fiber and also carries a 21-inch front wheel. Its parts can be more expensive than other motorbikes, but websites like   can help you get parts for the bike without spending too much. The Brutale 800 is already gorgeous, but the 2016 model has been made even sexier by the fashion-conscious engineers at Varese. Furthermore, the new looks of the bike have been combined with the favorite three cylinder engines that have helped the bike hit all the marks. There isn’t much known about this Victory introduction even though the company has created a lot of hype about their new production engine. Working with three renowned customizers  ,   and  , three concept motorbikes have been built, but it is yet to be seen which bike will use this engine. It will be something if it is anything like the concept machines. The biggest success story for Ducaty last year was the Scrambler and became the company’s best-seller in Australia after being on sale for just eight months. With a 400cc engine, the Sixty2 is now learner legal, which means everyone gets the opportunity to ride it. It has the handling and the looks and as long as the engine works well, it is going to be a hit. The legendary off-roader by Honda has made a return and it is brimming with a host of features that are every biker’s dream. The Africa twin boasts good handling, is light weight and has the right power characteristics to make it a highly capable and enjoyable machine for fulfilling all your off-roading adventures. Over the years, Benelli has gotten a lot of criticism and not all has been undeserved. Nonetheless, the company’s name is coming back to the forefront with the latest small-capacity machines. Yes, it is made in China, but the designs are mostly Italian and the Leoncino is an amazing piece. Even though it is another scrambler, it is quite stunning and as long as it is released at the right price and doesn’t have any technological flaws or glitches, it could be tempting for a large number of bikers and riders.",Waqar Hassan,5
2016-03-21,http://comluv.com/best-email-marketing-platforms-small-business/,Best Email Marketing Platforms For Small Business - ComLuv,"Are you into  ? Well, if you are running a small business, then you should. Building a mailing list is one of the most effective ways to create a strong relationship with your audience. Your subscribers are not just your most loyal fans, but also a reliable source of traffic and potential customers. There are many methods to gather new contacts and increase your mailing list: by offering a freebie, such an eBook, an online course, a special promotion for a membership program, or by generating leads with your social media profiles or even by content upgrades (  how to triple your subscribers with this method). But it’s not just about strategies, it’s also about using the right tools which will increase your chances to run a successful mailing list. So let’s see the best email marketing platforms for small businesses.   Founded in 1999,   today serves more than 350,000 customers around 182 countries. Their pricing is really competitive and, unlike other platforms, is affordable as your list size increases. The user interface is simple to understand and starting out requires just a few minutes. They offer more than 500 good looking templates that you can use to create professional emails. GetResponse’s last generation autoresponders feature lets you create a series of messages that are triggered based on time-based on action-based options. They also offer a landing page tool, with more than 100 professional templates and 1000 free images that you can edit, crop and resize to match your needs. For advanced users, GetResponse’s features include A/B testing. It’s very simple to create the most converting version of your landing page or emails, by split testing buttons, forms, images, or even subject lines, sender names or body content. A unique service they offer included in their plans is webinars (something that you will hardly find in another email marketing provider). Webinars are an effective method to nurture your existing subscribers and get new contacts, by sharing the expertise in your field. Other interesting options include time travel, mobile inbox preview and excellent delivery rates. The customer support is impeccable and the analytics integration lets you monitor all the important stats of your newsletter. You may not be aware that GetResponse does not charge you for unsubscribed contacts.   It may look a bit outdated, but   is still one of the most popular choices when it comes to email marketing. It’s used by more than 120,000 small businesses around the world. They offer all the high-end features a small business needs, such as autoresponders, A/B testing, email deliverability, newsletters and a tons of third-party integrations (one of the most interesting one is with WordPress – their WP plugin lets you easily integrate email sign up forms in your blog with just a few clicks). There is an easy-to-use interface and you can choose from many beautiful templates available. The segmentation capability is something that advanced users are going to love. However, their pricing plan is hard to digest. Starting at $19/mo for 500 subscribers, increasing to $29 for up to 2500 or $49 for up to 5000. AWeber also charges for the unsubscribes (a fact that lots of users aren’t aware of). It may happen that you are going to pay $29    is another popular email marketing solution (counting more than seven million customers around the globe). They provide lots of templates and different ways to edit your campaigns. You can easily send and track your newsletter, check analytics and build autoresponders. I like the simple WordPress integration with the MailChimp plugin. Just grab your API key and you are ready to go. Their free plan (supporting up to 2000 users and 12,000 emails/mo) gives the option to connect with third-party integration and if you are just starting out, you can study the wide help material available. The paid plan starts at $15/mo (scaling up to $240) depending on your size list. I love the integration with mobile with the nice apps for Android and iPhone. MailChimp is really good for small businesses that are just starting email marketing, because it’s simple to set up and the free plan is really interesting. However, features like spam filtering, analytics tools and auto-responding options are just included in the paid plans. Does MailChimp charge for unsubscribes? The answer is a sweet no.   Like the previously mentioned platforms, also   offers a list of email marketing features and provides lots of templates businesses can use to create a professional newsletter. Whether you need autoresponders, list management, spamcheck, reports and analytics, social media sharing and email creation, with iContact you have it. Good to mention that they offer a free live setup help if you are not an expert. There’s also a personal coaching service to guide you through the creation of a perfect email marketing campaign. How about prices? The basic plan costs $14/mo and increases up to $99/mo for extra features. Free trial with no credit card required. A good point for iContact: they do not charge for unsubscribes.    is the largest email marketing platform in terms of number of clients, counting more than 500,000 customers. There’s a simple drag and drop editor to create professional emails using one of the many templates available. The autoresponder feature lets you build a series of messages or send specific emails at the desired time (e.g. for a birthday or anniversary). You can easily upload your list from Excel, Outlook or Gmail and the tracking reports are precise. There is also a list of useful mobile and social media features. Their customer support is excellent. Pricing stars from $20 for their “email” plan or $45/month for the “email PLUS”. Free 60-days trial with no credit card required.    can be a powerful weapon, if used the right way. Be sure to choose the right service provider, by reading the information offered in this post. If you want to hear my opinion, I’d go with GetResponse, not just because their pricing plans are the most competitive, but also for the high-end features they offer, some of them – webinars and landing page editor – are really a plus.   And you? Are you running a mailing list? What platform are you using? Do you have experience with any of the tools mentioned above? Please share your views in the comments below, thanks!",Erik Emanuelli,8
2016-03-16,http://comluv.com/5-ways-hold-effective-team-meeting/,5 Ways to Hold an Effective Team Meeting - ComLuv,"Team meetings are supposed to inform your team about a certain topic, and when done ineffectively, they can cause a confusion and lead to various problems. Therefore, don’t improvise, but plan your meeting well and follow the rules. The participants have probably organized themselves according the time you suggested in the e-mail. So, don’t hold your meeting longer than necessary, and stay on schedule. Begin and finish your meeting on time. If you spend too much time on one topic, you might have less time for some other, equally important one. Moreover, the usual reason why meetings become long and boring, and not effective at all, is because people tend to start talking off topic. Usually, the person who holds the meeting can get lost, they can digress, which will confuse everyone. This leads to discussing unimportant things and wasting precious time. Therefore, stay on topic and follow your points in order to cover everything. Almost every meeting should ban the usage of smartphones However, this doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t use tech to make your meeting more effective. Use presentations and a projector. During the meeting, there should be something on the screen. Don’t write too many things, since they’ll spend too much time reading, and not listening. Become creative and innovative, and make a professional-looking video by yourself. According to , you can be sure that you will easily create the best possible video, which will catch the eye of participants and make them more engaged. During the business meeting, it’s not about one person speaking, and others just listening. There needs to be feedback, and everyone should be involved. Ask them questions and make sure everyone suggests something. As you have sent them the agenda before the meeting, they will already have some questions to ask and something to say something about the matter. However, many times, it happens that only one person talks all the time, and others cannot say anything. If that happens, thank the person and ask for someone else’s opinion. Make sure that  . If there is something to be discussed and it’s not comfortable speaking up about that, ask them to write their thoughts on a piece of paper at the end of the meeting. Many people get out of the meeting not knowing what the outcome was. Don’t let this happen, but 24 hours after the meeting, send everyone a memo containing everything that was discussed and the solutions you came up with. In this manner, everyone will be informed and on the same page.",Ivan Dimitrijevic,7
2016-02-25,http://comluv.com/free-alternatives-expensive-microsoft-products/,Free alternatives to expensive Microsoft products - ComLuv,"Yes, you got to work hard, but working smarter is the key to thriving as a business in this changing economy. And working smarter does not always mean buying the most expensive products in the market to help you build your business because that is what everybody else is doing; but working smarter means effectively getting your work done without breaking your budget. If you own a computer, then you are no stranger to Microsoft products and their prices. They dominate the markets of spreadsheets, text documents, slideshows, diagrams, personal information managers etc. and for good reason too; because they work really well. Yet, they are a little pricey, and we cannot always afford them without dangerously getting too close to breaking our fragile budgets. But fortunately, we have plenty of other options which are all good (free or affordable) alternatives to expensive Microsoft counterparts. What you should know is that, just because these alternatives are relatively ‘cheap’, it doesn’t mean that they are necessarily low in quality. Once you start using them, you’d find them to be surprisingly far better and easier to use! Here is a list of free alternatives for expensive Microsoft products you must know of; Linux is a free Unix-like operating system that is developed collaboratively by over 1000 developers from at least 100 different companies. This open source software can be installed on PCs, laptops, netbooks, mobile and tablet devices, video game consoles, servers, supercomputers and more. The defining component of the software is the Linux kernel, around which many varieties (a.k.a distributions) have been produced by various companies involved in the development of the software. These different distributions are aimed at all kinds of users including home users as well as business users.   is probably the most famous of these distributions but there are many others targeted for specific users. Chrome OS is an operating system developed by Google and is built on the Linux kernel. Since both applications and user data reside in the cloud, Chrome OS primarily runs web applications. It’s a viable alternative to Windows on small portable netbooks or Chromebooks. If you can use a web browser, then using Chrome OS and its Chromebook would be an effortless task. Thunderbird is regarded as one of the most stable alternatives to Outlook. It’s recognized for its reliable security system and the many extensions it provides. It’s an advanced email app with impressive features that is ideal for business as well as personal use. It’s not only completely free and highly customizable, but Mailbird is an email client specifically designed for speed and as a platform for email productivity. The client can link to both IMAP and POP email accounts. It allows integration with popular productivity apps such as Google Calendar, Evernote, Google Docs etc. Its latest version also allows integration with Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Furthermore, with features like Email Snooze, Video Meetings and Speed Reader, Mailbird stands out as a better alternative for Microsoft Outlook. We all rely on many Google products on a daily basis, and if you have a Google account, then you have free access to Google Docs Spreadsheet application. It’s Google’s own version of an office application which is readily available for you unlike the Microsoft application. Its not as feature rich as MS Office but for basic office work its more than enough. It has a word processor, spreadsheets, presentations and you can enhance it through various add-ons. Additionally it operates inside your browser, so whatever you are working on will be saved online. OpenOffice is another completely free alternative to Microsoft Office. Again its not as feature rich as MS Office but for basic office work you don’t need all those features anyway. However, unlike Google Docs , OpenOffice is a downloadable program and can operate locally on your personal computer. Creately is a diagramming software that you can use on your web browser as well as on your desktop. You have the ability to draw over 50 types of diagrams using this app while collaborating with your team in-real time seamlessly. It’s mostly known for ease of use which is facilitated by its unique features such as 1-click create and text-to-shape. One of the noteworthy features of Creately is that you can easily import your existing Visio files. It also allows you to import Visio Stencil and Template files, giving you access to all your legacy content. Compared to Microsoft, Creately is not only cheap but also much easy to use. Dia is open source software similar to Microsoft Visio. While its user interface closely resembles that of Microsoft Visio, most of its features are also essentially similar. You can create several structured diagrams and charts with Dia using more than 1000 predefined objects and symbols. It supports Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and can also be scripted using the Python programming language. These software we’ve talked about have come to challenge the very dominance of Microsoft products in the market, not simply because they are free or cheaper alternatives, but because they are better-designed and stable. These software are ideal alternatives for anyone looking for affordable tools that have similar functions and features to the expensive Microsoft counterparts. Having them in your arsenal will certainly help you work smarter and better.",Nishadha Silva,0

Even if it is just a slight discount, they’ll probably see it as a golden opportunity to get the best value for their money. Moreover, in an era full of opportunists, the demand for  sites has grown steadily. Everybody loves special sales. The use of coupons has been embedded in the mindset of consumers for as long as we can remember. For example, did you know that   look specifically for coupons or special sales? Additionally, 64% of American adults who shop online are more inclined to buying with a loyalty coupon. With the internet, this consumer behavior has opened up an opportunity for online marketers to make money by promoting the brand of others. They gain their traffic by offering special discounts and promos for other products on their site. In return, they receive a small commission for every confirmed purchase. Think affiliate marketing. Of course, it is an excellent way to drive sales for those products, increase brand awareness, and encourage cross-selling as well as up-selling. Moreover, since this method is straightforward and highly achievable within a few weeks, the competition has predictably grown to vicious heights. Make no mistake that there’s much money to be made from this industry. However, you need to be outstanding if you want a piece of the pie. You must aim to be second to none; otherwise, the competition will just demolish you. Fortunately, it was only a matter of time before the contest itself reveals the best practices to succeed in this business. Here is a simple checklist that will help maximize your coupon site’s earnings: This may be a no-brainer, but sometimes it is a lot easier to overlook the things right in front of us.

With tools like  you can easily create your search bar without writing a single line of code. Keep in mind that users probably already have an idea in mind of what coupons to look for. When it comes to design, it is often desirable to place the search bar right on top or in the middle of the page. Make it appear as the central feature of your coupon site. It is also always a wise decision to add a CTA (call-to-action) so the users will know what to do within seconds after loading the page. The perfect example would be how   pulled it off with Eventually, a pattern should emerge when it comes to the most in-demand coupons. As a marketer, there’s nothing wrong with squeezing what you can from cash cows. With coupon sites, you can do this by making sure your best cards are the easiest to find.

2016-02-03,http://comluv.com/world-exotic-cars-people-buy-despite-price/,World of Exotic Cars and Why People Buy Despite Their Price,"When you have a lot of money you need to find the right ways to spend that money. Of course, investment in a good market is the best choice for any millionaire or billionaire because this causes the money to increase. However, you don’t always feel like making investments from your money. Sometimes it is about your passion, spirit and dreams. Buying a house on the hilltop is not just an investment but it is more of a realization of a dream. Even a person living in a small house with a family of 10 would think of having such a house. Keeping novelties, buying expensive musical instruments, making people’s wishes come true etc. are also a few things people with money like to do. Among these things, there are some people who have the passion of owning exotic cars. These are the cars that are close to the ground in height, look out of this world on the road and are made in a very small number because of the huge price tags. Why do people like to buy   when they can travel in other ordinary cars as well? There are many reasons for people to buy exotic cars and they can change from person to person. However, a few common reasons are given below: Spending money on looking rich and having a high status was once only associated with men but that’s not the case anymore. Today, there are just as many Hollywood celebrities with exotic cars as there are male celebrities. There is a huge list of modern celebrities who have astonished even the male celebrities around them with their choice of cars and how they converted those cars to exactly how they wanted them. A great example is Paris Hilton who got a custom Bentley Similarly, you have Nicki Minaj who has her Lamborghini Aventador painted with matte pink not only on the body but also on the rims. Beyonce has taken things a step further from all other female celebrities with her passion and purchase of 1959 Silver Cloud Rolls-Royce that has a value of more than $1,000,000. On top of everything, this amazing old classic is a convertible so it will be a bit frugality of words to say that Beyonce has got a gem. As it becomes easier with time to earn money – thanks to the internet jobs – more and more people are buying the exotic cars. Not all exotic cars are made equal and while some look great, some have the looks from out of this world that make every head turn on the road when they pass. There are quite a few exotic car brands that are known all around the world and are considered the face of exotic car manufacturing. However, some brands are known for their uniqueness in what they do and   is one of them. The new entries into exotic cars from Jaguar need some special mention. The recent 2016 F-Type series from Jaguar is no doubt one of the coolest out there. The power of these cars is to be talked about later, the first thing that blows you away is how these cars have been designed. There are coupe and convertible models available of this car. The exterior of the car is tremendously beautiful with headlights that are more like tear drops stretched at one side. The side skirts are fully crafted with proper care of the aerodynamics and the back lights are as thin as they could be. The dials on the interior are analog with options for auto and sport mode available at your fingertips. The interior can be designed as you want so the personalization of the car depends completely on you. The engine on the car is V6 with best acceleration available on F-Type S that allows you to go from 0 to 60mph in just a little less than 5 seconds. On the automatic models you get 8-speed transmission and almost all the different models are available in the coupe and convertible form. Jaguar exotic cars needed a special mention because one has to agree that these are currently the coolest looking cars on the roads compared to the still old styled exotic cars mostly popular among people. A few other cars that need to be mentioned for offering some cool new looks are Lotus Evora 400, Porsche Cayman GT4, Audi R8 with V10 etc. The most obvious thing that you need to have before you buy an exotic car is of course the money. However, there is some other stuff that needs your attention before you buy one. First, you have to make sure to buy an exotic car that matches your personality. Some personalities are more like sober personalities and they look cooler when they are riding the more down-toned and subdued exotic cars like R series from Audi. A lively personality with a passionate look on the face would look great in a car like Jaguar F-Type. Furthermore, you have to know that exotic cars are already designed with intricate details and attention to even the most minor things that count. If you want personal changes in these cars you have to be very intelligent and careful with that. You don’t want to ruin the great looks of your exotic car. For example, Nicki Minaj is not praised much for painting her Lamborghini pink. However, if you are a person who cares less about people’s opinions, you can have your exotic car just the way you want. You can also choose your car according to the event you are about to attend.",Waqar Hassan,5

This year, it will be very exciting to at least double the income we generate online. We don’t double our income by doing the same things we did last year at the same pace. Some of these things, we must put in a little more effort. However, some of us put more effort and focus on the wrongs things. Once you’ve identified the right and scalable aspects of your business, focus on them, rinse and repeat, improve your skills, etc, you are certainly going to drive more sales. So as bloggers, who want to generate income blogging, which areas should we focus on? As a matter of fact, the key is not even promoting as many products as you fine online. Rather, focus and promote products that are relevant and add value to your blog for your readers. I have said it a couple of times that   is one of the best ways to generate income online especially if you don’t want to get into the worries of creating and maintaining a product. What you do is simply promote products and get get paid commissions. So how do you proceed this year to double your income through Affiliate Marketing? Most bloggers fail because they are dabbling. They don’t know the right things to do that will generate the right results. They lack the necessary information so everything else they do fails. The first investment I recommend is training.

I suggest grabbing a copy of  , an ebook I specifically wrote for bloggers in any niche, wishing to make money in Affiliate Marketing blogging. I share my hidden tips in this ebook while digging deep into what some very successful bloggers do to generate the kind of income they show us on their income report pages.

2016-02-04,http://comluv.com/important-ecommerce-essentials-shouldnt-forget/,Important eCommerce Essentials You Shouldn't Forget - ComLuv,"There’s no one specific thing which can guarantee that your   will become a hit… but there are absolutely a few things you can do which can increase the likelihood that your store will convert more of its visitors into buyers. Luckily, massive amounts of buyer behavior data has already been collected and analyzed by large retail corporations, doing most of the legwork for you where figuring out   is concerned! Your website needs to look stellar, full stop. And if it doesn’t, you should upgrade! Dated sites don’t look trustworthy to savvy buyers. Your ecommerce functions need to be simple and streamlined. If your website doesn’t meet these qualifications, consider using a low-cost website builder; you can even compare some of the best with  . The great part? Many modern website builders make it easy to upload, update, and alter product information, and offer secure checkout options with great additional features. Since your homepage is what many visitors will land on, it needs to have a lot of wow factor… while also helping your store  And unfortunately, it’s very common that online shops are designed without any thought to what makes a great online shopping experience. If the main point of your   is to  then you need to be concerned with some of these details! You should always have a clear and prominent, professional-looking logo in both the header and the footer. Always reference the brand name in any homepage text rather than ‘I’; this makes your website look more professional and is likely to increase your website’s profitability. Logos create brand loyalty, and knowing that the store in question  a brand subconsciously encourages visitors to trust the site. You should also consider Display products on the home page! Either with slider images, columns showing most-purchased or most popular items, or showing product categories; just make sure that your site’s visitors can get to your products from the home page. There are a few things each of your product pages should always have! Every product should have more than 1 photo, for example; and should also display color and size options (rather than having different product pages for each color or size option). Some   owners don’t add any copy or description about the product, but doing so always makes your website look far more legitimate.   If your product needs a sizing guide, link to it on the product page, as well as to your return policy. Another important thing? Item reviews or buyer comments. Potential buyers are always more swayed to purchase items which have reviews. And the last important thing to include on each and every product page, at the bottom, is either a ‘similar items’ or ‘customers also bought’ list! This increases click-throughs and up-sells, meaning visitors are more likely to buy more at your store. The shopping cart experience can be great and breezy, or it can be so frustrating as to cause potential buyers to abandon the cart entirely. On the first step, buyers should be able to choose to buy without needing to register; according to some statistics, this can dramatically increase purchases. Buyers should also be able to see shipping costs early on in the checkout process, and have a wide variety of payment options. Most simple checkout plugins can allow for as many as 50 different options, but ideally, you should be able to accept debit, credit, paypal, and google wallet payments.",Ivan Dimitrijevic,7
