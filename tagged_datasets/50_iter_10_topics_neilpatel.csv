How to Build a List Using Facebook Ads and Make Money,"Let’s begin!  If you want to shortcut the process (just for the short-term), then consider working backwards with Facebook’s targeting options. This can be frustrating, when you realize that having the right image can make all the difference for a Facebook Ad. Make sure that they have identical targeting and copy, then closely monitor the numbers. After a couple of days, put all of your budget into the ad that performed the best. You’ll want to repeat this process for each of the elements in your ad, until your ad is fully optimized and ready for a bigger spend. You might also want to use this process when optimizing the targeting for your Facebook Ads too. . . If you were in the ‘running,’ market, for example, you could teach people the importance of having the right running technique, or how to find the right running shoes. Then, when sending a promotional email, you could promote a pair of running shoes. Work out what your target audience really wants to learn about, and then teach them how they can achieve that result – maybe with the help of a paid solution that you have to offer. Webinars can be a powerful way of giving value and building a list, because you can offer live Q&A sessions, which adds to the thrill of attending a webinar. If enough people aren’t signing up to watch your webinars or receive your giveaways, there could be one of four things wrong. Additionally, if your ad is not targeted properly, the conversion rates on your landing page will be very low, too. As you do some more research, you’ll be able to better decipher what it is that keeps your target market awake at night. You can’t do that with weak copy that doesn’t promote benefits and freedom from troubling issues. You could even run live training events for your software customers. So, if you used to have a high converting ad, and you find that its power is dwindling, there’s a good chance that you’re experiencing ad fatigue.",Neil Patel,9

The key issue we want to investigate now, is how you can set up your landing page, so that it is going to ‘convert.’ The main thing that you want to keep in mind when writing a headline, is questioning how you can best showcase the benefit you’re offering. There’s a good chance that the headlines used on their landing pages are working, as it’s costing money for the advertiser to get people to the landing page. Don’t just click on ads aimlessly, however. Your goal is to quickly convince the reader that what’s on the other side of the opt-in form is worth having. Make sure, however, that you don’t copy anything. The style of image that you need to use is going to depend on the landing page itself. You may even want to take a look at the impact of using security and spam mentions under the opt-in form too.  This is a chance to remind people that their data will never be shared or sold.

Let’s begin!  The ‘pageviews’ of a book will be higher, if the book is good. If the content of the book is no good in the first place, hype or an awesome book cover won’t be enough to get someone to read through to the end. You’ll also want to make sure that you’ve done some basic SEO optimization for your content, too. You don’t have to do something as extensive as my ‘Guides,’ but you do want to create something that is in-depth and highly informative. Think about it – don’t you want to spend more time on a website that has a great user experience? Additionally, you’ll want to put a lot of effort into displaying ads that relate to the topic your site covers. This is another way that you can potentially improve the user experience on your site – albeit a slightly unusual one. Having a related content sidebar is great, because it is a subtle way of nudging people to read some of your other content. Or, it might be better to just list one piece of content that people can click on, rather than two or three – making the decision to click somewhat easier. Many blogs often fail to promote old pieces of content, even though the content in question is still quite valuable. Now, it will be easier to promote old pieces of content if you have created evergreen pieces. Social media is also a great way to promote old pieces of content. This is mainly because your content will achieve better search engine rankings.",Neil Patel,4

So, you can’t isolate persuading your audience to merely click. Instead, you’ve got to also meet the expectations behind their click, resulting in higher engagement. This mismatch of expectation versus delivery will mean low engagement on the page and ultimately lead to a fall in your rankings. As we’re measuring the exact sequence, you’ll need to choose the “is immediately followed by…” option, below the steps. These 4 weeks of engagement might mean upwards of 15 clicks for each course sale. Display is more like a touchpoint to generate interest for your brand. Look at the difference between a company’s sales that came after a consumer clicked on an ad (283) vs. when they viewed an ad (23,800).

As a marketer, there is nothing more important than regularly analyzing data. Google Analytics allows you to do so with ease. From a marketing perspective, all of this data is important. Take, for example, social engagement. Analytics allows you to answer questions such as: Have you read any of these books? Have you uncovered a few that could improve your content marketing skills? There are many powerful features associated with Google Docs. Some of my favorites, as simple as they may be, include: With Google Trends, you can view featured stories, as well as “stories trending now.” You also have the opportunity to drill down, based on your niche, to uncover timely topics.
