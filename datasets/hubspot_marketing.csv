2016-05-16,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-sort-in-excel,How to Sort in Excel: A Simple Guide to Organizing Data,"When it comes to Excel, here's a  good rule of thumb: If you start to do something manually, it probably means there is an easier way to do it. Whether you are trying to remove duplicates, do simple calculations, or sort your data, you can almost always find a workaround that'll help you get it done with just a click (or two) of a button.  But if you're not a power user, it's easy to overlook these shortcuts.  And before you know it, something as simple as organizing a list of names in alphabetical order can suck up a ton of your time.  Luckily, there is a workaround for that. In fact, there are a few different ways to use Excel's sorting feature that you may not know about. Let's check them out below ... Let's start out with the basics. Sometimes you may have a list of data that has no organization whatsoever. Maybe you exported a list of your marketing contacts or blog posts. Whatever the case may be, you might want to start by alphabetizing the list.  Sometimes you don't just want to sort one column, but you want to sort two. Let's say you want to organize all of your blog posts that you have in a list by the month they were published. First, you'd want to organize them by date, and then by the blog post title or URL. In this example, I want to sort my list first by house, and then by last name. This would give me a list organized by each house, but also alphabetized within each house.   Sometimes you don't want to sort by A to Z or Z to A. Sometimes you want to sort by something else such as months, days of the week, or some other organizational system. In situations like this you can create your own custom order to specify exactly the order you want the sort. (It follows a similar path to multiple columns but is slightly different.) Let's say we have everyone's birthday month at Hogwarts, and we want everyone to be sorted first by Birthday Month, then by House, and then by Last Name. Sometimes your data may appear in rows instead of columns. When that happens you are still able to sort your data with a slightly different step. If you use conditional formatting to change the color of a cell, add an icon, or change the color of a font, you can actually sort by that, too. In the example below, I've used colors to signify different grade ranges: If they have a 90 or above, the cell appears green. Between 80-90 is yellow. Below 80 is red. Here's how you'd sort that information to put the top performers at the top of the list. I want to sort this information so that the top performers are at the top of the list.

2016-04-28,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-prospective-students-arent-opening-your-emails,Why Prospective Students Aren't Opening Your Emails,"Many schools send out blast emails. Any email address in their contact databases, no matter how the address got in there, receives every email the schools send out. In the early days of email (the '90s), this was an awesome marketing tactic because it worked. No longer. People want and expect personalized content. If you keep sending information about your criminal justice program to prospective students who've expressed an interest in your medical billing certification program – it's no wonder they're not opening your emails. When we say ""personalize"", we're not talking about inserting someone's first name in a field tag. The most effective personalized emails personalize the content they provide. That's how you get the right messages and information in front of the right people at the right time.  Our own research revealed that targeting different emails to different personas resulted in a  16% increase in click through rates  (CTRs). That's the increase we saw merely from personalizing content at the persona level.  Persona targeting is only the top level of your personalization options. Segmenting your email database into a multitude of smaller lists is the true key to precision personalization.  A 2015 email benchmark report  finds that open rates in North America remain steady at 32%. Of course, that's the average open rate. And who wants to be average. So there's email marketing, and there's email marketing well. If your school isn't seeing open rates that get you into the top quarter of performers – take a look at how effectively (or not) you're personalizing the content you email out. Here's our four-step process for improving your email personalization, and your open rates along with it. You can't segment and personalize if you don't know anything about the person behind the email address. Using online forms, surveys, and back-end data collection, you can learn a lot your digital visitors. This includes demographic, psychographic, and behavioral data.  As you collect more data, you can refine your lists. For example, let's say you create a list for leads that meet this criteria: That's not a bad start. But as that visitor continues to engage with your content, you also learn that they nearly always access content via a mobile device and clicked on a Twitter link to get to your blog post introducing a visiting professor from France. Now you can add them to an email list targeting mobile users, who also use Twitter. So the next email they get is one optimized for mobile with Twitter-sized content for them to read and share. The great thing about  smart lists  is that your leads automatically get added to the right lists once they meet the criteria. And there's no limit to the number of lists an email address can be on. The more a visitor interacts with your content, as well as they kind of content they're focusing on, the better you can gauge where in their journey they are. Define some content and behavior criteria that indicate to you where a prospect is. Use that criteria to create lists targeting different phases. Behavioral indicators can include more frequently engaging with your content; spending more time on your site, but narrowing their focus to certain pages; shifting their attention from content you tagged for one journey phase to another; they've graduated from online content to attending in-person events. Where a lead is in their enrollment journey is a critical piece of intel for sending out the most relevant content. A parent downloads your guide on how to select an academy for their child. Is now the time to send them an application package? Not really. Instead, you send them an email with a short, embedded video interview with a current parent at your school, who's talking about what was important to them in their selection process. At the bottom, you have a call-to-action inviting them to click on a link to a virtual tour of your school. That's an email a parent at the start of their discovery phase is more likely to open and engage with. And if they click on that link? That's more intel for you to continue to refine the content this parent receives. How prospective students and parents interact with past emails provides even more intelligence. Do they ignore emails about financial assistance issues, but always open emails relating to your school's sports teams?  You can select content and email frequency based on whether a lead is opening most of your emails or none. A lead with a high level of engagement may be ready to get pushed into the decision phase. Instead of waiting for the lead to go through a typical, longer email drip process, you can set up a smart list to capture leads that open a specified high percentage of emails over a fixed period of time to cut short the nurturing cycle. For the recipient who isn't opening any of your emails: Are they an outlier in this, or are they on an underperforming list? If the list as a whole is underperforming, re-assess whether you're sending the right content for the specified criteria. If the content does seem related, take a closer look at the criteria. Were just a random collection criteria grouped together because you could, but they don't really create an actionable segment? People do like emails that send them relevant, interesting content. If your leads aren't opening your emails, then you're not sending the right emails. Or maybe you are, but  your subject lines are snores . Email marketing isn't going away.  Your competition is investing resources to succeed in email marketing, which raises the bar for your own efforts. Personalizing your email content is the smart way to increase your email marketing returns.

2016-04-29,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/stress-management-apps,14 Stress Management Apps to Relax Your Mind & Body,"Stress and anxiety -- to some degree -- are natural parts of everyday life. Think about it: You get that feeling when a driver cuts you off on your way to work, or when you have a looming deadline, or when you spill coffee on your shirt. These stressful moments can range from uncomfortable and annoying ( even motivational ) to completely debilitating.  What's worse, these negative feelings can build on themselves really quickly until they feel out of control. That's why it's crucial to monitor our emotional health whether or not we have a diagnosed disorder.  According to experts at the Mayo Clinic , unmanaged stress symptoms “can affect your body, your thoughts and feelings, and your behavior,” and can lead to some serious physical repercussions. Self-help can be our biggest asset, and luckily for us, there are some great apps out there that can help you manage your stress and anxiety on a daily basis. Here's a list of some of our favorites. Note:  These apps are not intended to be substitutes for medical advice -- they're for educational purposes only. Consult your healthcare professional before making any health, medical, or other decisions based on the data within these apps. Here's a daily tool that'll help you address stress and anxiety at a gradual pace. The folks who invented it based it on cognitive behavioral therapy combined with relaxation and wellness techniques. The app itself is pretty low maintenance: The idea is to track your daily activities by writing or via audio. The app then helps you understand what activities might be triggering different moods and emotions, especially stress and anxiety. The goal here? To help you recognize what's making you anxious or stressed so you can break the cycle. It also gives you goals to set and emotional homework. And, unlike many of the self-help apps out there, it's refreshingly non-fluffy. Image Credit:  Bustle Here's another app that lets you track your emotions and activities throughout the day, with the goal of helping you figure out what's driving these emotions. Monitoring your mood in an app can help you find some useful correlations -- for example, some folks find their mood changes depending on whether or not they worked out that day. You can put in your sleeping times and sleep quality, medications taken, amount of exercise performed, stress levels, menstrual cycles, and more in here. It's a pretty robust app, hence the $4.99 price tag -- although you can download the lite version for free. The Android alternative, T2 Mood Tracker, is also free. Image Credit:  iTunes The GPS For the Soul app was created by  Arianna Huffington  and  Deepak Chopra , both outspoken advocates for emotional well-being.  The app helps to connect you with ""guides"" that make it easier to manage your stress. Each guide includes a combination of things like pictures of nature, breathing exercises, meditation, and yoga. While there are many guides to choose from, you can also create your own by uploading photos of loved ones or by adding your own music or quotes. Once the guide has launched, a breathing pacer will help you measure your breathing. Your feed will help you see what your friends are feeling and what's helping them, too. The point here is to help you put things into perspective and remember all the things that you can be grateful for. Image Credit:  Bustle Several bodies of research show  simple acts of kindness make people feel good. And there may also be particular benefits to varying our acts of kindness, as novelty seems to be linked to happiness as well. That's why folks involved in the Pay It Forward movement created this app, which encourages users to do acts of kindness every single day. Each morning, it offers a short list of suggestions for what to do -- stuff like pay for the next person's cup of coffee, for example. It keeps track of your progress as you go and connects you with people to share recommendations with, including friends and family who have downloaded the app, too. Don't expect anything fancy from this app: The interface is as simple as the idea. But what a great reminder to give back in small ways every day. (And what a great thing to wake up to every morning.) Image Credit:  Google Play Buddha Board is an app inspired by the Zen concept of living in the moment. It lets you ""paint"" virtually, using your fingers, on the surface of your mobile device. Once you've ""painted"" your design, watch as it slowly disappears. Image Credit:  iTunes   Gradually, you'll be left with a clean slate -- and, theoretically, a clear mind to go with it. ""Allow yourself to 'let go' and not be concerned with each outcome - live in the moment and enjoy,""  reads the description on iTunes . It's simple, easy, and fun to use. But be warned: One iTunes reviewer complained that although you  can  use it on your iPad, the screen resolution is pretty poor on a larger screen. If you're looking for something to use on your iPad, check out  Zen Space .  Instead of painting, Zen Space lets you create your own zen garden -- accompanied by soothing music -- and save your images if you want to look at your masterpieces later. Created by a university team of psychologists, computer scientists, and student users, the Self-Help Anxiety Management app (nicknamed SAM) helps you figure out what's making you anxious or stressed while also suggesting ways to combat it. It's a great resource for external information, covering everything from information about anxiety to physical and mental relaxation techniques. Along with these resources comes guidance for putting these techniques into practice. Over time, you'll be able to see a graph of your anxiety so you can self-monitor. Image Credit:  Bustle   Has anyone ever told you to close your eyes and breathe when you're having even the smallest of panic attacks? That's because focusing on and controlling your breathing can really help calm a person down. In fact, diaphragmatic breathing (i.e., breathing from your stomach) has actually been  proven  to decrease stress. The Department of Defense’s  Center for Telehealth and Technology  created this app to help soldiers and their families learn stress-relieving breathing techniques -- but, of course, it works for everyone. It also offers some great information and resources on depression, anxiety, stress, and more. So the next time you feel like you're getting super stressed, try letting this app guide you into some mindful breathing exercises. Image Credit:  Bustle This app helps you  improve  your mood using positive-thinking activities.  Their philosophy , based on scientific research, is this: We each have a genetic set point for happiness -- but we also have the ability to offset it. In other words, we have more control over our happiness than we might realize. By practicing certain exercises and interventions that promote positive emotional qualities (like kindness and mindfulness), we can choose our thoughts, behaviors, and actions. Over time, these choices will become habitual and will gradually increase our resilience and make us happier. That's exactly what the Happify app aims to do. It helps you set specific goals and offers tips for achieving those goals. The positive-thinking activities include games, posting about something you're grateful for, or imagining what a situation would be like in someone else's shoes.  CNN named this app  among the top apps to train your brain and better cope with stress.  Image Credit:  Bustle If you're a fan of playing games on your phone to relieve stress, try adding this one to your repertoire. The premise of the game is super simple: It takes place in a garden where two faces, one happy and one angry, drop into the ground. The happy face creates a trail of grass you have to quickly trace with your finger. The more you play, the more attuned you become to look for the happy face instead of the angry one. Imagine this setup set to soothing background music. That's literally it. And it works, according to science: It's based on an emerging cognitive treatment for anxiety called attention-bias modification training (ABMT). ""Essentially, this treatment involves training patients to ignore a threatening stimulus (such as an angry face) and to focus instead on a non-threatening stimulus (such as a neutral or happy face),""  writes Mihir Patkar for Lifehacker.org . ""This type of training has been shown to reduce anxiety and stress among people suffering from high anxiety."" All it takes is 25 minutes of play time to reap the positive benefits,  according to a study  published in the Clinical Psychological Science journal about the app. Image Credit:  iTunes If stress or anxiety gets in the way of you falling asleep or staying asleep, you might want to try an app like Relax Melodies to help you relax before bedtime. The app lets you choose from 48 relaxing ambient and nature sounds -- everything from ocean waves to white noise -- as well as calming music and guided meditation sessions. You can customize these sounds into a mix, or choose just one. You can also set a timer for them to stop playing after a certain amount of time, or set a time during the night or morning for them to wake you up. Image Credit:  Bustle Meditation is another great stress relief technique -- and Headspace is one of the best apps out there for guided meditation sessions, especially if you're a beginner. These guided sessions will teach you how to turn off that brain chatter and meditate effectively. The free version includes access to Take10, a starter course including ten 10-minute meditation activities geared toward beginners. From there, you can pay a monthly subscription of $12.99 to receive more and longer meditation sessions, as well as sessions for specific purposes like less stress and conscious eating. Image Credit:  iTunes How great would it be if you could just take all your worries, put them in a box, and leave them in that box -- instead of having to carry them with you wherever you go? That's what The Worry Box is for. It's exactly what it sounds like: A virtual ""box"" where you can record all the things you're stressing about and leave them behind -- kind of like the ""letting go"" philosophy from the Buddha Board app. Then, the app lets you think them through. If the worry is controllable, it'll help you list out some steps for managing it. If it's not controllable, you can select from a list of coping statements to help you approach it from a different angle. It's based entirely on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that are proven to relieve and manage stress, anxiety, and depression.   Image Credit:  Google Play Here's an app that'll help you garner some physical release from your everyday stresses. Acupressure is an ancient healing art where you use your fingers to press on ""pressure points"" on the surface of your skin to stimulate the body's natural, self-curative abilities. It's totally safe to do -- and pressing on these pressure points has both physical and mental benefits, including releasing nerve endings, easing tension in your body, and increasing blood flow. The app itself helps you locate the pressure points that'll help alleviate specific symptoms (which you can search for), and then teaches you how to actually alleviate that pressure.  Image Credit:  iTunes Sometimes, all it takes to alleviate some of that building stress is to reflect on what we're grateful for. After all,  there are many studies out there proving  that keeping a gratitude journal can result in higher alertness, enthusiasm, determination, attentiveness, and energy. Here's a great gratitude journaling app that'll prompt you to record the highlights of your day. You can even take pictures of those things to keep a visual reminder of what you're grateful for.

2016-04-29,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/strategies-to-drive-member-engagement,Strategies to Drive Member Engagement,"Over time, you’ve collected a wealth of data on your members. That’s because your members are engaged with your organizations for reasons that are beyond materialistic. They care about your mission and work. They’re regularly reading your content. They’re giving you donations to do what you do best and expect nothing but goodwill in return. So why are you analyzing this data in a spreadsheet? Engagement has so many interesting dimensions and can be eye-opening to a marketer who is looking to make the most out of a limited marketing judgement. Instead of letting your invaluable trends fall to the wayside with data that is going unanalyzed, take a look at the following tactics and strategies. With the right tools, processes, and systems, you can integrate your data into your high-level strategy.  Your  most engaged members  deserve special recognition because the offer the most value to your organization. Of your overall audience, they are likely the most engaged, likely to donate, and passionate about your work. Imagine how fruitful it would be to have a direct, ongoing conversation channel into this audience where you could conduct research, ask for opinions, share content, and discover what’s on their minds. One way to tackle this challenge is to create exclusive social media groups in your sector. These include groups on Facebook and LinkedIn and hashtag-based Twitter chats. If you’re feeling especially ambitious, you could launch your own niche online community. Keep these cohorts small so that you can keep the benefits exclusive and interaction alive. If you’re tracking information about  all  your members in a central marketing or communications data, you’re in a strong position to create customer segments. Why not craft one that’s focused around your most valuable audiences? Create personalized welcome screens, share interesting content, and offer custom resources for your most engaged members. Understand what appeals to them personally, and make sure that your messages aligns with their interests on an individual level.   Here are some resources that can help you get started: Personalization has many moving parts, so make sure to do your research upfront. Spend time with your highest value members and donors in person so that you can continue to develop your most current and compelling messaging. Master this creative side, automate process, and devote as much time as you can to learning about your audience. Email still remains as the best channel for communicating with audiences 1:1. It’s especially valuable for connecting with members who have a high personal stake in your organization. Think about it: they’re committing their time and money to your cause. It’s the ultimate form of brand engagement. Why not  make the most out of these touch points  by increasing the value of your interactions? When you’re sending personalized emails to strangers or minimally engaged audiences, you risk wasting resources. But when you’re sending personal emails to audiences who are already engaged, your probability of having a successful outcome is high. Think about it: if you’re sending member renewal emails, wouldn’t you want to give your long-timers a special thank you? The extra effort will only take a couple minutes of your time. If you’re looking for some ideas to get started, check out  this list of example email templates . When it comes to engaging your members, nothing replaces  an in-person interaction . Use your online strategy to help guide your strategy for setting up exclusive meetups in key geographies where your most engaged audiences are living. Use your member database to identify potential hosts and speakers. Come up with a monthly schedule for longer and shorter events. You can even create a monthly meetup (at a venue like your office or a park), host a potluck, and invite members to spend time together. It’s a marketing program that you can build at almost no additional cost, while complementing your marketing funnel.  When you spend time together in person, you’ll come up with some great ideas for additional marketing initiatives, content to write, and campaigns to run. You’ll get feedback on your programs to date and figure out exactly how to iterate and make your processes better. Data and personalization campaigns can help tie together many moving parts of your member engagement strategy. Focus on giving this group your best marketing experience: after all, they’re your most powerful advocates. Engagement fuels more engagement. Automate as much as possible so that you can focus on what you do best--building engagement.

2016-04-29,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/welcome-email-examples,7 Great Examples of 'Welcome' Emails to Inspire Your Own Strategy,"We've all heard how important it is to make a good first impression. Show up late for a job interview? That's a bad first impression. Eat a ton of garlic and forget to brush your teeth right before a first date? Also a bad first impression. Go to meet your significant others' parents for the first time dressed in Crocs and sweatpants? That might also result in a bad first impression (depending on prevailing fashion sensibilities). It turns out that the ""make a good first impression"" principle holds true not only in face-to-face encounters, but in email interactions as well. When you send off a welcome email to a new blog or newsletter subscriber, or to a new customer, you're making a first impression on behalf of your brand. To help ensure you're making the best first impression possible, we've rounded up some examples of standout welcome emails from brands big and small. As you'll soon discover, each example showcases different tactics and strategies for engaging new email subscribers. Let's dive in ... Let's face it: We, the internet-using public, are constantly bombarded with prompts to sign up for and subscribe to all sorts of email communications. So as a brand, when someone takes the time to sift through all the chaos in order to intentionally sign up for  your  email communications, it's a big deal. In order to acknowledge how grateful they are to the folks who actually take the time to subscribe, Kate Spade uses a simple -- but effective -- tactic with their welcome emails: They say ""Thank You"" in big, bold lettering. And by placing that ""Thank You"" on an envelope, Kate Spade recreates the feeling of receiving an actual thank-you letter in the mail. (The 15% off discount code doesn't hurt either.) A welcome email is the perfect medium for introducing folks to the characteristics (and eccentricities) that make your brand unique. For Virgin America, that means putting the ""I love you"" hand symbol front and center. This small gesture signals to the recipient that the folks at Virgin America really care about their customers. The playful accompanying copy, ""Welcome aboard,"" and casual call-to-action, ""Grab a seat,"" also help to position Virgin America as a hip, fun-loving brand right off the bat. The Michaels approach to the welcome email borrows elements from both Kate Spade and Virgin America. In addition to expressing gratitude to the folks who took the time to sign up, Michaels uses their welcome email to showcase their brand. And they do a great job: the lengthy email feels like one big arts and crafts project, complete with paint, yarn, and chalkboards. Another standout feature of this welcome email is that Michaels makes it immediately clear what value their future email communications are going to provide. After thanking subscribers, there's this nice bit of copy that sums it up: ""We're going to send fun stuff like DIY tips and tricks, invites to in-store events, and exclusive deals and coupons."" When you sign up for InVision's free prototyping app, their welcome email makes it very clear what your next step should be: using the app. To facilitate this action, InVision's welcome email doesn't simply list out what you need to do in order to get started. Instead, it  shows you  what you need to do with a series of quick videos. Given the visual, interactive nature of the product, this makes a lot of sense. Sometimes the tiniest of elements in a welcome email can speak volumes about a brand. And when it comes to Food52's welcome email, their preview text at the top of the email, ""We brought snacks,"" definitely accomplishes this. Also known as a preheader or snippet text, preview text is the copy that gets pulled in from the body of an email and displayed next to (or beneath) the subject line in someone's inbox. So when you see Food52's welcome email in your inbox, you get a taste of their brand's personality before you even open it. Food52's welcome email also does a good job of building trust by putting a face (make that two faces) to their name. As soon as you open the email, you see a photograph of -- and welcome message from -- the company's founders. It might not be the most beautifully designed email on this list, but that doesn't mean IKEA's welcome email isn't effective. Instead of going for the hard sell (e.g., ""By stuff now!""), or explaining what it is they do (which is something IKEA probably assumes most people already know), IKEA uses its welcome email to turn folks onto its other, lesser-known programs and content channels. For example, there's a call-to-action right at the top that explains the value of its member benefits program. There are also prompts to visit their design blog and to contribute to their collaborative ""Share Space"" site. Of course, if you're not interested in any of that stuff, IKEA's welcome email also makes it easy for you to simply log in and start shopping (there's a login field right up top). No fancy design work. No videos. No photos. The welcome email Drift sends out after signing up for their newsletter is a lesson in minimalism. The email opens with a bit of candid commentary on the state of email. ""Most people have really long welcome email sequences after you get on their email list,"" Dave from Drift writes, before continuing: ""Good news: we aren't most people."" What follows is simply a bulleted list of the company's most popular blog posts. And the only mention of the product comes in a brief post-script at the very end. If you're trying to craft a welcome email that's non-interruptive, and that's laser-focused on adding value vs. fluff, this is a great example to follow.

""That shade of blue just doesn't look right .... Wouldn't it be cool to have the logo on the right side of the screen? .... How about we put a giant animated GIF in the middle of the page?"" However, if you're truly trying to accomplish something with your website (e.g., brand awareness, lead generation, etc.), you'll need to focus on more than just how your website looks. In a world where folks have  more than a billion websites  they can potentially land on, you need to make sure your website's design is optimized for usability (how easy your website is to use)  and  user experience (how enjoyable interacting with your website is for actual users). Now, you could spend years studying the ins and outs of usability and UX, but for the sake of giving you a jumping off point, we've put together the following list of helpful guidelines to apply to your next web design project. While the look and feel of your website is important, most visitors aren't coming to your site to evaluate how slick the design is. Instead, they're coming to your site to complete some action, or to find some specific piece of information. Adding unnecessary design elements (i.e., elements that serve no functional purpose) to your website will only make it harder for visitors to accomplish what they're trying to accomplish. From a usability and UX perspective, simplicity is your friend. And you can employ simplicity in a variety of different ways. Here are some examples: Here's a great example of a simple homepage design from  Rockaway Relief: The great car designer Colin Chapman famously said, “Simplify, then add lightness.” This principle owes something to that mindset. Every element on a page must add value to the user or the business—and ideally, to both. Taken literally, the process of stripping away non-value-adding elements can produce a rather Spartan design. This is where adding some visual texture back into a page comes in. This approach means: The great car designer Colin Chapman famously said, “Simplify, then add lightness.” This principle owes something to that mindset. Every element on a page must add value to the user or the business—and ideally, to both. Taken literally, the process of stripping away non-value-adding elements can produce a rather Spartan design. This is where adding some visual texture back into a page comes in. This approach means: Closely tied to the principle of simplicity, visual hierarchy entails arranging and organizing website elements so that visitors naturally gravitate toward the most important elements first. Remember, when it comes to optimizing for usability and UX, the goal is to lead visitors to complete a desired action, but in a way that feels natural and enjoyable. By adjusting the position, color, or size of certain elements, you can structure your site in such a way that visitors will be drawn to those elements first.  In the example below from Spotify , you can see that the ""Get Spotify Free"" call-to-action sits atop the visual hierarchy. For starters, it's positioned on the left of the page (most visitors scan websites from left to right). What's more, it's the only element above the fold that uses that dark purple color, which naturally draws your attention. Having intuitive navigation on your site is crucial for ensuring visitors can find what they're looking for. Ideally, a visitor should be able to arrive on your site and not have to think extensively about where they should click next -- moving from point A to point B should be as pain-free as possible. Here are a few tips for optimizing your site's navigation: Another pointer: Once you've settled on what your site's main (top) navigation will be, keep it consistent. The labels and location of your navigation should remain the same on each and every page of your site.  Here's an example from the InVision website : And this leads us to our next principle ... In addition to keeping your site's navigation consistent, the overall look and feel of your site should be consistent across all of your site's pages. Backgrounds, color schemes, typefaces, and even the tone of your writing are all areas where being consistent can have a positive impact on usability and UX. That's not to say, however, that every page on your site should have the same exact layout. Instead, you should create different layouts for specific types of pages (e.g., a layout for landing pages, a layout for informational pages, etc.), and by using those layouts consistently, you'll make it easier for visitors to understand what type of information they're likely to find on a given page. In the example below, you can see that  Airbnb uses the same layout for all of its ""Help"" pages  (a common practice). Just imagine what it would be like from a visitor's perspective if every ""Help"" page had its own, unique layout. (It would likely result in a lot of shoulder shrugging.) According to comScore , tablet internet consumption grew 30% between 2013 and 2015. Smartphone internet consumption, meanwhile, grew 78% during the same time period. The takeaway here: In order to provide a truly great user experience, your site needs to be compatible with the different devices (and operating systems,  and  browsers) that your visitors are using. At a high-level, this means investing in a website structure that is highly flexible -- like responsive design. With a responsive site, content is automatically resized and reshuffled to fit the dimensions of whichever device a visitor happens to be using. (HubSpot Marketing customers:  Using  built-in responsive design , HubSpot content built on the COS is automatically optimized for visitors from any device.) At a lower level, improving accessibility can be as simple as adding alt-text to all of your images (so visitors who can't see images in their browsers can still understand what's on the page). Ultimately, it's more important that your website provides a great experience across different platforms as opposed to having to it look identical across those platforms. And that can mean adhering to platform-specific design conventions instead of trying to squeeze in unique elements that users of that platform might not be familiar with. This leads us to our next principle ... There are certain web design conventions which, over the years, internet users have become increasingly familiar with. Such conventions include: While it might be tempting to throw all such design conventions out the window for the sake of being completely original or unique, this would (likely) be a mistake. It'd be akin to putting a car's steering wheel in the backseat, which is to say: it would confuse people. In order to provide the best experience possible for your site's visitors, take advantage of the fact that you already know what types of web experiences they're familiar with. You can use this information to make your site easier for visitors to navigate. One of the most common examples of conventionality in web design: Using a shopping cart icon on an ecommerce site: In the image above, you can see (from left to right) shopping cart icons from Amazon, Wayfair, and Best Buy. Ultimately, using web design conventions -- design elements and strategies that visitors are already familiar with -- can help give your site more credibility. And if you're striving to build a site that provides the best user experience possible, credibility (a.k.a. the amount of trust your site conveys) can go a long way. One of the best ways to improve your site's credibility is to be clear and honest about the product/service you're selling on the site. Don't make visitors have to dig through dozens of pages to find out what it is you actually do. Instead, be up front about it, and dedicate some real estate to explaining the value behind what you do. Another credibility tip: Have a pricing page. While it can be tempting to force people to contact you in order for them to learn more about pricing, having prices listed clearly on your site can definitely make your business seem more trustworthy and legitimate.  Here's an example of a great pricing page from the Box website : At the end of the day, usability and user experience hinge on the preferences of the end users. (After all, if you're not designing for them ... who are you designing for?) So while the principles detailed in this list are a great starting point, the real key to improving the design of your site is to conduct user testing, gather feedback, and make changes based on what you've learned.  Here are a few user testing tools to get you started: (Read this for even more helpful tools.) According to Vitamin T , 68% of visitors fail to convert  because they don't think you care about their experience . So as a final bit of usability/UX wisdom, start caring more! Put yourself into the shoes of your site's visitors and keep them in mind every step of the way. What other principles do you think make for exceptional website design and usability?

2016-04-28,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychology-ecommerce-loyalty-program,The Psychology of Ecommerce: Why Your Loyalty Program May Not Build Loyalty,"Loyalty rewards programs are a staple of retail and ecommerce brands, but what if they’re doing more harm than good? At their most basic, loyalty programs allow customers to accrue points or punch cards until free items or discounts are earned. But what if sometimes a simple “thank you” is all you need? Here’s the problem with a loyalty program that offers rewards of some monetary value: buyers  often find the amount trivial . As in, why even bother? Consider for a moment the price of a fancy coffee. Five dollars sounds about right. Now, the seller of this fancy coffee hands over a punch card when someone buys, and that punch card allows for the reward of a free fancy coffee after ten purchases. Sounds pretty straightforward, until you realize the coffee shop is essentially giving buyers $0.50 as a “thank you.” Framing is everything! You’re probably not going to turn away that free coffee, but there’s a good chance you won’t feel as though the coffee shop actually  appreciates  you when they’re pouring it. Why? Because sometimes a sincere “thank you” goes a lot further than a $0.50 reward. You'll feel more valued if you're working towards those stamps for a free coffee, rather than $0.50 back on your purchase. A recent study asked hotel guests to rate how appreciated they felt upon receiving acknowledgment from the hotel. Part of the guests received a sincere thank you note, while the other part received $0.05 (yes, five cents). The recipients were to rate their feelings on a scale of one to seven. Those who received a verbal thank you ranked their feelings of appreciation at 5.6, while those who received the small monetary gift said they ranked the gesture of appreciation at 4.4. Well, then. Of course, it’s easy to glean one fact from this particular study: the smaller the monetary gift, the more trivial consumers will consider it to be. So, if you simply have to give a larger reward for buyers to feel appreciated, how large are we looking at? Another group was split into sections, with some receiving a verbal thank you, and the rest receiving varying percentages of their purchase price as a reward. Those who received the verbal thank you felt more appreciated than those who received up to 10% of the purchase price as a reward (remember the coffee example from earlier?). However, once the reward tipped into 15% and higher, consumers said they felt more and more appreciated. Consider a points system where customers are rewarded for activities besides purchases and work towards a variety of rewards. For example, you can incentivize activities like leaving a review or sharing something on social media. In return, you can give them early access to sales or free shipping over a certain threshold. There is one reward that may eclipse even the verbal thank you. Remember when we discussed the  Noble Edge Effect , where consumers are more likely to support businesses with a social conscience? Consumers love the chance to give back, which is funny because that’s exactly what you’re trying to do for them, isn’t it?  The  final study shows  that consumers who are allowed to give their small financial gift to a charity will feel almost as appreciated as those who just get a verbal thanks. You get even more than their appreciation, too, since those buyers will see you as a socially conscious company and resolve to support you as often as possible. This one seems like a win-win, right? In truth, balancing rewards, customer loyalty, and your genuine appreciation can be difficult. Pay attention to what your customers really want and then give it to them. Remember that loyalty goes both ways—they want you to be loyal to them, as well.

2016-04-30,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-calendar-feature-goals,You Can Now Set Goals in Google Calendar: Here's How to Set It Up,"While setting and working towards personal goals is often hailed as a way to stay motivated and productive, the science behind goal-setting paints a different picture.  For starters,  a study from the University of Liverpool  revealed a connection between depression and setting generalized, abstract goals. It turns out that when we don't have precise criteria for what it means to achieve a goal, it's difficult to ever feel a sense of accomplishment.  It's like kicking a soccer ball toward a goal line, but the goal line keeps moving further and further backwards. Couple that with the fact that,  as psychologist Robert Cialdini explained in his best-selling book  Influence , sticking to any goal you set is incredibly difficult -- unless you take the time to write your goals down and/or share them publicly. Fortunately for all of us who have been struggling with defining and sticking to our goals, Google has released a new feature for Google Calendar that can help. It's called ""Goals,"" and it could be the solution to the goal setting problems I outlined above. Google announced the addition of the ""Goals"" feature  to its Google Calendar application on April 12, 2016. The feature lets you set clearly defined goals (e.g., ""practice speaking French three times per week"") and then Google Calendar automatically schedules those goals based on when you have open slots in your calendar. When you're setting a goal, you also have control over how much time you want to dedicate to each session. Just like with a meeting, you can have a goal session last 15 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, or however long you want. You can also specify what time of day -- morning, afternoon, or evening -- you'd prefer to work on your goals. What happens if a new meeting pops up on your calendar in the spot where a goal session has been scheduled? No, you don't get to use that meeting as an excuse (any more) for skipping out on your goals. Instead, Google Calendar automatically reschedules that goal session for you. (Source:  Google ) The same thing happens if you decide to defer a session. Instead of disappearing from your calendar, that session gets automatically rescheduled. And as you keep using the Goals feature, Google Calendar gets better at understanding your scheduling preferences, so it can provide more personalized scheduling. One caveat here: You can only  create  goals using the Google Calendar application on an iPhone, iPad, or Android device. That being said, you can still view, edit, and -- if needed -- defer goal sessions using Google Calendar on a desktop or laptop.  Now that you have a basic understanding of what Google Calendar's ""Goals"" feature is all about, let's go through the steps of actually creating a goal. Once your goal is set and you've landed on the confirmation screen (see above), you can fine-tune your goal settings by tapping that ""More Options"" link. From there you'll be able to edit notifications, colors, and more. When you're finished, goal sessions will start appearing on your calendar and you'll be off to the races (or off to French lessons, depending on your goal).

2016-05-02,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-resources,11 Helpful Resources for Improving Your Business Skills,"Whether or not business school is worth the investment is a hot topic these days. But regardless of where you stand, you don't have to go to business school to gain a better understanding of how businesses work. ""Business"" is quite a versatile topic with many components. There's a lot that goes into becoming more business-savvy, whether it's learning the ""softer"" skills (like people management and public speaking) or mastering the ""hard"" skills (like accounting and finance). Aside from studying for a formal degree, where can you go to learn about and practice these important business skills? Turns out, there are a whole lot of resources, both online and offline, where you can hone your business skills, learn new strategies, and make sure you're staying on top of the ever-evolving business world. Here are 11 of the best resources out there to help you become more business-savvy. Having a career mentor (or a few career mentors) with business experience is a crucial part of your professional development. Opportunities are attached to people. Your mentor can provide you with support and advice when you need it -- and, if you choose wisely, they'll learn how to deliver that support in a way that makes sense to you. One key to finding a great mentor is to have some clear goals in mind for the type of experience you want your mentor to have. Are you looking for someone who works in an industry you're interested in learning more about? Someone with experience in raising capital for a new business? Someone who's senior to you at your current company? Once you have a goal or two in mind, there are many ways to actually find a mentor. Don't just go straight for the most visible and well-known (and probably busiest) people. Instead, take a look at your own network and keep an eye out for folks you respect with relevant experience. You can search your network on LinkedIn -- which means you'll first want to  update and clean up your own LinkedIn profile . If you find someone who isn't a direct connection,  send a personal message with your connection request , or  ask for an introduction from a mutual connection . But sometimes, it's as simple as asking your friends and peers who they think would be great for you to talk to. Then, you can  ask for an email introduction . My last tip here? Keep it local. While online mentorship is great, relationships grounded in quality time in-person time are usually a lot more effective. Even better, get out of the office and into an environment that's more conducive to relaxing and candid conversation, like a coffee shop or a lunch place. (If you're on the other side of the mentor-mentee relationship,  read this blog post to learn how to be an amazing mentor .) While content is getting more and more snackable these days, there's still a whole lot of power in a great book. The research and writing and editing required to publish a book -- especially a best-seller -- is far more impressive than what goes in to an article or podcast.  But, of course, there's an overwhelming number of business books out there for choose from. And given how much time it actually takes it read a book from cover to cover, you'll want to make sure you're making the most of your time. So ... where better to go for the best books on business than the plethora of syllabi from Harvard Business School? To help you narrow down your search, my colleague Lauren Hintz combed through these syllabi for the 11 most intriguing books on HBS students' required reading lists. I've listed a few of these books below, but  read her roundup  for the full list with summaries. One way to learn from experienced business leaders and innovators who have first-hand knowledge of the business world is to find and watch recordings of their talks online. TED, for instance,  has some really compelling talks about business strategy  you can watch for free. Here's one from Bill Gross, a man who's founded many startups and incubated many others, on why some fail and others succeeded based on data from hundreds of companies: There's also a lot you can learn about business from graduation speeches, from  Michael Lewis' speech at Princeton  about the profound connection between success and luck, to  Marissa Meyers' speech at Illinois Institute of Technology  about the importance of asking the right questions, surrounding yourself with the right people, and finding the courage to do things that are uncomfortable.  Here's a list of eight inspiring graduation speeches  with valuable business lessons you should definitely watch. Finally, we have recorded lectures series from graduate business schools, featuring top business and government leaders from around the world. These may not be as exciting or glamorous as TED talks or graduation speeches, but many of them get into the nitty-gritty details of business strategy -- the hard skills that the other types of talks don't tend to get into. While most of the live lectures are closed to non-students, many of them are posted online later. Here are a few speaker series to get you started: Let's not beat around the bush here: Public speaking is a required business skill. There's a critical value in being willing and able to communicate effectively with your team, investors, customers, and so on.  A research study showed  that  70% of employed Americans who give presentations agree that presentation and public speaking skills are critical to their success at work.  Some say the other 30% just don't know it yet. You can start by reading about public speaking, like in  this helpful guide of public speaking tips , or  this uneasy speaker's guide to confident public speaking . But this is one skill where practice is crucial -- which is why you should join some sort of public speaking club or group if you're serious about making measurable improvements. Toastmasters  is probably the best public speaking club out there. When you join, you're put on a track where you can regularly deliver speeches, get feedback, lead teams, and participate in improvisational speaking games in a super supportive atmosphere. Plus, these clubs are all over the world -- more than  15,400 different Toastmasters clubs  in 135 countries worldwide, to be more precise -- and you can  use their ""Find a Club"" tool  to find the one closest to you. If you're willing to step out of your comfort zone, there's actually a lot you can learn from improv about business. It can teach you how to react and adapt to new situations, how to become a better listener -- perhaps most importantly -- how to stop fearing failure. Improv classes are offered in cities and towns all over the world. Try searching on Google for ""improv classes"" + the name of your city, like ""improv classes Boston."" ( Here are some more Google search tips  to help you narrow it down.) If you need some more inspiration, check out  the INBOUND15 Bold Talk below by Dave Delaney , a seasoned improv performer and author of  New Business Networking.  In it, he talks all about how improvisation can improve your networking, creativity, communication, teamwork, and leadership skills. There are a lot of resources for soft skills in here. But what about the hard skills that are so critical to business knowledge, like finance, accounting, marketing, and operations? For these skills, which require absorption of new information, repetition, and practice, we recommend taking more formal approach. There are plenty of places you can pay to take online business classes. Coursera, for example, has  a four-class specialization package called ""Wharton Business Foundations,""  which includes four online classes from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business in accounting, finance, operations, and marketing. But if you're looking for a high-quality resource for online courses that's  free,  well ...  Khan Academy  is the easy winner. Their whole mantra is that you can learn anything for free -- and,  like Facebook , they claim their services will always be free. Their courses are a myriad of lectures, interactive exercises. And their businesses courses include, but are not limited to, courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, finance and capital markets, and entrepreneurship. Simply  go their homepage  and click ""Subjects"" from the top navigation bar, choose ""Economics and finance,"" and then click the topic you want to study. But their business-related courses aren't limited to the ones in these categories. Use the search bar to find specific course topics -- from the fluffier stuff, like  ""Turning a Hobby Into a Bright Business,""  to the more complex, like  ""Derivative and Marginal Cost."" Another great place to learn hard skills like investments and accounting is Investopedia, a site dedicated to educating people about finance. There's great content everywhere on their site, but I want to point your attention in particular to  Investopedia's ""Guides"" section . This is where you can find a whole slew of guides on everything from accounting basics to valuing employee stock options to how to write a business plan. Their dictionary  -- which is how Investopedia started, by the way -- is also a great resource for when you come across finance-related terms you aren't familiar with. When you educate yourself on what an Angel Fund is, or how to invest capital back into your business, you'll all a lot more value.  Each definition page includes a sentence or two defining the term, a breakdown of what it means, a list of related terms (for example, on the page for ""leading indicator,"" you'll find a link to ""lagging indicator""), related content like blog posts, and any related videos. Whereas Investopedia and Khan Academy cover more of the accounting, finance, and operations-related material, HubSpot Academy is a great place to go for marketing and sales skills. Taking the time to hone these skills will allow you to better understand how businesses work and oversee areas of a business, even if you don't completely master them. HubSpot Academy offers  a few online certification courses  that are free and open to anyone, whether or not you use HubSpot's software. Each class includes training videos, helpful documents, quizzes, and a final exam you need to pass to get your certification. Bonus: You can also get a Google Analytics certification for free by  taking Google's GA proficiency course online , and then passing the Google Analytics IQ exam.  Business podcasts serve as a great way to stay informed and inspired when you're on-the-go, like on a run or during your commute. You can tune into everything from one-on-one interviews with today’s top leaders to recaps of the day’s most pressing business news. To save you some time, here's a list of some of the best business-related podcasts out there: ( Here's a list  with even more business podcast suggestions.) Carefully crafted business content is great, but sometimes, getting business news, opinions, and quotables in the form of a quick tweet is exactly the kind of snackable information you're looking for. If you want to  just  see the content from your favorite Twitter users separate from everyone else, you can create a Twitter list or stream. Now that you've made your lists ... whom do you add to them? There's a lot of crap out there on Twitter. It's best to narrow down people tweeting out  the best of the best  content about business. For that, I turn to  Kavi Gupta , an investment banker for Merrill Lynch who's spent some considerable time narrowing down  the top Twitter profiles for business content . Here are four of his favorite people to follow on Twitter for good business content: Managing Partner in Asia for We Are Social, Kemp tweets out research he finds on social media, mobile penetration, and internet-related behaviors all over the world -- especially in South East Asia. In his tweets, he likes to single out the most important slide from a given slide deck rather than making followers sift through an entire presentation. Does social media really work for  #B2B  marketing?  https://t.co/aEkLxJKtfc   pic.twitter.com/KZrH8K9z1x Subrahmanyam (or Subbu for short) is Gupta's  Wall Street Journal, Economic Times,  and  Reuters  guy. He has a knack for finding the best business information from these media sources, while also adding his own, summarized insights from whatever article he's tweeting. He also tends to screenshot the most quotable parts of a post to draw readers in to the full article. Moving fast.

What he likes most about her Twitter style is that you don't have to click out and away from your feed to get her content -- because, most of the time, she's tweeting visuals, statements, and thoughts without many links. 2016: the year VCs switched from Medium/Twitter to Snapchat as a platform for their thought leadership You know as well as I do how much content there is about business on the internet these days. Some of it is really good, and some of it is crap -- and both sides of the quality coin can be found on the same website. But if you're looking for a resource that constantly puts out high-quality content about business,  Harvard Business Review   (HBR)  is your source. Their articles, both online and in print, are always written by experts, and their most popular topics include managing people, leadership, strategy, communication, innovation, technology, entrepreneurship, and other business topics. If you like reading and you have some extra money to spend, some of the material in HBR's online store might be worth the investment. For example, editors at HBR created  a box set of ""must-reads""  from combing through hundreds of articles and selected what they believe are the most important ones to help you maximize both you and your organization's performance.

You want to be sure that whatever you're working towards is measurable, impactful, and challenging enough to keep you on your toes. Trouble is, the planning process is only half the battle.  When it actually comes time to achieve said goal, it's easy for things to fall apart. Think back to those New Year's resolutions you set. Does the phrase  grossly overestimated  come to mind? NBA legend Bill Walton, knows the intricacies of both setting and achieving goals all too well. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that he was coached by one of the best coaches in history -- John Wooden -- who was committed to helping him succeed both on and off the court.  On  this week’s episode of The Growth Show , we sat down with Walton to learn more about how Wooden's influence helped him devise a process for successfully tackling even his most ambitious goals. While there are plenty of strategies out there for setting goals, the process of actually hitting those goals can seem like a much more ambiguous path. How do we solidify the path to then hit our goals? “Ask somebody who is on their way back,"" suggests  Walton. Walton is on his way back, so we asked him on your behalf. Let's take a look at his process below.  What's the key to getting started? “Have a dream,” Walton told us.  When you have a dream in mind, it becomes much easier to define a measurable goal -- or set of goals -- to get you there. Once you have a defined goal, you can use it to determine where to  devote your focus  and what to prioritize.  Need help defining your goal?  This free goal-setting template  should make it a bit easier.  The next step? “Choose a teacher, a leader, or a coach,"" suggests Walton.  Even the most successful leaders have had mentors along the way. And the words of the ideal mentor will resonate years beyond their physical presence. In fact, if they've done their due diligence, you should walk away from the relationship with a toolbox full of lessons to carry with you.  The hard part? Finding the right person. When searching for a trusted advisor, you want to look for someone who has achieved something that you can learn from. While it's possible that this person might be a peer, mentors tend to be senior to their mentees.  If you're having trouble determining what to look for in a mentor,  check out this post on mentorship tips  from my colleague Lindsay.  Ready to tackle the third step? Walton says you need to, “Join a team and immerse yourself in [that] positive culture.” Creating a team gives you the advantage of approaching your goal with a diverse perspective. For example, I played on a collegiate hockey team and one of our biggest strengths was knowing how to leverage our unique skills to perform as a strong, cohesive unit. This type of approach allows everyone to bring something different to the table while encouraging each individual to expand their perspective. Besides the individual growth value, you will be able to hit your goal faster. Need advice on putting together a team? Here’s a  free kit to help you build your inbound team . By now, you're on the right track. To keep moving forward, Walton suggests that you, “Develop the individual foundation -- assuming and understanding that the strength of the team is the strength of the individual."" In other words, now that you have reinforcement to help you accomplish your goal, you need to leverage it. But this doesn't mean that you should delegate every task on your own plate. In fact, you'll benefit from keeping busy yourself:  According to Yerkes Dodson Law , increased mental arousal can help you improve your performance. Instead, lean on your teammates to help you sharpen your  breadth of skills . Try to soak up bits of knowledge from each of their areas of expertise to help you devise a well-rounded plan for accomplishing your goal. Walton's final tip? “Have the willingness to sacrifice and discipline.” This one may fall under the category of easier said than done. It can be difficult to get  yourself in the zone  -- especially if it’s 3 p.m. on a Friday -- but this is where you can save yourself some serious time. The better you are at  finding your “flow,”  the easier it will be to enter that space when you need it most. The other half of this is being comfortable saying “no.” No to leaving work early, no to taking on that extra project, and no to staying up late to watch Netflix. Trust me, learning how and when to say ""no"" will save you a ton of time and energy.  The lesson? Define not only your goal, but also the path to achieve said goal. And as you build out that path, don't hesitate to look for opportunities to pick up support from mentors or teammates -- it'll make all the difference.  Want more advice on how to hit your goals?

2016-05-03,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seth-godin-lessons,"3 Valuable Lessons From Seth Godin on Failure, Permission Marketing & What It Means to Be Remarkable","Trying to nail down Seth Godin's greatest strength is no easy task. He's a brilliant author, marketer, speaker, and entrepreneur, but above all that, he's truly mastered the art of getting straight to the point.  Have you seen  his blog ? He carefully boils each post down to a few hundred words. No fluff. No fancy sentences. Just perfectly distilled lessons.  Whether he's writing a blog post, delivering a speech, teaching a class, or giving an interview, he holds true to this way of doing things. And his recent interview with CreativeLive was certainly no exception.  As part of the  30 Days of Genius series , CreativeLive sat down with Godin to discuss everything from failure to permission marketing to what it takes to be truly remarkable. Below you'll find a peek into this discussion ... As a marketer, it's easy to identify with the fear of failure. When you're stepping outside of your comfort zone -- whether you're trying a new tool or experimenting with a new medium -- it's hard not to worry about the ""what ifs."" Over the years, you learn how to live with that little fear in the back of your head. You need to. If you don't, you'll find it's seemingly impossible to think outside of the box and take risks. As Godin so clearly articulates it, “The challenge with letting your genius out, is that it might not work. And that expression, ‘it might not work,’ is super hard to say out loud.” Godin goes on to explain the psychological power behind why he regularly tells himself that his next big creative risk, simply might not work. Rather than trying to convince others that a new endeavor --  like his radically different  altMBA online workshop , for example -- will be an immediate success, Godin makes it very clear there is always the possibility of painful failure. That's just what happens when you take a business risk. Instead of burying that fear of failure, he challenges himself to dance with his fears. He explains, “The fear is hardwired into us, for good reason. And the thing is, we’re just mistaken. You had a reason to be afraid during the Spanish Inquisition. You have a reason to be afraid if a baseball bat is flying into the stands.” However, when it comes to taking creative risks and stepping outside of your comfort zone,  we really don’t have that much to lose . It’s not a life­-or-­death type of decision. All too often, we allow our primal fears to negatively impact our decision­ making process when it comes to things as simple as public speaking, publishing a blog post, or trusting your instinct on a critical business decision. When in fact, the act of reminding yourself that you simply do not have all the answers, and that failure is a very real possibility, is a vital personal development stage in progression towards becoming a better version of yourself. Godin has an incredibly simple definition of what permission marketing really is: “Would they miss you, if you were gone?” He continues, “those people­­ -- the ones you’re seeking to have an impact on -- would they miss you if you didn’t show up tomorrow? Would they miss you if this new product or new project didn’t come to the world?” In a world where we tend to obsess over things like high open rates and strong clickthroughs, Godin challenges us to look a level deeper and decide whether or not we have genuine permission to interact with our customers, leads, and subscribers ... or if we’re simply being tolerated by them. If you're struggling with defining a sound strategy, ask yourself the question: “Would my subscribers miss me? Would I receive one, ten, or one hundred emails from them if they didn’t receive my email this week?” How you answer that question will tell you a lot about the depth of the relationship you have with your community. Remarkable. You've heard the word tossed around in meetings, snuck into blog titles, and worked into recommendation letters. You've probably used it a few times yourself. But what does it really mean?  “It’s really easy to do that thing that people notice. That’s not remarkable, the way I use the phrase,” Godin begins. The way he sees it, there's a stark difference between doing something that simply gets noticed, and doing something that’s truly remarkable. When you do something remarkable, people begin telling others, and the word about what you’re doing spreads in a very genuine manner. But getting people talking is only half the battle. Godin’s analogy is that it’s easy to get noticed by wearing plaid to a funeral. But is that remarkable? Absolutely not. The real challenge is to get people to remark about what you’re doing, but to do so in exactly the way you want them to. Now, it’s entirely different when it comes to strategically crafting what you want your audience to say, after they see or hear your message. “If we want them to say, ‘you need to see this, it will transform you,’ or if we want them to say, ‘can you believe how generous that act was?’ if we want them to say, ‘this is the new fresh thing,’ then go build that,” Godin explains. What's more, you need to very thoughtful about the creation process. You need to create your work in a way that inspires others to share it -- in a way that helps you grow. To do that, Godin explains, “We have to be serious enough about the process [of creating great work], that we’re proud of what we made, and we did it in a way that the kind of person we care about, tells someone else.” This is the true definition of creating impactful work. This type of work is different in that it’s inherently viral within the communities who deeply care about the subject matter.  And in Godin's eyes, that's the type of work you want to strive for. That's the work that matters.  Want more from Seth Godin?  Check out the full '30 Days of Genius' interview from CreativeLive here .

2016-05-04,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/new-managers-leadership-guide,The New Manager's Guide to Effective Leadership,"Congratulations! You’ve recently been promoted to a new position as a manager. You now have a team, perhaps the opportunity to hire, and the chance to guide and grow your new direct reports. Are you ready for this? You may be feeling excited, afraid, nervous, or empowered.  You may also be experiencing the very common  imposture syndrome : the fear of getting caught as a “fraud” due to not being competent or fully prepared to deserve your new position. But here you are, and the best thing you can do is to lean in to this experience as an opportunity for your own development.  To start, here are a few recommendations that I learned from my mentors when I began as a new manager. From finding your leadership style to learning how to navigate a working relationship, these tips are meant to help you get off on the right foot.  ( Not sure if management is right for you? Try  HubSpot’s career growth assessment  to discover your next career move. ) One of the biggest challenges when going from individual contributor to people manager is having to change the way you value your own impact. Every day prior to this promotion you were evaluated on the impact you personally had on the business. From here on out, you’re evaluated on the impact driven by your collective team. This comes with some good news and some “bad” news: To help yourself enter this mindset, you have the opportunity to define how you will  be  as a leader. What your personal style will be? To start, visualize what your interactions with your teammates will be like, how you’ll carry yourself, and how you’ll communicate. For example, you can ask yourself: By answering these questions for yourself, you’ll be able to develop your leadership persona or the best portrait of yourself as a leader. Write it down, reread it from time to time, and do your best to encompass this new state. The next step is to decide how you’ll work with each of your employees, and I believe the best relationships are driven by clarity and curiosity. Let’s first dig into the latter. If you’ve inherited a team you used to work with laterally, or were promoted within your current team, you most likely already know your new direct reports pretty well. However, do you know them  enough ? What don’t you know? What else can you learn?  I suggest one of the first things you do is to have a second interview with each of your direct reports. Grab coffee, go for a walk, and use that time to really get to know that person. If it helps, here are a few things you can ask: The best favor you can do for yourself now, and onward, is to never assume anything about another person. Instead ask. For example, imagine you were giving an employee a brand new project. Perhaps your instinct is to walk them through how to do it step-by-step. Why wouldn't you? You've never given her this type of project before. But how do you know if that’s really the amount of support they need? Before deciding how you can best help, ask them if they’ve done something like this before and gauge their true comfort level. That way you’ll know to be hands-on or hands-off with your direction. Now let’s talk about clarity. Think back to a prior boss that never seemed happy with your work. Why do you think that was? Perhaps it’s because you never really knew what she was looking for, or you didn’t have a full understanding of her expectations. (Or worse, maybe she hadn’t decided what her expectations of you actually were.) One of the best things you can do as a new manager is set context and goals as clearly as possible. And that might begin with taking the time to make a bunch of decisions on your own first. For example: Communicating your expectations clearly will remove ambiguity and set up your employee for success. Most likely when you get promoted, you’ll need to figure out how to move all the work you used to do off your plate. And you may do that by delegating those projects to your new team. That’s great! The question is if you can do this in a way that supports you  and them. Delegating projects is a great opportunity to help someone grow into your old shoes. See if you can help someone reach the role you were previously in. If you do, it will free up your time to make higher-level decisions and support the team as a whole. It also means the person receiving the project can stretch and learn work they may not have done before. Sounds like a win-win? It absolutely can be, but there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it. In order to solve for a person’s long-term growth, you need to delegate a project in a way that helps him become a decision maker versus a task do-er. How do you know which is happening? It depends on the way you teach. Are you helping someone memorize a series of actions (most likely to execute a project in the same way you used to do it), or are you taking the time to explain your judgment around the project? The latter requires you to share context for why you take different actions this way. Note: There’s nothing wrong with teaching someone how to do something step-by-step. Just make sure you’re explaining your decision-making behind it, so a teammate walks away with the same judgment you have. That very judgment hopefully can be applied to similar projects. Now they’re a decision maker.  Being a new manager is hard -- and that’s to be expected. The best thing you can do for yourself is communicate clearly and frequently, make yourself open to feedback from your team and your boss, and use your resources. Perhaps you can get a group of other new managers together and grab lunch. It's great to talk with folks who are in a similar scenario to reflect on your experiences -- if only to know you're not alone. You can also look into trainings in your area. Would your boss support you going to a one-day training here and there?  You could also suggest setting up skip-level reviews, meaning your direct reports meet with your boss every so often to share their feedback on you. This can be extremely helpful. Perhaps there's a small thing you could change or improve that would make all the difference. Wouldn't you like to know that?  Most importantly -- and my favorite --  find a mentor . It could be someone inside or outside of your company, as long as it's someone you really trust. Nothing beats one-to-one guidance.  Remember: Being a good manager doesn’t require knowing all the answers. Stay open minded and confident in yourself. You’ll be great.

2016-05-03,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-does-not-mean-just-build-a-website,"Digital Does Not Mean ""Just Build a Website""","Many traditional publishers have prematurely thrown in the towel on digital. “I have a website, but no one wants to advertise on it.” “I have an iPad version of my print magazine, but only a tiny fraction of my audience subscribes.” “I have made pdf’s of all my articles but no one is downloading them.” The problem is not that content creators cannot make money in digital. The problem is digital facsimiles of print products are not what the customer wants. Data support this. For example, according to the  Alliance for Audited Media , digital editions represent  only 3.8 percent of total circulation  (paid, verified and analyzed nonpaid). Even for the top 25  best selling  digital editions,  digital accounts for only 12 percent of total circulation .  Many publishers view digital as a technical problem to solve. These companies follow the “if you build it, they will come” mentality. Because they have a digital edition, a website, and maybe even a mobile app, they think “mission accomplished.  The mindset needs to shift. Consumers don’t want a digital edition for the sake of having a digital edition. Digital consumers have a new set of needs, which I bucket in three areas: context, curation, and customization. Content companies need to build products that address these three psychological needs to appeal to the digital consumer. As a digital society, we would definitely fail the infamous  “marshmallow test”  conducted by Stanford in the late 1960s. Are you familiar with this study? Psychologist Walter Mischel offered a child a choice between one small reward (e.g., a marshmallow) immediately or a larger reward if they waited for a short period. The researchers found that children who were able to wait longer went on to become more successful in life.  The digital consumer wants whatever, whenever, wherever. We’re not willing to wait a month or two for the next issue to arrive in the mail. We’re not willing to wait until we get home to view an article on our desktop because it’s unreadable on our phone. We might get distracted or change our mind if the checkout process is too complex. To evaluate if you are whatever, whenever, wherever for your audience, start with these three questions: Responsive design is the method of designing web pages that automatically appear in their optimized form on all devices ( click here for a more detailed definition from HubSpot ). In other words, be where the consumer wants you to be – desktop, mobile, tablet, and whatever comes next. What does your content look across devices?  Check out this website to see . Mobile has surpassed desktop and now  represents 51% of traffic . If you are not designing responsively, you are leaving money on the table. Without responsive design, you’ll likely have a large difference in bounce rate (the percentage of visitors who navigate away from your site after viewing only one page) between your desktop and mobile products. You can use  Google Analytics  to measure bounce rate if you are not doing so already. No one wants to pinch and zoom pdf files to be able to read them on his or her phone. Invest in responsive design. Research by Professor Ramesh Sitaraman  found we are only willing to wait two seconds when it comes to video load times. After that, abandonment rates skyrocket. You’ll lose half your audience if load times get to ten seconds. On this theme, Amazon found  increased revenue of 1% for every 100 milliseconds  improvement to their site speed. Facebook and Google capitalize on user impatience with their  Instant Articles  and  Accelerated Mobile Pages  products. There is a lot of literature on improving performance, and I found  this blog entry from The Daily Egg  straightforward for those who want some practical tips. With Uber, you press a button to call a car; with Open Table, you press a button to make a restaurant reservation; with Amazon, you  press a button, and more Tide gets shipped to your house . How can you make your user experience at the moment of truth as smooth as possible? Ask your payment processors about their ability to vault credit card numbers, so you don’t have to re-ask for this information (think about how many times you used Amazon one-click buying on an impulse). HubSpot recommends a process called “ progressive profiling ” in which you ask for as little information as possible upfront (for example, just an email address) and in future engagements, ask for additional details (e.g., mailing address, income level, preferences). Do you have a user experience designer on staff or a consultant helping you with removing roadblocks? I can assure you the ROI is there. Marketing expert  Mark Schaefer  coined the phrase “ content shock ” which in essence means publishers are creating more content than audiences could possibly consume. According to Schaeffer, we already consume nearly 10 hours of content per day. Since there are only so many hours in a day (and we need to sleep, eat, work), there is a limit on how much more we can take in. Yet, the amount of information on the web is expected to increase by 500 percent in the next five years. Supply will outstrip demand. On top of this, in  The Paradox of Choice , author Barry Schwartz  explains why too much choice has proven to be  detrimental  to our psychological well-being. He says eliminating choices can greatly reduce stress.  Here is a summary  of one experiment Schwartz described to illustrate his point: “When researchers set up [in a gourmet food store] a display featuring a line of exotic, high-quality jams, customers who came by could taste samples, and they were given a coupon for a dollar off if they bought a jar. In one condition of the study, 6 varieties of the jam were available for tasting. In another, 24 varieties were available. In either case, the entire set of 24 varieties was available for purchase. The large array of jams attracted more people to the table than the small array, though in both cases people tasted about the same number of jams on average. When it came to buying, however, a huge difference became evident. Thirty percent of the people exposed to the small array of jams actually bought a jar; only 3 percent of those exposed to the large array of jams did so.” As content creators, let’s help society cut through the surplus of information and reduce anxiety while we are at it. It is all about curation.  Many media companies have had the idea to put all their content on their website, both in front of and behind a paywall. However, to maximize the benefit for the consumer, you need to provide some guidance. For example, while I was the COO of America’s Test Kitchen, we added a daily digest to the Cook’s Illustrated homepage, which inspired cooks with new ideas, and helped them navigate the database of tens of thousands of recipes. Many publications, like the  Wall Street Journal , have daily emails that highlight the most relevant stories based on subscriber’s interest profile.  Curation also applies to online learning products. Consumers can get lost in a sea of options if there is no tracking or curriculum.  DataCamp  provides a good example of curation done right. They have well-organized course modules, and it is clear which classes are prerequisites of others. So before you slap together a myriad of content on your site, think about how you can pave a path for your audience. Provide some structure to help the discover the full value of your content. This is where big data comes in. According to  McKinsey , data-driven tailoring of digital experiences can drive an ROI of 15-20%. However, I have seen much larger increases (50%+) in my work with smaller companies. Consumers expect personalization. The days of “batch and blast” marketing campaigns are over (that is, sending the same promotion to all customers), and I expect “batch and blast” user experiences will soon follow in the footsteps of these untailored marketing campaigns. The New York Times (NYT) publishes over 300 pieces of content every day and  uses advanced analytical techniques  to make personal recommendations. First, they use a model to classify every article as a mixture of various topics (e.g., politics, environment) based on the words in the text. For example, if the word “tree” appears a lot, it is likely an article about the environment. The NYT data scientists also model each reader’s theme preferences based on viewing history. They then adjust the article’s classification based on actual behavior, in case the vocabulary was ambiguous or allegorical (which would lead to errors in mechanical classification). So, if the model initially predicts an article is about art, but people who like politics are engaging with it, the model adjust the classification accordingly. Can’t afford a data science team? There are other software platforms that can help you personalize user experiences. found their personalization features sparked a  42% increase in conversion for personalized  vs. impersonal content. There are  dozens of companies  that provide this software, and the right one for you would depend on your size and technical sophistication. Can’t afford personalization software? You can fake it ‘til you make it. Simply ask visitors to identify themselves on your homepage, e.g., “Is your skill level Novice, Intermediate, or Advanced?” and direct the experience accordingly. Alternatively, you can think about obvious segmentations based on data you already have. For example, you can regionalize your website based on IP address. You can have a different experience for logged in vs. not logged in viewers. Presumably, those who are not logged in are less familiar with your brand and seeking more introductory or background material. What about differences based on day of the week or time of day? So, the next time you think about dismissing digital, take a deep breath. Think about what your company can do to drive conversion, retention, and lifetime value by giving digital customers what they are seeking. The digital consumer wants your content in any context, the need your help curating the information, and they will engage more if you personalize the experience for them. Just creating a pdf of your magazine or newspaper will not ultimately satisfy them.

So why is it that many websites are still chock full of the elements that so many visitors have bemoaned over and over? Perhaps with the sheer excitement (or terror, depending on your personality) that comes with designing your own website, all of the user experience quirks that have driven you crazy over the years escape your mind. But poor user experience can cause high page abandonment rates, low visitor-to-lead conversion rates, poor organic search listing positions, and a plain ol' bad reputation.

 So we compiled a list of the 17 most annoying things we've seen on websites to act as a sort of guide for what   not   to do when designing your website. Let's take a look at the worst offenders! Our shortening attention spans are not just making us check our phones several hundred times per day; they're also making us really impatient when it comes to waiting for websites to load.  According to a KISSmetrics report ,  47% of consumers expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and 40% abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load.  Even a one-second delay decreases customer satisfaction by about 16%. Slow loading time frustrates your site visitors and affects conversion rate and brand perception -- especially for mobile users, who are sometimes relying on slower cellular internet connections when browsing the web. How does slow load time impact brand perception, you might be wondering?  According to an Ericsson study , the longer it takes a website to load, the more website visitors blame the content provider instead of their mobile service providers. But if you want people to stick around your website, you're going to have to put optimizing your site's load performance at the top of your to-do list. Page load time can be impacted by image size, code, videos, and other factors.  Learn how to monitor and improve page load time in general here , and  learn more about improving the page load time of your mobile website here . When browsing the internet on a mobile phone, have you ever been forced to scroll from side-to-side to read copy on a website? Or have you had to pinch-to-zoom because the words or buttons on a page were way too small? These are all examples of the painful UX people can have on websites that aren't optimized for mobile.  Google announced a major mobile algorithm update  in summer 2015 that penalizes websites that aren't mobile-friendly, and  it announced it would strengthen the ranking signal  from mobile-friendly websites starting on May 1, 2016. A big part of why Google continues to make these changes is to improve the web browsing experience for mobile users. So if your site isn’t optimized for mobile devices, you'll likely lose out significantly in the organic search rankings. Can you really afford to miss out on all that traffic and all those sales? It's unlikely.  Learn more about choosing a mobile optimization approach here . ( HubSpot customers:  The HubSpot Website Platform uses responsive design, has automatic image compression, and is backed by our CDN for loading your website really quickly -- so you don't need to worry about these things.) When someone lands on your site, do they know what to do? Where to go? What their next steps should be? While this might seem like a no-brainer,  research by Small Business Trends suggests  that  80% of small B2B business websites lacked a call-to-action  -- as recently as 2013. They weren't missing out on leads and sales because their CTAs were poorly written; they were missing out because they simply didn't provide any direction on their website or ask people to click around. Include clear headline copy, jargonless page copy that explains the value of what you do, and a clear primary call-to-action that shows visitors how to take the next steps -- whether that's subscribing to your blog, getting a free trial, watching a video, or any other action you hope visitors will perform on your site. As for your actual navigation bar,  read this blog post to learn how to nail down the perfect website navigation , including how to phrase your navigation copy, how to analyze visitor flow, and more. Excessive pop-ups that disrupt the reading experience can be seriously annoying -- especially when the CTA copy is made to guilt-trip you. You know, the ones that include a button that says something like, ""No thanks, I don't want to improve my website."" Can't they just let you live your life? If you're going to use pop-ups there  is  a right way: An alternative to pop-ups altogether? Slide-in CTAs, which are small banners that slide in from the side or bottom of the page with a call-to-action. They tend to be less obtrusive, providing users with more information while still allowing them to continue reading the piece of content. This one from  Wait But Why  says it all: Shhhh ... I wasn't supposed to be on this site at work! If someone's enjoying what they thought was a silent browsing session and they're bombarded with your theme song or a talking head on a video for which they didn't press ""play"" -- especially if they can't find the button for ""stop"" -- what do you think they're going to do? Some might fumble for their mute button ... but I can more easily locate the back button in my browser than my computer's volume controls. Although Facebook and Twitter now autoplay videos in our feeds, note that they're always on mute unless users choose to unmute them. Extend the same courtesy to your visitors by not forcing your multimedia content on them. Either let them choose when to play it, or at the very least have it start with the sound off. You're probably familiar with  the blink test  by now. You know, the three seconds users have to orient themselves on any given web page before they click ""back"" in their browser. Animations, autoplay videos, blinking and flashing paid advertisements, and other interactive entertainment may seem really cool, but if they're too obtrusive or disorienting, they can detract from a visitor's focus during those critical three seconds. Keep any animations on your website simple, like  the one below from this blog post .  This is a simple animated GIF that catches the reader's eye without being too distracting. (If you want to learn how to make animated GIFs like this one using Photoshop,  here's a simple tutorial .) You may already know that  using images is great for your inbound marketing . So when it comes to adding images to your website, you go browsing and ... find this gem: Hmm. Are we supposed to believe these people work at your company? And are they always  that  happy about work? This is  an example of a bad stock photo.  Bad stock photos are generic at best, and ridiculous at worst. Images are helpful if they clarify something for a visitor, and generic stock photography doesn't help visitors or your business.  It's much better to show real pictures of customers, employees, your company, your product, and your location. If you don't have any of those,  browse this list of the best free, non-cheesy stock photo websites . If you're particularly design savvy, you can create visuals yourself that directly relate to what you do. ( Download this beginner's guide to visual content creation  if you need some extra guidance.) A 'Contact Us' form may seem like an easy way to generate an opt-in email list, but it's really the least valuable form of lead generation for you and your site visitors. Not only is it terribly generic, but it also doesn't indicate whether or not the contact actually  wants  to receive ongoing communications from you. It's more likely that they have a one-time problem or request that needs to be addressed. So, let's say they  do  in fact have a one-time request. There's nothing wrong with having a ""Contact Us"" module on your site, but it should never be the only means of communication between you and your customers. If your visitor or customer needs help, they want it now. They don't want to fill out a form and wait to see when, if ever, they get a response. Let people get in touch with you via email, the phone, and social media, and make that information available on your website. ( Read this blog post to learn more about how to create a great 'Contact Us' page .) Does your 'About Us' page explain what you do in business babble, or using the words and phrases common to the general population? Let's play a translation game using HubSpot's 'About Us' page copy.  Our 'About Us' page  doesn't say this, but read the copy below and think to yourself: Would you know what HubSpot did if it this was what it said? HubSpot assists organizations across multiple countries reduce churn by backfilling the sales pipeline with highly qualified traffic that generates leads that convert into customers with high lifetime value. We achieve this through leading-edge software that integrates all marketing channels for a synergistic view of the data that determines and prioritizes the high-value marketing activities."" Uh, what? Instead, we chose to tell a story on our 'About Us' page. Here's an excerpt from our company story: People have transformed how they consume information, research products and services, make purchasing decisions and share their views and experiences. The customer is more in control than ever — and tunes out traditional sales and marketing messages more than ever. Yet businesses still rely on the same sales and marketing playbook they have used for more than a decade. This mismatch in buyer behavior and company tactics is what led Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah to start HubSpot in 2006 and create the vision for the inbound experience."" Ahh, that's better. Why? Because it's written in a way that people actually speak. It doesn't make your brain hurt like the first iteration did.  Check out this post for 12 great examples of 'About Us' pages. In the same vein as a bad 'About Us' page, it's really frustrating to click around a company's website and not get a clear sense of what the company actually offers. The best webpages clearly explain who they are, what they do, and/or what you (the visitor) can do there. If you're a well-known brand or company (i.e., Coca-Cola) you may be able to get away with not having to describe who you are and what you do. However, most businesses still need to answer these questions so that each visitor knows they are in the ""right place."" Steven Krugg sums it up best in his best-selling book,  Don't Make Me Think:  If visitors can't identify what it is you do within seconds, they won't stick around long.  Here are 15 examples of great homepage design  from companies who did this particularly well. Remember back in the early 2000s when you went to a website and saw paragraphs and paragraphs of copy? Aside from being visually overwhelming, if you read that copy you'd find nothing more than a bunch of keywords meant for crawlers, not humans. Unfortunately, some websites are still writing for bots, even though  Google's algorithm is far more sophisticated  at determining a page's relevancy than it was 10 years ago. Stuffing your content with keywords is  one of the most common search engine optimization (SEO) mistakes  marketers make. While keywords are crucial to driving SEO success, Google will penalize your website in search for keyword-stuffing. Even more importantly, keyword-stuffed copy makes for a bad reader experience. So instead or cramming a keyword in every chance you get,  read this blog post to learn the five parts of your website where you should optimize for keywords . If you're writing for humans, you probably have some really interesting content on your site -- content that people want to share on social media, perhaps. That's why it's a huge disappointment to scroll up and down looking for a ""Tweet This!"" button, only to realize there aren't any   social sharing buttons   on your website. Social sharing buttons make it easy for your readers to share your content on social networks because they don't have to manually copy and paste your URL and compose a tweet. And easy social sharing options means your content gets more visibility, which means more site traffic, better search engine rankings, and more lead generation opportunities.  Read this blog post to learn how to create social sharing and follow buttons  for the major social networks.  If you don't have a blog, you're missing out on an opportunity to provide your visitors with a ton of valuable information. (And you're missing out on ranking opportunities, too.) These days, consumers are empowered to perform in-depth company research on their own before ever contacting a salesperson. If they find answers to their common questions in articles on your company's blog, they're much more likely to come into the sales process trusting what you have to say because you've helped them in the past. (This is one of  the many benefits of business blogging .) If you're an avid content creator, you know  how important a well-crafted title is . Great titles are what cause people to click through to read what you have written. But if they're met with content that's unrelated to the title you provided, you'll disappoint visitors -- and they'll often abandon your site. This is why  click-baity headlines aren't a very fair  way to get people to your site. They take advantage of our natural curiosity. If you're going to use that tactic, you'd better deliver content that excites as much as the title. If not, you'll just annoy people.  The lesson: While it's important to capture peoples' attention in titles, make sure it isn't misleading and your content can actually live up to what you promised you'd deliver. Along the same lines,  your calls-to-action  should align with what visitors receive when they redeem your offer. There's nothing more frustrating than being promised a 50% off coupon in the call-to-action copy, only to redeem it and find there's a caveat that says you must first spend $1,000. On select items. In-store purchases only. This is not only insulting to your visitors, but it will also hurt your reputation -- not to mention your conversion rates. When done correctly,  internal links are helpful  for readers and website alike. They point readers to other relevant information, and help you improve the organic ranking for important pages on your own website. But some websites seem to have trouble  executing internal linking correctly , pointing users to irrelevant pages, linking strange phrases within the copy, and overdoing it to the point of making content unreadable. Include internal links only to relevant pages on your website that will enhance a reader's experience, and include that link on the anchor text that makes the most sense.  ( Pro Tip:  Be sure to have all links open into a new tab in your browser, not the same window. Visitors may not be done reading the content on this page, and you don't want to navigate them away while they're still reading!) Image sliders, also known as image carousels, serve as a way to showcase multiple images in a space-efficient manner. But you have to be careful with these because there's a right way and a wrong way to use them. The right way:  Your slider loads images quickly and doesn't require a new page to load every time a user clicks. The wrong way:  Every time you click the arrow for the next image, your page loads an entirely new web page. This can increase page load time by several seconds as the entire webpage reloads. Remember: The longer it takes a webpage to load,  the more people will abandon it . So make sure yours loads quickly and doesn't require a reload. You'll also want to accompany the visual elements with written copy above or below the slider. Many readers are scanners and wont' invest the time to click through every image in the slider. (HubSpot customers:  Read this post  to learn how to include an image slider on a page using HubSpot.)  What website components drive you nuts? Share them in the comments.

2016-05-04,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ted-talks-confidence-boost,10 Inspiring TED Talks That'll Boost Your Self-Confidence,"Some days, you just feel ... blah. It happens to all of us. It can be short-term, like  when we're exhausted or bored , or we're embarking on a new project but have no idea where to start. Other times, it's a little more long-term, like when we feel like we're  tapped out of good ideas , or  stuck in our careers. Where should you go from there? In times like these, we all have our own coping mechanisms. But if what you need is some words of wisdom and a little motivation, check out the 10 TED talks below. We've curated some of the best TED talks for when you're feeling down and out, stuck, unmotivated, or generally in need of a confidence boost. Check 'em out, and bookmark them for when you need a little encouragement. They could be just what you needed. Before she authored the book  Eat, Pray, Love,  Elizabeth Gilbert was an ""unpublished young diner waitress,"" devastated by rejection letters. And even after she published the book and it became a huge success, she found herself identifying strongly with her former self -- and feeling the urge to quit the fame game and move to the country to raise corgis. In this TED talk, Gilbert reflects on the strange and unlikely psychological connection between how we experience great failure and how we experience great success. She then offers simple (though hard) advice for making sure  your  creativity survives its own success.  Carol Dweck starts her talk off with a short but powerful story about a high school in Chicago where students didn't receive failing grades. Instead, they received the grade ""Not Yet."" The grade implies that not passing the course doesn't mean you're going nowhere, but rather you're on a learning curve. Dweck uses this story to frame the rest of her TED talk, where she talks about her research on ""growth mindset"" -- the idea that we can actually grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. She talks about two different ways to approach a problem that's just a little too hard for you to solve: Are you not smart enough to solve it ... or have you just not solved it yet? I'm a long-time fan of Isabel Allende, author of (among other wonderful books)  The House of Spirits.  She's 71 years old, but says she's still 17. Hey, why let society decide when you're old? In her TED talk, she talks about how we all experience age differently. She talks about her fears as she gets older, and shares how she plans to keep living passionately. Through aging, she says she's gained freedom -- mainly, the freedom from having to prove things to people anymore. ""My body may be falling apart, but my brain is not, yet,"" she says. ""I love my brain. I feel lighter. I don't carry grudges, ambition, vanity, none of the deadly sins that are not even worth the trouble. It's great to let go. And I should have started sooner. "" When have you, or others in your life, opted out of being creative? Many organizations divided people into categories: Either you're a ""creative,"" or you're not. But designer and educator David Kelley suggests that creativity is not limited to a chosen few. In this TED talk, Kelley tells really interesting, touching stories from his legendary design career and his own life, and offers ways to build the confidence to create. He believes that when people gain this confidence, they start working on the things that are really important in their lives -- and come up with more interesting ideas. ( Warning:  NSFW. There are graphic images in this video.) Boniface Mwangi is a photographer whose job was to document the horrific violence in his home country of Kenya -- and watched as his government kept it silent. Finally, he made a plan to protest against the corruption: During a large public meeting where the Kenyan president was speaking, he and a few friends would stand up and heckle the president to get his attention. But his friends never showed .  ""I was scared,   but I knew very well that that particular day,   I had to make a decision.   Was I able to live as a coward, like everyone else,  or was I going to make a stand?"" He says what he decided to do in that moment showed him who he truly was. As he says, ""There are two most powerful days in your life. The day you are born, and the day you discover why."" Humans are fearful for a reason. It served us well as a species for thousands of years so we wouldn't be killed off by predators. But, as Joe Kowan explains, it's a little less wonderful when that same,  visceral, body-hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of 20 folk-music fans at an open mic night. Kowan used to just write songs, but at some point, that wasn't enough anymore. He had all these stories and ideas he wanted to share with people, but his stage fright was keeping him from doing it. The week of his 30th birthday, he decided to put that fear behind him, a process he describes in this talk. Body language can have profound effects on how others see us. We make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language, and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes -- like whom we hire or promote, whom we ask out on a date, and so on. But, even more importantly, body language can affect how we see  ourselves. Social Psychologist Amy Cuddy's research on body language proves that we can actually change other people's perceptions of us (and even our own body chemistry) simply by changing body positions. In this TED talk, Cuddy specifically talks about how ""power posing"" -- i.e., standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can affect testosterone and cortisone levels in the brain. If we do it for even two minutes at a time, it can have profound positive impacts on how we feel and whether we succeed. Now here's a wild story: Two years prior to giving this TED talk, game designer Jane McGonigal suffered a severe concussion and became bedridden and suicidal. Suicidal ideation is common following traumatic brain injuries, and hers became so bad that she began to fear for her life. At one point -- and she says she'll never forget this moment -- she said to herself,  ""I'm either going to kill myself,  or I'm going to turn this into a game."" That was her ticket to getting better: turning it into a game. She dove into scientific research and created the healing game she called SuperBetter. In this moving talk, she explains how a game like hers can help boost resilience. (And she promises watching the talk will add 7 1/2 minutes to your life.) Where does creativity come from? Are some people born with it? Is creativity a function of some other neurological quirk, like psychosis or depression? Are some people equipped with certain skills that enable creativity, like artistic ability? Or is creativity developed mostly through experience? You may know Amy Tan as the author of  The Joy Luck Club,  or one of her other well known books. In this TED talk, she dives into her own creative process and stories of her life that could lend a clue to where it comes from. She reminds us that, in our moments of doubt, even if there is an answer, there is uncertainty in everything -- and that's a good thing. In fact, that space where the uncertainty is can be the birthplace of creativity: She finds that by filling those holes with her own imagining, she can find particles of truth and discover new possibilities she'd never considered before. Some people, Susan Colantuono included, believe that  leadership manifests at every level of management. There's  a tremendous number of a wesome leaders in middle management, and many of them are women. But for Colantuono, this  raises the question:   Why are there so many women  stuck  in the middle -- even when they're doing everything right at work and taking all the right advice? In this TED talk, Colantuono shares a simple and surprising piece of advice. The talk's aimed primarily at women, but there are universal takeaways in here for men, too, as well as for new graduates and mid-career workers. Which TED talks would you add to this list?

2016-05-05,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/nonverbal-communication-tips,33 Little Ways to Improve Your Nonverbal Communication Skills [Infographic],"As famed dancer and choreographer Martha Graham one said, ""The body never lies."" And it turns out that this is as true in an office or boardroom as it is on a stage or dance floor. Whether you realize it or not, your posture, your mannerisms, even how close you stand to someone can communicate something to the people around you.  And yet, many of us don't give a second thought to what our bodies are doing when we communicate -- we're too focused on what we're saying. But as an observer, you've likely noticed that when someone is saying one thing, but their body language seems to be saying another (e.g., when your boss says ""that's a great idea!"" while sporting a frown and a furrowed brow) there's often a breakdown in communication. To help you avoid such communication breakdowns,  the team at Ethos3 put together the infographic below . Check out their 33 tips for mastering nonverbal communication.

2016-05-05,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/education-blogging-101-how-to-attract-more-students-online,Education Blogging 101: How to Attract More Students Online,"Active blogging is a basic building block of any successful inbound marketing strategy - its hub, if you will. For schools and admissions offices struggling for resources, launching and maintaining a blog may seem like a daunting undertaking. But it's one well worth taking. HubSpot research found that  marketers who prioritize blogging are 13x more likely to be able to show a return for their efforts . Having a school blog (or two) can boost your student applications in a number of ways. First, good blogs are regularly updated with with entertaining, informative content. Google  loves  blogs with a steady flow of engaging content. If you're writing around the right keywords, your blog will increase the flow of organic traffic to your blog and website.  Also, the more you blog, the more inbound links you get back to your site, which Google also loves. It sees inbound links as a sign of trust and authority for your content, so it bumps up your place in search results because it wants to serve up the most relevant, reliable content. Helpful, engaging blog content also gets shared on social media, which in turns drives more new visitors to your site.  Once you have all these new visitors to your blog and website, you have the opportunity to get their information into your marketing database. You want to include a call-to-action form on every blog post, and throughout your website. The call-to-action may be to sign up for your newsletter or blog, or to download a report. The blog visitor shares her email and other information with you in order to get this content. Now you can push more content out to them overtime as you nurture them along the path to making an application. And the more they visit your blog, the more effectively you can  personalize the content you send them. As you can see, having a school blog gives you more opportunities and control over how and when to interact with prospective students and parents who've already shown interest in your school. It also provides a bigger platform to tell the school's stories, instead of relying entirely on others to frame your stories for you. Convinced you yet why your school needs a blog? Great. Here are the basics to put together when you plan it out. Every successful blog shares content that its personas want to read about. The blog posts educate readers about the issues that concern or interest them. The posts don't directly promote your school. Leave that for other types of content. When you built your personas, you outlined each one's goals, challenges, and concerns. Use that information to keep your blog content focused on topics they'll read, share, and react to. If your personas need some sprucing, go back and ask with some current and prospective students what information would be most valuable to them. Ask the parents as well. Refine your topic list by looking at all the content your school already creates. Your school already has tons of content. There are curricula, admissions FAQs, program brochures, career office reports, and campus organization descriptions. What questions are these pieces answering? How can a blog post dig deeper or provide a new perspective on them? As you're making your list of all your school's existing content you want to use to spark blog post ideas, it probably occurred to you that you can use some of this existing content itself. Great idea. Your existing content can be converted, with just a little tweaking, directly into blog posts. In addition to the content sources listed in the previous section, also look at any newsletter or publication put out by a student group, program, even your alumni and development newsletters. Are any faculty or staff writing thought leadership pieces – see if you can reprint them on your school's blog. If you can't reprint them, you can craft your own post sharing the piece and linking to it. When you convert existing content into a blog post, make sure to edit it so it works in a blog setting. Give it some context as a blog post. You're not going to just reprint a program's curriculum. You'll rework that content into a post about the different areas of theoretical and practical knowledge the program provides, and why each is important – with a call-to-action linking to the full curriculum. Repurposing existing content is a great tactic for finding meaningful, cost effective content for your blog. But you do want original work on the blog as well, in addition to people on your marketing team who can write. Many of your student leaders would love having a platform on your blog, from formal student ambassadors to group leaders. Student voices are especially influential with prospective students, who want to know what life is really like at your school. Have alumni who want to give back, but aren't yet in a place where they can write a check? Ask them to write about their transition from student to the next phase of their life, whether its finding a job or getting another degree. Faculty and department staff also have stories to tell about what's going on in their domains. Find a couple key people in each department who have an interesting voice to write posts occasionally. Blogs without a distribution plan are the falling trees nobody hears. Regular posting of high quality content based on relevant keywords will build some SEO juice for your site. But there's more to distribution than organic traffic. Outline how you'll use your social media profiles to promote your blog, and get others to share links to your blog via their own social profiles. Include links to blog posts in your newsletters and emails in other campaigns, where they add value. Managing your blog will be much easier when you don't have reinvent the distribution plan for each post. This doesn't mean each post goes into each newsletter or gets its own promotional email. It means outline the different avenues for distribution and promotion and clarify which routes work for different types of blog posts. Then it's easy to specify in your  blog calendar  how any given post will be promoted. Attracting Sudents to Your Blog is the First Step to Getting Their Application Every prospective student is on their own, personal enrollment journey. If you want your school to be part of that journey, a school blog is the best way to attract them early on in the process.

2016-05-06,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/science-of-speed-reading,The Science of Speed Reading: How Well Does It Actually Work?,"Imagine breezing through a lengthy business report in mere seconds, or tackling  War and Peace  in a single afternoon. For many of us, such feats sound like they belong squarely in the realm of science fiction. But to others, ""speed reading"" is quite real, and can be improved through practice and proper technique. Take six-time world speed reading champion Anne Jones, for example, who read all 784 pages of  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  in just 47 minutes.  As  New York Magazine  reported , that works out to 4,200 words per minute -- more than 10 times faster than the pace ""good readers"" read at. And to prove that she wasn't simply rifling through pages with reckless abandon in order to make it seem as though she was speed reading, Jones was able to successfully summarize the major plot points of the book afterwards, suggesting that she actually retained information. So, what's going on here? Is Jones really able to read at word-per-minute rates far greater than what the typical, non-super human is capable of? Or is there some other, more scientific explanation behind what's happening? Before we dive in, let's take a moment to understand how speed reading (allegedly) works. Speed reading courses have been around since the 1950s, with educator Evelyn Wood introducing one of the more popular ones -- Reading Dynamics -- in 1959. As with many of the speed reading courses that would follow, Wood's course focused on minimizing the number of back-and-forth eye movements a reader made while scanning a page. The underlying theory was that you could improve reading speed through improving reading efficiency. In other words, if you could absorb more information with each glance (e.g., through only focusing on every other word, or through honing in on just the beginnings and ends of sentences or paragraphs), you could, in theory, drastically reduce the time it takes you to read something. Modern speed reading apps,  like Spritz , rely on the same basic principle. In fact, by flashing individual words in rapid succession, such apps don't just reduce back-and-forth eye movements, they essentially eliminate them. This leads to a highly efficient style of reading. Check out the GIF below for a sample of what it's like. Image Credit:  thejournal.ie But can this more efficient method of reading really help you read faster? Or does it merely make you  think  you're reading faster, when in reality you're not retaining as much information? (i.e., is ""speed reading"" really just another term for ""skimming""?) Based on the available research, it definitely appears that the latter is more likely than the former. For psychology professors Jeffrey M. Zacks and Rebecca Treiman, speed reading claims have always sounded too good to be true. And  in a recent op-ed in the  New York Times , they delivered their thoughts on the matter under the blunt headline ""Sorry, You Can't Speed Read."" One of the biggest issues they identified, which also applies to reading apps like Spritz, is that people fail to understand the difference between perception (simply  seeing  words) and language processing. Unlike perception, language processing involves stringing words together in order to derive a broader meaning from them. So while speed reading courses can indeed help you perceive more words in a given glance, that doesn't guarantee that your brain will have enough time to actually process everything you're seeing. That means when you're speed reading, you're not understanding the text as deeply compared to if you were reading normally -- even if you see every single word. In their op-ed, Zacks and Treiman used this analogy: Have you ever tried listening to an audio recording with the speaking rate dialed way up? Doubling the speed, in our experience, leaves individual words perfectly identifiable -- but makes it just about impossible to follow the meaning. The same phenomenon occurs with written text."" Ultimately, the factor that most effects a person's reading speed isn't how efficient their eye movements are, it's how extensive their vocabulary is. According to  Zacks and Treiman, r eading and understanding text more rapidly is all about improving language comprehension, not vision.

Oftentimes, marketers  do  give a lot of thought to email design when it comes time to launch a campaign. It makes perfect sense: You have an awesome new announcement or event, and you want to kick off the campaign right with a darn good looking email.

 But what about the follow-up email? Or any email that may be included in an automated email workflow? It's time to stop focusing on the design of just your biggest sends, and spend some time spiffing up all those other emails you're sending.  Need some inspiration? Check out the email examples below. Informational emails are one-to-many emails you can send to folks to bring them up to speed in regards to your latest content, product announcements, and more. Note: You should only send them to people who have opted in to receive emails from you. This is one you probably already know and love. You know, the one where you announce your next sale, ebook, webinar, coupon, free trial ... and the list goes on. This email is used to describe and promote a particular marketing offer -- one single offer -- with a call-to-action that links to a targeted landing page made for that specific offer. When it comes to designing an email for a specific offer, the main component to keep in mind is the offer itself. You want the copy to be brief but descriptive enough to convey the offer's value. In addition, make sure your email's call-to-action (CTA) link is large, clear, and uses actionable language. You can also include a large CTA image/button underneath to make the action you want email readers to take crystal clear. ( Example:  NextView Ventures  ) Product emails are tricky. People generally don't want to receive these often, and they're typically not as interesting or engaging as something like an offer email. That said, it's important to keep these emails simple and straightforward. Many companies choose to send weekly or monthly product digests to keep their customers or fan base up-to-date with the latest features and functionalities. And no matter how much a customer loves your business, it's still work for them to learn how to use new features or learn why a new product is worth their investment. Rather than inundating your contacts with a slew of emails about each individual product update, consider sending a sort of roundup of new updates or products periodically. For each update you list, include a large, clear headline, a brief description, and an image that showcases the product or feature. It's also worth linking to a custom page for each feature to make it easy for recipients to learn more about it. ( Example:  Adobe ) Do you maintain a business blog for your company? Are you a magazine or media outlet? No matter which of these categories you fall into, many companies choose to send a roundup of stories or articles published weekly or monthly. And if you truly want people to read these email roundups, it's critical that you share them in a visually appealing way. Within these roundup emails, it's a good idea to use an image paired with a headline, a brief summary or introduction, and a CTA for recipients to read more. This simple format will allow you to use visuals to attract the reader to each article while still giving you the ability to feature multiple articles -- without sending a super lengthy email. ( Example:  Skillshare ) Email can be a great vehicle for promoting an upcoming event you're hosting. But if you want to invite your contacts to an event and motivate them to register, it's extremely important to clearly showcase why that event is worth their attendance.  A great way to do so is through visuals. A lot of events cost money to attend, and most cost a pretty penny. So if you want to attract registrants, cut down on the copy and  show  potential registrants why the event will be awesome. ( Example:  FutureM ) ( Example:  INBOUND ) Co-marketing is when two or more complementary companies partner together for some mutually beneficial task, event, or other promotion. The main draw of co-marketing is to leverage the audience of another company to increase your reach. Sometimes the relationship results in a strategic announcement; other times it's as simple as a joint webinar. Let's use the latter for an example of how co-marketing emails work, and why they're so beneficial: Let's say you and another company decide to do a webinar together on a particular subject. As a result, that webinar will likely (pending your arrangements) be promoted to the email lists of both of your companies. This exposure to a list that is not your own is one of the key benefits of co-marketing partnerships. When it comes to the email your business sends, make it clear that this offer or event is the result of a partnership with company X -- especially if your co-marketing partner is particularly popular or impressive. To do this, you can adjust the company logo in your email to also include the other business' logo. Furthermore, make sure your copy mentions both businesses, and create a custom graphic or image to visualize the offer or event.  ( Example:  HubSpot + Unbounce ) Wait ... what does social media have to do with email? Well, if you're making good use of LinkedIn Groups or Google+ Events, email has  everything  to do with social media. As the administrator of LinkedIn Group, when you send a LinkedIn Announcement, you're directly reaching a LinkedIn user's inbox. And when you create a Google+ event, sending the invite directly sends you into users' email boxes as well. Without having to create lists or collect email addresses, you automatically have access to users' email, but be sure to tap into these resources with care. When it comes to these social media emails, you don't have the option of using email software that allows you to customize the layout or add images. You're at the mercy of copy alone. This is where leveraging white space is very important. Keep your paragraphs short, your sentences brief, and your thoughts clear. Optimize these emails for the scanning reader, and use bullets or numbers to deliver your main points.  ( Example:  CMI ) Don't neglect a very important audience for your company: your employees. Many companies, especially if they're on the larger side, choose to send internal updates or newsletters to their employees to keep them in the know about the latest company information -- whether it be new product updates, marketing offers, or events.  With these emails, it's less about the beauty, and more about the clarity. The most important formatting tip for these types of emails is to arrange the information in a simple and helpful way. Once you've nailed your formatting, it's simply a matter of highlighting the most critical information associated with each offer or update so its messaging is crystal clear to everyone. ( Example:  HubSpot Academy ) Transactional emails are one-to-one emails that are triggered by specific actions, such as completing a purchase or signing up for a newsletter. Note:  You'll need specialized software in order to set up transactional emails. How frustrating is it to book a flight or register for an event and  not receive an automatic confirmation email?  I know that personally, every time I make an online transaction, I wait impatiently to see that my transaction was complete. After all, nobody wants to worry that they're first payment wasn't processed, only to click the payment button again and get charged twice. What bothers me most about so many businesses' confirmation emails are two things: when the subject lines are vague, and when the information I actually want to confirm isn't immediately evident when I open the email. Confirmation emails should be just that -- confirmation emails. To avoid any confusion, keep these emails simple,  with just a brief summary of the information your recipients would want you to confirm. Try not to fuss with the design, as t hey simply want to know that the action they took was completed so they can save the information, have peace of mind, and move on.  ( Example:  GrubHub ) Whenever a prospect, lead, or customer fills out a form on one of your landing pages, a kickback email should automatically get triggered after their submission. Depending on the form, these kickback emails are often referred to as thank-you emails. These emails are mainly for the sake of fulfilling your promise to the user, and storing the information you promised them safely in their inbox. How frustrating would it be if you downloaded an ebook, and then forgot where you stored the link to the PDF? Kickback emails solve that problem. These automatic emails should make the CTA big and clear. Keep in mind that the CTA should link to the direct offer -- NOT to the form. In these emails, simply thank the reader for their form submission, and give them what you promised, whether it be a link to the PDF of an ebook, instructions on how to activate their free trial, or the coupon they requested. Furthermore, don't overcomplicate the appearance of these emails. The reader isn't looking for  additional  information, but rather the offer or content they already know they redeemed.   ( Example:  IMPACT Branding & Design ) Another type of transactional email, the welcome email is the perfect option for thanking and providing more information to people who have signed up for your newsletter, product trial, or other offer. The elements you include in a welcome email will depend on the specifics of what you're offering. But in general, you can use the email to showcase your brand's personality and to highlight the value that recipients can expect to receive. If you're welcoming new users to a product or service, the welcome email is a great place to explain how everything works and what users need to do in order to get started. Remember: First impressions are important, even when they happen via email. For more inspiration,  check out this list of stellar welcome email examples . ( Example:  Food52 ) Depending on the specific action a persona takes, you may want to enroll them in a lead nurturing campaign. Lead nurturing emails consist of a tightly connected series of emails containing useful, targeted content. As their name suggests, these emails are used to nurture leads through the marketing funnel into a position of sales readiness. For example, let's say you sent your list a marketing offer email. You might then set up a lead nurturing workflow that triggers another email about a complementary offer or piece of content to everyone who converted on that initial offer. The logic is simple: By identifying a particular group of contacts that you already know are interested in a specific topic, you and can follow up with more relevant and targeted content that makes them more likely to continue their relationship with you. In your lead nurturing emails, it's important to call out why recipients are receiving the email. For example, you could say something like, ""We noticed you're into [topic x] since you downloaded our [Topic X] ebook, and we thought you might want to learn more about [topic x] ..."" Once you've addressed why recipients are getting email from you, you can format your lead nurturing emails similar to the way you'd set up your general marketing offer emails. Other very important considerations to make when crafting your lead nurturing campaigns are the planning, setup, segmentation, and timing of your nurturing emails.  ( Example:  HubSpot ) At the end of the day, your emails should not only be visually appealing, but they should also be valuable. Focus on sharing the key information in the most appropriate format depending on the type of email you're sending -- and the audience you're sending it to. After all, what's the use of a crazy-beautiful email if it doesn't provide any true value to the reader?  Know of any other types of email that should be on this list?

2016-05-05,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pros-cons-bonobos-ecommerce-model,The Pros and Cons of the Bonobos Ecommerce Model,"Bonobos is a wildly popular men’s online shopping boutique that is changing the way people shop. They recently hit $100 million in revenue, after nine years of business. The model is pretty simple: several variations on popular clothing items like pants, dress shirts, and casual shirts. No matter what you’re looking for, Bonobos probably has it. Simply put, Bonobos has come to define ecommerce with a guide shop sales model that seems to work—but are they missing out on some key sales? Let’s examine the pros and cons of their guide shop sales model. No one brand offers  the sheer number of options  buyers can get from Bonobos. In the case of brick-and-mortar stores, there just isn’t enough room to display over two hundred pants styles—not of the same brand, anyway. By adopting an ecommerce model, Bonobos didn’t have to worry about display space or inventory storage. They didn’t have to worry about their clothing competing with other brands. No, everything in their online store is directly from Bonobos. Bonobos recently caused a stir by opening guide shops, where Bonobos clothing is on display for any shoppers craving the in-person experience. The problem is that the clothes are for testing purposes only. If buyers are unsure of a size or fit, they can drop in for a few minutes and try something on. That all sounds wonderful, but what about buyers’ desire for  instant gratification ? If they’ve foregone the convenience of online shopping to head into a store, won’t they be disappointed when they can’t buy the items that fit right away? To remedy that need for instant gratification, Bonobos has outfitted all employees with tablets so buyers can order immediately after finding items that fit. That way, no one has to leave the store without making a purchase; they just can’t leave the store with their purchase. Once the buyer makes a purchase right there in the store, they still have to go home and wait for their new clothes to arrive in the mail. Again, they’re shrugging away the buyer’s strong desire to own their products by making them wait. Now, shipping times aren’t a problem to those who engage in traditional ecommerce, because waiting for the products to arrive is the price you pay for the convenience you experience when shopping from home. In the end, it seems as though the guide shops have given a tremendous assist to the Bonobos model. Fans of the brand who haven’t purchased for fear that they’d order the wrong size can now ease those fears. Buyers who want to try out new styles and colors can test their wardrobe in front of a mirror before committing. The real magic, however, happens after the first order. If the size is right, buyers don’t have to visit the shop again. Uncertainty is removed and they can buy at their leisure. Of course, there’s one thing we didn’t mention: Bonobos is actually available for purchase from Nordstrom, so those who have a serious crush on the products can get something immediately. As with any retail situation, however, the options are limited to whatever Nordstrom can fit into that little corner of their store. So what do you think? Is Bonobos actually changing the way we do ecommerce with their guide shops, or is it all a fad that will fade away when shoppers miss the convenience of buying from their living room?

2016-05-06,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productive-weekend-ideas,How to Have a Super Productive Weekend: 12 Helpful Tips,"Let me make one thing clear: This is not a post about how you should spend your weekends working yourself to the bone. ""Productivity"" has a much wider definition than many of us give it credit for. We tend to equate productivity with  doing  things, rather than with taking time to think, reflect, and rest. But  busyness is not the same as productivity . Being productive can mean working on a project efficiently, but it can also mean giving your mind a break. After all, w hen people are exhausted and burnt out, they become less engaged at work -- and  Gallup reports  that  engaged employees are a whopping 28% more productive than unengaged employees.  (Not to mention they're happier, more attentive, and more innovative.) So, what are some ways you can make your weekends more productive, in every sense of the word? Check out the list below for some ideas. Some of these are geared toward the more conventional definition of productivity, while others are biased toward giving yourself a break so you can be happier, more creative, and more efficient in the long-term. (Note: If you're finding you're still working nonstop on weekends,  check out  our guide on how to be more productive  to learn how to manage your time and maximize your workplace performance during the week.) You probably spend the majority of your workweek sitting at your desk or in conference rooms, slogging away at your day-to-day tasks. That's why changing the  types  of activities you do on weekends can play a big role in both your level of happiness and productivity. Why? By changing the types of activities you're doing, you can actually change the neurons firing inside your head. Using different neurons makes it easier for you to make different types of connections and associations. When composers get stuck writing a piece of music, for example, it's not uncommon for them  to switch to a different instrument  to help get over their writer's block. The different instrument helps them think about the ""problem"" in a different way. Laura Vanderkam, author of the book  What Successful People Do Before Breakfast,  agrees, saying your weekends need to feel different from your weekdays. She suggests rotating in different activities and hobbies that you don't have time to do during the week. Celebrity Chef Marcus Samuelsson  plays soccer on the weekends , for example. And billionaire Warren Buffet  plays the ukulele . Making time for hobbies and non-work activities can foster creativity, relieve stress, and make you a happier, more successful person. If you wake up on Saturday with a list of 20 to-do list items, you're setting yourself up for failure. (Or at least for a whole lot of stress.) The key is to prioritize so you get the  most important things  done, not all the things done. That way, you allow yourself the time to do them well.  One technique for prioritizing your to-do list is called  the impact vs. effort analysis . Here's how it works: Before you begin a task, ask yourself how much effort this task will take, and what the immediate impact will be. This'll help you quickly figure out which of the items on your to-do list will have the most immediate impact in the least amount of time. For example, if you wake up on a Saturday and find your inbox is overflowing but you were hoping to bang out a blog post before lunch, run a quick impact vs. effort analysis in your head. You might realize that getting through 30+ emails takes a significant amount of effort, but actually has little impact on your success. Writing that blog post, on the other hand, requires more effort, but it carries a much higher impact. ""The early bird catches the worm"" isn't a common phrase for nothing. Practically every article out there on productivity says waking up early can help you get more done -- provided you went to bed at a reasonable hour the night before. If not, it may be better to catch up on sleep. (See #6.) Either way, when you  do  get up, try to get up and out of bed as soon as you can. Mornings tend to be slower and lend fewer distractions, making it easier for you to get things done more quickly. ""I try to leave my house as early as possible,"" says  Leslie Ye , writer and editor for HubSpot's Sales Blog . ""That way, I get fresh air and don't just sit on my couch all day."" ""If I do an easy but rote chore right when I wake up, like clean the kitchen or empty the dishwasher, I'm usually really productive the rest of that day,"" says HubSpot's Director of Content Corey Wainwright. The idea is that, if you kick yourself into gear first thing in the morning, you don't give yourself a chance to laze around -- and you'll put yourself in the mindset to get things done. Alternatively, if you don't have anything specific if you need to get done, sometimes the best thing you can do for your future productivity is to give your mind a break. After all, time off is good for your productivity and performance at work. Almost  nine out of ten American workers  feel like time off increases their happiness, and 91% of business leaders believe their employees return from breaks recharged and ready to work more effectively. Ye likes to use weekends to get outside and get some fresh air. ""Being in an office five days a week leaves me drained by Friday,"" she says. ""Taking the time to do an outside activity, even if it's just taking a walk along the Charles River, helps me recharge and gives my mind a break."" Meditating is another way to release your mind from stressors -- and it happens to  have extraordinary health and productivity benefits , like increased focus, reduced stress, and greater creativity. Plenty of successful people -- Jack Dorsey, Rupert Murdoch, and Oprah Winfrey --  all meditate daily . If you've never meditated before, there are a few great apps that offer guided meditations, like  Headspace  (which gives you 10 free guided meditation sessions with the option of subscribing later) or  Calm  (which offers two-dozen guided meditation session ranging from a few minutes long to about 30 minutes long). Sleep debt is a real thing. The downsides of sleep debt aren't just that you're tired all the time -- chronic sleep debt  raises the risk  of obesity, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. And in the short-term, lack of sleep  can have significant effects  on the hippocampus -- an area of the brain involved in memory creation and consolidation. The good news is, if you find yourself getting fewer than the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep per night, you  can  make up that debt on weekends.  One University of Chicago study  followed a group of student volunteers who slept only four hours per night for six consecutive days. All of the changes they experienced during that period of sleep deprivation -- from high blood pressure to fewer antibodies to insulin resistance -- were reversed when the students made up the hours of sleep they’d lost. So if you missed, say, ten hours of sleep over the course of a week, then add three or four extra sleep hours on the weekend, and an extra one to two hours to nights the following week -- until you’ve repaid all 10 of those hours.  Don't make this a habit, though. Try to factor those seven to eight hours of sleep per night into your daily schedule as much as you can. ( Read more about the science of sleep here .)  While you should use your workweek to nail the job you have, if you're gunning for a promotion -- or another job altogether -- then why not use some of your weekend time learning the skills of the job you  want?  Learning a new skill or diving deeper into an area of specialization that's growing might be just the ammunition you need to land that coveted position. The skills you choose to work on will depend on the role you have your eye on. For example, if you want to  move up as a digital marketer , you may want to improve your HTML/CSS skills, read up on trends in modern technology and emerging platforms, or brush up on your SEO knowledge. If you  want to work for an agency , you'll want to gain experience with cross-channel marketing, mobile marketing, and design. Want to  be a CMO ? Make sure you master personnel development -- perhaps by taking on mentorship roles outside of work -- as well as financial analysis and strategic thinking. For more ideas on which skills to work on,  here's a list of 13 valuable skills you can learn for free . Want to get your get her name out there as a thought leader and industry expert? Most media outlets allow people to submit authentic, original articles on topics that are relevant to their readership. Each one has different requirements and submission instructions, though. While some require you to submit full articles, others accept topic pitches and are willing to work with you on an outline. To help you sort through these requirements,  here are guest blogging instructions and guidelines for 11 top media outlets , including  The New York Times, Business Insider,  HBR.org,  Mashable,  and more. If you want to write more regularly, consider creating a personal blog. The social publishing platform Medium is a great place to publish personal blog posts because  it comes with a built-in audience . This is especially helpful for people who don't have time to do a lot of content promotion. ( Here's a beginner's guide to Medium  to get you started.) Weekends are for stepping away from the daily grind, spending time with friends and family, doing things that make you smile, and generally keeping your work-life balance in check. These things may not necessarily boost your company's profits by 200% or make you CEO next week, but that doesn't make them any less important. But some of you might find it hard to step away from all those obligations -- work-related or not -- for the entire two-day period. If that sounds like you, then try to choose at least one of the two days to remain totally obligation-free. ""S aturday is my no-guilt, 100% work-free day,"" says Ye. ""I don't do any errands, chores, or open my work computer -- I save that for Sunday. Giving myself one day a week to do exactly what I want with no guilt makes it that much easier to tackle my chores and errands the next day."" I find it harder to work efficiently on the weekends, simply because it feels like I have so much more time. But time can fly, and all of a sudden it's 5:00 p.m. and I just spent the last several hours in limbo between getting work done and procrastinating hardcore. When you literally reserve blocks of time to get specific tasks done, it can be much easier to focus and get your work done quicker -- leaving you with more time to actually enjoy your weekend. Emma Brudner, who manages HubSpot's Sales Blog,  uses laundry as a work timer  when she works from home. "" I set mini-deadlines for myself corresponding to when I have to go downstairs to switch loads,"" she says. ""If I'm working on an article, I tell myself I'll get to a certain point before the wash cycle ends. Then I set another goal for the dryer."" Tyler Littwin, a content strategist and graphic designer at HubSpot, agrees it's important to set a limit on work when you're at home. ""If you work from home full-time (or on a regular basis), it’s really easy to let your work life bleed into your personal life. Maintaining a boundary is important for both halves of the equation."" Another handy trick? The laptop battery countdown. This one comes from  Ginny Soskey , who manages HubSpot's Marketing Blog. She suggests bringing your laptop with you to a remote location -- like the coffee shop downstairs -- without your computer charger. Then, aim to work until your computer dies. This is a way of gamifying your productivity, and it works: The pressure of a looming deadline can do wonders to keep you focused and working smarter. Didn't get as much done as you wanted to in your designated block of time? Forgive yourself, and then move on. The more you set these hard time limits for yourself, the more efficient you'll get during your designated work time. Think about all the things in your home that you haven't touched in months or years, but can't bear to throw away. Those shoes you never wear anymore. That unopened kitchen gadget you got for Christmas three years ago. All those old notes and receipts you haven't looked at in years. A lot of us simply have too much stuff. Why not spend some time over the weekend getting rid of it, little by little? Decluttering your living spaces will make you feel a lot better -- especially if you can give some of those items to charity, or sell them online. Donating is the easiest way to get rid of things without throwing it away. Start by finding the nearest  Salvation Army  or  Goodwill  or other local charitable organization. For the more expensive things -- like that unopened kitchen gadget -- try selling it. If you're in the U.S., try using Craigslist for items you don't want to ship, like furniture or other large items. For items you feel comfortable boxing and shipping, try eBay. You can also  trade in old items like electronics on Amazon for Amazon credit . (For more ideas,  here's a great guide to decluttering your home from Lifehacker .) Billionaire Richard Branson said , ""It is amazing how focusing your mind on issues like health, poverty, conservation and climate change can help to re-energize your thinking in other areas."" Serving others has a long list of intangible benefits, like pride, satisfaction, accomplishment, connections with others, strengthening your community, and improving the lives of others. Nothing helps put things into perspective -- and can make your problems seem a little smaller -- than helping those less fortunate. Plus, along with social benefits,  research shows  there's a strong relationship between volunteering and physical health, too. Weekends are a great time to get involved in local and community volunteer events. If you don't have a specific cause in mind, check out your local library, youth center, animal shelter, homeless shelter, or hospital to see if they're in need of volunteers.  VolunteerMatch.org  is another great place to find good causes in your local community for a wide variety of time commitments. Sunday night blues are never fun. Instead of using those last few golden weekend hours to check through all your boring work emails, do something you'll actually look forward to. For me, it's watching  Game of Thrones.  For you, it might be reading a book, taking a run with your dog, meditating, or cooking a nice meal. Another idea is to take the time to reflect on the week gone by. Reflection is something you should be doing daily, but weekends are a great time to step back and think about what made you smile, what you're grateful for, what you've accomplished, and how to make the next week even better. “This extends the weekend and keeps you focused on the fun to come, rather than on Monday morning,” writes Vanderkam in her book. That way, you'll go to bed with a calmer mindset, unperturbed by all the stuff you have to do the next day. What other ways are you productive on weekends?

2016-05-05,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-inconsistency-sources,6 Sneaky Places Brand Inconsistencies Hide (And How to Fix Them),"Most marketers and brand strategists understand the dangers of brand inconsistency: without a well-defined logo, color scheme, and brand voice, your brand won’t stand out in consumers’ minds. And if consumers can’t remember your brand, you haven’t a chance against competitors. While brands are constantly trying to uphold a strong visual image, the internet is notorious for uncovering small inconsistencies, many of which reside in the most unexpected places.  To make sure that you're covering all the bases, we've outlined six sneaky places where brand inconsistencies tend to hide -- from the depths of your product descriptions to that email you're about to send. Alongside these sources you'll find inspiring examples of world-class brands that are doing their due diligence to keep things consistent across the board.  Whether your content team is made up of two or 20, you’re inevitably going to end up with different writing styles. Having a range of voices is a good way to keep your audience interested, but there’s a fine line between an interesting variation and writing that’s downright inconsistent. And when the writing styles and visual content across blog posts are too drastic, your readers will be confused about the message you’re trying to send. One way to achieve consistency on your blog is to create a detailed content style guide. This guide can include information such as what types of stock photos to use, whether or not to use oxford commas, and what language to avoid. In addition to sharing this guide with everyone on your internal team, you can also share it with contributors, partners, and press. OpenTable’s style guide  includes helpful guidelines for what tone their branded content should embody. These tips are used to inform blog content, so writers of all different backgrounds have a basic standard to follow.   Pop Quiz: If you need information, fast, where do you typically go to get it? We’re going to take a gamble and say that your answer was Google. People looking for information about your brand probably have the same train of thought. After all, Google is seen as a trusted method for finding information. Trouble is, this can be bad news for brands. Since Google is so good at scouring the web, they’ll pull up anything and everything related to your brand -- even outdated logos, old product shots, and inaccurate company descriptions. If you’re not keen on chasing people across the interwebs every single time your logo is used incorrectly, try taking a proactive approach. You can prevent brand misuse by showcasing your brand accurately in a single, public-facing location. You can adopt a   c loud-based platform like Brandfolder  to provide easy, immediate access to your brand assets and their usage guidelines. Slack ensures proper use of their brand assets by linking to  their Brandfolder  directly from their website in the top left corner. They also have a “brand guidelines” page on their website where readers can access all asset usage instructions. One of the biggest culprits of brand inconsistency resides in product descriptions and feature pages. This copywriting is especially notorious for being misaligned with your brand, and with one another, because they are extremely detailed and change often. The best way to keep your website up-to-date is to conduct a website audit. To ensure the process goes smoothly, be sure to involve leaders from every department. Your marketing team can help refine copy, your product team can ensure that it’s accurate, and your sales team can verify pricing information. Website audits can be especially challenging if you haven’t conducted one in over a year, so try getting into the habit of conducting one every six months or so. Warby Parker  is a great example of a brand that achieves consistency across hundreds of products. Each pair of glasses has a product description that is similar in length and language. Since people shopping for glasses are inevitably going to look through many different pairs, these consistent product descriptions help Warby Parker uphold the quality and perceived brand value of their product. Consider this scenario: Your sales team is communicating with a customer about a possible feature upgrade. Your support team is communicating with that same customer to help fix a bug. Meanwhile, you’re crafting the perfect promotional email to send to all your customers. While all of the emails are from the same brand, none of the teams are aligning their email language. As a result, each email sends a radically different message, and the customer retrieves a mixed message about what your brand is about. Similar to the content style guide we suggested in tip one, an email style guide can serve as a helpful alignment tool. Your guide should include guidelines on how to respond to questions and concerns, and what specific language you should include (and avoid). Start by rounding up the most common questions each department receives, then work with your marketing team to craft on-brand answers. In addition to helping your brand be more consistent, this will also save your team time. To make it even easier for writers to follow your brand’s editorial guidelines, simply make your style guide public. Hamilton College sets a great example for brands looking to standardize their email writing styles --  their Email Style Guide  includes directions on everything from acceptable fonts and colors to imagery usage. So your brand has an official Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and -- wait a minute, what other social platforms are you on? With so many options for marketing your brand on social media, it’s hard not to feel pressured to have a presence on all of them. However, trying to tackle all of these platforms is difficult -- can you really maintain a consistent posting cadence on all of these sites? Even more problematic is that fact that each of these platforms have varying audiences -- and not all of these audiences are aligned with your target market and brand strategy. The best way to stay consistent on social media is to choose a few platforms that make sense for your audience and your product -- then master them. It’s also a good idea to do a cleanup of your social profiles and delete the ones you don’t use, or don’t plan on using in the near future. After all, you probably don’t want people looking up your brand on Twitter to find you’ve only tweeted once ... three years ago. Apple gets it: they’re one of the largest tech companies in the world, but they don’t even have a designated Twitter account. However, they do have an Apple Support account, which offers helpful tips and tricks on getting the most out of your Apple products. This actually fits into the greater brand experience that Apple creates. Instead of reaching out to customers with promotional discounts and deals, Apple offers an online support community where people can go to find what they need -- similar to their in-store experience. Since product review sites are regulated by people who know nothing about your brand, they often portray the wrong information. Whether your business has the wrong location, or is missing a proper company description, review sites can be a huge source of concern for potential customers. And while there’s not much you can do about the poor ratings and negative reviews on these types of sites, you can take steps to keep your fundamental brand information accurate. First, reach out to these sites and do whatever you can to correct your brand's information. It’s the job of the review site to inform their users, so they’ll likely be receptive to your request. Another way to boost your presence on review sites is to reach out to your champion customers and ask them to leave a review (if they haven’t already). This will help filter out the not-so-positive reviews, so people visiting these sites understand both what your brand is about, and what people honestly think of it. Nashville’s Hotel Indigo proves that a TripAdvisor profile can go a long way. Their page includes professional photography, accurate contact information, and TripAdvisor’s official “Seal of Excellence.” Nashville’s Hotel Indigo Staff can easily monitor this site to help customers gain knowledge and trust.

2016-04-16,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sales-without-voicemail,"In a World Without Voicemail, What Would Happen to Sales?","This post  originally appeared  on HubSpot's Sales Blog. To read more content like this,  subscribe to Sales . Voicemail is an essential tool for salespeople. Reaching a prospect on your first call attempt is never a guarantee, so salespeople spend hours practicing and perfecting a compelling voicemail template that will hook buyers’ attention and get them to call back. But what happens when leaving voicemails just … isn’t an option anymore? We’re probably years away from a voicemail-less world, but the trendlines are already starting to point away from voicemail. These findings suggest that, even if voicemails still exist in a number of years, they might no longer be the best or easiest way to reach buyers. While salespeople probably won’t stop leaving voicemails any time soon, it’s not a bad thing to start investing more time in getting really good at other sales techniques. What do those strategies look like? Here are four skills salespeople should make sure to perfect so that if voicemail does ever become obsolete, they’ll be ready. This one’s no surprise. Email is a less interruptive method of reaching a prospect than a voicemail, since they get to decide when and if they respond. But it’s also hard to stand out -- prospects get dozens, if not hundreds of emails every day, and there’s no guarantee that yours will get read. Good sales emails include  a catchy subject line , compelling value proposition (i.e. a reason your prospect should respond to your email, not buy your product), and something that  provides value to your prospect . And even if you think you’re better in person than through a screen, reflect on what exactly makes your voicemails so compelling -- then put it in your emails! Still, writing a good email isn’t easy. You have to invest time into really researching prospects so they’re hooked by highly relevant content from the first sentence. Writing also may not come naturally to some salespeople. For more tips, check out these resources: Social selling is much-hyped but also oft-criticized. It’s easy to dismiss the tecnique as so much social noise if salespeople are overly promotional and post irrelevant content. But done right,  it’s an incredibly powerful way  to meet buyers on their own turf and talk about the issues they care about. Research the social platforms and online forums your buyers are most likely to be active in, then join them and start participating. The key to successful social selling is to shed your salesperson identity. Instead, act as an advisor and industry expert. Provide helpful advice and link to relevant content. Only talk about your product if you are explicitly asked about it. If this seems like a foreboding amount of work to you, try starting out by just sourcing your target accounts on social media. Monitor their activity and jump in with advice where you can. Eventually, you’ll be comfortable enough with social selling to make it part of your regular routine. You might traditionally think of all pre-sale activity as Marketing’s responsibility. And while marketers certainly have a huge role to play in nurturing and educating leads, salespeople have a great opportunity here as well. Whether it’s social selling (see above), creating original content, speaking at conferences, or running educational webinars, the more valuable you can make yourself to a prospect before they even think about purchasing a product, the more likely they’ll think of you and be willing to take your call when the time comes to make a decision. Referrals are powerful. Salespeople who can leverage their existing networks for referrals are at an advantage. After all, you have an objective third party backing up their value proposition who your prospect presumably already knows and trusts. Salespeople leave voicemails and send prospecting emails to get an introduction. But plumbing your networks for referrals completely skips over needing to make that initial connection yourself.

2016-04-18,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/twitter-retargeting-ads-experiment,How to Use Twitter Retargeting Ads to Generate More Customers,"When you think of lead nurturing, do you think of a series of well-timed, relevant emails to a perfectly segmented audience? Of course you do. And you would be right. In practice, email is the primary channel for lead nurturing. However, supplementary channels such as paid retargeting also serve as an effective way to gently help an engaged prospect along the buyer's journey. At HubSpot, we started experimenting with Twitter Ads as a method of lead nurturing ... but it didn't exactly go as planned. In fact, our results actually  sucked . How come? Well, my team's job is to drive product interest through trials, demos, and inbound marketing assessments. For someone to covert on one of these offerings, they need to complete a 13-field form on a landing page. And given  Twitter’s mobile-first nature , it was easy to see why we weren’t successful. But instead of throwing in the towel and deciding not to use Twitter Ads for the middle of the funnel, we decided to take a different approach. Rather than asking people to fill out a form, we decided to try showing product-related and bottom funnel content to see if we could influence leads down the funnel to become opportunities and eventually, customers. So we asked ourselves:  Can Twitter be an effective channel for  influencing the lead-to-customer conversion rate ? In order to answer the question we were asking ourselves, we had to run a lengthy split-group test to determine if Twitter was effective at influencing leads down the funnel. Here is a breakdown of the experiment: Aware that there are several ways to interpret and measure ""influence,"" I knew it was important to note what this experiment is and what it isn't: Prior to this experiment, we promoted direct response ads that asked for a free trial, a demo, or an inbound marketing assessment. Here’s an example: As you can see, we are directly asking for a free trial of our SEO tool and then directing the lead to a landing page with a very long form. Not so great on a mobile-first platform. During the experiment our leads saw both product awareness and bottom funnel content. We'll define these types of content in detail later, but here are some examples of the content we employed: Bottom Funnel Content:  ROI Calculator  Product Awareness Content:  Product Video At the end of the experiment we determined that  the retargeted group converted into customers 64% better than the control group. What conclusion did we actually draw from this?  It’s not all about form fills . Retargeting leads with bottom funnel and product-related content is an effective way to influence people along the buyer’s journey, especially on a mobile-first platform. Do you want to see if this works for your business? Here are the steps to set up this experiment for yourself. (Note: Everyone has their own software and systems, so if you begin to feel overwhelmed by these steps due to any technical limitations, just take the overall principles and do the best you can.) Here’s one of the hard truths about retargeting: list size matters. Since this is list-based retargeting, match-rate is absolutely crucial. Why? Because according to  MediaMath , match rates can vary from 70-80% down to as low as 20-30% for some platforms. In other words, in order for list-based retargeting to be effective, you’ll need a fairly large list. Create your list in whatever CRM or marketing automation platform you use. (HubSpot Marketing customers: You'll want to start by creating a smartlist and setting whatever criteria you want to target.  Learn more about creating lists here. ) With any good experiment, you’ll need to have an experiment group to test against your control group for the most accurate results. In this test, the experiment group was retargeted with Twitter Ads and the control group was not. To get our audience into Twitter, we used list-syncing service called  GoChime . GoChime automatically syncs HubSpot lists to Twitter and Facebook to make retargeting your database simple. If you have a list-syncing service like GoChime, then simply sync your experiment group over to Twitter to use as a  Twitter Tailored Audience . (GoChime also recently announced  increased match rates , so your retargeting will be that much more effective.) If you do not have this syncing capability, you’ll want to follow the instructions below: In order to do list-based retargeting on Twitter, you need to at least have your audience’s email addresses. You can also upload a list containing phone numbers or Twitter handles, but email is likely to provide a better match-rate. Next, you’ll want to set up your reporting so you can measure the impact of your test. This process will differ depending on which system you're using, but these are the metrics you should be looking at for your experiment: These are the primary metrics for success in the experiment, but do make sure you’re also looking at your Twitter metrics -- engagement rate, cost per engagement, etc. -- so you can optimize within the platform. To record your results, check out the simple tables below. (Note: These are example results -- not results from our experiment.) Experiment Group Control Group If the sample size (number of leads) of your groups differ, make sure to calculate statistical significance between the two groups. (KISSmetrics has a  great A/B significance calculator  that will work well for this purpose.) Now that we’ve been through the steps on how to set up this experiment, let’s talk about content selection. The type of content we used can be broken down into two categories: product awareness and bottom funnel content. Product awareness content simply means any type of content that tells the story of your product. The most important thing to remember about product awareness content is that it must be helpful and tell the prospect how your product can help solve their problem. Product awareness should not be confused with the “awareness” stage content of the buyer’s journey, which is typically more top funnel content like ebooks, templates, checklists, and so on. Instead, product awareness and bottom funnel content actually fall into both the “consideration” and “decision” stages of the buyer’s journey. Examples of product awareness content: After you’ve been retargeting your experiment group with product awareness content, you’ll want to move toward “bottom funnel” content. Bottom funnel content is basically anything that you would show in the late stages of the buyer’s journey. Examples of bottom funnel content: After all that information, I will end with this: Measuring influence is hard. As I stated in the beginning, this experiment isn’t meant to help you figure out exactly which ad made prospects turn into sales opportunities and customers. Instead, this experiment is meant to help you take a step back and make an educated assumption of whether or not Twitter Ads (or any other social ad platform, like Facebook) can be used to influence your overall lead-to-customer rate.
