A couple of days ago, I showed you how to   Ads. Today, I want to dwell on another important platform Twitter and show how you can use it to drive targeted traffic to your website. Twitter has millions of active users and the company’s official website states that 47% of users who usually follow a business are likely to visit the company’s website. Twitter itself makes it easy for you to tap this tremendous opportunity by offering tools to make it easy to create campaigns to drive traffic to your website. Let’s see how you can do this.   Twitter’s go-to tool for driving website conversions is Website Cards. Twitter’s internal analytics show that Website Cards drive 43% more clicks compared to normal tweets. Website Cards are creative ad units with options to add an attractive image, a descriptive text, and a powerful call to action button. They are usually displayed to a targeted group of users and are capable of being tracked from end to end. Setting up Twitter cards is easy as pie and involves 5 simple steps. To get started with Website cards, you first need to have a Twitter Ads account. 1. First, you need to  . 2. Once your account is approved, you can log in to the Twitter Ads dashboard to create for first website card. Now enter your campaign details. 3. On the top right of the screen, click the Create new campaign drop down and select Website clicks or conversions. 4. In the next screen, enter a name for your campaign and select a start and end date for your campaign. 5. Set up your target audience by location, gender, language, platform and carrier. Additionally you can narrow down your target audience by adding keywords, followers, interests, tailored audiences, TV targeting, behaviors, and event targeting. 6. Also choose where your promoted tweets should appear; in the user’s timeline? in the Search results? or in the Profiles and Tweet Detail pages. 7. If required, you can also limit who sees your promoted tweet by excluding a certain audience. 8. Another exclusion option is to exclude audiences by user behavior. After you have set your target audience, you can scroll to the top left of the screen to see your estimated audience size. 9. In the next step, you set up a budget capping how much you spend a day or by setting a total budget. 10. The Advanced Option lets you choose if you want to set automatic bids to get the best results at the lowest price (within your budget) or choose your own target cost per click. Now its time to set up your creative. You can compose a new Tweet or go for an existing one. Let’s compose a new tweet. 11. In The Website Card, enter your tweet, the website URL where you want visitors to go, an image (800×320 px), a powerful call to action headline and a card name that is for your reference. 12. Click Preview to preview the tweet and when you are satisfied with all the information, click Tweet (promoted-only) button. If you haven’t set a payment yet, the Twitter dashboard will prompt you to set up the account. Once you input your credit card details, you can hit the launch button to start the campaign. Every marketing campaign must be tracked from end to end to know how far it has succeeded in achieving your objectives. If your Twitter ad is not intended to encourage users to take action on your website, you can avoid setting up conversion tracking. On the other hand, if you are say, the owner of an ecommerce store, you can track who viewed a promoted tweet and went on to make a purchase from the online store. Similarly, if you are a B2B company, you can track which of your campaigns are leading to successful sign ups or lead gens. Twitter’s conversion tracking tool shows you the return on your investment by tracking the actions users take after engaging with your promoted tweet. These actions can include link clicks, Retweets and impressions. To start measuring conversions, you need to add a snippet of Twitter code or a website tag to the page on your website that corresponds to the conversion event. Once you have launched your campaign, you can setup Twitter tracking. 1. On the Twitter dashboard, from the Tools menu, select Conversion tracking. 2. Click Create your first website tag. 3. Enter the tracking details such as name, conversion type(whether you want to track a site visit, download, purchase, sign up or others) and click save tag and generate code snippet. 4. In the next screen, you will be presented with a code snippet that you must copy and paste into your website just before the closing </body> tag. Please give up to 24 hours for Twitter to get pings from the tag. 5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Save and return to conversion tracking. You can now monitor your Twitter Ads dashboard for engagements and conversions.   Some points to remember when you are setting your target audience: Twitter Ads works on an auction based system and your budget and bid decides the price of your campaign. When you set up your budget, you have a couple of options. You can choose Automatic bidding where Twitter will optimize your ad by showing you in auctions with the lowest bid possible, while also making sure it delivers on your overall campaign objectives. Or you can choose Maximum bidding where you set the price of a follow, lead, click or engagement. You can set the campaign to run for a specific period and control how much money is spent every day, or you can define the total cost of your campaign, in which case the campaign will automatically end when the budget runs out. If you are promoting a trending topic, the total budget option will be a good fit as your ad will receive attention when the topic is hot and trending. If you are running a campaign to drive more traffic to your website, you will only be charged for clicks to the website. Other engagements such as retweets and replies are free. The maximum bid pricing for this option is between $1.68 – $10.00. The pricing for other campaigns such as video views, acquiring followers, tweet engagements and app installs vary from $0.10 to $23. Twitter recommends setting bids at $1 – $2 to get started. If you have a tight budget, set bids low and gradually increase to conserve budget. To get the most out of your budget, create highly targeted campaigns and A/B test the performance of each campaign using a small part of your budget. With this new analytics, you can launch further campaigns that will drive traffic to your website. Twitter Ads offer website owners a straightforward and easy process to setup creatives and monitor their performance. You cannot expect to get results the instant you start running a campaign. As with any marketing strategy, you will be monitor and constantly test your campaigns, understand which ones work and which ones don’t and readjust your strategies to be successful.",Eddie
2016-01-27,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/how-small-blogs-are-making-the-blog-world-a-better-place/,How Small Blogs Are Making The Blog World A Better Place,"I can still remember the time when I started my blog GenuineSEO an SEO blog. It was small like every other blog and focused on a niche topic that were of great interest and bloggers loved my content. I had my blog listed on BuySellAds and AdSense and was making a few hundred dollars each month easy. As my blog grew I began offering services to my readers and the community at large and the revenue began to increase. And then came a time when I needed to move on and most importantly I needed the money to pay off my bills. I sold my blog on Flippa and then went on to start another blog a few years after. Today I can say with confidence that anyone can start a blog, grow it and make money  . My blog did not grow to a million visitor blog but with a limit to 10,000 visitors. My blog even though was small it generated and provided for me and the family. Don’t give up hope your blog contributes to the blog world a great deal and it does wonders. The small blogs out there are doing what none of the big blogs are doing. They are driving change and disruptions in the blog world. Established blogs are often too scared to take risk and often end up being stagnated. The big advantage small blogs have is that they can focus on a micro niche market that gets them a lot of attention from web surfers. These small blogs are able to drive massive search traffic and even generate some revenue from such segments. The bloggers don’t really have to work on   building as   works wonders for them. Micro niche markets can be highly profitable if the right strategies are applied and small blogs are able to take advantage of this. There is one disadvantage, niche segments can go out of season, meaning one year they can get you a $1000 revenue and next just $10. Its a risky business if you are going to depend on it as your primary income source. Fast growing blogs often focus on advanced topics or topics that they believe is the best place to start at. What many of the big blogs or fast growing blog fail to understand is that there are millions of users who have never used much of the internet before. They have no clue about starting a business online or even set up a blog or hosting or any of that. This is where the small blogs come in. Many of the small blogs talk about very basic stuff like changing a header image and making tweaks that are so simple that we would not think that anyone would need help with. There are people who still have no idea about these things and need help. And small blogs are able to make the most of this because they write about topics that newbies need to know. Small blogs are self sustaining. Bloggers are able to make a living even if their blogs are small. You don’t always need millions of page views or visitors to make money online.  You can offer niche services, products and even offer content that will generate enough traffic for you to make money. I’ve been a small blogger and I can say there is a lot of money to be made even as a small blog. The advantage is that these blogs or bloggers do not rely much on external sources or support and are self sustaining. May be except for search traffic which they can be penalized but you can always work on recover from google panda updates and other algorithm changes. There are a good list of bloggers who sell printable like the ones I offer as a freebie to my newsletter subscribers. The etsy market is filled with these types of small bloggers and they are able to generate a steady income. I love reading smaller blogs for this simple reason. They offer some of the best freebies in the market and also they come up with the most creative ideas for new products. As small blogs there is not much pressure on our shoulders. We are able to focus on creating something that will make a difference in the world we exist. Our readers and customers find our products useful and of course they are not expensive. Some of the big blogs I know today were once smaller blogs with awesome ideas that grew into something magnificent. With the right focus and mindset small bloggers are able to do great things. Small bloggers are always working so that they can one day become a   and make millions of dollars blogging. Even though small blogs are self sustaining and come up with creative products. They do not have to remain small, they all want to grow into something big. Small blogs have only one place to go and that’s up and they all end up becoming large blogs someday as long as they do not  . Small bloggers have to work hard to keep up the momentum and also keep the money coming in. This they do because they don’t make a lot of money and they are not always known by readers world wide. These bloggers need to work to find their way up the ladder and be known. , small blogs are contributing a great deal to the blog world. They are like the soldiers that we never see but is always there to provide support for us in time of need. Small blogs are the backbone to the blogging world. : Are you a small blogging trying to make it big? What are your challenges and how are you making a difference in the blog world? I totally agree with you Eddie! Thank you for sharing this. I haven’t really sat down to think about what I’m missing versus bigger, well-known bloggers. I just keep in my lane and run my own race.  Have a great day! Cori Cori, Its always good to have a perspective so that we know where we are headed and what we are doing. You sound like a well organized person to me, just a few more things to keep in check to know about your growth. That’s encouraging, since all my blogs are small. I’m only now getting serious about them as I see the content sites I was writing for floundering and closing.",Eddie
2016-02-06,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/income-reports-and-their-impact-on-readers/,Income Reports And Their Impact On Readers,"Over the last two years there are more and more bloggers publishing income reports online. Correct me if I am wrong, I believe that it was Pat Flynn who made the whole income report thing popular in the first place. He is one of the very few bloggers who proudly showcases his earnings every month and year. It is not easy to   and when a blogger is able to achieve that goal they proudly showcase their income reports to their readers. While that is just one side of the story, there are other bloggers like Pradeep from HellBoundBloggers who likes to keep their earnings private and not showcase it to the public. There are a lot of pro and cons to both these approaches and for today’s article I will focus on what happens when a blogger posts his or her income report online. I’ve even been doing some research and collecting a whole lot of income reports and putting them together on a   that you can follow. Here are some of the Impact that a blog income report has on readers world wide. Income reports are a great way to motivate your readers. Showcasing the blogs income reports on a regular basis shows your readers how much money you really make just from   and some more details into what are the streams that are driving income. This gives readers a good perspective into blogging and if they should take up blogging as a career. As many of my readers know I’ve been blogging for about 9 years now and when I started off, income from blogs were kept private. But, as the years passed bloggers began to share their income and as I began to read these income reports I was even more motivated to blog better and make more money from blogging. This is one of the main reasons several bloggers publish income reports on a regular basis so as to motivate their readers. While motivation is one of the positives of sharing income reports regularly there are also downsides to this. There are several readers and bloggers who are impacted by this. They slowly begin to compare themselves with the bloggers who are making hundreds and thousands of dollars on a monthly basis. This comparison results in low self esteem of the blogger or reader. They begin to doubt themselves and start to think that they will never be able to make so much money as these top bloggers do. What they fail to understand is that it has taken top bloggers years of trial and error and perfecting a system that generates thousands of dollars. None the less, this can also be a demotivating factor for many bloggers and can lead them to  . Over a period of time things get more and more complicated specially if you are blogger who is trying to make more money blogging. Income reports are a great way to build trust and respect among your readers and peers. Many consider bloggers as show offs because of the display of their earnings as bloggers. Many till this day cannot believe that bloggers can make money blogging. But the truth is that bloggers are making money including myself   and showcasing this earning helps people know that you are genuine and you are not making up things to make money. Readers and bloggers trust bloggers like Pat and Darren because they showcase or at some point have showcased their earnings and their potential. This helps readers believe and trust them and the recommendations and advice that they offer to their readers. This helps both the readers and the blogger grow there is mutual benefit. There are several blogger who simply put up their earnings just to show off how much they make. However if you take a closer look at their blog there would be little to nothing that they share or teach their readers. They just maintain a primary blog to let their readers know that they are running some niche site that they can’t reveal yet they can reveal all the income they make. These are bloggers who are not really helping the blogging community or even helping their peers make money and set up a business. These are bloggers who are self centered and self interested in their own growth and success. This is the simple reason these bloggers are called as show offs. Because all they want to do is let their readers know how much money they make and even this cannot be verified as no supporting documents or proofs are shared. , blog income reports can be both good and bad for readers and bloggers. They motivate some readers and lower the self esteem of many, they are used as a manipulative technique into getting their readers believe that they are rock-stars in their industry. With all this said, its always good to see a blogger do well in the industry.  Are you a blogger who shares his or her income report? Which bucket do you fall under? What is the main reason you publish your income report? Hey Eddie, Oh yes! This one;”You Are Nothing But A Show Off” is oh GOD….. I have seen many around doing it. They do tell about how much niche sites made them bucks but they don’t even share the URLs of those niche sites, let alone how much and what worked for them. Hope I won’t ever fall into such category in future if I ever start to earn out of blog/internet.  ~ Adeel I surely am flat when I see some great bloggers, like Pat Flynn, publish quality useful posts. When I see the income reports, yes, not only do I get encouraged (it depends on the perception, though) but also got to know of some other affiliate income sources which I had missed earlier or was not aware of until then. Well, Eddie, I think that disclosing one’s income is just the choice of the blogger who chooses to do it. It does surely make one stand apart from other bloggers, but one question always remains open: Is the income report true? Or is it inflated? Because there is no proof, just trust from the readers that he/she is saying the truth. Who can tell? P.S. I do trust Pat Flynn!  Hi Eddie – I share your posts all of the time but this is the first time I’ve commented.  I agree with them all, and as an “up and coming” blogger, I feel all of the above when I read income reports.  I lean more towards the “bragging” column, and when I cross the line of decent money to real money, I personally won’t be sharing how much I’m making.  It’s no one’s business but mine.  But I do share what I do with the funds, such as my breast cancer advocacy and awareness. Another note is that most of the big money bloggers have alternate sources of income that often exceed what their blog is making ie eBooks, Etsy store, consulting. Thanks for putting such a controversial topic out there. 
Cheers, Holly Hi Eddie, I’ve talked with other bloggers about income reports and most of them feel it falls under bragging. While I tend to be motivated by them, the comment “what am I doing wrong” always comes up. I’ve done one income report but believe me there was no bragging involved. I showcased the months I didn’t make a dime and others when I only $100. The goal was to show that it’s a slow process but can be done when you have the right plan in place and I shared the networks I belong to that are making me money. Thank you for sharing this. I’m sure it’s going to make for some great conversations. Have a great week. Cori I recently started sharing my income reports as a blogger. I do this to motivate and educate fellow bloggers. My blog is fairly small even though I’ve been blogging (off and on) for about 5 years. I have made a lot of mistakes and missteps in my journey and I’ve been very transparent about that all along. 
I started posting the income report because I honestly had bloggers asking as a litmus test for their own blogs, as well as non-bloggers asking “you mean you get PAID to do that? How?” 
I don’t make a lot of money, and I make it very clear within the post that not only is this for transparency, but also to help educate, and that I am in no way trying to brag. I also state that I am open for questions (and willing to share most of the sources of my income such as blogger networks and affiliate programs). We all had to start somewhere. We were new bloggers at one point and I figured this offers up some information that people are too afraid or too polite to ask  
Excellent post, great points! I see so many bloggers posting their income reports in a boastful manner and then not sharing honestly about how they got there. I hope as my blog grows I can stay true to my purpose and intent. Hi Eddie, Holly brings up a very good point. Most bloggers that do income reports include their income from alternate sources in their monthly totals, even though their actual blog has nothing to do with generating that alternate income. I consider making money blogging to include income from: sponsored posts and sponsored giveaways 
sponsored reviews 
sponsored podcasts 
ads on your blog, 
ebook sales directly related to your blog 
ecourse sales directly related to your blog 
and affiliate links that are actually found on your blog. I do not consider making money blogging to include money that the blogger earned through managing other websites, creating other niche websites, freelance writing for their clients, web design for clients, or managing ad networks for other bloggers. When bloggers create their income reports, and include income from secondary sources it is extremely misleading for other bloggers (especially new bloggers) who are solely focused on trying to make money from their one and only blog.  They end up discouraged and they run around in circles trying to figure out what they are doing wrong because they are only making a couple of hundred dollars a month from ads and sponsored posts and other bloggers are bragging about making $30,000 a month from “their blog”. When you actually get to know some of these so called high earner bloggers personally you discover that they are not 100% upfront in their income reports with how they earn their money. And if you question them in their comments you will get very vague replies from them. But they keep doing their monthly reports because it draws in readers. They fill those monthly reports with affiliate links in the hopes that their readers will buy the stuff they are selling because those readers want to make all that money as well.  The readers buy into it, they blog for a year or two, and then realize, heck I am only making a few bucks a month. Either I am a failure or the ones making thousands a month were inflating their numbers or not telling the whole story. But by then the blogger has killed two years trying to emulate these so called high earners, and they have nothing to show for it, but a blog filled with tons of content. Because I know some of the behind the scenes ways that these high income bloggers earn their money, I take their income reports with a grain of salt, and I definitely do not feel like they are building any sort of trust or authority. I’m more of an analytics or site traffic sharing braggard. Many times I feel like sharing about income programs that have worked for me that could possible help someone else.",Eddie
2016-01-08,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/questions-you-must-answer-in-every-blog-post/,5 Questions You Must Answer In Every Blog Post,"Why do you blog? Is it to make money? Or solve a problem? Or just for the fun of it.   means different for different people. Not everyone is passionate about becoming a  . Whatever type of blogger you choose to be, there are 5 basic questions that your blog post must answer. If your article does these five things then, they are worth to be called blog posts. Gone are the days when people keep online journals, for that we have social networks. Blogs are being used to power websites and are used as a medium to share knowledge and create awareness. Businesses use blogs as a powerful marketing tool to drive growth and visibility online. This post will focus on the 5 questions that every blog post should answer and I hope that you are in agreement with me as I share these with you. 
		 Anyone can write a blog post. But what does your blog post do. Does it add any value to the reader? Is your community finding your blog posts helpful. If your answer is no, then you really need to reconsider what you are doing blogging. Every blog post that you churn out should be adding some value to the community you belong to. When you write a blog post that is helpful to readers then you are making a difference in your community. If your blog post does not answer this simple question, you might as well   right away. It will save you all the time and effort and the heartache that comes along in the long run. Blogging is not for everyone, there are million of blogs created every day and every day there are millions who  . The second and the most important question you need to answer with your blog post is are you writing to the right audience? Its important that you target the right group of people to ensure that you get the most out of your blog post. There are people who have been blogging for years and yet to see a penny because they are all targeting the wrong audience. When you target the right audience and your content is put in front of the right people you will automatically see an increase in engagement, conversions and new customers come in each day. That’s the power of targeting an audience. So is your blog post talking to the right audience, if not its time to re-assess and do some basic market research to find out who you need to be focusing on and how to go about getting the most of it. I’m sure none of us want to end up in a place where our content is published one day and forgotten the next. Quite often we link to other bloggers and resources guiding our readers to something that is not our content or something that is alien to them. The important question to be asked here is, are we doing justice by only proving our readers with the best possible resource or we taking advantage and using paid promotions for our advantage. In recent times it comes to light that several bloggers collect money to insert links into older blog posts that are performing well on the web. I’ve been approached with such opportunities in the past and have denied them which allows me to say for sure that this happen. Its important that we as bloggers take caution and only include resources in our articles that truly add value to our readers and does not manipulate them into doing something. Its important that you only link to the right bloggers and files that you entirely trust and believe with all your heart that your readers will benefit from. There are bloggers who are too good at  , there are bloggers that are too bad at writing blog posts and there are those bloggers who are stuck in the middle and somehow manage to get a post out every week. Wherever you stand within the three sections, ask your self this simple question. Can my readers understand what I write and will they share it. Are the words being used too complicated that people don’t know what they mean or is it full of errors that people lose interest. May be your content is not share worthy. If you fall under any of those reasons you need to consider reevaluating your ability to blog and help your community. If your readers can’t understand what you write then what is the point of writing a blog post. If your readers think that the content is not worth sharing when you are not doing enough to create a viral impact. Do an assessment and figure out what works best for your readers and write the type of content that your audience will understand and love and share with others in the community. Finding your voice while writing online is the most challenging task any blogger has faced. Its not easy to find your voice but once you do you can be the master of marketing and selling to your audience. As bloggers we need to maintain a consistent voice, we need to be able to deliver information in a way that is consistent from when we started blogging to three or more years down the line. Unless otherwise we decided to change our voice of communicating with our readers. Maintaining a consistent voice will not just make your blog post stand out, it will resonate with your audience, it will be helpful to your readers and it will create the impact that you are driving to create in your community. , answering key questions in your blog post will make it more engaging, intriguing and something people want to read. Its vital to ensure that blog posts address customer concerns, solve a problem and much more without which there is nothing valuable you are adding to the community. : Is your blog post answering these simple but vital questions? If not, are you planning on implementing them? How are you making a difference though your blog posts? Take action now before its too late. I know that I have been guilty if this before. I still aim to just get content written, but the actual writing is the shortest part nowadays for me. I will usually spend longer before when researching and after when editing, than the actual writing!!! Hey Harry, When you have well researched information and also some good understanding of the subject you are able to create valuable content in no time. Back when I started I used to take an average of 3 hours to write a 700 word article. Today, I’ve mastered the field I’m part of that it takes me about 45 mins to get an article ready once I know the topic or subject I’m going to  write about. Eddie, many thanks for sharing your thoughts! It’s true that finding your own voice is one of the main things to do in writing. Because when you’re not sounding consistent, what is the sense in your writing?  Your readers simply will not believe your words. Writing is as other activities need many practice and persistence.  What do I do for mastering of my writing skills? I start run-off-the-mill writing, continue regularly using dictionaries, still reading not less than 5 new books every month and using great digital tools (TWords for tracking my writing and Unplag plagiarism checker for ensuring that my ready pieces don’t have any unintentionally plagiarized parts) Hi Deborah, Nice of you to stop by and you whats even better you just left a very valuable comment on this article. You talking about your process of improving your writing just gave me an idea on how I can improve mine. I’ve started reading 1 book a month but I do not use any tools to put a check on my writing. I think that area needs a lot of work and I need to put some checks in place. Please visit often with more valuable tips. Cheers.",Eddie
2016-02-02,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/love-tailwind-review/,How to Use Tailwind Pinterest Marketing Tool to Drive Traffic and Sales,"Google set out to clean the web with their Panda and Penguin algorithms. The result: thousands of genuine bloggers and businesses were put out of business. If you are one of those people still struggling to recover your lost organic rankings and are waiting for the next big update from Google, stop bothering. There are plenty of other strategies that can give you the results you need. One that I’ve started focusing on 2016 is Pinterest marketing. Facebook and Twitter are undoubtedly are great tools for social marketing, but Pinterest is the platform that has been showing the most active growth. The   that Pinterest recently surpassed the 100 MILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS landmark and is continuing to grow at an explosive rate. In an interview with  , Pinterest shared some interesting statistics. The power of Pinterest is amazing. Now that we’ve established (to some extent!) the power of Pinterest, let’s take a look at how you can leverage it for your business or website. If you don’t already have a Pinterest account, then create now right now. Set up boards (or categories) and start following people. Everyday, set aside some time to share pins that are valuable to you and your followers. This can be pins from your site but it should definitely include other people’s pins as well. Keep at it everyday and over a period of time you’ll have a good following, a good number of pins, good traffic and increased sales. If you have a Pinterest account, chances are you are already doing all of the above. So have you seen a growth in traffic from Pinterest? No? Well, that’s probably because random acts of pinning will get you nowhere! To truly know if your Pinterest marketing efforts are paying off, you need to know what your audience is consuming, which pins and boards are trending, which are the best times to pin and who are your most influential followers are. Pinterest’s   page shows you stats such as your average daily impressions, monthly viewers and engagement levels, but they are very basic in nature. In fact they are so basic that you may be forced to rely on tools like Google Analytics to get a better understanding of what is happening behind the scenes. One tool that can make a solid difference to your Pinterest marketing efforts, one that works wonders for me and one that I heartily recommend is Tailwind. Tailwind is a powerful tool that lets you grow and track your fans and followers, view audience engagement details and measure your ROI. It is also a tool that tells you the best posting times, allows for bulk and multi board scheduling and a tool that help you identify content that can be better optimized. If you are a small blogger like myself or running a small business with a tight budget, you’ll appreciate many of the features that are packed into its economical Plus plan ($9.99 billed annually). If you are big brand or an agency, you’ll get plenty of extra features for $799.99/month and there’s a comprehensive package for Enterprise level users too with custom pricing. Most analytical tools today are out of reach of the hands of small bloggers and the ones that are affordable or accessible are either convoluted or too time consuming to figure out. What I love about Tailwind is the effort they have taken to prepare a special plan for bloggers and small businesses that is not only affordable but also one that can deliver the Analytics we want to see in an intuitive platform. I signed up for the free plan, loved what I saw and then upgraded to the Plus plan, which I am currently using. And I’d like to take you around Tailwind to show you all the little and huge advantages you can get out of this tool! After signing up and linking your Pinterest account, your analytical data is displayed on Tailwind’s Dashboard. This is a jumpy little board that holds two sections: the left pane which holds all the main sections of the tool and the shifty right pane, which displays the results of your selection. All the main activities in the account are displayed on the Profile Performance tab in the Track Your Brand section on the left pane. This is where you catch up on your Pinterest growth statistics. You can find how your followers, pins, repins, and likes grew over the week or over a custom time period. Below the growth chart, you’ll see 3 major scores that tell you at a glance whether you are shining or lacking in your Pinterest marketing efforts. If your meter is full it indicates that your pins are pretty viral and are receiving a lot of attention and love from the Pinterest community. A score of 10 for instance indicates that about 10 times the amount of content you pinned is getting repinned. This score tells you how engaged each follower is with your content. For instance a score of 6 indicates that your Pinterest followers engaged with at least 6 of your pins over the last week. This score tells you how much your audience resonates with your pins. A score of 100 indicates that each of your pins received at least one pin during the week. Wouldn’t we all just love to see that!   Right next to the Profile Performance tab is the Board Insights tab. This screen shows the most popular boards that had the greatest impact. Again, you can see the pins, followers, repins, virality and engagement scores for each board. You can click on a column title to sort through your most and least popular boards. When you click inside a board, you can drill down further into your data and see the performance of each pin within that board. Again, you can sort the columns to see the detailed stats on the pins. An Enterprise level plan will offer deeper insights such as trending pins from your website, heatmaps and such, but that’s beyond the scope of this post and my budget! Available only for the Enterprise plan, this feature lets you track how your followers, pins, repins and likes are stacking up against industry standards. To get an overall view of all your weekly stats at a glance, head over to the Weekly summary section on the left pane. This screen crunches the numbers for you and offers a quick summary of how you fared over the week. You can see: : You can see the exact number of repins, how it compared to the average, how many repins you had last week and your current total. Next is a summary of how you fared and finally you have a link taking you directly to the report that shows your most repinned pins. : You can see the exact number of domain repins, how it compared to the average and how many domain repins you had last week. You can see a visual summary of your recent pins a link taking you directly to the report that shows your most recent pins. : You can see the exact number of followers, how it compared to the average and how many followers you gained last week. You can also click the link taking you directly to the report that shows your follower trends. : You can see the latest comments on your pins and can respond directly from the dashboard. : This section shows the 3 most popular boards along with the virality score. If your Pinterest marketing efforts are not yielding the expected benefits , this section will provide you with all the information you need to start focusing in the right area. The Pin Inspector tab is the only one that works with the Plus plan. Here you can find information on the pins from your domain that were most engaging based on repins, likes, comments, and date pinned and you can even reschedule a pin from this section. Again, you can sort through the columns to understand which types of pins work best and which ones don’t. This section is rather basic with the Plus plan but with an Enterprise level plan, you can do some deeper analysis such as: : This report will show you exactly which pins went viral over a period of time. : The boards where you pin most of your content may not be the ones that your followers engage most with. The Interest Heatmaps tab shows you which types of content are the most engaging so you can refine your pinning strategy to match your audience’s interests. As with all heatmaps, the darker the colors, the hotter the content. : This report will help you figure out when you should be pinning based on when your audience is most active. If you want more insights into your domain’s performance in Pinterest, this is the section to head to. With a Plus plan, you only get bare-bones data. You can see the daily average pin volume chart and your latest domain level pins that received engagement. With an Enterprise plan, you get more such as discovering trending topics across pins from your domain, and see charts of the best times when people are actively pinning from your domain. You can view this information by pins, pinners and potential impressions. You can also view how your latest pins are faring, your most pinned images, most clicked pins, most engaged pins and pins that attracted the most comments and conversations and compare your performance with the industry standard. Finally, you can sync your Google Analytics account to Tailwind to see the estimated revenue that referral traffic from Pinterest is likely to generate. You must have goals with values set up in Analytics for this to work. As you can see, at the Analytics level Tailwind offers you plenty of great value even for the ($9.99) a month Plus plan. Tailwind’s Analytics is good, but what I love (and bloggers will love this too!) the most in Tailwind is its pin scheduling feature. If you head over to the Publish section, you can prepare drafts, schedule pins, view published pins and more. The monthly billed Plus plan comes with a cap of 400 pins a month but upgrading to the annual billing plan removes that restriction. Let’s see how pin scheduling works! The best way to start pinning with Tailwind is  by installing the web browser extension. When you browse a website and find an attractive image to pin, you just hover over the image and click the little Tailwind Schedule icon at the bottom of the image to pin it. If you want to pin multiple images from a web page, clicking the Tailwind icon on the web browser bar will display all the images and you can then choose the ones you want to pin. Once selected, the image or images are saved to drafts. The feature even works if you are browsing within Pinterest. You can select a board name, change the pin description, schedule it to go now or save for later. Tailwind’s Draft feature is very handy because you can quickly save up a collection of pins for scheduling later on at one go. No need to to spend time filling details such as board name, description and so on for each and every pin before moving on to the next one. Another plus is that you can collate all your pins and outsource the pin filling and scheduling to someone else. Tailwind’s next exciting feature is the ability to schedule one pin to multiple boards. You simply type the name of the board and hit Enter and then type out the next name. You can add as many board names as you like to a pin. You can also add multiple board names to multiple pins. Let’s say you have 10 pins in your Drafts and you want to assign all of them to 2 specific boards. Simply head over to the Add Board to All text box to populate the board names. As you enter the board name, all your draft pins will get simultaneously updated. So in a matter of a few seconds you created 20 pins to be scheduled. All that is left to do is queue it up! If you like to set a custom time when you want your pin to go out, you can click the clock icon on the pin to bring down the calendar and pick your date and time. Or you can hit the Queue it up button to let Tailwind auto-schedule it for you. If you want to send your scheduled pins to Facebook and Twitter via Tailwind, you can click the social icon boxes on the pin when scheduling. That’s a whole lot of options for you when it comes to pinning with Tailwind. But, I’m not done yet! Tailwind also lets you schedule pins like a pro! If you head over to the Scheduled tab in Tailwind you’ll find all your pins queued up here. If you want to make changes to your scheduled pins, this is where you do it. The right side of the page gives you a visual calendar of sorts to see your pinning schedule at a glance. Tailwind’s awesome Weekly Pinning Schedule (which you will find on the Your Schedule tab in the Publish section on the left pane) is where you can see the auto-scheduled timeslots that Tailwind creates for your account. When you sign up to Tailwind, it analyzes the kind of stuff you pin the most and when your audience is most active and creates a smart schedule for you. That’s the little green timeslots in your Weekly Pinning Schedule. When you schedule pins to go out, it automatically gets assigned to a time on the green slots. You also have the freedom to create your own time slots or use the recommended ones that come  with a dash border. Back in the Scheduled Tab, you can see all your scheduled pins that are set to go out at the various timeslots that Tailwind has picked for you. If you want to move a scheduled pin to a different time slot, just go to the visual calendar and drag and drop it in the new timeslot you want. How awesome is that! You can also change a whole bunch of other stuff here, from the board name to the description to shuffling your entire queue. And all of these changes and edits should take you only a few minutes. Its that easy. Check out this video to see the scheduling feature in action. Tailwind is just such an awesome, feature rich tool that can be immensely helpful to grow your Pinterest traffic, monitor your Analytics and get valuable insights on how you can expand your presence on the social platform. Before I close this post, let me quickly summarize the top features of Tailwind that is making my Pinterest marketing efforts more effective. 1.

Cori Thank you for this awesome review, Eddie! I’m a huge Tailwind fan too. They were the third Pinterest scheduler I tried, but I wish I’d found them first! Would’ve saved me a lot of time and aggravation. Haha.",Eddie
2016-01-11,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/7-things-learned-stay-home-mom-bloggers/,7 Things I Learned From Stay At Home Mom Bloggers,"Over the last few months after I got back home from my trip to the United States I’ve been following and studying a lot of mommy bloggers or the stay at home moms who blog. These are some powerful bloggers. In the past I have underestimated their potential and their ability to be bloggers and money makers. But as I grew older and began following their work online my opinion of them soon changed.  is for everyone and I mean everyone. Anyone can become a blogger, even if they do not know or have the ability to become one. The best part of the last three months researching is that I’ve learned a lot from stay at home mom bloggers that It has literally changed my perspective of what makes a blogger. There are one too many things that even I’ve neglected as a blogger and a profession that stay at home mom blogs follow religiously. What better way to share the knowledge than to write a blog post, so here I am sharing the piece of wisdom and the power behind mommy bloggers. 
		 We bloggers are so obsessed with SEO, Google and search traffic. The amazing thing I figured out is that mommy bloggers don’t rely so much on traffic from Google. From what I understand they do some basic on page SEO. From that point on they only focus on delivering value to their readers. They have mastered the art of social media marketing and promotion. They drive traffic to their blogs in the six digit range and some even in the millions. Its surprising how these simple blogs that talk about baby care or cooking or even parenting for new moms and much more drive so much traffic from social media. Somehow they are all able to do this. Its not just one mom here and another one somewhere else who is able to dominate social media marketing. There is a whole community of stay at home mommy bloggers who are driving a whole lot of visitors from social media platforms of all types. : Do not rely so much on Google. There are other venues that can drive even more traffic and even high   and customers. Stay at home moms who blog focus on what they are good at or what they know best to  . We all know that there are so many criteria that we need to consider before we start blogging. The niche we select needs to be profitable, it needs to have a low competition and it needs to be something that will draw enough audience so that we can monetize it. But with stay at home moms and their blogs its surprising how many bloggers take the most simplest of things and turn it into a money making machine. They create something valuable and put it up for sale and there are people in the hundreds and thousands that flock to purchase these digital if not physical products. : Do what you love the most and turn it into a money making machine. Create valuable products that people will want to buy. They are all on YouTube. I never imagined that they would have anything worth putting up YouTube videos, and man was I wrong. There are so many videos. I’ve been sitting and watching them all weekend long. There is so much value they pack into these videos even I learned something even though I’m not a parent yet. YouTube is big and these stay at home mom bloggers are generating thousands of readers and also growing their YouTube channel like crazy. After watching them create these videos, even I’ve started putting out some videos out there. As you know I’m an introvert and very camera shy. But with a lot of effort I’ve been able to put out three very basic videos in terms of how they are created on YouTube. Please share your feedback if you believe that I’m doing something wrong, I’m still learning and would like to improve. Lesson: Start creating videos. There is a lot of value you can add to your readers and draw traffic and new following. After the volume of videos that I’ve seen on YouTube and the number of blog posts that I’ve read over the weekend on blogging advice. I can clearly say that they are all not experts at marketing. Most of them offer very basic and free marketing tips for newbies. Its surprising again that they are able to garner so much attention with so little marketing skill and effort. Blogging has truly transformed the way we present ourselves online and this holds very true to the stay at home mom bloggers. You do not have to be an expert at promotion and marketing to be a good blogger and make money. Just some basic skills and knowledge is more than enough to get you to the top and start making some good cash regularly. : You don’t have to be an expert marketer to be a good blogger. You will find a lot of bloggers and even yourself if you are a pro blogger you will definitely say that   is the way to go. Mom bloggers have a totally different opinion about this. You need to be on a platform that is both comfortable and easy for you to use. No complications or confusions or too many things to worry about. The lesser the attention that is required the better are the chances of the platform being adopted. I’ve seen so many stay at home mommy bloggers run their blog on blogspot. Some of them still on a free domain and some on paid domain option. : As long as you can deliver value and have an easy to use platform; the platform you use does not matter. Stay at home mom bloggers do a lot of planning and trust me there is a whole niche around blog planning where bloggers are making 4 figure monthly. This is big and is growing at a steady pace. The best thing I liked most about mom bloggers is that how organized and well planned they are. Everything is written down in a planner custom designed most of the time with the bloggers interest in mind. I guess if you are able to plan your blog it will help you blog better. Planning is a tedious task if you have not planned before. I’ve made plans for 2016 and it has taken me over 2 days to figure out stuff. Get a blog planner and start planning if you haven’t already. Lesson: Planning is key to your  . Get a planner and start planning now. This is the most amazing thing that I’ve seem during my research. Stay at home mommy bloggers have the ability to come up with some of the best monetization strategies. They can create a product out of nothing. They can write just about anything and there will be an audience for it. They will do anything from staff writing, to filling out surveys, app testing and what not to make money. With that said, when it comes to the end of the month they are making a decent 4 figure monthly income and they are content. As they constantly come up with new ways to make money they increase their earning potential and are constantly growing. : Look out for opportunities, there is money to be made with everything. , there are one too many things that we neglect as blogger when we start to grow. But when you take time to look at the new bloggers and the more humble bloggers there is so much you can learn from them that will make you realize what you are missing out on. Stay at home mom bloggers are rocking it in the blogosphere and they are here to stay, if you want to learn something new about blogging, start following mommy bloggers and they are bound to teach you something new. : What was your opinion of mommy bloggers? Did you know some of them who I’ve had correspondence with make a solid 5 figure monthly income? Do you want to become a mommy blogger as well? The potential is endless if you have the will to conquer and dominate the blogging industry. Hi Eddie, Yes, mom bloggers are kickin’ a** and so rock the blogosphere! I’m so glad to be a part of that community. I’m learning from some great ladies and so admire their ability to balance it all.  Thanks for sharing this. Cori That’s great Cori. I’m glad that you are both learning and doing great. When I first started blogging I employed a lot of the tactics mom bloggers use to promote their blogs. Later on I thought I was so “smart” and abandoned some of those practices. How silly of me ! Late last year I started using blog hops, a very common way of blog promotion in the mom blogger community and the traffic I got from that was amazing ! It is definitely a community to learn a lot from. Thanks for sharing Eddie. Gee that is just amazing that you have learned so much from mom bloggers. I’ve heard about blog hops and how they can drive traffic to blog. As long it serves your community and provide value to your readers its definitely a good strategy to follow. Thanks so much for stopping by and sharing this info. You are awesome. Cheers. Hello Eddie, Yes, I have also read a lot of mom blogs. I am a member of several wahm forums.  You are right about that. They are very focused and determined. They really do what is best for them. I believe that is the best way to go. Thanks for sharing this with us! Hello Maketta, Its been a while since I’ve seen you around. Glad to hear that you are part of the WAHM communities. I hear there is a lot of discussions and support that goes around there. The last time I had to offer some service for a mom blogger we happen to talk about it a bit. Keep rocking and be more frequent the Broke Bloke community might just need a little bit more of people like yourself to inspire and support them.",Eddie
2016-01-13,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/why-writing-aint-as-good-as-it-used-to-be/,Why Writing Ain’t As Good As It Used To Be,"About a decade ago when   was not as big and popular as it is today. Only those who were good at writing got online or someone who had a strong technical background and knowledge of websites were online. Things have changed since the birth of blogging. Anyone can start a blog with little or no effort and start writing articles good or bad. With blogging you don’t have to be good at writing and you don’t need any license to publish your work online. Writing has lost a lot of its flair, people don’t write as good as it they used to. Not because they have lost their ability to write, but simply because there are other people who have joined the community who are not good at writing. Writing is losing its quality so much so that search engines like Google look for quality articles to rank and even have it as a criteria for search rankings. Writing does not come easy for everyone but if you can take a little bit of effort to reference a few guides or take up some classes you can soon master the art of writing and get the standards of writing up to where it used to be. 
		 Ever since the birth of blogging and the knowledge that one can  , everyone is taking up blogging. This has introduced the world with a whole lot of new writers that is reducing the quality of writing. Its not the writer that is losing his or her ability to write but non writers trying to write and fill the web with content. We have top ranking sites in Google that are simply made up of mediocre content. Readers are often faced with reading poor material and bad writing because they are most often written by non native English speakers. These people most often do not have a strong command over the language and end up producing poor quality writing. This does not mean that we have to live with writing that is not good. We can take small steps to ensure that we produce better quality content. Its true writing ain’t what it used to be, but with some training and education we can all do better. Amazon Kindle opened up opportunities for thousands of dollars to be made from writing eBooks. Small business owners, bloggers started creating eBooks from their blog posts. There are new short story writers emerging every day and there are books covering simple things like blogging tips to full blown novels all selling anywhere between a dollar and $9.99 average. Amazon kindle opened up the opportunity for everyone to become a self publisher. Anyone can write and publish an eBook these days and sell it at a price that they deem fit. Everyone is able to make money out of eBooks with the right strategies and techniques. Its important to note that not everyone is cut out for writing and when it comes to creating eBooks it takes a lot of skill and patience. You need to create structure and flow of content that is easily understandable. Now that everyone is publishing eBooks this has brought down the quality of writing to a great extent. I’ve purchased eBooks from Amazon Kindle that I’ve simply thrown away because it was made of nothing worth, it had poor English, poor structure and everything was bad about it. But by reading books on how to organize and create books one will be able to do better. All it takes is a little bit of effort to make it big and boost writing to a whole new level. When I was in school, the English language and writing was never given much importance. The teachers focused more on the other subjects and the language was always sidelined. If my teachers had to impart the importance of the English language and the power of writing I would have been in a much better position and be able to create much higher quality of blog articles and products. Its important that students in schools and colleges are taught the power of writing and a habit if you will is nurtured in schools so that when they grow up they have a command over the language and if they choose to write a book or even start a blog, they will be able to keep the writing standards high. Even now there are not many English writing courses that teaches bloggers and publishers the art of writing well for the web. If only there were better systems writing won’t be as bad as it is today. One of the biggest reasons writing ain’t what it used to be is because most of the writers today are non English native speakers. This in some way plays a huge role in the quality of writing and the output they produce. Its important that non English speakers take up classes that helps them master the art of writing English. Today, there are million of bloggers hailing out of India and not all of them can even speak proper English but they run blogs and are making thousands of dollars online. Not to say that all Indian bloggers are bad, but simply that extra attention to writing has to be made to improve the quality of writing. , writing is not what it was a decade ago. Today anyone can be a writer and with the birth of blogging everyone has taken up writing, everyone is publishing eBooks thanks to Amazon Kindle eBooks and many of these writers are not native English speakers and not all of them are well educated in the language. Things might not be good now for writing but this opens up opportunities for us writers to be better at what we do. : How good a writer are you? Do you work to make the community better? Do you think writing is not what it was 10 years ago? Share your thoughts and comments. Good post Eddie! My two cents: I think that in addition to these new avenues for any one to become a writer, I believe that this trend is part because people want to absorb info quickly by reading a few paragraphs. If it is too lengthy, they discard it.  This, I guess, has resulted in people being okay with mistakes made or if the quality of the post isn’t great as long as they get the right information. But then again, as far as I have seen, blog posts/articles written with better prose and good information (and longer formats) do tend to capture attention, like this one 😉 Hey Karthi,  Thanks for stopping by and thanks for sharing some valuable insights. I am in agreement with you. Cheers. [ Smiles ] I think that people actually “dumb down” their writing to attract an audience. If we were to write the way that we were taught in school, our blog posts my acquire the look of a boring text-book. For the record, there are many highly educated bloggers out in cyberspace; but they do not flaunt their superiority in the English language. Eddie, you are quite correct when you gave your reasons for the drop of standard in writing. It is also my perspective, that we should also maintain a high standard in the area of writing without offending those people who are not quite as educated as we are. By keeping it simple, we accommodate viewers of all levels of education; from primary, secondary all the way to tertiary. By the way, I love your posts and do keep up the good work! Wow Renard, I never actually looked at it that way. Thinking about it I think it just might be true. People might be willingly changing the way they write so that they can reach their audience and not sound like a boring textbook. Writing for the web is a totally new thing and I bet they do not teach that to you in school. Appreciate your comments and thoughts. You are awesome.",Eddie
2016-01-15,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/how-to-stay-popular-in-the-blog-world/,How To Stay Popular In The Blog World,"You can go from a new blog or an silent blog to a   if you put in the right effort.   can work wonders for many, all you have to do is believe and work towards your goals. Building a popular blog is difficult, and maintaining popularity is a totally different thing. Take bloggers like ProBlogger – Darren Rowse and Pat Flynn. These guys have been in the blog world for a long time and have established themselves as popular bloggers and remained at the top. While there are many other bloggers who during the last few years have popped up and have been very silent or even forgotten in recent times. Staying popular in the blogging world can be a big challenge unless otherwise you are motivated at what you do. If you are a successful blogger or if you have built successful blogs in the past you will understand what I mean by challenge. This post talks about a few things that focuses on what it takes to keep your blog at the popular spot and keep going. 
		 Often bloggers lose motivation after a year or two into blogging. They start to think they cannot become popular bloggers and even if they do they cannot remain at the top as popular bloggers. The blogging world is highly competitive and there are new bloggers who gain popularity every day. This does not mean that they can maintain top position. They rise and fall and there have been a a very select few who have been able to maintain both the motivation and the momentum that demands a popular blog. The simplest way I stay motivated is viewing the income reports of various bloggers both big and small. These bloggers are able to make a steady income month on month. Some like to read motivational books and some listen to music. What ever might be your motivation, you need loads of it to stay at the top of the popularity ladder. If you have the secret recipe to start a  , first share it with me   once you have done that you got to work on keeping it at the top which is a big challenge. As I mentioned earlier it takes a lot of time and effort. As a good rule of thumb network with the top bloggers in your industry, network with popular bloggers even if they are not in your industry. This is very important because you need to stay connected with the folks who the top of the line bloggers as they are the most updated folks in the industry and they are always in sync with changes in the industry. If they are in the news, its important that you are connected to them for all the good reasons that is. This will help you get noticed from time to  time and these bloggers will always try to work with you if any option arises. If you followed the previous point you are already one step close to meeting this goal. Networking with top bloggers in your industry and related industry is vital to staying on top in the blog world. Once you are in good books with these top blogs, its time to get some favors. Have them feature your products, talk about some free service that you offered them, or anything that you can do to get them to mention you in their blog posts, podcast and may be even interview you on their blogs. Its important to get frequent attention and mentions from these top blogs as your name will become familiar among their readers who will soon become your readers as well. This is something that will work in your favor and help you grow your popularity and visibility to stay at the top of the ladder. This will happen only if you can build trust and respect with your peers, no blogger will want to feature you just because you did them a favor or mentioned them on your blog. Those silly tricks do not work anymore. The top guns need to have faith in what you do and trust in you before you can get a mention. Continue to produce high quality articles on your blog or website. We often take for granted just because we have become popular or starting to get attention. Its important that we maintain quality and the consistency that we had. I’ve seen several blogs lose momentum and stop posting articles as regularly as they used to once before. Write valuable material that you readers love and come to your blog and what made your blog popular. Do not lose focus of what made you popular else you will start to crumble and soon reach the bottom. This is irrespective of the money you make, the new products that you launch you need to keep up the good work to stay a popular blog in the blog world. I will be honest with you on this one. I am not entirely sure if this helps you keep the momentum of being a popular blogger. But I’ve noticed that most popular bloggers are public speakers and present at various conferences around the world. This is a great way for the industry to notice you as a blogger and professional and also keep you at the top. Blogging can take you places that I can say for sure. As an introvert I’ve had to decline a lot of opportunities that have come my way simply because I can’t talk to a crown I cannot do telephonic interviews and what not. There is so much more one can do to stay popular in the blog world. What I’m sharing with you are just the top few that can make a huge difference. , It might be easy to become a popular blogger in the blog world. But to remain popular is a whole different ball game. There are thousands of bloggers who were popular once, but are no longer being spoke about because they are able to stay with the momentum. There is a lot more than blogging one needs to do to stay popular in the blogging world. Put your best foot forward and don’t look back. : Did you ever get to the point of being a popular blogger in the blog world? Are you a popular blogger? If you have risen to the top, have you managed to maintain the momentum. What has been your biggest challenge? Hi Eddie, 
In the past, I have guessed posted on big blogs. Sometimes, people from those sites come to my site, but they do not subscribe to my blog. I have three optin boxes. I am beginning to think guest posting on big blogs is a huge waste of time. 
Janice Hi Janice, Gone are the days when we used to write guest posts and drive traffic and conversions to our blog. These days you are not allowed to self promote your blog or articles in the guest post. All you get to do is add a URL in the bio of the post and that does not get you any traffic, almost. And even if it does that does not convert as well as we expected as most of our blogs are not optimized for it. My belief is that all you can expect really from guest blogging is awareness. As for your conversions. I can give you a few suggestions to get more conversions. Have a convincing call to action one that the reader needs resolved. Then, try and adjust your call to action placements. Hi Eddie, These are great suggestions for us to stay popular in the blogging world. I do network with some popular bloggers and I have been mentioned by some but I have to say I get star struck approaching new bloggers.  “Do not lose focus of what made you popular else you will start to crumble and soon reach the bottom…” this is so true. 
I wouldn’t say I’m a popular blogger and while it’s on my list, it isn’t in the top five. I’m just focusing on helping other bloggers who are just starting out and need guidance.  Thanks again for sharing this with us. Have a great day and weekend. Cori Cori, I could not agree with you more. You are doing what is best for your community and yourself. Even though you are not thinking of becoming popular right now, popularity will find its way to you by the way you serve your community. You will be known for what you do best. Keep up the good work and great things shall follow. [ Smiles ] Eddie, the very act of producing high quality content is a start to remain popular in the blog world. I am of the opinion, that promoting one’s blog via social media helps a lot. Renard, We create blog posts or articles in the hope to get attention and become popular and continuing to do so will keep you at the top. Sharing on social media is a means to getting that attention and can help you retain your name and image in the media. These are pretty good recommendations, yet I’m going to call you on one of them because, well, I’m contrary like that. lol You recommend writing high quality content. I see this recommendation on almost every blog I visit about blogging, making money, driving traffic, etc. Yet, in all the years I’ve been writing (almost 11) and reading blogs (longer) the only article I’ve ever seen describing what high quality content actually means was written by… me.   Since I couldn’t find a search box here I’m not sure if you’ve ever defined it here or not but just once I’d like to see someone else explain it to the masses to see if we’re in any kind of agreement or not. As for having authority figures talking about me… I can get behind that because it would be nice. I did get a mention in a Guy Kawasaki book 7 1/2 years ago; I guess it’s time for a boost.  Mitch, Firstly its awesome to be called out by Guy. Congratulations. As for the quality of content you are talking about. I would say it depends entirely on your community. For example, many do not consider BuzzFeed to be a site that delivers quality content. But if you ask their community they will disagree. Its about creating the best of what your community is looking for. As Steve Jobs once said, users do not know what they want until its given to them. Its up to use to come up with the best form of content until we find a spark in our readers and then keep that momentum going. Most of the articles I see on buzzfeed or huff post or bigtime blogs like that are trash and I would consider them to be not be high quality at all yet they get a ton of traffic.    Becoming popular and being put in front of a large audience is key but I don’t necessarily think it has to do with high quality. But dont get me wrong, i try and write all my posts high quality just in case.   Alexander, I was at your blog two days ago. Nice of you to stop by. I just mentioned about BuzzFeed in the previous comment. To mention it again, its about what our readers feel about the content and not just good grammar and sentence structure and story telling. Quality content is more than that. Really great points today! I might also add posting your blog to Viral Content Buzz for social shares and traffic. It has worked great for me.",Eddie
2016-01-29,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/love-convertkit-review/,ConvertKit: The Perfect Email Marketing Software For Bloggers,"Are you frustrated with your email marketing software? I was. For a very long time! I used   for a year, then it was MailChimp for the next two; I tried my hand at GetResponse and signed up to Benchmark Email and Vertical Response, but all these tools lacked one thing or another. Aweber did not offer landing pages, MailChimp kept sending me fake subscribers, GetResponse forms kept disappearing on my sidebar, Benchmark opt-ins wouldn’t integrate with my lead-gen plugin   and Vertical Response was missing RSS campaigns. I was THOROUGHLY and UTTERLY frustrated. I almost gave up on email marketing until I chanced upon ConvertKit, a relatively new email marketing software from designer, author and blogger Nathan Berry. My instant attraction to ConvertKit was that it was designed by a blogger, a person like me who probably went through the same pains any fellow blogger goes through when he’s looking for an ideal marketing solution that fits his needs; a tool easy enough to use, yet powerful, customizable, and affordable. I quickly checked out the ConvertKit website and found out that the tool had some pretty impressive features. BUT there was no free trial period to test out the product. I had to do a minimum payout of $29 (for 1000 subscribers) to see the tool hands-on or forget it. I was like a cat on a hot tin roof– should I pay up and risk getting disappointed again or play safe with what I had. Better the known devil or the unknown angel? After a long debate with myself, I decided I had nothing to lose and took the plunge. I signed up for the smallest plan and within an hour, had my opt-in forms and   all set up. ConvertKit totally took me by surprise. Was I Happy? Disappointed? The answer surprisingly is YES, to BOTH. Happy because that was the fastest setup I had ever done in my life. Just like that, my forms were ready to go live on the site. Disappointed because I had become used to choosing from a wide selection of templates with other software and ConvertKit offered me just 3, which felt more like 1. Happy again, because there were some pretty radical features I never dared to consider using on other platforms but  ended up being so easy to set up on ConvertKit. Happier still because I get to share my view of this awesome tool ConvertKit, which I believe will be a great fit for you if you are a blogger and have struggled with other tools like I have. After all, you don’t often come across a product that excites you so much that you want to wake up and sing its praises everyday. ConvertKit makes me want to do that. Everyday! So here goes! Do you remember when you signed up to your first email provider? I’ll bet you had no idea on how to get started. You probably watched a ton of YouTube videos and followed the step-by-step guide to get started and after a lot of stumbling, bumbling trials and errors you finally got it set up! I know I had a really tough time with MailChimp and although it got a lot easier with other tools, it still required a learning curve, in some cases not so much, in other cases, a lot! The most intuitive feature I found with ConvertKit is the UI, which while simple and clean is designed with a logical workflow in mind. At a glance, you know exactly what you have to do to get started. The Home page, for instance asks how you want to collect subscribers and gives you 2 straightforward options; either create a landing page or a form. Simples! Now to the unhappy part. ConvertKit only has 3 forms and 4 landing page templates and that’s all! Really? This can be off-putting for people who like to be dazzled with hundreds of templates, landing pages, forms and what not. But the fact is, ConvertKit keeps things simple and straightforward which is more than enough to get the job done. There is no distraction or overwhelming options to choose from. Once you’ve selected your choice of newsletter, you move to the next logical step; customizing the email contents. You navigate to the Settings tab to do this and here is where ConvertKit really stands out. All this can be easily accomplished in a step-by-step fashion from just ONE SINGLE PAGE. There is no need to go back and forth, no need to check out video tutorials and no need to go through how to guides. The workflow is laid down in a COMPLETELY USER FRIENDLY style so you can have your form set up in minutes. : Logical flow of sequences and clearly organized inputs means creating forms should take less than 15 minutes. Moving lists from one email service provider to another can be risky and in case of huge lists, it can quickly become messy. I don’t have a big list of subscribers, just under 500 but a simple process of importing a CSV file was all that was needed to get the job done. It took about a minute or two to receive a confirmation email and I was set. I doubt that a huge subscriber list would be a problem for ConvertKit. Another advantage is the subscriber drop-down list, which lets you see who your confirmed, unconfirmed, complained, cancelled, bounced and cold subscribers are. You can easily manage your subscriber list by tagging the cold subscribers and sending them a broadcast mail to confirm their subscription. If you don’t hear from them, they can be easily taken off the list. : You can click on a subscriber name to learn more information about the person, including the ability to see a profile picture of the person. For anyone who is not pleased with the simplicity of the ConvertKit forms, there’s always options to use lead generation tools like LeadPages or  . Chances are, most professionals who are in the business for a long time are probably signed up to one service or another. Users on a tight budget can still use ConvertKit with free tools like SumoMe. Here are some of the tools ConvertKit integrates flawlessly with: Fans of WordPress plugins can also use the ConvertKit WordPress plugin to effortlessly add ConvertKit forms to their website. : Integration with Zapier means you can use ConvertKit to integrate with just about any software that is available online. ConvertKit forms are all built to automatically adjust to any screen size. They are responsive, polished, light to load and look great on any device, whether mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop. They are also easy to add to any website. As I mentioned earlier, its no-fuss integration works seamlessly with many of the best tools but a simple copy-paste of the code would work just as easily. You can place your forms inline, modal, slide-in or on the sidebar, and you can choose to show a different opt-in for someone who is already subscribed to the original. After all, it would be amateurish to show the same opt-in form to someone who has already subscribed before. Showing another form such as one promoting a sale would be a great way to nudge the targeted subscriber into completing the sale. : With the WordPress plugin, you can display custom forms on different pages. So if you have a   post, you can display the blogging-related opt-in; if you’ve written a social media article, you can input the social-media-focused option. Incentives are a really clever and powerful way to get your visitors to part with their email address. If you are an author, you’ll probably want to give away a free chapter from your latest book; if you’re a blogger, you probably want to give away a blog planner or two. This can be tricky with tools like Mailchimp and Aweber and pricey with tools like LeadPages. ConvertKit on the other hand makes it a breeze to set up incentives. You can create an unlimited number of opt-in forms for each of your incentives and have them auto delivered to new subscribers without you having to do anything extra. The best part about ConvertKit is that you can then tag subscribers according to their downloads, making the job of segmentation super easy. : You can see at a glance which opt-ins and placements are best performing/converting and which incentives are more popular than others. This gives you the power to focus your attention on building better products and creating better content around that topic and improve your marketing efforts.   Setting up an Autoresponder campaign for sending drip email messages, especially if your first time doing it, can be exhausting. Since email messages need to be sequential, managing them often requires a lot of back and forth. If you haven’t completed your email setup, there is the added danger of an incomplete email being sent out. ConvertKit’s Autoresponder feature is called Courses and they are dead simple to create and manage. Since   using this email marketing system, you bet he knows a thing or two about how to make it work successfully. His systematic system just MAKES SENSE. The whole process of sending drip email doesn’t have to be complicated and ConvertKit again proves that with its logical workflow. The Course page has an easy-to-understand sequence where you can see how your messages flow from day 1. You can add more levels if you need to, but this smart sequence takes all the guesswork out of preparing an autoresponder series. ConvertKit lets you get instantly started with your autoresponder series. The learning curve is negligible if not non-existent and you can start typing out the email contents in the convenient on-screen editor right away. You can then preview the email and mark it as published or draft depending on the status. If you want to move an email up or down the sequence, the dashboard acts as a drag and drop editor so its just a question of clicking and dragging the tabs to make the adjustments. The dates automatically readjust themselves too! I don’t know many tools that can make creating an autoresponder series such a breeze. Do you? : Autoresponder (Courses) feature is super intuitive with a logical workflow giving you the freedom to choose who you send out emails to. Another popular feature that most email marketing tools offer is broadcasting. Most tools, again MailChimp seems to be the perfect example to bring in, makes this a convoluted process when it doesn’t have to be so. With MailChimp you: 1. Create a new campaign by selecting from one of 4 types. 2. Select the list you want to broadcast to. (Multiple lists are not allowed.) 3. Enter basic details about the campaign such as the name, subject, from and to address, tracking options and so on. 4. Choose a template and customize it to match your content and brand. 5. Type out the contents of the broadcast email. 6. Confirm all the changes and schedule it to go or send it right away. The broadcast process is no better with Aweber either. With ConvertKit its just a simple 3 step process. 1. Choose your subscribers. You can choose all subscribers or filter them by segments, forms, tags and courses. 2. Type your content. 3. Preview and publish your email or schedule it. ConvertKit also lets you choose who to broadcast your email messages to. For example, let’s say you want to send a broadcast email to promote your eBook. You can exclude certain subscribers from this list, such as those who already purchased the eBook earlier. The exclusion process is simply a matter of ticking some checkboxes. : ConvertKit lets you resend broadcasts to subscribers who haven’t opened your mail increasing the chances of engagement and open rates. When your business begins to expand and grow, you’ll want things to be automated. Automation is all the buzz now and it doesn’t come cheap or easy. For instance, many of your subscribers probably signed up to read a free chapter of your eBook, but did not go on to complete the sale. Maybe they totally forgot about it, maybe not. Sending them an email a few days later may bring them back to complete the sale. manually, this is next to impossible to do. With ConvertKit this is a breeze. At the moment there are about 8 automation rules you can perform. All you need to do is select a trigger on the right to perform an action listed on the left pane. Let’s look at an example. Let’s say you created an autoresponder course to promote your new WordPress plugin. You can set an automation rule to tag subscribers who click a link in your email message to take up the free 30 day trial of your plugin to FREE TRIAL. During the course of the autoresponder series, ConvertKit will automatically tag subscribers who opted for the free trial offer. Now you don’t just have a list of subscribers you have a highly targeted list who are interested in your plugin. You can now focus on this targeted list to send follow up emails encouraging them to complete the purchase. The follow up message could include a special discount or an extra bonus. But the BIG DEAL here is that ConvertKit is able to automatically segment your list making it easy for you to gain more engagement and conversions. With no extra effort on your part! Another example is how automation can help eCommerce websites target consumers. Since the tool plays nice with shopping carts such as Gumroad and Shopify, anyone purchasing a specific product can be tagged using automation rules so that follow up messages can be sent to the targeted group. The follow up messages could promote items similar to what they purchased or educate them about a benefits of a comparatively similar product, get them to sign them up for a new educational course or simply be a request for testimonials. Automation is an extremely powerful feature in email marketing. It ensures that you don’t SPAM users with too many email messages or force them to read email messages they are not interested in, which could prove counter-productive, leading to more unsubscribes and damaging your reputation in the process. : Automation works fluidly and rookies can get the hang of the whole process without much of a learning curve. MailChimp’s stats reveal nice numbers such as how many people signed up, how many email messages were sent, how many were opened, and how many clicked a link within the email. But can you honestly tell me if you were able to figure out which campaigns worked the best for you? No? Well, not unless you had another software to measure that for you and not unless you spent quite a bit of time on it. With ConvertKit, I don’t have to do a thing except look into my dashboard. At a glance, I can see all my sign up forms, number of visitors who saw the opt-in, number of them who signed up and the % of conversions. I can also see a tiny little graph at the bottom of the form showing the trend-line, which I think is totally rad! The top of the dashboard also displays a nice big bar chart that displays how the various forms fared on each day. By hovering over the markup’s on the bar, I can tell that “n” number of people signed up with form A while “x” number of people opted in to form B. The end result is easy analytics! I am not just saving hours and hours of my precious time with ConvertKit analytics, I’m also becoming more confident in my email marketing setup. And I now have extra time to plan my next marketing strategy. ConvertKit’s pricing is like a bitter pill. Its an instant put-off. Once you check out the pricing page, you’ll close the screen and move right on. That’s because of 2 good reasons. There is NO FREE PLAN and there is NO TRIAL PERIOD. You take it or leave it. You can actually ask for a refund after 30 days if you are unhappy with the product, but who wants to do that? So there you have it. The catch. BUT WAIT! Bitter pills often hide the pleasant truth – the cure. ConvertKit hides a pleasant truth as well. ConvertKit’s lowest pricing is $29 for 1000 subscribers. That’s steep for a new-kid-on-the-block with no free trial. But the truth that it hides is that every single feature in ConvertKit is ready to use, right-off the bat. You don’t need tutorials, guides, how to videos, step-by-step walkthroughs anymore. If you believe that time is money, then ConvertKit just saved you a whole lot of money! and then some! Also take a look at some of its radical features like tagging or resending broadcasts to unopened subscribers. These are extremely powerful features that you’d find only in high end enterprise-level providers. You get them on ConvertKit at no extra cost and no extra effort either. If that’s not a deal breaker for that price, I don’t know what is.  ConvertKit doesn’t charge for duplicate subscribers unlike MailChimp and Aweber. In ConvertKit, one email address equals one subscriber. If that subscriber is signs up to 3 different opt-ins, it counts as just 1 subscriber, not 3. That’s the right math, ain’t it! Most email marketing tools come with restrictions in one form or another. You cannot have multiple lists, or send unlimited email messages, or create multiple autoresponders. ConvertKit puts no such restrictions on use. You can create multiple forms, have one email in multiple forms, include incentives, create unlimited autoresponders or courses and so on. RSS to Email is a popular feature that almost every blogger loves to use. Most people would say that MailChimp does a pretty good job of it. I wish I could say the same but I’ve been having issues with spacing, placement and appearance of the social buttons on a sister-blog, and after a long and hard struggle, I’ve just given up. ConvertKit doesn’t offer a complete RSS to Email solution. You need to create an automation rule and manually publish the RSS feed, which is a little convoluted. The only thing I can say in ConvertKit’s defense is that the money is still in the list, so you might reconsider using the wildly untargeted option that is RSS. Pretty much every software that is designed on the planet for lead generation and email marketing integrates with MailChimp and Aweber, since they are the two most popular email marketing tools available. ConvertKit still has some way to go. Despite many popular services being added everyday, many users may be forced to use Zapier as a workaround for adding non-integrated services. Also, if you a looking for a robust CRM-type platform, ConvertKit is not for you. Its not an all-in-one solution and will probably never be! I’ve already discussed the pricing aspect before. This is not a negative for ConvertKit but clever pricing mechanisms of other service providers can easily fool you into thinking that ConvertKit is expensive. Where it might hurt a bit is the absence of a free plan. Templates are a big deal for a lot of users. All the kings horses and all the kings men cannot make a subscriber sign up for a service that has no value. And all the fancy templates and stylish opt-ins won’t help either. If you’ve got something valuable to share with your readers, a simple user-friendly template is all that is needed to get the job done. Nathan was able to do all his book sales via the same options and that’s living proof of its success. Don’t agree with me? Then ConvertKit is probably not for you. This is the longest post I have ever written on any subject and if you’ve reached this far, thank you for staying with me. In the course of my 5 year blogging journey, I have been through my share of email marketing tools. I’ve read top reviews on the best email marketing software, struggled with some free tools, paid my way through premium ones and yet never found a tool that was worth my time and money. That’s why even though I did come close to doing a full review of my personal best choice, Aweber, I never really sat down to do it. I guess deep down, I always know a better one would come along. And it did. You often hear the saying “there’s no place like home” and for good reason. To me, ConvertKit feels like home. The better part of my email marketing journey was spent with MailChimp. It’s a tool I chose to use for the simple reason that everybody said it was the best, it came with impossible-to-resist FREE plan (send up to 12000 emails a month for up to 2000 subscribers), integration on my site was relatively easy and it even worked flawlessly with every theme that I used and with my  . Just like me, I’ll bet there are hundreds and thousands of rookie, small time bloggers and entrepreneurs who have fallen hook, line, and sinker for a free plan or a cheap service. What no one will tell you with such a service is the long, frustrating, hair pulling hours you’ll spend figuring out the different features of the tools and how they work. And then spending time setting it all up. If you’ve been through the same frustrations as I have, you know you’ve not had your money’s worth. You’ve settled for less than the best. And you don’t deserve that! I know I didn’t! Mainstream marketing tools like AWeber, OntraPort, and InfusionSoft are great tools in themselves, but I believe they are designed for companies with a handy marketing team who can take care of all the different aspects of setting up campaigns in their 8 hour work day. Individual bloggers, podcasters, entrepreneurs and others who make a living online single-handedly or with some outsourced help need a powerful email marketing tool they can rely on to get the job done with ease. In my view ConvertKit is the best option I’ve seen thus far. Its user interface is clean and minimalist, yet shows you exactly what you need to do without needing to reference any guide. Whether you are  creating a landing page or an opt-in form, setting up a broadcast or autoresponder, or triggering an automation rule, ConvertKit makes it possible for even a layman to do it like a pro! You don’t need to take up a course on email marketing at Udemy to understand how email marketing works. Simply start using ConvertKit and it will all start to make sense. If you ever feel like email marketing is not for you or you just want to give up, give ConvertKit a try. Prepare an awesome plan to offer a great incentive to your readers, follow it up with a great autoresponder series and make your sales push. Its easy as apple pie with ConvertKit. What has been your frustration with your email marketing tool? Let us know and we’ll see how ConvertKit can help you out! I just signed up for ConvertKit three days ago and I’m already impressed. Oh, there are bugs for them to work out, but I’m pretty sure they’re on top of that. I’m looking forward to more fields (where do I put last names, birthdays, etc?), which they’re working on. It’s expensive, but it’s effortless. The customer service is fantastic. And you know what? I’m beginning to think I prefer the honest “this is what it costs” instead of “Oh, it’s FREE … but you can’t have this or this or … no, you can’t have that, either, until you pay.” Hi Eddie, You listed awber and some more software for building email listing with.But recently i got mailchimp for this .I noticed many blogs using awber .so think awber is very good tool like if top blogger are using it. Thanks for this exhaustive review. I got Convert Kit a few months ago and have been struggling with some of the features, but I have high hopes for using it with both Thrive Leads and Leadpages (better templates) for a Master class I’m working on. Your review helps me look at the app more clearly.",Eddie
2016-01-18,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/how-to-create-a-free-blog-on-blogspot-blogging-platform/,How To Create A Free Blog On BlogSpot Blogging Platform (Ideal For Personal Blogs),"is a great way to share information and news on a topic. If you believe that you’ve got something special to share with the world, there’s no better platform to express it than on a blog. And the good news is that blogging is not just a platform where you can express your passion, its also a fantastic source for making money online. But before we jump ahead of ourselves, let’s start with the basics. You need 3 essential assets to get started right away – a blogging platform, a web host, and a domain name. Each of these assets will cost you money. If you’re not ready to commit to a financial investment just yet, don’t worry, you can still set up your blog for free using Google’s free blogging platform Blogger. In this post, I’m going to show you the exact steps you need to follow to start your own blog for free using the Blogger platform. In this post, you will learn how to: Before we get to the actual process of setting up your blog, you need to know what you are going to blog about. Often, newbie bloggers get carried away by stories of bloggers making thousands of dollars working for just a few hours each day. These stories are true, but only for well established blogs. Initially, you have to be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into your project. One of the first things you must do once you decide to blog is choose a blog topic. This may sound like a simple thing to do, but in reality, it is the most crucial aspect of making yourself stand out among the competition and earning a lot of money. The good news is that focusing on these 3 essential ingredients during your brainstorming session will suffice. : Choose a topic you are passionate about. You should be able to churn out regular content and you should be in it for the long haul. Your topic choice should be one you can’t wait to get up every morning and start writing about. A simple example could be healthy recipes. You may be very self conscious about the health of your loved ones and spend a lot of time working on new recipes that are not only good for your family but also ones that taste great. After all, if all healthy food were all great tasting ones, we would opt for it instead of those juicy burgers and fries. : Your topic choice must have a Unique Selling Point (USP). You must be able to differentiate yourself from thousands of others who are blogging. You must be prepared to be an expert in the field or no one will be interested in what you have to say. Ask yourself what skills you have, what makes your skill unique and why people would listen to you and not someone else. Going with the previous example, there are hundreds of food bloggers who write about healthy foods. What makes you stand out from them? Do you have the right educational qualification to talk about healthy foods? Do you conduct special sessions via Skype to engage with people who want to follow a healthy diet? : Your topic choice must generate plenty of interest and demand. If you try to cater to the interests of the whole world, your website will have no sense of direction. Choose a topic that you can relate to a target audience. If your skill can help people solve a real problem in their life, then you can write for such an audience. Again, the health industry is a great niche that offers plenty of opportunities to make your voice heard. While you are thinking about your topic marketability, also consider how you intend to make money from your content. Will you be choosing CPM programs like Adsense? Will you be selling your services? If so, will there be enough demand for your services to allow you to make money from it. Will you be affiliating to sell other people’s products? If so, is there a genuine demand for such products? Whatever topic you choose, ensure that it contains all these 3 essential ingredients. Once you have decided on a topic, its time to pick out a great title because this is the name that readers will remember in the years to come. Avoid a title that is quickly forgettable or too common to remember. Also avoid being too specific and leave room for more expansive topics. Your blog title should be memorable, catchy and short and relate to your blog topic. Keep these 3 factors in mind when thinking about a  . : These are the keywords that best describe your content and how it will benefit the readers.  Alternatively, you can pick a brand name. These are names that are not descriptive but short and catchy. You can mix 2 whole words to create one, such as Face+Book or even mesh words like Pin+Interest=Pinterest.   is a site that can help you come up with cool new words you can use. : If you want your blog to be representative of you, you can simply create a title with your name. Write down a list of at least 7-8 blog names that are acceptable. If your name includes common words, chances are someone has already taken it up. So have a list of alternative titles ready at hand before you move on to the next step. Now that you’ve picked out a list of possible names that best represent your blog, its time to set it up on the blogging platform. Blogger is a free weblog publishing tool from Google that lets you share text, photos and videos with the world. It offers plenty of free templates, widgets and themes to make your blog look classy and professional. This is one of the most popular blogging platforms for newbie bloggers after WordPress. It is not completely flexible like WordPress.org, but you get quick access to Google’s tools like Google Analytics and Google Adsense and they are easily integrated into the blog as well. The limitations with Blogger is that it has fewer themes and storage space compared to platforms like WordPress.com, you don’t have the freedom of self hosting the blog and are dependent on Blogger’s current offerings. Plus, your blog will have .BLOGSPOT appended to the title. (which can be changed.) Another thing – the Blogger platform doesn’t have a powerful and supportive community as WordPress does. Despite the limitations, Blogger is still an extremely popular platform to get started on. So let’s get going. To create your Blogger account, here’s what you need to do: 1. Open up your web browser and go to  2. You will be directed to sign in with your Google account credentials. If you don’t have a Google account, you can create one right away. 3. Once you are signed in, you will see the Welcome screen. Here you will be asked to choose a profile option. You can create a Google + profile or maintain a limited profile if you want to use a pseudonym. I recommend that you connect to a Google + profile as the social platform is a great place to be sharing your content with readers. 4. In the next screen, your Display name will be displayed. Confirm the details and click Continue to Blogger. 5. The next screen is where you set up your new blog. On the left side of the screen, click New Blog. 6. In the pop up, enter the name you decided for your blog and input your blog URL. Remember, the extension .blogspot.com will be appended to the blog name automatically. 7. Then select a template layout and click Create blog! (You can change the template later, so simply select an option for now.) 8. You will now be taken to the Blogger dashboard where you can see links to customize your blog, your page views and blog stat updates and other Blogger related news and guides. You are now ready to start customizing your blog to give it a polished and professional look. Now that you’ve configured your blog in Blogger, let’s take a look at how it appears to your readers. On the Blogger dashboard, click View blog. This is what Pinch of Nutrition looks like. Let’s do a big of customization to make it look more professional. Let’s start with changing the template design. 1. On the Blogger dashboard, click the More options drop-down list and click Template. (You can also find some cool premium  .) 2. Scroll through the thumbnail of the various template designs and click on a thumbnail to preview it. Once you settle on a theme you like, click Apply to Blog. 3. On the Template page, you can now do further customization. Click Customize. 4. In the Blogger Template Designer page, at the top left of the screen, you have options to choose more template designs, set a background color, adjust widths, modify the layout, and use other advanced options. Click Background to add a new background color. 5. Similarly, you can go to Adjust widths and Advanced to modify the width of your layout and change the fonts, text color, and background color of the blog. If you plan to adjust the width, make sure that the best browser compatibility option is to keep the width of the blog at or under 930 pixels. If you want to add advertising to your sidebar, the Right Sidebar should be at least 300 pixels wide. 6. When you are done with all the changes, click Apply to Blog at the top of the screen. 7. Click Back to Blogger to go back to the dashboard screen. 8. Now its time to start adding some widgets to the sidebar. On the left pane, click Layouts. 9. The layout screen will be displayed showing you the main content area and sidebar area where you can add widgets or gadgets of your choice. Click on the Header layout to modify your header. 10. In the configure Header pop up box, enter the blog description, choose an image header option if you like, and select a placement style. When you are satisfied with the header changes, click OK. 11. Similarly, click on the Edit link for About me, Blog Archive, Nav Bar, and Attribution and make the changes you desire. 12. Then on the Sidebar 1 layout, click Add a Gadget. 13. In the Add a Gadget pop up window, select gadgets you want to add to the sidebar. You can configure Adsense, Search Box, Popular posts, Subscription Links to start off with. 14. Next, you can click the Edit link in the Favicon section to add your blog favicon. Now that you have made some basic customization to the blog, its time to start publishing some great content your audience will love. Here’s what my sample blog looks like after customization and after publishing a few posts. If you don’t want your blog to display the .blogspot tag in your domain name, you can create a custom domain name for your blog. This can be done any time, even after you set up your blog on Blogger or while you are creating your blog itself. You will have to spend a bit of money for purchasing the domain name though. Let’s see how you can do this. 1. Buy a domain name from a company like GoDaddy or Namecheap. Your blog name should now look like http://example.com or in my example  . 2. On the Blogger dashboard, on the left pane, click Settings. 3. In the Settings page, in the Publishing section, click + Set up a third-party URL for your blog . 4. Add the domain name you purchased earlier and click Save. Note: You must include www. before your blog name or you will receive an error. Blogs hosted at naked domains such as : yourdomain.com are not accepted. 5. The next step involves setting up the CNAME. Each CNAME has 2 parts   or   and   or  . The first CNAME is the same for everyone;   being “www” and   “ghs.google.com.” The second CNAME is specific to your blog and your Google Account. You can find these details in the place where you registered your domain name such as GoDaddy. The control panel is where you will find the CNAME details. You can find more information on how to find the CNAME for various registrars  . Wait for 24 hours for your DNS settings to completely propagate. Once the Settings are activated, your blogspot.com address will redirect to your new custom domain. [ Smiles ] Eddie, I have one more thing to add: if they are not pleased with the selection of templates that are available on Blogger, they are free to upload their own! That is true Renard. I’ve also provided a link where new themes or templates can be purchased and used. Hey Eddie, This is a very good article for a person just starting with a blog and wanting to test the waters. I started with Blogger myself at first, until I realized I needed more for my blog and then I quickly moved on to WordPress.org. And when its time to move, WordPress makes it very easy to move all your posts to them. Thanks for sharing this informative article with us and I hope you have a great week! –Rob Thanks Rob. This article is focused at those new bloggers who just want to set up something simple and start writing. Not all bloggers want to make money and have customization. Some bloggers just like to set up something and start writing and I believe that this article will help them get started. Thanks so much for your comment here. Visit more often my readers would love to hear you opinion on my articles.",Eddie
2016-01-20,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/email-marketing-mistakes-you-must-avoid/,Email Marketing Mistakes You Must Avoid,"Its important that you keep your cool with email marketing irrespective of the mistakes you make. If you lose control of what you are doing everything will go haywire. Simply apply the   and keep moving forward. You are bound to make some mistakes and you will learn along the way to overcome them. What makes you a better email marketer is the ability to take charge and take action. Every marketing email should have a few essential components and ensuring that your marketing email has them is meeting your goal half way. People make mistakes with email marketing because they are afraid that they do not know enough or they just don’t do enough research on the subject and some times they just don’t have a clue. Its in times like these that bloggers and   make mistakes that cost them dearly. Mark an old friend made the biggest mistake of not understanding industry best practices before starting his email marketing business. But by the time he realized what went wrong they had drove his business into the ground. This is why its important that you pay close attention to the email marketing mistakes highlighted in this article. 
		 The first and the biggest mistake email marketers make is writing spammy email subject lines. This results in either the email ending up in the spam folder or the reader deleting the email. When you are an email marketer you need to pay close attention to everything. If you even neglect one small aspect, it might end up costing you. The best way to escape this mistake is to adopt   growth hacks.  These will help you and even ensure that you only write high quality email subject lines that your readers will love. As a general rule make it a habit to write up to 10 email subject lines daily. Think of it as a routine and do it diligently and before you even realize it will come naturally and you won’t have to worry about making this mistake again. Another big mistake is that email marketers send way too many emails a day. This can annoy the readers and make them unsubscribe from your list. The best way to avoid this mistake is to ensure that you only send out blog posts on specific days. The rest of the days you can use to schedule other email blasts that you wish to send out to the entire audience. Sending too many emails will make you look spammy as well. Remember the reader subscribes to various blogs and received way too many emails already, you don’t want to clutter their inbox and have them lose interest in what you have to offer. Be smart with email marketing and win the hearts and minds of your readers. If you are a marketer like me, you should have read the book “ ” By Seth Godin. In the book he talks about the importance of getting permission to market. A lot of marketers and bloggers these days to save on time and in a desperate attempt to make it big end up purchasing list that are publicly available for sale. These lists while they may be good by which I mean qualified leads, they still did not sign up to receive updates from you. This will result in them marking your emails as SPAM or just simply unsubscribing. There is a good chance that you make a few good sales, but that does not count for the lack of permission. Its important that you   your self. Set up a website or a blog, use email marketing software like   and set up optin or sign up forms and start collecting emails with permission. This will ensure that you have a more responsive list of readers and future customers. Don’t promote your products or affiliate products all the time. People did not subscribe to your list so that they can receive promotional emails all the time. They want to gain knowledge and access to information that you offer on your blog. Keep promotional emails to a minimum may be bi-weekly. This will ensure that you deliver quality material to your readers and at the same time nurture them to the promotions that you send out to your readers. They will love the sales pitches because they love what you write and share. You cannot ignore promotions all together, because where is the money in the list if you can’t monetize it? right. So ensure that you have a good email nurturing system in place and the promotions go out in sync with that. I am not sure how many of you bloggers and email marketers do this. But recently I came to know that bloggers swap email lists with each other to make sure they reach a larger audience. This is a bad idea. Do not ever share the email addresses that you collect. Readers trust you with their information and you should never misuse that information. Sharing email address is another big mistakes I believe is the recent trend and we should stop it at the very beginning. This will ensure that we create high quality email lists and don’t get into trouble. As mentioned in the point above the best way to grow a list and do email marketing is to collect emails yourself via a blog or a website. There are many newbie email marketers who just collect emails and send out blog posts on a regular basis. This is not email marketing. This is just using a powerful email marketing software to send out your RSS feeds. To be able to be successful at email marketing one needs to understand and segment emails, nurture them, convince and convert them to customers. The last of the email marketing mistake is that lists are un-segmented and un-targeted. This results in sending out blast emails to the same audience over and over again. This will annoy the subscribers and soon you will see your list dwindle down. The best way to avoid this mistake is to set up autoresponder rules to send out emails at certain intervals so that all your subscribers get the emails once and not more. Segment your list and you are on your way to managing your emails effectively. , email marketing is all about talking to your customers in a one to one manner. This marketing technique allows you to reach out to each individual in ways that other marketing techniques don’t allow. Its important to avoid the mistakes listed in this post as they can cost you a fortune. When you get things right with email marketing you can make a lot of money. Its one of the best forms of marketing that has been followed for a long time and still businesses use them effectively to win new customers each day. : What are the steps you take to avoid such costly email marketing mistakes?

2016-01-22,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/what-mom-never-told-you-about-blogging/,What Mom Never Told You About Blogging,"My mom told me, Eddie – take a look at all those moms who blog they are so organized and plan everything to the detail. Why are you so disorganized. As the saying goes, you mom is never wrong. I took up a planner and began planning my goals and targets for the year 2016. Things are much organized now and I’m happy that I’m able to free up some time in my schedule to focus on the smaller things that brings happiness to me. Since my mom was so good at giving advise, I decided to ask her about  . I was stumped, there was so much she knew that she never ever told me when I started off 8 years ago. Blogging has been a learning curve for me for almost 8 years and I still learn new things. Its exciting and fun but the journey to make money with a blog could have been much sooner if I’d known about the various strategies and facts about blogging. There are so many tools like  ,   (I did a SEMRush review after I fell in love with the tool 7 years into blogging) and so many other tools and  .  Here are the key points that my mom forgot to mention about blogging. 
		 When I started blogging back in 2007 I had no clue that there was so much potential into blogging. It was not until bloggers like Pat Flynn started showcasing their review online did I realize how much money lies in blogging. Its a multi-million dollar industry where there are millions to be made with the right strategy. Its not late, I’ve made my first $1000 with this blog and there is only good things to look ahead with this project. I aim at a $50,000 for the year 2016 and I have a few strong products in the pipeline to help me reach the goal. None the less, blogging is full of money and with the right attitude and a good product and high quality content you can make that money in no time. This is one of the most important things my mom forgot to mention when I was younger and starting out as a blogger. I was not fully prepared but now truly believe in the potential of a good business model and making money online. My mom has been a big impact on my life in both positive and negative ways. The second thing she forgot to mention about blogging when I was starting off was that blogging can bring you fame. I never knew back then you will get featured in news networks and popular newspapers. As I contribute to blog today I see more and more bloggers in the spotlight. Paper mentions that are note worthy and news channels featuring them. This gives me hope that one day depending on how well I perform as a blogger and how much money I make as a blogger I too have the opportunity to become famous online and for the world to know me as a well known blogger. I am not entirely sure how I will handle all the fame for I am an introvert. But I believe that it would good for business and anything that is good for business is good for me. I’d be one of the happiest people in the world if I get featured in National newspapers. Anyone can become a blogger. I never knew this. When I wanted to become a blogger I looked around and was constantly second guessing my abilities. My mom never mentioned that anyone can become a blogger. As a guide we expect parents to shed some light on new things we try to pursue. I was surprised and always believed that only writers became bloggers. But the hard truth is that anyone can be a blogger today. All you need to do is set up a WordPress blog and start writing. All it takes is hour of your time to get everything set up and ready to go. I believe that my confidence level would have been much higher than what It was. None the less I am grateful that I started blogging because it has turned out to be one of the very few things that I truly love doing. Just maintaining a journal online wont make you a blogger. You need to be able to share your knowledge with others so that they can learn something from you. If you are a business its an different ball game. But if you are an individual blogger then you need to have something to share with your readers to grow a following. Blogging is the art of sharing valuable information that others can learn from. If you have nothing to share then you do not have to blog. There are millions of blogs shut down each day because everyone thinks they can be a blogger and after a few posts in they realize that blogging is not for them for they have ran out of ideas to share with their readers. Gaining knowledge and continuing to grow that knowledge will make you a much better blogger and improve the chances of you being a successful blogger. You don’t have to be a writer to be a blogger but every blogger is essentially a writer in a way. We constantly generate content on my blog and its writing information in a certain way so that my readers can gain value from it. I never realized that I was a writer until only day it struck me. I am a writer. I never realized I would say that and never in a million years imagined that I would write for a living. Even though my day job is focused at digital marketing I do all the writing on my blog and make money off of it. Something very important my mom forgot to mention, bloggers are essentially writers. , Knowing these things now leaves me at a disadvantage. I’m part of a race where everyone is ahead of me. I hope this post gives you some insights into the potentials of blogging so that you can prepare your self for the future that lies before you. : If you had known these things when you were younger or when you were  , would you have done anything to ensure that you had better results? Do you think its possible to still win in a race where the competition is well ahead of you. Let me know your thoughts. Hi Eddie.  Glad to get advice from your mom and fill-in-the-blanks from you. I have actually started over a couple of times.  Sometimes I wish I had been more focused in on what it was that I really wanted to do, but I wasn’t, so I floundered for awhile. Don’t know if I’ll ever be famous, but who knows?  Like you, I’ve settled down to making more attainable goals, rather than just stumbling down the path. Thanks for sharing, but I’m not sure I’ll come back if I have to do math LOL. All the best, 
Leslie Leslie, I’ve taken care of the math. It was a theme issue and I had to switch to math to combat spam. But now it should be a simple check box. On the other hand you will become famous just keep your faith and keep working towards it. Its okay to start over but its important to keep at it and not quit blogging. Hey there! Omg, I have probably started over a million times simply because I doubted myself as a blogger.  I also struggled keeping things organized. Once I created a blog in a particular niche I would get bored then create another one and just as I was getting into that one I’d be plagued with doubt again. So, yeah, I totally understand. Even now I can’t bring myself to make hard copies of my ideas for a new post, but at least there’s the drafts option, which has improved my productivity as a blogger big time.  I also wanted to point out that patience, even when given the facts about the income a blog can create, is something that so many people lack. I’m lucky that I’m a very patient person, but the fact that I couldn’t make up my mind was really holding me back. Laria, I am glad that you are patient and able to wait though all the noise. Its good to know that you have now settled down and able to keep your mind on the prize and not switching between blogs. I know how tempting it can be. Thanks for stopping by. Do let me know if there is any marketing advice you need and I would be glad to help you out. Hello Eddie, I too, am focusing more on my goals.  Blogging has so many benefits. I think consistency plays a big part in being a successful blogger. You really have to ride the tide. I like to write so that’s what keeps me going. I also like sharing what I learn with others. It’s definitely a journey for sure. Thanks for sharing this with us! I like the way you put it Maketta. Ride the tide. I’m glad that you find my articles useful and glad that you always stop by to share your valuable inputs. Its good that you are focusing on your goals, if they are shared goals let me know how I can help.",Eddie
2015-12-26,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/2016-blog-plan/,2016 Blog Plan,"If you are a friend reading this you know that the last few years have been hard on me. I’ve been in an accident with broken bones and damaged spine, I’ve been under treatment for a severe case of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) for the last one year, the rains played havoc over the last few weeks and the list goes on. If you are someone who does not know well, there you go; if you need something more detailed you can read about me on the  . If you would like to interview me and know more about how I’m going through these challenges and how   is helping me overcome the obstacles in front of me you can use the  . I did have a plan and I published as planned except on two occasions. One when I was on a   and one when my house was flooded because of non stop rains. Even though there was a plan and I stuck to it, I was not able to achieve the desired results as you can see in my  . This was not because it was a bad plan, it was because it was not a plan that would get me to the $1000 per month revenue. In order to ensure that I make up for my loss and catch up on my goals. I’ve set up a five figure goal plan for the year 2016. This includes a whole lot more than I can handle, but I’ve decided unless I challenge myself a little bit more I am not going to see results. I’m tired of my past haunting me and making me feel guilty for the choices I’ve made. I’m tired of not being able to feel happiness. I’m tired of being me for the last few years for I’ve not been myself. Someone else has taken over me. I’ve decided to put an end to all this and start the new year in a new way with a new life. I’ve taken a new approach to my life and my behavior. Irrespective of the OCD, I believe that I need to make changes to my life that reflects my better self. Here is a nice video that talks about what I plan on doing and the direction I plan on taking in my life. Whatever happened to me in the past is one, what is going to happen in the future I can make an effort to make it better for both myself and others around me. The main principles focused in this video are To focus on the first point, I need to Lose weight – 45 lbs as I’m about 60 lbs overweight right now and I’m struggling to carry myself around. This also adds to a lot of stress that in turn aggravates my OCD. Even though my OCD in much under control after I’ve kept myself away from all the negative people in my life, it still does get to me from time to time. I am not sure how to go about the second goal right now as I’m an introvert and don’t easily talk to people. Socializing is hard, very hard for me to do. While I make the most out of emails and I’m having a conversation over telephone and meeting people in person can be a big challenge unless I already know them or there is something common. But I’m going to lay out a plan that will make me help out people more than ever even strangers. A greet in every conversation and a big smile on my face and spread the cheer around. I’ve heard happiness is contagious and I choose to spread it around with the people around me. Blogging has been a great way for me to keep myself out of trouble. To keep me focused and working towards something that means alot to me. I’ve met some awesome folks over the 8 years of blogging and continue to meet people online. I plan on growing my blog to extent that its a full and self sustaining business that will help me lead a better life and provide for my family in ways we never could over the last 60 – 70 years. I wish to change everything that we have been through all the struggles and sleepless nights. Right now, nothing makes me more happier than my blog. As I continue to see my blog grow I will see greater joy in it. Transform   into a five figure business – $50,000 in 2016 and in order to do this, I will need to do more than blogging. Right now I have a few ideas and will be laying out detailed plans for each project and hope they will make me enough revenue to reach my goals. I’ve already made some changes in terms of the blogs design and I’ve switched to StudioPress, I will be making some changes to the email marketing section of the blog to deliver more value to my readers. With clear cut goals and project plan I believe that I will be able to reach the set target of $50,000 in 2016. Thank you for taking the time to read about what I plan on doing in 2016, I hope you join me in this journey and help me reach my goals. [ Smiles ] Lovely! I truly hope that you attain those goals that you set out for yourself in 2016. All the best for 2016 Eddie. I hope you achieve your new goals and I’ll be here to support you 😀 Hey Eddie, sincerest of wishes and good luck, it all starts with a dream and imagination. I am glad that you have a vision and you can see it coming in your life. If there is anything I can do to help you in achieving this vision, let me know. I  am getting more frequent on your blog now as I feel that you write very similar to me in terms of blogging and your experience. Good luck again and keep going. Blogging is not a sprint, it is a marathon. Endurance is more important than a spike. Hey Ahmad, You said it man. Blogging does take time and it’s not something that delivers  overnight success. There are one off instances where bloggers have seen such success but that does not work for all. Thanks for your wishes once again and my wishes to you as well.  Thanks for offering your support that’s kind of you. Appreciate it. Regards,

2015-12-27,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/blog-transformation/,2015 Transformed The Way I Look At My Blog,"I finally found some time today to work on my new lead magnet, the first year of   eBook. The eBook is now complete and free for download when you sign up for my newsletter. I was able to get the eBook done in under four hours. Its simple and easy to follow. I used a standard template I created that I will customize from time to time for my future eBooks. There are   that you will find in guide where experts share their experience during their first year of blogging. They also recommend some awesome tools that are worth checking out. I’ve already sent out the email to my existing subscribers and for the new ones I will be adding it to my email chain so you can download them when you sign up. Today was dedicated to clearing out the backlog of activities as I prepare myself for the new year. As you might have read in my  , there are loads of changes that are coming your way and all good ones I hope. There is a lot more you will be learning from me and my blog and some premium products in store for those interested in a structured lesson like flow of content. All through 2015 I’ve been reading though the   that I shared with you early in the year. These are blogs that share valuable information that anyone can learn from. I share this list even though they might be my competitors is because there is always something different you can learn from every blog. With that said, I would like you as a learner to read as many blogs as you can in the niche to get the best and the most out of it. There was a time bloggers and Internet marketers used to be  . But this is not the case anymore, there are way too many competitors and smaller providers who are niche centric and offer high value to readers and small businesses. Even   are switching from top   service providers to the up and coming systems as they are more economical and work much better than the older systems they used in the past. I will be testing out a few other email marketing service providers as my list begins to grow.  Over the 1 year I’ve been blogging my list has grown from 15 subscribers to 900+ subscribers. Once I am able to finalize on a service provider I will be importing all my subscribers into the new system so you continue to get updates from me and my free goodies. In 2016 I will be experimenting and focusing a lot on  and might even end up purchasing some services to manage my pinterest activity. If you guys know any good tools, leave me a comment with the name of the tool and I will test them out and give it a try. I’ve also read a lot about  and makes sales through  , I am not a big fan and I don’t believe I will be focusing much on it. If you are someone who is interested in Instagram, then I suggest you check out my good friend Ricky’s blog  where he has some awesome programs to grow your massive following in no time. I’ve been focusing a lot on   which I’ve seen good growth and progress. This list will help me a great deal when I launch my email marketing course in March. I will be applying these   that I shared with you in the past on the early bird   where you will be able to sign up for discounts. In the end of the day I’ve been able to build a blog that is on its way to become a  I believe that my 2016 goal will and a rock solid  will help me reach my goal of $50,000 in 2016 In summary, I’ve grown my list, I’ve planned for new premium products to be launched in 2016, Pinterest Marketing, and a whole lot of email marketing. : What are your biggest blogging achievements and what are your plans for 2016? These all sound like awesome plans! I wish you the best of luck with your eBook. By the way, how does one create an eBook? Do you have a post about that? I actually recently published a post about my goals for 2016 on my own blog. Check it out and let me know what you think I’d love some feedback from a fellow blogger 😄 Hey Laria, Thanks for your wishes. I wish you the best as well in the new year. I do not have an article on eBook writing. But all I do is structure the material that I’m going to write and start writing it into a word document and convert it to PDF and add copyright notice to it and put it up for sale. Ofcourse there is some branding and the cover designs. I just took a look at your blog, I can give you one piece of advice. Make your goals objective. For example, say I will write 1000 blog posts in 2016 instead of daily blog post.  When you add a value to it you can measure it and see if you were successful. Hope that helps. Regards, 
Eddie Hi Eddie, a nice post with real-life feedback.  2015 for me was my first proper year of blogging. Touching 10,000 visitors per month was the highlight but I have learnt a lot in this time. I am new and I am still learning but you are very right when you said, blogging makes ordinary people do extra-ordinary things. Well done for your efforts and good luck for the new year. Happy to connect and keeping in touch with you in the future. Hey Ahmad, That’s awesome that you have reached the 10,000 mark. Its good to hear that your blog has been growing. I visited your blog a few hours back and share a few posts as well. Good stuff dude. I see that you cover some tech stuff as well, its good to find a blog that has a  mix of things. People do not start blogs like that these days. Thanks for your kind words. Wish you the best in the new year. Regards, 
Eddie Thanks for a very informative post. Your writing rings true . . . which is SUCH A RELIEF compared to many other blogs about blogging. I’ll be especially interested in your experiences with Pinterest. Oh, and the up-and-coming email services, too. 
Best wishes for 2016, 
Philip Hi Philip, Thanks for your kind words. It means a lot to me. Be sure to sign up here   so that I can notify you when my email marketing course goes live and also offer you some early bird discounts. As for pinterest, I’m doing a whole lot of cleaning up of my pinterest boards and re-arranging them. Things are looking good and pinterest is driving a decent amount of traffic. I am looking to capitalize on this, taking up new courses and learning something new each day and applying them to see what works for me. I just might have a pinterest marketing course out there as well, if time permits. Stay tuned. Cheers, 
Eddie Congratulations on growing your list to over 900 subscribers! Can’t wait to see what alternatives to Aweber you discover. Hey Clement, Welcome back. Hope you are having a great holiday season. Thanks it was not easy but I did get real close to my goal of 1000 subscribers. Who knows I still have a few more days to go before the year ends and I just might reach the goal. How are things fairing with you? Cheers, 
Eddie Although my blog is only a few months old I’ve already got on the radar of some A-List bloggers. It was a great feeling seeing people I look up to share my posts on social media. Such as Jon Morrow, Kristi Hines, and…. the one and only…. Broke Bloke Blogs!",Eddie
2015-12-29,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/keeping-your-cool-with-email-marketing/,Keeping Your Cool With Email Marketing,"You might feel the difficulty of keeping your cool with email marketing especially if you are new to the   space. May be even trying to adopt the email marketing system to grow your business and take it to the next level.   is important and every business needs one. You might not need one at the moment but you will learn the benefits of a list in the future. So its better to be safe than sorry. But, how is one supposed to take up email marketing without being overwhelmed that email marketing can never work out for you. That thought is entirely normal, when   I struggled as well, but as time went by I learned and mastered the skill and today I am working on a course that others can learn from and master as well. I’ve been blogging for over 8 years and its not until very recently that I’ve really invested time and money into email marketing. Do not let the thought of email marketing not working for your business scare you. It will in due time when you are ready to get things rolling. It’s important that you stay cool about it and begin working towards the goal one step at a time. 
		 Email marketing is not for everyone who blogs or runs an online business. Even though it is a good to have and will help you boost your business online. It is important that you keep your cool about email marketing no matter what stage of your business you are in. You need to remember that you can always learn about email marketing and implement it. With that said, there are times when you are just not cut for it. You might be an individual running a business managing all the activities and taking care of all aspects of your personal life as well and adding email marketing to that list of tasks only makes things even harder for you. This makes you want to give up everything. Its times like these that you need to think smart and choose to outsource these activities to people who might be able to get things done for you for a small fee. You don’t have to always do everything that is related to your business and you need to learn to keep your cool and learn to delegate tasks effectively. I know everyone tell you to take up email marketing, lists are important and you need to start growing them from the start. Sometimes you just can’t do it and it might go with your plans and goals for your business. And it’s okay to let go and not adopt the marketing strategy. There are so many social networks and I bet there are always people who claim that a certain social network gets them tons of traffic and customers. But just because they claim it we do not adopt everything that everyone says. Email marketing is just one of those, there is a lot of work involved and it takes up a lot of your time and effort. So think before you invest your time and money. You can either get overwhelmed with email marketing or attack the problem one step at a time. Its not rocket science you know, no matter what people say. You can learn it and make it work for you and the best way you can do that is by taking it slow and steady. Work on one aspect of email marketing, learn it well and implement it. Then move on to the next step and the next step and so on. By the time you realize how far you have come you would mastered the art and will be growing your business at an exponential rate. Its important that you take email marketing slow so that you learn the small details that make big differences in your email campaign. And if you are stuck somewhere or have some questions about something you can always reach out to a blogger who writes about email marketing and ask for help. They might be able to help you with a solution for free or for a small cost. It will be all totally worth it. Do your research and get things done. If you decide to take up email marketing and be cool about it you can always take up my email marketing course on how to do email marketing to get the most out of your subscribers. This course will help you to build a list, nurture your subscribers, drive traffic, convert to customers and more. I’m working on this course so that people who are new to the space will be able to implement step by step strategies into their marketing efforts and see results. The course goes out live in March of 2016. If you are looking for early bird discounts then   and when the course is live I will be sure to send you a coupon to claim your discounts. An alternative way to keeping your cool with email marketing is to simply see the people who run email marketing campaigns. Learn what they are doing and not what they are telling you. Write it down and try to recreate the same strategy and how you would apply them in your industry. THere are several top bloggers who are able to create very good email campaigns and make the most out of it and you can learn so much from these bloggers only if you set your mind to it. This is not going to be an easy task, but if you can sit down and track their emails you can get it done. Its a very slow and time staking process. You don’t have to worry about email marketing for a simple reason because you can start anytime. You might have heard hundreds if not thousands of bloggers tell you that you need to start email marketing when you start a blog. Imagine if you had to know everything before you started something, you will never achieve anything in life. Even some of the top products like Windows and the Mac OS was launched with defects and were later fixed with updates. Its a fast paced world and you cant wait to know and do everything perfect before you go live. I strongly recommend that you take your time to start email marketing because even though you need not know everything you need to know something to make it work, else you are simply wasting your time and your readers will only grow a dislike towards your blog and business. , It can be a challenge keeping your cool with email marketing when you are new to blogging and Internet marketing. But it is going to be a challenge for you if you are new to it, but how you take it is what is going to make you master the subject and become an expert at it. : What is your biggest challenge to email marketing?

2015-12-31,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/4-link-building-strategies-seo-still-work-today/,4 Link Building Strategies for SEO That Still Work Today,"has always been the backbone of search rankings. No matter how Google altered its algorithm it always made sure that backlinks had the highest value to rank any website on the internet. Link building strategies have changed dramatically over the years while many of them do not work today, there are quite a few that still stand strong. Take guest   for example, bloggers have been building backlinks by writing articles on other blogs for a long time, even after being told that it is bad. The point that everyone missed was guest blogging for a   is not bad but doing it in high margins can impact your site performance in search engines in both positive and negative ways. However if the strategy is applied correctly you can gain good results from guest blogging. I will talk about guest blogging more in one of the sections below. For now let’s focus on the link building strategies that work in the current timeline we live in and how we can make the most of it. The four points I’m going to talk about are: 
		 As I mentioned in the overview of this article guest blogging is still one of the best ways to build a backlink. The   is not just limited to link building,   if you take the right approach. The trick behind guest blogging is not to stuff keyword rich backlinks but genuine links pointing to the main site. This approach will get you more   submitted and also a good name with Google. Writing   like I did on   and GetResponse and many other top blogs that increased my page authority and rankings respectively. Guest blogging also creates awareness of your blog but importantly it gets you that one link that matters the most. We often neglect the power of sites that host content. There were content sites in the past that were penalized by Google which created a negative impact on our blogs and websites. With that bloggers, SEOs and marketers have been very cautious to tread on new networks. Top content sites that use a different medium when compared to blogs and website generate massive traffic as high quality links as well. For example   to your blog if you apply the right strategies. You can also focus on PDF hosting sites and sites that distribute free eBooks and have your content circulated and links pointing back to your blog. Be careful as there are also sites that are quite spammy and you do not want to end up your stuff being submitted there. Blog communities are awesome. Today we have a whole lot of blogging communities that provide you a healthy backlink and also drive a ton of traffic if used properly. There are awesome communities that you can be part of like  ,  ,   and much much more. Blog communities don’t necessarily have to be like forums or a group where you have conversations. They can be social sharing platforms, engagement mastermind groups and so much more. Most groups have a good profile page and they carry good page authority because of the high level of engagement they nurture. This is still strong today and will continue to grow as we step into 2016 and is worth investing some time and money in. You just might not have given it a second thought. Why, who reads press releases these days? Well most journalists and new reporters and bloggers who report about companies read them a lot and they are very popular among them. Its important that we publish high quality press pages so that journalists and bloggers from large networks catch hold of our press and write about us. Imagine if someone from TechCrunch or HuffPost came across our success story and decided to feature us. We not only get a very high quality backlink but also a whole lot of traffic that sometimes our servers crash. I’m not saying this will happen to you if you submit a Press Release. But, this will not only get you a Press Release backlink but also a good opportunity to be featured by news networks and top blogs. , building backlinks in still the way to get on the first page of Google. If you are a blogger or a business trying to reach the first page of Google, you should be applying the above mentioned 4 link building strategies for SEO that still work today. : What are your link building strategies? Are you applying these methods to improve your organic SEO? Share your opinion in the comments, I’d love to hear from you. Thanks for sharing. Guest blogging has been working well for me. Its a great strategy both for SEO and for building my profile.  Triberr is fantastic too, didn´t realise that Triberr links have SEO value. Hey Clement, Glad that you are taking advantage of guest blogging. As for the backlink from Triberr, remember the URLs are indexable and thus the value. Cheers, 
Eddie I just clicked through to this via a tweet from SEMRush. I agree that guest blogging on top industry sites is a great way of generating links and a fantastic brand awareness approach. My thoughts on using guest blogging as a link building tactic just to add links to your site is it just doesn’t seem natural and I wonder how long it will be before big G clamps down on it. Hey Mark, I am glad that you found me from the SEMRush tweet. I wrote a post for them that went viral and got a lot of social shares. They are an awesome team. Guest blogging is good for awareness if you think of backlink building its a waste of time. But if you look at it you still do get a link and that is good for business. Cheers. It’s not a practice I’ve been particularly keen on, but I’d be interested in your take on the “link-bait infographic” strategy – create an infographic, contact a bunch of sites to include it in a post in exchange for a backlink. Article marketing has gotten an undeserved bum rap: There’s still very good reasons to maintain a focused and very high-quality presence at EzineArticles and a few others for Brand Building and Authorship references. You don’t HAVE (or want to) link to your money site, you don’t have to use exact match money keywords. There’s tons of opportunities to link to other social accounts, social profile URL’s, and other 1st tier properties in your content and bio box. Tip: Use SEMRush to help identify article directories that still rank for thousands of keywords in the Top-50 of results – and only publish at directories that still have ranking power.",Eddie
2015-12-30,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/turn-small-business-big-business-email-marketing/,Turn Your Small Business Into A Big Business With Email Marketing,"Do you want to transform your small business into a million dollar business? If your answer the to the above question is YES, then you your business needs to adopt email marketing. The money is in the list and without a list you cannot do email marketing. By setting up an optin form on your blog or business website and collecting a list or any other strategy or means you have at getting a list, it is important that you have a list. This allows you to talk one to one with your audience and pitch and even convince each reader’s differently based on their engagement and responses. This advantage will help you grow your business and sell more products and services to your target audience. I’ve been learning a lot about email markeitng that is allowing me to share my knowledge with you as well. I hope you find this article useful and help you transform you business from small business into a big business. I have a couple of posts on   when I launched this blog you can read them below. 
		 The best way to build a permission list is by setting the sign up forms on your website, blog and social platforms where you get the permission of the subscriber to send them emails. This tells you that the subscriber wants to receive emails from you and you can use this permission to target them. Its important to get permission from the reader or potential customer because they convert better and also you do not break any laws by being considered as SPAM. Its important that you stay off the SPAM list and convert better. There are so many other ways you can build a list. You don’t always have to   from scratch. There are various vendors in the market that have already built a list and have segmented them based on various criteria. These lists are available for sale and you can always purchase these lists to make the most out of the time you have missed out. Sometimes you can simply network with bloggers and have them to send out your campaigns through their list. Not every blogger like to share his or her list, but its always an option that is available to you. I’ve tried out solo ads in the past and it has helped me a great deal to get new audience and subscribers. Once you have begun the process of growing your list its time to start sending out your lead nurturing campaign. This is something that will get your subscribers used to receiving your emails and make them comfortable. It’s important to nurture you subscribers because this helps in increasing engagement rate. An increased engagement rate means that you can get more people to buy from you. This plays a huge role in making money from your email list. This method is only possible if you have a permission list and you cannot apply this system when you purchase a list or using a shared list. Now that you have begin nurturing your audience, it’s time to start segmenting your emails subscribers and getting them on another list where you can target them. We will talk a bit more about targeting and selling in the next section. But for now lets focus on segmentation.  You can segment your post before you start a list or after the email is collected. While today there are some email service providers will help you to segment your list based on demographic, gender and so on, many do not offer that  feature. To ensure that you get the most out of email marketing it’s important to segment your subscribers based on interest and gender this will allow you to target the right people at the right time. Once segmentation is done it is time to start targeting each segment of the list so that you can sell them the right product. Imagine that you have a list for blog post updates, one for free eBook on hairstyles and one for gadgets. With this information you will be able to send out gadget related deals and offers to the gadget list and hairstyle related materials to the hairstyle list and your blog updates to another list.  This keeps your list active and reduces unsubscribe rate and even helps maximize your sales. , Emails allow you to directly talk to people unlike   where you talk to a group or an audience. This is why email marketing is so powerful and can grow your business big. Adopting   and the various section outlined in this email will allow you to grow your list, target it and convert them to customers. And that’s growing your business from small to big. : Are you doing what it takes to take your business to the next level?

2016-01-06,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/9-biggest-blogging-blunders-and-how-to-avoid-them/,9 Biggest Blogging Blunders And How To Avoid Them,"I started   about 8 years ago and back then there were not many bloggers who pointed out each others blunders in the field of blogging. They all spoke about blogging can do this and that, but never what we were doing wrong. It took a long time before bloggers or marketers began to look at the broader picture and started providing articles that supported and helped even a newbie who had no clue about blogging. Blogging is fun and its a great way to keep stress out of your life and also make that $50,000 Annual income. Blogging for me has been lucrative and I’ve been capitalizing on it year on year. I’ve been helping out my community with information that is normally sold as a consultation for hundreds of dollars. I blog so that you do not make the mistakes that I made when I started off as a blogger. You can be better than what I was and you can make money much sooner than I did. Blog with passion and take it one step at a time and avoid these blogging blunders at all cost and you are already so many steps ahead of the game. 
		 The first in line to be crowned the biggest blunder bloggers make during their tenure as bloggers is writing and hoping that someone would read it and find value from it. Blogging is marketing and if you do not know your audience you are not going to reach them and if you can’t reach them then no one is going to read your blog and you are never going to become popular. The best way to avoid this is to do some market research well before you start your blog and understand your target audience and write with a focus towards them. It is okay if you already started your blog, its better late than never. So do your market research now and target the right type of people so that you can make more money by converting better. There are millions of blogs out there and thousands of   each day. And most of these blogs focus on generic subject matters or a wide range of subjects. Most often these bloggers believe that they are going to run out of ideas and start to make the topic they write about wide. This is a big problem. Why? you ask. Because someone who is looking for gadgets is not going to be looking for gardening, for example. Bloggers blunder by mixing up too many different things that creates a massive impact on their blog in the long run. The best way to fix this is to pick niche focused blogs. Write about one subject, let it be detailed and let it be broad enough that you don’t run out of topics to write about. This way when someone is looking for information on gardening and then they land on a gardening blog they have a whole lot to learn from what you have to offer and also they might subscribe and receive future updates from you. Another big problem with bloggers these days is that they are very inconsistent in their blogging. One time they post on weekend and another they don’t. Sometimes bloggers leave a long gap before they are back on their blogs again. There are many a times, I’ve left comments on blogs only to wait for 3 or more months to get a response because the blogger was away or focusing on another project. These things create a negative mindset with readers across the world. They forget to visit your blog because they think you are no longer writing, they unsubscribe at times and forget about you all together. The best way to overcome this is to plan your blog posting routine. Create a blog calendar either online or using printed copies. If you are looking for online options I would suggest  and if you are looking for printed planner I would suggest  Planner which is available on Amazon alternatively you can sign up for my newsletter and get the free printables blog planner. For 2016 I’ve set a plan to write 3 times a week on this blog, now this depends entirely on your time and availability. But by being consistent your readers are most likely to visit more often because they know you will have something new for them. There is a lot of information on the world wide web stating that the more posts you write and the more frequent you publish your site would rank better and drive a ton of search traffic. Honestly, I cannot say if this is true or false as I’ve not tested this yet. But to be honest by following the strategy of focusing on the volume of posts that are published, bloggers are making the biggest blunder; they begin compromising on the quality of the articles. This creates a bad image and people will start to visit your blog in the beginning, but as time goes by they will start to feel that you post too frequent and that the quality of the articles are not up to standard. Now, if you have an editorial team that’s a totally different story, but if you are an one man army like myself then you are in for some rough times my friend. The best way to overcome this is to ensure that you only publish posts that you can handle. Like I mentioned in the point about, based on my availability I can write 3 posts a week and anything more than that would be way too much for me to handle. So the best thing to do is figure out the perfect rhythm and follow the posting pattern. Check out how you can   and keep your readers wanting more. I’ve noticed this mostly among new bloggers these days. They think that if they write a blog and create a product everyone will come running to them. They forget that blogging is not about themselves its about your target audience and your readers. If you are not able to put your readers first and above your needs you are in the wrong business. Remember, its always about helping your readers and solving their problem. As a blogger if you can avoid this blunder you are on your way to making a whole lot of money. Doing a survey, asking engaging questions and figuring out a way where your readers can respond to you and find a way to let you know what they what and what you can do to help them out will put you in the right path to success. When it comes to blogging many think its just writing. Why would I need to plan. I can always write something off the bat and my readers would love it and share it and I would make a whole lot of money from my blog. The hard truth is that’s not how blogging works. You need a good strategy, plan and execute the well laid out money making system. Its all about what you can do, how you do it and how much money its going to make you. And in order for all of this to work out you need to have a rock solid plan. Without which you are not getting far. You might make some money, but its never going to be a six digit or a seven figure income. There are hundreds of planners out there that can help you plan your blog. Its all about putting your right foot forward and start the planning process right away. Even today there are so many blogs that I visit that do not have social sharing options on the article pages. Bloggers do not understand the importance and the power of social media and what it can do for them. There are so many awesome blog posts that I’ve read but simple never shared them because the blogger cared less to optimize them for social media. The simplest thing bloggers can do is add social sharing buttons so readers can share them on platforms they like and drive some traffic and visitors to your blog. In this day and age if you cannot give importance to social media you might as well go offline, you are simply wasting your time online. The key note that bloggers need to take here is to be available on top social platforms and also optimizing their blogs and websites for social media. This gets your business in front of more readers and customers than you imagined. I often read that blogger spend too much time on SEO and they forget the audience. Most often I see this in reverse, there are so many blogs that I StumbleUpon each day that have some awesome information and I would have never seen them if not for the social network. They are never to be found on search engines because how everyone else is using SEO to their advantage but the quality content providers are neglecting it. I believe that anyone who is online, need to cover the basics of SEO so that they can get to the readers who is looking for them. Remember its not about what you want and what you care about, its about what your readers want and where they are. Your content needs to be available at as many platforms as possible and that means search as well. I made this same mistake when I started out as a blogger. I wrote about subject that was already out there. I covered topics that top bloggers covered. I was making money but it was not a lot and I often lost most of my readers because they were finding better content from experts in the field. The bigger blogs were drawing away the readers from my blog. The mistake here is that we tend to focus on the same subject and the same posts even at times without realizing it. By taking a subject, writing your perspective, your strategies and something that is entirely new can drive growth and progress to your site. What you need to focus on is that if its already out there don’t bother writing about the same topic unless you have something entirely different to say about it. , You might be a new blogger or a seasoned blogger it does not matter. If you are making these blogging mistakes or blunders then its costing you money and you are putting your reputation on the line. By reading this article and putting these points in check you will be able to set things on track and be a better blogger. Its not just about   anymore, its about not making the above mentioned blunders and seeing success. : Do you want to  ? Then take action now and put these tips and suggestions into action and start rocking your blog to success in the new year. I’m thinking about blogging about blogging on FS. Could be fun! Blogging is definitely a great way to connect. Always enjoy reading articles on how to improve ones blog. I agree entirely about quality and not quantity. When I first started blogging it was the opposite. Today, I focus on good content & social media interaction.  Like any business, you never stop learning! Hey Robert, We are constantly learning and evolving in every aspect of our lives. Its good to hear that you have learned and stepped up your game. Keep rocking. Cheers,

Social media platforms are one of the best sources of traffic because there are literally thousands of people active on these platforms at any point in time. Facebook with over a billion active monthly users is the most sought after traffic source so in this post we’re going to be showing you how you can drive targeted traffic to your blog from Facebook.

Do you want people to engage with your ad like sharing or commenting on it? Do you want people to like your page, do you want them to visit your website or do you want them to know that you exist?

Allowing Facebook to set its own audience profile is a definite No-No. Although Facebook will show your ad to whoever is most likely to click, this is NOT a targeted list. You will be the loser if you follow Facebook’s recommendations. Instead target your audience by going to your competitor’s fan page and clicking on the profiles of people who like that page and target them. Keeping your target audience to less than 10K is realistic because the more narrow the audience is the more likely you are to have a higher CTR and conversions. Facebook also allows you to define your target audiences using certain tools. : Use the Create Audience option to make your own target audience for each post type. For example, if you run a travel blog and want to boost a post that talks about ecotourism, you can create your Audience profile to match that interest. You can name your new audience using a keyword so you can always reuse that targeted audience the next time you want to promote an ecotourism related post. When you choose your audience age, gender, country or languages select them based on Facebook Insights or Google Analytics data. You can further choose to include or exclude people with specific interests using keywords. : Your email list consists of people who have indicated an interest in your product and are most likely to buy from you. You can import your email list to Facebook’s Custom Audience to target them. Facebook will compare the data you uploaded with those on its database and draw up your audience. : You can also get Facebook to find people who look like your current customers,   or Page fans. If you’ve uploaded a list of custom audiences, you can then link them to Lookalike Audiences to find your target audience. You can also attract your website visitors by installing a tracking code using   on your web pages to create Lookalike Audiences based on your website visitors. Finally, you can also create Lookalike audiences based on people who liked your page. Facebook Exchange: You can also target people who have done things on the Internet that indicate an interest in your business. This can be based on actions they have taken online such as visiting your website. Finally, you can combine your target audiences for a better reach. For instance you can target lookalike and interest audiences or fans of a page, fans and friends, and lookalike audiences or any combination thereof. Testing a target audience combination say for a period of at least 72 hours will help you better narrow down your target list. Before you begin the process of budgeting your Facebook ads, you need to meet certain prerequisites and goals you need to quantify. If you don’t have a strong Facebook presence it becomes difficult to sell anything. Fans are a lot easier to engage with and are more willing to click and buy than non-fans. If you don’t have a good presence, you’ll have to first start building one and this will take time. When you are preparing a Facebook campaign, make sure you have a dedicated resource who can create helpful content that can target your fans and audience. Make sure your website is well optimized and content is regularly published. Ensure that your landing page or sales copy is well optimized for conversion with clear call to actions. Usually, you can expect to spend anywhere from $.50 to $1 per Facebook fan. This depends on a number of factors such as niche, brand recognition, established presence and country. If you are planning to increase your fans by 50,000, you’ll need a budget spend of between $25-50K. If you want to build an email list with an attractive Facebook giveaway, you can expect to spend at least $1 a subscriber. This valuation can vary depending on how targeted your audience is. If you have a website with lots of viral content – click-bait headlines, attractive image and great content, you can get website referrals for as little as $0.10 cents. However a more reasonable pricing will be in the range of $0.35 cents. Buffer   a small budget of $5 a day made on its Facebook campaigns. Moz on the other hand was able to   by 4000 people on a $1 a day budget. The experience for you may be different. Again, making your ad attractive as hell could well turn the tide in your favor.   made some interesting reveals when setting up Facebook ads. For instance, giving away something free, showing social proof, clearly spelling out the benefit to the reader, and removing the right side advertisement are a few points that are still valid today. Noah’s budgetary recommendation is $3.33 a day to keep it within $100 a month. There is obviously no one perfect way to succeed at Facebook marketing. What works for one may not work for another. However, if you are able to clearly define your audience, test target audience combos, optimize your ads, and track your performance closely, you will be able to weed out inefficiencies and adjust your strategies to make Facebook ads work to your advantage in driving targeted traffic, generating leads and making conversions.",Eddie
2016-01-25,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/reasons-why-you-should-never-give-up-on-blogging/,5 Reasons Why You Should Never Give Up On Blogging,"On a beautiful Friday evening I was sitting on the rooftop gazing at the skies and realized that there was so much more in this world and I am just a speck in it. The earth is a speck in the galaxy, and our solar system in the milky-way and I virtually do not exist when compared to the millions if not billions of stars in the universe. It was then it gleaned on me that I was worrying myself unnecessarily and getting depressed for no reason. You might not know it, but my 2015 performance was not up to par and I did not meet my goals. I’ve set some pretty high goals for 2016 and have already started to feel the pressure. I started off with   in 2007 and today I’m at the stage where I’ve been creating my own products. Its easy to start a blog, or write a   post and even start to  . But with all of this comes a lot of responsibility and unwanted stress. I love blogging and creating new products, services or solutions. But my anxiety always seems to get the better of me. But on this day something opened my eyes and showed me that I did not have to worry and everything had its purpose and value and my blog was also doing what it was intended to do in the blogosphere. 
		 No matter the mistakes you make as a blogger you are still perfect. Blogging is a learning process where you improve along the way and become a better writer, marketer and drive traffic like you cannot imagine. Don’t let anyone tell you what you are not fit to be a blogger or you are not cut out to be a blogging. Take it one step at a time and keep moving forward and you will eventually strike gold. Just don’t quit already. Millions of bloggers quit each day because they give up on their dreams and hope right when they are about to start making money online. All you have to do is keep in mind that you are a perfect blogger and there is nothing wrong with you. Making money with a blog is not hard, there are mommy bloggers who make a whole lot of money and also several other bloggers who make money. I even have a Pinterest board collecting the list of bloggers who publish their income reports. If you are interested you can follow the  . This is a collection of social proof that bloggers can make money online and lots of it. Do not quit just because you have not yet started to see the money come in, last year I only made $1000 when my blog has the potential to make over $12000 annually. There is so much more that you can do better with a blog to make money. Focus on quality content, monetization models and consistency and you will be on your way to making money with a blog. Blog planning, this is something that I did not do very well when I started to blog back in 2007. Blogging was more a fun activity for me and I enjoyed and still enjoy sharing knowledge by blogging. My first tip would be to get your hands on the   and start planning your blog every step of the way. This will keep you organized and remind you of the various things you need to do as a blogger and also get things done in a timely and consistent manner. The important point to follow here is to keep your head in the game and plan it all out. Your blog is unique no matter how many other blogs are out there in the same niche that you are in. Many bloggers think that they are in a niche where there is too many blogs, but the truth is that you write about the subject with your opinion and experience on the subject. This helps shed light on the subject in a way that the reader never viewed it before. Keep writing and don’t give up too soon and always believe in your blog and what it can do for you and your growth online. As long as you continue to share your experience and opinion your blog will remain unique. In an earlier post I highlight the reasons why someone should  . Now, I tell you its better if you continue. While my views might be contradicting, at some point you have to throw in the towel when and if you figure out its not your thing even if there is money in it. You might lose out on something, but working or something that you do not love is like being slave to your master. Do not quit blogging. There are amazing things that you will experience as a blogger. Meet new people, network with top guns and even get nominated for various awards and make money blogging. , do not let anyone tell you that you are not fit to blog or call yourself a blogger. You can always better yourself and as part of life we are all constantly working to be better than ourselves from yesterday. Staying focused and determined in the key to your success as a blogger. : Have you ever reached a point where you lost all hope, and faith as a blogger. Have you been treated in a way that you believed that you could never do anything. Has anyone made you look small? Share your experiences in the comments below. I doubt myself as a blogger all the time. I’m not sure how to stop doing that Laria, Here is my suggestion. Try to cultivate a habit where you do not focus on the future but the present moment of what you are doing. Most of all this thought comes from worrying about if you will be successful, if you will make money and so on. By focusing on the moment you will be much more effective as a blogger. Never thought of that! Thanks a ton for the advice! I think I actually felt some weight lift! As you say, “Take it one step at a time and keep moving forward”. Success comes one small step at a time. When someone shares your post. When you get a new comment on your blog. When someone links to a post you’ve written. Work hard and be patient. Glad that we are in agreement there Clement. I always believed that if we take one step at a time we will not lose focus and can stay determined towards what we are trying to achieve. Glad that you stopped by. You make a very good point, Clement! I will focus on that instead of thinking so far ahead. This is inspirational. I started a free blog in 2014 and after a while stopped. Now 2016 I have a paid blog and want to grow it as I enjoy reading and writing. Time is not always on my side but this time I am going to carry on and see where it will take me. Thanks for the inspiration Jenny, I am glad that you found this post inspiring. Many often tell me that I should give up on blogging and that I am a bad writer. But my gut keeps telling me to continue writing and I would eventually become better at it. I’ve been doing this for 9 years and thankfully have been able to make money every year. Not the large sums you see with top bloggers but just enough to keep me happy and excited. I am checking out your blog now, you are doing a good job and if you need any help marketing do let me know and I’d be happy to help out. Hi Eddie.  What a touching post.  You laid it all out for us to see, which was courageous.  I think that we tend to think everyone but us is having enormous success, and that’s not true. As I wrote in my first post of 2016, I didn’t meet my goals for 2015, either.  The important thing is to keep working and trying new things.  I’m in the game for 2016 and will keep going as long as I am able.  Thanks for sharing with us. All the best, 
Leslie Leslie, Its good that you evaluated your performance and also having a positive attitude towards 2016. Keep working hard and take action on your goals and you will make good all your focus areas. Thanks for your kinds words. I’m happy that the article resonates with my readers as well. This article is very encouraging. I’ve been publishing since the summer of 2007 and I’ve seen lots of blogger and publishers give up. Some attempt to re-invent their websites – which isn’t a bad idea if they believe the changes will bring them closer to their goals – but most simply give up because they’re not seeing any success. I publish in the health and wellness niche. I love what I do and I believe in what I do. I publish to educate and inform; my website is a business, however, and I take this very seriously. I expect others who approach me for article posting to also take this seriously.  Often times, people will tell you that you can’t make it because they don’t have the confidence or gumption to succeed. Or they want to steal from you and will attempt to belittle your plans because they want to take your idea for themselves. So always be careful who you talk to, but don’t live in a bubble or listen to the naysayers. Do what’s right. Do things that make a positive difference in this world and ask God to help you. If you approach Him with your concerns and don’t give up, eventually you’ll bear good fruit. BTW, I’m happy that Broke Bloke Blogs retweets my tweets. Thank you. Joseph @blog4health This is what I needed to hear tonight. I don’t want to quit. I’m just overwhelmed at all there is to do. Now it’s tax season again and I’ll have to devote blogging time to filling out tons of forms until it’s over. Life keeps interfering with  blogging.",Eddie

As users of the internet the people tend to surf social platforms more than anything else on the web. There was a time when Google search topped that, but today its the social networks that are most visited and the sites that people spend most of their time. As bloggers we are losing customers and visitors as more and more people are flocking to social networks instead of websites for information. Our blogs are becoming a little less of importance. With that said, eventually they do end up on sites but social platforms are even staying updated to keep readers more on their platforms. Allowing publishing options like LinkedIn and Facebook Notes people are exploring these options as they come free of cost and an pre-defined audience attached to it. To counter this we bloggers and marketers are using social media marketing tactics to get readers to view our content. We are desperate in getting readers attention that sometimes we even cross the lines and start spamming a little bit to get their attention. This article focuses on various marketing strategies that helps bloggers and internet marketers generate social leads or simply leads using social platforms. Facebook contests are on the rise and more and more marketers who use facebook marketing strategies tend to hold facebook contests that gets a user’s name and email to gain access to hidden treasures and sometimes something free of high value and at times it can be just a membership that allows you to access content that’s only made available to members.

2015-12-16,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/blog-types/,5 Blog Types Based On Content Creation,"What type of content do you create as a blogger? Does it work for you? Whatever be the answer to the questions, different types of articles work for different types of bloggers. Some bloggers write generic content and some tutorials and some list based articles and so on. What works for one does not necessarily works or the other. What is most important and what bloggers need to pay attention to is what their readers want and like. Write content that your readers will love and come back for more.  is all about writing quality articles for many and for business its nothing but a marketing tool that helps create awareness and may be win new customers. Whatever be the reason, the type of content you create will make all the difference. Each niche demands a type of content and there are bloggers who adopt the methodologies accordingly. While there is no hard and fast rule as to what type of content you must create as a blogger, here are some that I think are the most common and something that you can consider writing for your blog. These are bloggers who claim to be in a niche but in truth they write about a whole lot of things and are not essentially niche centric. A good example for a blog that writes about topics that are not just about blogs is  . This blog offers some quality articles but tends to have a variety of generic posts that don’t necessarily add value to the readers as the content is distributed and not entirely focused on the niche. There is nothing wrong to be a generic blog. ShoutMeLoud gets millions of readers monthly and the readers seem to love what the blog has to offer. Irrespective of the type of content it creates it draws people and generates traffic. This shows that the blogger Harsh is creating content that is what its readers long for and keep coming back for more. A big thumbs up to his efforts and Broke Bloke wishes him all the success. And there are these blogs that purely write tutorials that help people do stuff on their own. They are more like a learning portal that enables better lives.   is one of the most popular tutorial blogs or websites on the internet. These sites are most sought after by people who are looking to learn new things. While most tutorial sites follow and teach how to use various tools there are also other sites that teach marketing, patience, personal development and many more. Tutorial based sites draw a ton of traffic and are most sought after my sponsors. They are easy to target and easy to run and maintain. Are you a tutorial based blogger? If yes, what subject is your blog focused on? This is the current trend where blogger pick up statistics on performance of various blogs and put it together to justify their means and write an article based on all. 99% of the time the article is written to suite the facts. Today you will find almost every blogger trying to do this. And its not just what they have experienced its what others around the blogosphere have experienced.  is one of the very many blogs that writes articles that are stats driven. These get the attention of the reader very easily as people are quickly drawn to numbers  and when information is shared to suite those numbers people begin to believe. These sites are able to grow their lists and generate leads easily and quickly become crowd favourite. A strategy focused blog is one that most often shares strategies around how to get a certain job done. For example my blog   is a strategy focused blog where I share marketing strategies that helps other to market and promote their business online. While this is quite similar to a tutorial blog, the content of the site is focused mostly on strategies and not on tools or products. This slight variation causes the differentiating factor between a tutorial blog and a strategy blog. These blogs do more than just teaching you something new they help you achieve desired results. Another one of the blog types that was very popular and is still most sought after are those blogs that write list posts. While almost every blogger implements the list post strategy within their blogs. A few years back this was all the rage and people created dedicated blogs that focused on creating only lists and one such blog is  . Very popular and generating hundreds of dollars in revenue in paid advertisement, these sites never seem to amaze you. There is always something to write about and there is always something to inspire you. Writing list posts makes both the reader happy and the blogger happy. Creating content with a little research can get the job done. There is always a blog that thrives solely on guest submission. While many blogs start off as a regular blog many bloggers lose interest or focus and soon open their blogs to guest submission. One of the very     is one such blog that accepts tons of guest articles these days and barely publishes its own content. Sometimes I even wonder if Darren writes any more, now that he runs a multi-million dollar business. Blogs that accept guest submissions get to enjoy their free time without having to create their own content and the guest submitters get to showcase their skills and get some attention. If you are a blogger who is working towards   these are some good options you might want to consider. Share your thoughts and opinions in the comments below. Thank you for this list!  It looks like guest post based blog is not a bad idea (this is what I am trying to switch to from creating my own content as it is so much easier, to be honest!) Wish you the very best Natalia. Guest blogging can be benefiting when you are working on a side project as it free’s up so much more time. But a word of caution – Google does not like it, so be careful and take all necessary precautions. Very interesting way of classifying blogs. Going by what you said, I’m also a strategy focussed blogger. Hi Clement, Thats nice to hear. I love blogs that talk about strategies as well. They are more focused on helping businesses and also helps you get some consulting or even services gigs every now and then. Cheers,

2015-12-17,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/improve-your-chances-of-landing-a-guest-post-on-any-blog/,Improve Your Chances Of Landing A Guest Post On Any Blog,"Landing A Guest Post by   seems like a daunting task. To be honest with you, there is no denying that it takes a certain degree of skill to be accepted as a ProBlogger. However, with that being said, getting your guest post at top blogs is not a invincible challenge. You don’t have to be the best writer in the world to be accepted. You don’t have to resort to black magic, bribes, twisting of the arms or any other unfair means. All you need is preparation and focus. That is what works for me as a blogger, and if you put your heart, soul and mind to it, it will work for you as well. Preparing to produce a high quality guest post that is worthy of approval is not only about working hard. It is about working smart. You need to know the right techniques to create valuable content. Your guest posts will be judged, assessed and evaluated on the basis of certain criteria. It is up to you to make sure that you fulfill the criteria every single time. The following tips can help you achieve that. It is not about the words you insert into your writing, it is the attitude that your writing exudes which counts. When submitting a guest post, do not just think about getting backlinks back to your website. People at   sites can see right through your words. Personally, I feel that writing for the sake of generating backlinks drastically lowers the quality of your work. It simply does not have the same level of insight and ingenuity that you find in the words of someone whose writing stems from knowledge and motivation. Your attitude defines your writing. If you are struggling to find a motive, just imagine all the possibilities of being a successful guest blogger. It helps you grow your following. It helps you connect with an  . It serves as a learning experience and it is a way to establish your name in the   community. If that does not inspire the right attitude in you, I do not know what will. As mentioned before, most blogs want you to fulfill certain criteria in order to have your guest post approved. This can only be done if you follow the guidelines that they provide you with. The first thing that I do when I am planning to guest post on any blog is thoroughly go through their list of guidelines. Even if I am familiar with majority of the guidelines, I find it always necessary to read from the top to the bottom without leaving out any details. This thorough reading of the guidelines allows me to understand exactly what is required of me as a guest blogger. You need to do the same when you trying to submit your work. Go through each and every single one of their guidelines, and try to follow it to the best of your ability. There are four things that you should particularly focus on. If you want your work to be accepted, you need to first have a clear idea of the kind of writing that they promote. Look through their blogs and try to identify certain common characteristics in all of them. For example, by reading a few blogs on destination blog, I can immediately give you an estimate of the number of words that they ideally want in every blog. From my experience, I can guarantee you that thorough research work, regardless of how painstaking it maybe, always pays dividends in the end. Being adamant on covering one topic is something that a lot of novice bloggers are guilty of. Back in my early days of blogging, I would always create a blog post around the first thing that popped up in my head. Even though relying on intuition works sometimes, I would not recommend you to stick to one idea. Instead, take your time and brainstorm different ideas. Once you have 4-5 topics revolving in your head, write them down and create a set. This will help you to handpick the best possible idea for your blog post. If you are unsure of which idea to incorporate into your guest post, you can take your concerns and queries to the social media. I can tell you that people in social media are never hesitant to voice their opinions.   prefers guest posts that are built around a strong idea. So make sure that the topic you select sounds powerful and has the potential to appeal to the masses. When crafting your blog post, do not simply throw random buzzwords together. Instead, plan out your writing from beforehand and make sure that it is structured perfectly. When I am critiquing any piece of writing, the first thing that I look for is proper structure. Errors in grammar or facts do not bother me as much as a disfigured, messy piece of writing. The destination blogs want guest posts that attract the attention of their readers quickly. Poorly structured and over-elaborate pieces of writing will not do you any favours. Having your guest post accepted is a steep challenge. But, if you keep your mind focused on the basics and pull off the right attitude, I assure you that you will soon become their favorite guest blogger. Here are some of the guest articles that I’ve landed on popular blogs.    was featured as a guest blogger on one of the most popular SEO Blog on February 18, 2015. The featured guest article was “ “.

Eddie Hi  Eddie. Great read. I am definitely looking for guest blog opportunities with blogs with higher DA than mine. How much of a difference did your guest posts make in raising your Domain authority. I am open to any suggestions you may have that will help me access guest opportunities. DA does have an impact however its much slower but it does have an impact. Its more about creating awareness more people get to know who you are and what you do when you guest blog. That was my biggest takeaway from guest blogging. You can even read this post I wrote early this year on the benefits I’ve received. Let me know what you think and if its worth the effort.",Eddie
2015-12-18,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/marketing-email-components/,The Essential Components Every Marketing Email Should Have,"There is so much one can do with email marketing. Everything from making a sale to building rapport with potential customers. Email marketing hasn’t changed much from the day it because popular. I’m not sure when, but I’m glad that someone thought of the idea. We have to admit it is brilliant and pretty much makes millions of dollars for businesses world wide. I will be honest with you and say that I’ve not done much in the email marketing space. This is going to change big time as 2016 is around the corner. I’ve some good plans for this blog in terms of email marketing and providing high value to my readers. Its that time of the year that we all need to get start planning as to what we are going to do with our blogs. Its important to have a clear strategy and focus on delivering high quality material to our readers and at the same time making some good cash.  means the world to me and I will be making my plans over the next week and will be sharing my ideas and thought through a post as well for all my readers. This is something that I plan on doing each year so that my readers know whats in store. Getting back to email marketing, today I would like to talk to you about some of the essential components of every marketing email or for that matter any email that a business sends out to its customers or from a blogger to a reader. By covering these aspects you can say that you have taken a good first step in the right direction to email marketing. Now lets get into some details. This is the section of content that you add at the very beginning of any email. Its usually a very small message that you would like to convey to your readers. I usually add a coupon code that my readers can use if at any point they need to. You can share something more insightful or something that the reader will always find use with. It can be a link to your tools and resources or anything of such sorts. This does not have to be elaborate, but I strongly urge you to take some time to plan this section well and write something that is strong and compelling as this is the first thing that your readers will notice as its right about the header section. Pre-headers, many bloggers avoid this because they use “white emails” otherwise known as text based emails against the HTML emails. Email marketing software that are available today are able to optimize emails such that they will go out in the right format no matter what choice you make. Which is a big advantage for us bloggers and marketers. Header is nothing but the place where you add your logo or the banner for your website. Just like a website has headers, so do email messages. By text emails do not use headers, HTML emails use headers extensively and get creative when the seasons are right. Headers can be used to get the attention of the readers quickly as we know that visuals always gets the readers attention. Sometimes bloggers and   even embed coupon codes in the headers so that they get maximum attention. While I don’t think headers are that very important I’ve heard and read a lot about marketers making good use of this space. I would like you as bloggers and marketers share your expert opinion on this section. What has worked for you? Do you think headers are a big deal? Or can we do without them. This is important because your reader is going to read the subject line of the email even before they open the email. This is something that is going to make them decide weather or not they should read the email. Its important to write a catchy and yet a luring email subject that triggers the customer or reader to want to open your email message. Today’s email marketing software come with built in A/B testing tools that allow you to test out various  . But that does not mean you can ignore it. You still need to write the subject lines that draws the readers into your emails. A/B testing does give you a good perspective on what works best allowing you to write similar emails and get the most out of your email campaigns. Do not ignore this section as it can make or break your email marketing campaign. A good tip to writing effective subject lines is to include action words like “join us,” “download,” “get your free,” etc. I know that a lot of bloggers just collect emails, its not a bad thing. But you know what they say, its always special when you can add some personal touch to anything you do. Personalisation is a big part of your emails and by collecting both the name and email you can do some level of personalisation. The reader would be delighted to see the email address to him or her rather than some general email that is addressed to a large crowd. Like the other points today’s email marketing software comes with tag inserts that we can insert all through the email where the name would popup if required. Personalisation can give you that extra push when needed to convert that ever needed sale. Give it a try, you won’t regret it. This section of your marketing email is the most important. After the reader has been hooked on with the subject line, they take a look at the pre-header and header to get a feel of and confirm whom the email is really from. Once they are done that they soon start reading your email. Its important that you write high quality marketing emails. Don’t just sell all the time, try to keep your emails simple and easy to read and understand. This simple strategy will help your readers to easily follow through your message and understand it. And before you know it you have begun the nurturing process and the reader is hooked on to your emails. While there is a lot of dilemma around the use of images within marketing emails. I’m trorn between to use them or not. I’ve never really used an image in my marketing emails except for the header. I think the best assumption to go by is to use image only when its necessary. An image can speak a thousand words and is good to get your readers attention. Even if you choose to use images in your emails I would request you to keep it to a minimum and get your readers to click  through to your blog or website where they can read more about the subject. You can alternatively direct your readers to   that sell something or give something valuable like a private video teaching the reader something new they might not know. This is something that you add to the end of your email or somewhere around the middle of your marketing emails. This will get the reader to take action while reading the email or once they have read the email in full. It can be anything from signing up to a new course, purchasing a product or simply clicking on a URL to visit an old blog post. Call to actions need to strong yet simple and it can be a button or even a simple link in your email. The point is all about ACTION. If you can get your readers to take action then you have achieved something that you wanted. This is a must in any marketing email as its what we all work for in the end, for a customer to   or learn something we are teaching. Social sharing is something I  call the value add or the extra push that we bloggers and marketers demand from our subscribers. We want them to share our emails on the social web so as to get more readers to subscribe to our emails and help grow our list. Even though the stats on this is not very high from time to time readers do share emails if they are of high value and has offers attached to them. This is something that will definitely help you   rapidly. This is almost mandatory to have in any marketing email. The main reasons we add an Unsubscribe link in the email is so as to give the user to the option to opt out when required. Also it helps readers from marking our emails as SPAM. It makes sense to unsubscribe than to mark someone as spam, especially if you do not want to read their emails. Almost all email autoresponders and email marketing template come with the URL, if your’s does not have one please make sure its present. This can save you a lot of hassle and trouble in the long run. Make email marketing fun for everyone. In 2015-16 its important that your emails are tailored to fit almost any device that is available in the market. Meaning, you should have your emails responsive and ready to adapt to a tablet, or a mobile or even a widescreen TV screen. The reader should be able to view your email on any device he or she deems fit. As all of the above points this one also comes standard with most email marketing software. If your does not have one its time you switched to something like   or  . Creating marketing emails and having them reach your readers and convert them into customers is a big deal. In the first step to achieving that goal, these points will help you create the perfect email. What do you differently? Share your thoughts in the comments below. Thanks for the tips Eddie. I’m updating my newsletter template so this will be a great guide for me to make sure I have all the right components. Have a great day and weekend. Cori Hi Cori, Thats nice to hear. I too have some big plans for the email marketing section of my business starting in the new year. Still evaluating some of the email marketing programs. Let me know if you need any help of have some questions. I’d be happy to help out. Cheers,

2015-12-20,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/segment-email-list/,How To Segment Email List When All You Collect Is An Email Address,"; A well segmented list. You should have heard that phrase a million times if you are already in the   or internet marketing industry. The statement stands true and there is a ton of money to be made via   and every email campaign needs not just a list but a well segmented list. Most of the articles you find on the web will tell you to segment your list based on gender, age and so on. How can you segment a list when you do not collect those information. These posts are almost always written with a business in mind who will collect a lot more information about the subscriber. This will allow the company to do a varied set of segmentation on their lists before they begin  . Hubpost has a 10-12 field option form, social triggers has a email only option form and I have a name and email optin form. I am writing this article on list segmentation so as to help bloggers and internet marketers who collect minimal information. That is just the name and email and in some cases just the email address. This post will help you better segment your list and increase open rates, conversions and better click throughs. I recently read an article on MailChimp that stated   compared to non-segmented sends. When MailChimp measured stats “across all segmented campaigns,” segmented campaigns performed markedly better than their non-segmented counterparts. We will touch a little bit on the basics for those beginners and then move into the various techniques you can apply to segment your list. Segmentation is the process of segmenting or partitioning your leads generated and targeting them individually. list segmentation is creating manageable lists, or segments, from your larger list. Most companies segment lists based on Age, Gender, Interest and so on. For example. You have 1000 subscribers on your list, by sectioning them by gender, you can target 300 women with products related to them and the remaining 700 with products related to men. This helps improve open rates, conversion rates and even reduce unsubscribe rates. Segment email lists and you will immediately start seeing results. The process of email segmentation will help you keep your lists more organised, targeted and optimized. The segmentation process all depends on you and the data you collect from your readers. Not all   comes with tracking the type of user so as to allow you to segment. In order to do this you need to apply some simple strategies so that you can segment them later. I will talk about the techniques you can follow in the following sections of this post. For example. If you were a blogger who’s niche was shoes. You are collecting emails addresses as part of your effort to sell shows to those who subscribe. There is a good chance that you will have a lot of disinterest subscribers who will leave because you might be selling shoes for Guys to all the ladies on your list and vice versa. This is a bad for business and you will be sending money out the door. To avoid this you will segment your list and target the right audience. If you are a company you can do email segmentation at any point in your   process. That is because they have the flexibility and the funds to change things around quickly. But as bloggers it makes things very difficult for us as we are not always equipped with the best tools and loads of cash. For this purpose its best that we begin segmenting our list from the very beginning. This does not mean that you cannot segment your list mid way through. You just need to start working out new segmentation models the emails that you have already collection might not fall under the segmentation process but future emails can be segmented with the right strategy implementation. Lets take look at that in the next part of this post. I made the mistake of not segmenting my emails and when I really wanted to segment my emails I realised that I do not collect a whole lot of information using my forms. This made it difficult for me to segment my emails. Thinking about it almost all bloggers and marketers just collect an email address or name and emails. This is does not give us enough room to segment our list based on Geo, Age, Gender. With that said I was able to come up with a simple growth hack or a workaround that will help you segment. You can either collect more information from your subscribers or simply segment them by interest. If you want to collect more information you know what you need to collect. Name, Age, Gender, Company Name, Geo and email. This should give you enough room to segment your list very well. But if you are like me and don’t want to hassle your readers into providing so much information then you can follow my strategy. Or at least the one I’m about to implement in 2016. Segment your list based on Interest. You might be wondering how on earth am I going to know what their interests are. I just collect emails and there is nothing that says about their interest. Here is the solution: Set up different optin forms tied to different lists within your email marketing software. For example. I set up a subscribe to blog updates form on the home page and that is tied to a list where I send out automated emails every time a blog post is published. Then I have a pop up sign up option that collects emails of those interested in my eBooks and this tells me based on the type of eBook what the readers interest is. I have sign ups like this on various sections of my site targeting a varied set of audience each tied to a different list. This will  give me a good understanding of what my target audience interests are and when it comes to selling affiliated products I know what products need to be promoted to what audience or list. This processed will reduce my unsubscribe rates and keep more engaging readers on my list. Do you have a segmentation process for your  ? Let me know in the comments. Eddie, a great topic and I congratulate you on writing about it. Email segmentation is important and I realised it very early in my blogging journey. I went for “interest” split and just used one form to collect the right interest of my reader. I am not link dumping here but just for you and your reader’s information, have a look at my email sign up form at    and you will see that extra field is asked in the sign up form. The result is that I have a segmented list with people in all three main areas of my website. Your idea is great too. Having more than one form to collect different interests. It sounds interesting but the question is that what is interest “A” person meets your interest “B” form ? Does he/she not miss the opportunity because they never met the correct form? Thoughts welcome but all in all, an important topic and well written. That is a good way to segment your list indeed and that would solve the problem of many bloggers. But these days if you notice bloggers just collect emails. They don’t even want a name for personalization. But if  we bloggers really want to segment our lists we better come up with creative methods.",Eddie

I read my daily news and feeds from Flipboard and given the number of users on the platform if enough people subscribe to my magazine on   ( ) it can drive a great deal of traffic not just to my blog but the various blogs I have syndicated within the mag. Flipboard acts like a content  syndicating or aggregating tool that allows you to read various articles from various platforms. I have some top blogs added to the group and have decided to give it a 3 month run to see if it can really drive traffic to bloggers. So if you run a blog that focuses on marketing, blogging, SEO,   or social media send me a link and I will start adding content. To make it simpler if you have a Flipboard account leave your username in the comments section and I will add you as a contributor to the mag. I was really excited about using Flipboard and marketing using the platform which inspired me to write this article on promoting your blog on various locations. There are lots of  . Write high quality articles that   and learn how to promote your blog using different strategies. There are so many blogs that I follow and read through on a regular basis and some of them do not get any social shares and may be not even much traffic. But that does not mean that its a bad blog. Its just that the blogger is not taking the effort to market and promote his or her blog to increase reach and visibility. You don’t have to promote your blog 34 ways or 100 ways, there is no fixed number to the ways in which you can promote your blog. But if you take some time off your blog and do some marketing then you can not only grow your blog following rapidly but also  . The list of suggestions here are simple there to guide you to choose what best works for you. Blog promotion is essential to its success. You can write awesome pillar articles and have no one read it except your mom and grandma may be if you do not promote your blog. There are various pre-requisites to making a   but learning how to promote a blog is key to its existance. You should promote your blog once you have enough content on your blog, that is if someone visits your blog they should have enough posts to go through your blog and dig deeper and gain value from it. Once you hit 50 posts on your blog is a good time to start promoting your blog extensively. Once you reach the 50 post mark every time moving forward you should promote each article that is published henceforth. This will make sure that not only your older articles get traction but also the new ones get the attention they deserve. There are free and paid promotions and there are viral promotions. While many claim they can increase the vitality of a post, I do not believe that its that easy to get a post to go viral online. With that said, there are various social media and online marketing companies that can offer you the services if you are interesting. All you need to do is google viral marketing agencies and you will find a good number of them. As for free promotions I’ve made a very simple list of ways you can promote your blog online, these are more than enough to get your articles the attention they deserve and even may be get you on the first page of Google. As for paid marketing, you can start with Google Adsense and move on to Facebook Advertisement, Twitter Advertisement, Reddit Advertisement and StumbleUpon Advertisement. I bet there are even more way to advertise like banner ads and so on. Its only a matter of funding and the opportunities to promote your blog can be endless. Some really good tips and some I had never even considered before. The translation is a good idea – what language would your recommend?! I had one article shared on Flipboard earlier in the year and it brought a lot of traffic. Always trying to promote but it can be time consuming – more time spent than the actual writing! Hi Nicola, Thanks for stopping by and leaving a comment and your kind words of appreciation. You don’t have translate to a specific language, there are these simple and easy to install WordPress plugins (if you are on WordPress that is) that will allow the reader to translate to any language they prefer. Let me know if you need additional help in finding or setting up the plugin. I’d be happy to help out. Cheers and Merry Christmas to you and your Family. 
Eddie You too Eddie. Read lots of your posts yesterday, discovered through viral content buzz  Thats awesome. You can also subscribe to my blog so that you can get updates when I publish. Hi Eddie, Interesting advice about Flipboard, I should give it a try. It is true that blogging can be dauting. you have to create great content and at the same time, you have to promote it, and be good at both… I recently found a great service that helmps with the second one, and it is working really good for me. Hi Sandra,  Thanks for stopping by and sharing your comment. Blogging is interesting if you are into it. If you consider it a job and work on writing and social media marketing it can be a long winding list of tasks.  Blogging is for those who want to add value to what already is out there.

2015-12-24,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/2015-a-year-in-review/,2015 A Year In Review,"Its was not long since I started this blog; almost a year since I started   and the journey has been amazing so far. To be exact it was on the 29th of December 2014, a beautiful day for a very many great things took place on this day. There are a lot of things that have changed since I launched my blog, Themes, Content Style, Traffic and growth and the most important Revenue. Blogging feels like a job if you don’t make money, it becomes monotonous and tiring. But when you start seeing revenue things are awesome. I did not make a great deal. I had set my goal to make $1000 monthly from blogging. I mentioned this in my 2015  . I made just 10% of my set goals, that is just $100 per month. Even though its not much I’m happy to say that my blog made money. Based on the year’s performance I will be making some major changes to my 2016   which I will share with you in another blog post as the new year unfolds. In spite of being a brand new blog, Broke Bloke Blogs (Eddie) was interviewed several times during the year and was considered to be one of the twitter account to follow for 2015. I had a great time doing these interview and hope that the readers got some benefit out of my suggestions and recommendations. While many guest blog to build   I guest blog to get the attention that the host blog offers. As a brand new blog, it was important that I guest blogged so that various people in the industry get to know who I am and what I offer as a digital marketer. Here are some of the top sites I submitted my articles. Just because I got some big sites to host my blog it does not mean that I was not rejected. Time and again bloggers did not want to post my articles for various reasons. I am glad that the blogs that accepted my articles worked out for the benefit of both the host and broke bloke blogs. My advice to   is to keep going at it and you will get the most out of it. I’ve been switching between themes and various plugins and finally I’ve settled down with   (aff link) for now and I hope that it adds value to the blog and also my readers. I’ve tried and some of my other sites are still powered by thrive themes, wpzoom theme and various other ones. My suggestions is that use a blog framework that is best for you and your blog. If you are not satisfied then your blog is going to suffer. Make sure you do what works for the both of you. As I sit to write another posting planning my new year I would love to hear what you have to say. Share your ideas and plans what do you think I should aim for? Hey Eddie, What a year, huh? Very impressive. I remember the first time I visited BBB, in April, I really thought the blog was much older than a few months. hehe I recently started a blog, Blogging Aid, which I plan on being my #1. And I hope to grow it to around 5K subs by next Dec. 😀 Can I get some advice? Thanks, 
Julian Hey Julian, Thanks for your kind words and thanks for stopping by again to leave a comment. I’m glad that you started blogging, you are opening up endless possibilities for growth and self improvement my friend. There is so much you can do to grow your list. I visited your blog earlier today and noticed that you do not have much content yet. Its important that you have real valuable content because that will make people to want to sign up to your articles as they can learn from it or even solve their day to day problems. The next thing would be to use lead magnets where you can give something away for free that would make the reader want to sign up. Keep at it and you will grow your blog and reach your goals. Wish you all the best. Cheers, 
Eddie Yes, I do need more content. A lot more. I just published my 3rd post before Christmas. I’m currently working on a lead magnet. But I can’t think of what to call it. Can you give me some ideas? It’s a blog checklist, where I list the qualities/elements of a great blog. It’s to show struggling bloggers what they need to work on. For instance, I have a section where it’s all about the blog design. And it looks something like this: – Attractive logo 
– Clean and clear navigation bar 
– Responsive theme 
– Matching color combination 
(etc) I’d really love to hear what you’d call this kind of checklist. Hope to hear from you soon, 
Julian Something like Popular Blog Checklist or Build A Successful Blog Checklist. Call it what it is that way your readers are not taken off guard when they download a copy to find something that is not what you called it. It is always good to be clear as possible.",Eddie
2015-12-05,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/content-upgrades/,The Beginners Guide To Content Upgrades,"If you are involved in  , it is imperative that you stay in touch with the latest developments and modern trends in the field. Taking any old fashioned approach to email marketing can literally cost you money. To optimise your email marketing endeavours from today onwards, you need to turn your attention to the use of content upgrades. If you have never heard about a content upgrade before, then there is no reason to panic or be flustered. Yes, you are lagging behind other  , but you can still catch up if you understand the basic concepts of content upgrade quickly. The idea of a content upgrade is quite simple. It can be defined as bonus content that people are rewarded with in exchange of their email addresses. Content upgrades should not be confused with the conventional “site-wide” lead magnets. A content upgrade focuses on the particular content that is being read or heard by the visitors on your website. In other words, the bonus content that you are handing out should be relevant to the content which people are interested in already. There is no denying the fact that site-wide lead magnets work to a certain extent. In fact, a lot of website owners or web designers have attained a tremendous response from their visitors courtesy of site-wide lead magnets. However, if you analyze the situation in greater depth, you will realize that site-wide lead magnets do not always cater to the specific needs of the  . In most cases, there is no relevance to the content that people are already invested in. This leads to people being reluctant to download what you have on offer for them. A more effective strategy therefore is to use small, bite-sized and unique lead magnets that have a direct relation with popular content. When you think about it, this is email marketing in its purest form. As an email marketer, the one thing that piques your interest the most is the email addresses of prospective clients. Getting people’s email address is certainly no easy task these days. You need to offer something of value to entice them to give away their email addresses. A content upgrade is that object of value that will prompt people to share their email addresses with you. When you incorporate content upgrades in your strategy, your email opt-ins are likely to increase drastically. Some of the biggest digital marketers in the world today, such as Amy Porterfield, are using content upgrades in almost every single one of their posts. If it is efficacious enough to catch their attention, it should by all means work for you. Upgraded content may sound like a lot of hard work and long hours, but it can be really easy if you have your sights clear. If you are struggling to find ideas for content upgrades, maybe the following list can be of great help to you. Everybody loves tools and resources. These make work much easier and save precious hours in the day. If you create a PDF file that contains a well compiled list of the best tools and resources that your visitors can use, then they will really appreciate your bonus content. Needless to say, the tools and resources have to be relevant to their areas of interest. For example, if your website hosts content related to SEO, then the content upgrade should be a list of easily accessible digital marketing tools and resources. The podcast business is booming. The demand for podcasts is huge. With more and more people developing a taste for this form of audio content, it would be a wise move for email marketers to step up their game and come up with easy to read transcripts for podcasts. People are always interested to take extracts from podcasts and share it on social media. A transcript allows them to do just that. Then there are those who need transcripts to better understand the audio content. Packaging well written transcripts as bonus content in exchange for email addresses can prove to be immensely successful. When it comes to content that conveys instructions to people on how to open, start or operate a newly bought product, a quick start video guide as bonus content makes all the sense in the world. Often times, people feel hesitant to go through pages of instructions on a manual or a pamphlet to understand how a product really works. This is where your quick start video guide can off great value. Very few people would be reluctant to subscribe to your email list in exchange of a handy video guide. The ideas for content upgrades can only be limited by your imagination. As long as it is relevant to popular content and has the ability to spark interest, it should pay off. In order to make sure that your content upgrades produce the best results, you can adhere to the following four rules. Do not unnecessarily stretch out your bonus content. Creating colossal content will not win you any fans. The shorter the content is, the easier it will be for people to read or hear them. Remember, quality comes before quantity. The design of the content does not have to be your first priority, but you must not ignore it completely either. A well designed content can go a long way in earning the appreciation of your targeted audience. If you are not good with designing, don’t risk it. Find a designer who can create a wonderful template for you at a good price. This is the age of social media. Hence, you need to let your email subscribers share your high quality content upgrade with the world. By doing this, you are letting them do the marketing for you. Once people have downloaded your content upgraded, then should be well informed about what they ought to do next. To eliminate all confusions, simply add in a call to action.",Eddie
2015-12-09,http://brokeblokeblogs.com/blog-on-vacation/,How To Keep The Blog Active While On Vacation,"Should you keep your blog active while on vacation? Its the question on everyone’s mind these days. Bloggers tend to wonder if they should be actively   all the time even when they are on vacation or travel. Some of us have taken up blogging because of its nature. It offers us free time and the liberty to work at our convenience, but are we pushing it too far to work even while we are not working. The answer entirely depends on who is blogging and what their intentions are. I personally feel that depending on the topic or focus at the moment of travel you can choose to blog or not to blog. I certainly will not want to leave my readers hanging in the middle of an interesting topic. All this has come up simply because recently I had to travel to the US, Plano, TX to be exact. It was an amazing 16 hour long flight with a switch over at Dubai. I will leave it at than and not get into the details of the flight. I had some good company of my friends who also travelled along with me and you can find them in the photos below.     Blogging has been my passion for the last 8-9 years. I’ve made money from it, i’ve lost money to it and yet I get back to blogging each day. It gives me peace of mind and lets me be who I really am. A passionate marketer, lover of all things tech and a young man who loves to share his knowledge so that others can learn from it. These points I’ve put together from a list of things that I should have done while I was on vacation. I was too excited to think about anything else as this was my first international travel and that to the USA. Come on, anyone would get carried away at that. Anyway, I did not plan ahead and might have even lost out on potential revenue opportunties. Allow for guest posting on your blog while your on vacation, this way you do not have worry about creating regular content. This is not something for everyone. For example. I do not allow for guest articles on my blog and do not plan on introducing guest publications in the future as well. My blog is my opinion and I would like to keep it that way. My knowledge shared the way I best can. But there are several of you bloggers who love and nurture guest blogging, for those of you this is an excellent strategy to adopt. This will help you keep your blog active and engaged. Planning well ahead of your vacation is cruitial to your blog. I made the mistake of neglecting my blog and focusing only on my travel. Plan what you want from your blog and what you want for your readers. This will help you ensure that you take action when its needed and on time. My recommendation to you as you can see from the way I titled this post is to keep your blog active while your on vacation. Plan at least one month in advance so that you can implement various strategies and have them running before you set off on your vacation. Asking someone from your network who has a little time on hand to take over your blog while on vacation is a good thing. The only problem is that its hard to find bloggers who are that supportive or have free time on hand. Request a blogger in your network that you trust and can rely on, send out a request note at least one month in advance. I say one month almost all through this post as that would give enough time for anyone to plan or schedule appointments to fit in your requirements. I cant say this strategy will work, but I can say that its worth the try and might just get you a totally new set of readers while your out having fun. This strategy is going to need a little more than a month to plan, at least for myself. Writing posts and saving them as drafts is a good idea. This strategy is not just so you can blog while on vacation, but during times when you are not available, or ill or just have to get some time off from your busy blogging schedule. Every time I am able to write an extra post more than what has to be published for the day. Lets say I wrote two articles in a day, I only publish 1 article and keep the other as reserve for a time in need. Like I said before, this can be for times your ill, your on vacation, you need some time off, you are faced with a natural disaster and do not have access to the internet or anything that keeps you from your blog. These posts come in handy and help you save the day. You will never go without publishing a post again. These posts that you write and save up or even receive as part of the guest submissions from the holiday strategy you implemented, its time to put them to good use. The first thing you do is to sort the posts out so that they have some sort of a flow. Once you have done that, split out the days and their intervals evenly and begin scheduling them. This will make it look like you are actively blogging while your on vacation. While you might have already told your regular readers that you are on vacation your new readers will believe that you are active. This will only leave you with comments and engagements to deal with taking up just an hour or two of the day. Its always a good thing to be honest about your actions. Letting your readers and followers that you won’t be available for a while is not a bad thing. Its a good thing to let your readers about your vacation and that you will be taking care of stuff. You can also share the strategies that you are implementing as part of a post so that even they can learn from you. Just like I’m writing this post, you can do so too. The only difference is that I’m doing this after my vacation because I did not plan right and you will be learning from my mistakes and you can do it before you travel. This works wonders I remember doing this for one of my old blogs where I posted a giveaway that ran for two weeks. And all through that time all I did was promote, promote and some more promotion. When I got back from vacation I announced the winner and gave away the prize. Its important that you have something good enough to giveaway so that more and more readers join the giveaway or the contest and keep your site traffic up and active. After all we do not want to lose traffic and earnings during our vacation. If you can spare time on your vacation you can always write from where ever you are travelling provided you have access to the internet and other things that are required for you to blog. Blogging can be fun while on vacation, but then again remember you are taking a vacation so that you can get some time off.

Where once it was all about trying to promote the heck out of every single product or service you came across, that tactic has actually proven to be quite useless over the years for many folks. Long gone are the days where you just had to paste a ton of affiliate ads, banners, third party ads and other trash on your blog. I think if anyone is serious about making money online in 2016 they need to look at blogging as a business rather than just a website they build in hope that it will churn out money. These days people want more value, they don’t just want to be sold any old garbage. So with that said I think affiliate marketing still tops the list for blog monetisation in 2016, but doing affiliate marketing in a way that it educates people rather than just sells to them. I guess that’s where having a   strategy in place really matters. A very close second place would go to actually providing a service through your blog. The great thing about blogging and doing online marketing is that you learn a lot, and over time and with enough practice, you almost become an expert at doing certain things. This is a great opportunity I think for anyone to offer something they’ve developed as a skill as a service to others. For me gaining the skills and experience I’ve gained in designing websites and graphic design work has led me to offering this as a service on my blog.  is a full time trucker – part time blogger and imaginary entrepreneur. He is the only known trucker who is blogging about creating passive income online. $1,633 There are lots of ways to make money with a blog. Believe me – I’ve tried just about all of them! For 2016 and going forward – I’m mostly sticking with one tried and true method – affiliate marketing with total honesty and transparency! First – you need an audience (readers) in order to make money. Here’s what I am doing. In short, I plan to continue growing my blog audience by SEO (targeting low competition keywords) and through outreach. I also like to build a long-term relationship with my audience by building and growing my email list. Making money with affiliate marketing – this part isn’t that hard if you use the honest and transparent approach. I simply promote products that I actually use and love. For the internet marketing space that I blog in – this involves showing exactly how I use certain related products and how they produce results for me. In a sense, I “”un-box”” the products and show my readers and subscribers exactly what to expect if they buy that product (or service) too and I show them exactly how to use it. I then offer my affiliate link and make it clear to them that it is in fact an affiliate link and I will receive a small commission if they purchase through that link. Readers really appreciate up-front honesty and transparency. Most understand that many of us bloggers are trying to make extra money on the side with our blogs – so they are usually happy to support by purchasing through affiliate links.

It could be creating a course on teaching people new skills or one that encourages a hobby. Whatever your choice of making money with your blog, have a solid business plan, determine your monetization methods and frame workflows that will determine how you accomplish your objectives every month. , I set up my website in 2006 and started blogging. I immediately started to get graphic design work for clients from the site and in 2008 I stopped work so I could devote all my time to the business. Since then I have become an Amazon best selling author and a successful Udemy instructor. I provide web and graphic design services for clients as well as sell ebooks and video courses from my site. $8000 I still see Udemy as an amazing opportunity that everyone is missing. You are already creating content through a blog and therefore building an audience and an email list. Your “content creation muscle” will be well developed so you can create a course on Udemy which you can then sell to your audience. Udemy will also provide you with sales and a new audience as well who will then search you out, find your blog and swell your email list still further. This brings us to the end of the expert round up. I hope you enjoyed reading and learning from these exerts who all make money from their blogs and web businesses. How do you plan on implementing these monetization strategies into your blog and web businesses? Do you have a plan in place? Share your thoughts and opinion on this round up.

Harsh Chaklasiya Hey family! Good post, my friend. Honestly, I couldn’t agree more with Harsh Agrawal, especially on the fact… that it’s time for young bloggers to start creating and launching their own products. One main common factor between the top successful mediapreneurs is that they focus on creating, promoting and selling their own online courses, and programs. There is a good reason why they focus on that monetization strategy out of thousands of other options (hint hint!). Hey Ricky, Thanks for being part of this interview and your comment. I’m glad that you liked this post, its a completely new approach for me to create such a post. Its getting some traction and hope it continues to drive more traffic.  Also, I’m glad that you are liking some of the recommendations from other bloggers in the list. Don’t be a stranger. Cheers,
