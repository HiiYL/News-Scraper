McMuffin crumbs. Syrupy pancake remnants. A thimble full of coffee. Nothing was off limits for this sneaky San Jose scavenger. During my recent trip to Costa Rica my wife Kelli and I chilled in the capital of San Jose for a day (we knew the way). We enjoyed breakfast at 1 of the 14 million McDonald‚Äôs fast food joints in the city. I was simultaneously stunned and entertained by the pillager of home fries. How could a guy be so bold? Clearly he wasn‚Äôt a desperate street guy. Clean-cut, dressed well (compared to me he was dressed to the nines) and even the way he picked through spare McD‚Äôs fare suggested he could afford to be‚Ä¶..picky. This bold buzzard taught me ‚Äì and you ‚Äì 3 blogging lessons that day.  lessons. Not creating a lead in for a politically motivated tip here. No, this is not an advertisement for the Democratic National Committee. I‚Äôm talking ‚Äôbout: Do Not Care. The guy did not care what people thought of his sneaky scavenging of scrumptious single cheese burgers. Local Ticos (Costa Ricans) didn‚Äôt bat an eye lash. I carefully observed his persistent predation of fries, McNuggets and McRibs with a fascinated air. Blogging buddies, if you wish to ascend to the Blogging Big Dawg level of this game (whether you‚Äôre a  or seasoned vet), the upper echelon, the creme de la creme, gradually release your fear of criticism. Speak your mind. Write in YOUR voice. No watering down. No filtering. Your fans will love what you have to say. And your fan base will grow. Folks who disagree may or may not share their lack of clarity and belief in self through comments. But any disagreement or criticism says everything about the critics and nothing about you. He wolfed down a half-finished Sundae. After that, our San Jose purveyor of all things Golden Arches nibbled on a house salad. Didn‚Äôt anybody tell him Ticos don‚Äôt do salad at desayuno? Either way, the dude gobbled up opportunities to feast just like pro bloggers feast on opportunities to build connections. I gotta admit; I pondered writing this guest post for a few weeks. I mean, Ileane runs a first class, well read blog. She has built an astoundingly loyal community. But I‚Äôm a busy bee too. Hundreds of blogs for posting and only 24 hours a day. I publish 4 posts weekly on my blog. Blogging from Paradise Dot Com. If you‚Äôre keeping score at home. I publish 1 guest post weekly to   because Zac Johnson rocks. I publish 1 guest post weekly to  ¬†because it‚Äôs a top shelf personal development blog. And because the blog owner cooks my meals. And because she happened to marry me. I also travel the world persistently, changing time zones like most folks change pants and spending more time in the tropics than dengue fever. But I felt it‚Äôd be fun to share my thoughts on blogging here, for both me and Ileane‚Äôs awesome audience. So here we are. I am an Opportunity Pacman. Once again. The blogging world is your open mic guys. Be heard. . Comment on popular blogs. Share your blogging buddies‚Äô content. Make friends with high rolling bloggers. I‚Äôve been blessed to be featured on sites like Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin blog, Forbes and Neil Patel Dot Com and I spoke at NYU because I have fun being an Opportunity Pacman. No doubt, some of my more negative-feeling gringo buds looked at the   and shook their heads in pity. They chose to see a homeless guy desperate to fill his tummy. I saw a well-dressed, clean cut, discerning (yes I‚Äôm being serious; he once passed over 2 ounces of Angus Chipotle BBQ Bacon I even thought about devouring greedily) cat who simply ate what other people wasted. It‚Äôs almost alarming how many bloggers see failure versus successful opportunity. But that‚Äôs why 80% of bloggers never make more than $100 during their blogging careers. You won‚Äôt succeed by carrying a negative, confining vibe with you. Do 2 things: follow your fun and trust in the process. What can you gab about all day long? Blog about it. Then, trust in the blogging process. Meaning, as you make friends and create entertaining content for your readers you‚Äôll detach more from outcomes (blogging income, subscriber count, etc) and you‚Äôll naturally color your life with a positive paintbrush. Where others see failure, you‚Äôll see success. When others strain and strive to create mediocre content, you‚Äôll churn out entertaining, informative posts like (McD‚Äôs) hotcakes. Folks wonder how in the Hades I can write about how being stalked and attacked by 2 Thai lady boy prostitutes in Bangkok teaches me 6 distinct blogging lessons. Or how I learned 2 successful blogging lessons by being attacked ‚Äì twice ‚Äì by wild men in Kathmandu, Nepal (yes, unfortunately for my body, but fortunately for my brand, both are true stories). I frame the world in a positive light. I see growth. I see progression. I see empowered people. I appreciate the moment. Most of the time. I have fun. I trust. I surround myself with positive-feeling bloggers. I learn from bright lights. Naturally, oodles and oodles of blogging goodness flowed my way. In the form of fun, prospering, helpful ideas, influential bloggers, money, an increased presence. Ya know, all that jazz. Be positive. Be thankful. You have a sweet gig. Even if you‚Äôre not a pro blogger yet or you have no pro blogging plans you live in an exciting time. Embrace opportunities. Feel empowered. Enjoy the ride. What blogging lessons did you learn from this sharp-dressed scavenger? Hello Ryan Biddulph,                      Ryan you are always there with some fun loving facts, that make us all learn a healthy lesson 
                    for becoming a good blogger. Cheers for you buddy üôÇ                      I loved the point which you mentioned, ‚ÄúWrite in YOUR voice. No watering down. No filtering‚Äù

Ryan Hey there Ryan! What a style of writing you have, mi querido amigo! You are really living la pura vida over there in Costar Rica ‚Ä¶uh! I like how you approach life and always seem to find a lesson or something to think about (at least). I am the same way. Although, I am yet to put all of my life experiences and what I learn from them on blog posts.  You are a clear example of how story telling and entertaining writing can be mixed into the blogging world, and still be able to teach so much value. And even better yet; people are more likely to remember simple interesting stories than fact! üòâ I totally agree with your points here, too! One profound thing I have learned in life, is the fact that if you really and truly wan to become very successful you need to just Laser Focus on what you are very Passionate about. Do not care about what others might think or say (about you and what you are doing). Passion is the purest energy that comes straight from love (positive energy). Passion fuels you. Passion is your damn best coffee ‚Äì to keep on going and to stay up all night for a few nights, working on what you truly believe. If you just dedicate your life to do what you love, and what you are the most passionate about ‚Äì the rest will come into place naturally. It is amazing how life and our universe works! Follow your joy ‚Äì your highest excitement ‚Äì and have pure faith (that everything will be alright and that everything will happen for you) ‚Äì and the rest is history! üòÄ  I really enjoyed this post man! Gracias for sharing! Keep up the great work buddy! Have a fantastic week! Hi Freddy, What a comment! Passion really is the energy fueling the drive. Like a coffee, with a chaser of a pound of sugar, combined with ephedra.  I see you have a similar passion. It‚Äôd be impossible to make as amazing an impact as you do unless you were brimming with passionate, loving energy. Thanks for the awesome share. Ryan Hi Ryan..!!! 
You are my idol‚Ä¶!!! I also want to be like you dude‚Ä¶!!! Blogging from paradise is my own dream‚Ä¶!!!  One day i will surely be at that point when i can also say I am blogging from paradise..!!

And yes, don‚Äôt hesitate to nab that How to Find Your Writing Voice eBook Ileane generously dropped in the post üòâ Thanks for reading! Ryan hello Ryan , Thanks for this awesome insights. You really hit the nail at the head. especially on been. bold and fearless.   The truth is,  Fear has crippled millions of bloggers because every one is just trying to say what suits their mind.   Most times we are scared of rejection. we are scared to say the obvious and call out the elephant in the room.  You made it clear.  That the way to win is to be brutally honest with our words. To be shameless.  To call spade,  spade.  Thank you.   I‚Äôll definitely share this. Hi Charles, It pays to be super bold with our words. Fab comment! Ryan I totally agree with your 2nd point. That grabbing and playing with the right set of opportunities. these are one of the best blogging lessons I have ever come across.

Marcus, I‚Äôm glad you mentioned Pinterest because I am learning that I am not using my social sites correctly and I‚Äôve started making cool images to attach to my blog posts. Duh! They should all go on Pinterest. That is definitely on my list of adjustments to make in the near future. Also, which infographic program do you use? Hi Marcie, thank you for commenting. 
Of course images work üôÇ we are visual creatures and nice graphics appeal to a large number of people. However, not all niches profit from nice visuals. For some of the blogging niches No.1 should be accuracy and value of information (business, tech, social media, etc.) and you shouldn‚Äôt spend too much time on generating nice graphics. On the other hand, fashion, food, lifestyle and other bloggers from similar niches will enjoy nice benefits from utilizing quality images, both in traffic and social media shares.

But  Jeff Bullas created a list of infographic tools and programs you should definitely  . Hi Marcus, Content marketing is here to stay ‚Äì and the earlier we all accept the fact and clue in, the better. Personally, I‚Äôll add that, focus and preference should be given to the mediums that provide the most ROI (which may not necessarily be quantified in monetary terms).  The point is that, if an option for marketing content resonates with an audience in a fantastic manner, focus should be placed on such an option. I appreciate your attempt in publishing this. Be certain to make the day great. Always, 
Akaahan Terungwa Hi Akaahan, yes if you take a look at the infographic linked in the end of the article you‚Äôll see that content marketing is much older than the internet and internet related marketing. I don‚Äôt doubt that it will survive and adapt to any new medium we‚Äôll see in the future. Also, the other things you point out are correct, that is the general idea ‚Äì you examine the market and apply the option which brings in the most customers. Thank you for commenting, have a great day as well. Marcus Hey Marcus, The best content marketing is geared towards the interests of your specific target market and can get them to action. We have so many options when it comes to products and services. We can do research via Video, Infographic, Podcast, Slideshare, and written blogs. This is why content marketing isn‚Äôt going to go anywhere anytime soon. In our day and age it is the bloodline of information that all of us are dependent on. Especially if we aren‚Äôt sure to invest in a brand.  Thanks for sharing Marcus and I hope you have a great weekend! Hi Sherman, Glad to have you commenting and to see you agree! It was a good weekend overall üôÇ Cheers, 
Marcus Awesome article on Content Marketing. Can you recommend me some tools and plugin that will help me provide my users a good content? Thanks Hi Himanshu, My favorite tool is BuzzSumo it explores the most shared content based on the keywords you enter and the filters you apply (type of content, date, language, etc.). 
Having said that, you must know that BuzzSumo is not free, which is unfortunate as it is quite unique. 
Some other ‚Äútools‚Äù that might help you out are: 
Twitter ‚Äì because twitter :D; 
Followerwonk ‚Äì for finding and following influencers; 
Bufferapp ‚Äì it will display content popular in niches you choose, as well as enable you to schedule your posts for different social media networks. This is a great time-saving tool, I can‚Äôt imagine not having something like this üôÇ These are the ‚Äútools‚Äù I use most frequently and couldn‚Äôt imagine my day without any of them. However, there are few others you should take a look at as well, like: ahrefs content explorer, google trends and google news (aim for content freshness), Hootsuite, etc. Also, you can never go wrong with Facebook, Linkedin or Pinterest as I mentioned in the post. Keep in mind that some of the tools are free, some are freemium and some are paid for and are not cheap. Hi Marcus, Let‚Äôs put this way, no SEO success without content marketing, and if you want to drive quality targeted traffic‚Ä¶‚Ä¶you need careful planned and well-executed content marketing strategies. Even the best of content will go unnoticed if there are no eye balls looking at it and no brains reading it. This is why we need effective marketing plan to get our content in front of our ideal target audience. Thanks Marcus, nice reading.

2016-04-03,http://basicblogtips.com/killer-personal-brand.html,Follow these 4 Simple Steps for a Killer Personal Brand in 2016,"You always want to look your best‚Ä¶ especially in a world where anyone can search for anything and also find anything! The same holds true for both bloggers, businesses, brands and everyone else in between. With over a billion active sites on the internet and more than half of the world‚Äôs population now having access to the internet, it‚Äôs now more important than ever to have a great first impression online.  , brand, product or how to do something‚Ä¶ what do they do? They search for it through Google of course! What comes up in the search results is the immediate and first impression that is given.  However, Google isn‚Äôt the only thing you should be thinking about if you want to protect your reputation and look better online. Reviews, social media, search rankings, site content and status updates all play a huge part in the process. As someone who‚Äôs had a lot of experience in the world of SEO, reputation management and branding, while also having a great online reputation myself, I wanted to lay out some of the most effective ways you can  . Why 2016? Because there is no better time than right now, and if you want to stand the test of time on the internet, you need to look good in the process! A great first impression is so important and it‚Äôs also something that you can never take away. A good example of this would be if you went to a movie theatre and saw a preview for a movie. If the preview was amazing, you would definitely want to go see the movie. If it was horrible, you would likely have no interest in it. Take this same concept and apply it to the online world where most of us live for several hours per day. We can even back these statements up through the infographic stats below provided by industry-leading¬† . First impressions aren‚Äôt just through Google, they are also through your web sites (how they look), the content you write (how well it‚Äôs written), social media (what you say and do) and ultimately what Google ranks at the top of the search results for your name, brand or products as well. With all of that said, while you might think you already have a brand and following in place, just think about all of the people who are seeing your name or reading your content for the first time every day. Make sure everything you do online would represent itself as a ‚Äúgreat first impression‚Äù for anyone who might be seeing it for the first time. While there are many ways to deliver a great first impression and different ways for people to find you online, ranking at the top of Google has to be one of the most important. The reasons for this are simple: Yes, but this is all easier said than done, right? Well, kind of‚Ä¶ it really depends on what you are trying to rank for. ¬† Ranking at the top of Google for your name or brand should be relatively easy if you know what you are doing and don‚Äôt have a name that is commonly shared with thousands of other people. The best way to see all of this in action would be to Google my name ‚ÄúZac Johnson‚Äù. You will quickly notice that I   for my name. First you will see my own site at  , then a few social media profiles, followed by my content and bio profiles on other sites. If you see otherwise, it‚Äôs likely because Google has an auto-correct in place for ‚Äú ‚Äú, who is the professional golfer! (and my SEO arch-nemesis) As for what social profiles are easiest and fastest to rank for your name,¬† ¬†notes LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Weebly and WordPress seem to work best. Even if you have a site of your own, you should still create additional profiles on these sites as they are all free to use and will help with SEO rankings. If you want to further establish yourself as an expert or trusted source, you need to rank for your name and all relevant keywords. For a more in-depth guide on how to do this with a blog of your own,  . When trying to rank your site and your social profiles, be sure to interlink all of your content so they spread link juice between them.¬†Don‚Äôt just do this with your own sites, you will also want to build relevant links back to them wherever possible as well. Another great way to protect your reputation and brand online is to secure your name as a domain. Again, this goes back to how common your personal name is. (most brand names have to be original, so this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue for legit companies) When it comes to domain names, all you really need to worry about are .COM, .NET and .ORG. I wouldn‚Äôt bother with any of the other annoying domain extensions that registrars are commonly trying to push. In most cases they are junk, they usually don‚Äôt rank (as well) and they definitely won‚Äôt resell for much money either. If you are still having trouble coming up with a great name for your site, refer to this  . Follow these three steps for securing domain names and protecting your brand. The important thing to remember here is that once a domain name is gone, it‚Äôs usually gone for good. If your name as a domain is still available, register it up as soon as possible before someone else does! The final step of the process is to make sure you put everything into action so you are seen as an authority within your space. For this to be done you should already have your domain name, content that represents your brand well and maybe even already ranking at the top of the search results. If you still aren‚Äôt #1 in Google, this method will definitely help you out. While many bloggers and online marketers think it‚Äôs best to create content for ONLY their own sites, this is where they are going wrong. If you want to rank in Google and be seen by millions of people, you need to get out there on social media and on other relevant websites and blogs as well. Below you can see a few different roundups and expert collaborations I‚Äôve recently taken part in. The benefit to each of the contributions above is that whenever someone reads through this list, they will see my name, which will bring increased authority along with it.  , getting interviewed for expert roundups and contributing content to high authority sites is simply one of the best ways to establish yourself as an expert. An extra added benefit is that every time a new article like the ones above is published, it also increases linkbacks and mentions to my site as well ‚Äî thus helping it rank higher in the search results. The best time to start working on your brand and how you look online was 10 years ago. The second-best time is right now. If you seriously want to have a long-term business, brand and following on the internet, you need to work hard to stay above the competition. Having a trustworthy brand and ranking at the top of the search results for your brand is a great way to get there. If you aren‚Äôt currently monitoring your personal and brand name online, be sure to  . Follow these quick tips and make sure you implement them all the way through. I see way too many people focusing ‚Äúonly on content‚Äù and when you are competing with over a billion sites online, that simply isn‚Äôt going to get the job done. Nice Topic . But how do I get a strong competitive brand and how to make it compete with existing powers ? Hello Zac Johnson,                      Those were something really killer, which can be good for our personal brand.                      Very well said, ‚ÄúA great first impression, is something you can never take away‚Äù 
                    That is very much true. People are attracted more towards the website, if they had a first impression. 
                    Indeed not only ranked well by google helps to promote our social brands. 
                    But also the social media and site content do matter.                      This steps are very much useful for me, it would be helping to maintain the customers, 
                    attached to my site.                      Thanks for sharing this among us. 
                    Shantanu sinha It‚Äôs all about picking the right niche and audience, then building a business around their needs. I cover this in these two articles: Agree with Zac. In addition to the above, it‚Äôs also about holding out your own, sticking to your guns, and maintaining your uniqueness ( it‚Äôs there in you), and more. Personal branding is indeed the best thing you could do to yourself. I can agree more on that one. Good tips and creating useful content that‚Äôs got decent quality is key. But the tricky part is doing this consistently day in and day out. Creating a blog that‚Äôs going to be successful is much like building a house. Blog by blog your foundation gets stronger. I like the idea of getting all your social media names. But if you have a common name like mine then its easy to miss. This means you have to think ahead and plan everything. Good tips. For personal branding, my recommendation getting a domain name name with .me extension and creating profile in about.me and CrunchBase as they rank quite good on Google. .me is a good option is .com, .net and .org are all taken ‚Äî creating profiles on any of the top sites is always a great option as well. Once this is done, be sure to send a bunch of links back to them as well. Hey Zac, That‚Äôs some great tips! 
I totally agree that the first impression is vital to building a personal brand. Picking about right niche and audience that‚Äôs 100 and 10 % correct, I must say. And no wonder, hard work is the key to success. Great advice, but I wouldn‚Äôt used the word, ‚Äúkiller‚Äù related to ‚Äúpersonal brand‚Äù‚Ä¶ üòâ",Zac Johnson
2016-04-28,http://basicblogtips.com/8-mistakes-building-email-list.html,Avoid These 8 List Building Mistakes to Build A Massive List,"If you are blogging, building an email list is as basic as breathing. An email list can help you Almost everyone wants to build a huge email list of subscribers. After all, more email subscribers means more click through rates and  , right? Not everyone will be able to build a huge email list that makes money. You may never know what list building mistakes you are making while growing your email list. Here are 8 mistakes majority of the people make while building their email lists. Find out what mistakes you are making among them and avoid them to build a huge list who are hungry to buy what you offer. Are you ready to discover? Let‚Äôs get started. I still see a lot of people who are building an email list just use random words like ‚ÄúSign up to my list‚Äù, ‚ÄúJoin our newsletter‚Äù etc. If you are not   or not giving any strong reason for your website visitors, they won‚Äôt subscribe to your email list. Offer any free incentive like eBook, video, Infographics or anything that is easy to create and distribute to your readers. It can really help you in converting normal website visitors into email subscribers. On my own blog at  , I used to get around 5 to 6 subscribers a day (when I wasn‚Äôt offering any free incentive to my subscribers). But once I started giving away a free eBook on making money blogging, my email opt-in rate skyrocketed (with more than 200% email opt-in rate per day!). That‚Äôs the importance of offering incentives to your subscribers. They quickly help you boost your email list without increasing your website traffic. People follow those who have a huge following. It‚Äôs a general tendency to follow the crowd! Social proof is the currency online. If an expert is recommending you or your blog (even though if you are a beginner), your sales or email opt-in rates will skyrocket. That‚Äôs the power of social influence. Just imagine for a second, you landed on a blog, skimming through a blog post and suddenly there comes a popup which shows ‚ÄúJoin over 100,000 marketers‚Äù, would you join? I bet, you will (if you find their content interesting). The reason you‚Äôll join their list is because of the big number you see on their email list. That‚Äôs how social proof works online. So make sure to add social proof to the copy of your opt-in forms. Ask for an expert to say something about you or take testimonials about your freebies or content from your own readers and feature it. It can definitely help you boost your blog‚Äôs social proof. Most people hate popups. How do I know? Okay, let me be blunt. Even I hate them. But let me tell you one thing. Popups give you more signups than any other source! When I started using exit-intent popup (which shows a popup when a visitor just about to abandon your blog)  , my email subscription rates really went high. I still get majority of my email subscribers from that popup alone. Popups really work like a charm. Almost every top blogger uses them once in awhile. Because they know how essential they are to grow their email list or website sales. If you are not using popups on your blog yet, you better should consider using them immediately. Popups are conversion boosters, they quickly help you increase your email subscription rates no matter how much traffic your blog gets. Check this tutorial from Ms. Ileane on  Do you know your target audience? Do you know what your audience truly wants? Do you know what to do with your email list? Do you know how to monetize your blog‚Äôs traffic? Without properly understanding what your goal is with your blog, no one can help you in building a profitable blog. If you are building an email list just because everyone else building, you are making a huge mistake. If you don‚Äôt know your top priorities and things to do with your email list, you can never make any sales out of it. That‚Äôs the harsh truth. So it‚Äôs better to spend quality time in knowing your blogging goals and find out your audience needs and wants. That way you can better serve them to build a successful blog in the long run.   Highly converting landing pages often follow this rule ‚Äúone page ‚Äì one goal‚Äù. Landing pages are golden. They help you quickly increase your email opt-in rates because they focus only on one call to action i.e to increase your email signups. Don‚Äôt use any sidebars or footer section while creating landing pages. Landing pages are meant to focus only one goal. That‚Äôs how you can help your audience to easily decide whether you are worth their time or not. So start using landing pages if you want to build a huge email list that grows without increasing your blog traffic. Here‚Äôs  . I know most people are doing this mistake. They show their email opt-in forms at one or two places and they expect to grow their email list rapidly. It‚Äôs impossible to grow a huge list without increasing the exposure to your email opt-in forms. The more you use the more email subscribers you get. Here are few great places to add email opt-in forms on your blog. Sidebar is one of the most visible places on any blog. So make the most out of it by showing an email opt-in form with a freebie to boost your email list.  Derek Halpern introduced feature box to grow an email list. They quickly became popular and almost every top blogger is now using them. You can   to create a feature box on your blogs. Apps like Hellobar and SumoMe can help you show a header bar on your blog. It can‚Äôt be ignored by your website visitors. It always shows up at the top of your blog and by using an email opt-in form there can quickly boost your signup rates. Many blog themes come with the built in message bar at the top, for example,¬†  has this feature. Majority of the bloggers still use footer section on their blogs. And most blogs footer section are filled with 3 columns. Why not use an email opt-in form at least in one of such places?  account and find out the top 10 pages that send you most search traffic. Start using email opt-in forms at the beginning and ending of them to grow your email list. If a visitor is reading your blog‚Äôs content for the first time and if he makes it to the end of your blog post and finds an email opt-in form, he would gladly consider subscribing to your list for more relevant information. So don‚Äôt miss a chance to show email opt-in forms at the the end of your blog posts. No one likes to fill too many details to get into an email list. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much value you they find it! There‚Äôs no reason for you to ask for personal details, phone number or full name while building your email list. If you are starting from scratch, just ask their email address and that‚Äôs it! Let your website visitors to easily sign up for your email list without much burden. That‚Äôs how you can increase your email sign ups. When you are building an email list from scratch, you don‚Äôt want anything other than the email of your website visitors. No one really bothers about entering too many details to sign up for an email list. So make sure to keep it really simple.  Another important thing to consider while building a list is don‚Äôt use invalid credentials just to grow your email subscribers. I see few new bloggers using ‚ÄúJoin 15,000+ email subscribers‚Äù when they don‚Äôt have even 100 subscribers. How can I say that they don‚Äôt have so many subscribers? Well, there are so many website traffic checker tools out there that will help you easily estimate the traffic of any site. If a new blog is not getting even 500 visits a day, how can one build such a massive list? So don‚Äôt try to fake until you make it. It doesn‚Äôt work and gives you a bad impression on your site in the long run. About 4 years ago when I first started building my email list, I made a big mistake of not sending any emails to my subscribers. I thought my subscribers might ignore my emails or unsubscribe from my list if I send emails. I know how foolish I was. Whether you believe it or not, most beginners who are building an email list from scratch make this mistake. They don‚Äôt plan sending any emails to their subscribers. They just think about growing the email list and that‚Äôs it. They forget about the importance of email broadcasts and scheduling weekly emails. See, you don‚Äôt have to send 1 email per day. Even sending 1 email per week is enough to educate your subscribers about the products or services you promote. Just make sure you are not sending too many promotional emails or your subscribers might get irritated and simply unsubscribe from your email list. Likewise, sending too many emails (more than twice a week) to your subscribers is the surefire way to increase your unsubscription rates. Most people don‚Äôt like getting too many emails every week from the same blog. They might think you are manipulating them by sending too many promotional emails and they just unsubscribe. So be careful while creating an email autoresponder series to broadcast emails to your subscribers.  takes a lot of time and money. Everyone makes mistakes while growing their list. Just make sure to correct your list building mistakes as soon as possible to avoid wasting too much money and time. Make sure to analyze the tactics used by the   to grow their email list. That will give you a better idea on how to grow your audience without irritating them too much. So what are your thoughts about building an email list? What are the other list building mistakes you made while growing your list? Share your views in the comments. Thanks Anil, For sharing this valuable knowledge with us. Is there any free plugins to use for wordpress site to collect emails and send automated mails? Hi Harmeet, MailChimp is a free email autoresponder service which lets you send emails to your subscribers (up to 2000 sub) for free. They also have a couple of free WP plugins that can help you easily collect emails from your audience. Hi Anil! You are spot on with all of these tips for better email marketing ‚Äì except the last one (number eight). Sending emails every day and even more than once a day ‚Äì has been proven to work great, actually! Think about it, to how many Newsletters is your new Lead most likely to be subscribed to? The average new online marketer and blogger ‚Äì and just your average person looking to make money online ‚Äì is probably receiving emails from many Lists! If you send one or two emails per week, chances are most of your emails will end up at the BOTTOM of their inbox. And perhaps, by the time they get to it, they will be ready to Log Off their Inbox. So, not emailing often can actually result in very low conversions. Of course, if you have a HUGE List, you wouldn‚Äôt really notice this. But, I highly recommend you to try this ‚Äì you can be very surprised at how much you can boost up your email conversion rates by emailing more than once per day. I have actually learned this insight from the most successful people online. In particular, I have learned a lot about email marketing from one of my cool mentors; Michelangelo Lopez. He always uses the Groupon business model. LOL üòÄ  People do not really care getting many emails from you ‚Äì as long as you are sharing 80% value and only pitching 20%. This, of course, is the 80/20 rule. It is not true that ‚Äúpeople get irritated‚Äù if you send them ‚Äútoo many emails‚Äù. I totally disagree with you there, my friend. People get A LOT of emails every day, anyways. So, it is nothing new to them ‚Äì to get many emails. And actually, everyone is very used to getting a lot of emails daily. Especially people in this industry.  How many emails do you get every single day, Anil? ‚Äì And you probably have multiple emails too. If you get many emails daily, and you are very okay with it, what can make you think that people who are trying to make money online would not be okay with it? Again, do not disregard all of the OTHER Newsletters and Lists they are subscribed to.  It is not that people can ‚Äúget irritated‚Äù because you email them too often ‚Äì what they can very irritated with is being sold with every single email they get from you! It is perfectly fine to play and test ‚Äì with how frequently you are sending out emails to your list.  Also, why would you want to keep a subscriber who deep inside does not want to be in your list anymore??? When you email every day and you just lead with real value (applying the 80/20 rule) ‚Äì the ones who will Unsubscribe are the one who you WANT to Unsubscribe Anyways. This is actually a great way to WEED OUT the TIRE-KICKERS. The people who will remain in your list ‚Äì even when you send emails daily and even 3 times per day ‚Äì are the people who will definitely BUY from you.  Why keep dead weight in your Auto-responder? ‚Äì Especially, if you are brand new online and perhaps have a limited budget to invest in the necessary tool ‚Äì you know that email auto-responders charge per number of subscribers. So, wouldn‚Äôt it be a smart idea to MAKE SURE you weed out the tire-kickers / the people who will never buy from you (at all) regardless of what email marketing strategy you implement??? I think we need to really stress this issue for the newbies out there. Because you do not want to be paying extra because you now have an email list of 2,000 people and half of the half are only serious people who are more likely to buy from you. Right?!! Besides emailing every single day, what you should also do, is take one or two breaks a month. Meaning that you will email your list every single day for like 2 weeks and then all of a sudden stop emailing them for 4 ‚Äì 5 days. Then get back on the schedule again.  This simple tactic will make people wonder ‚Äúwhat happened to you‚Äù ‚Äì since they got used to seeing your emails daily. Doing this will even become a bit entertaining to your leads. Come on, you can‚Äôt be a boring email marketer, right! üòÄ  I do not believe in settling for just One Tip ‚Äì when it comes to How Often You Should Email Your List. Because, at the end of the day, what works best for YOU will depend on many factors (your personality, your way of connecting with your leads, your niche, the way you captured the leads, etc). Just my 2cents! ‚Ä¶or maybe it was way more than 2cents! hahaha .. I‚Äôm just a very passionate blogger! üòâ Overall, you laid out very valuable tips on email marketing, Anil!  Keep up the great work! Have a wonderful weekend! .. Cheers! üòÄ I think sending emails every single day is NOT advisable for anyone unless you are into a news/entertainment niche.  Sending 1 email per week is working well for me. Not only sending less frequent mails can help you build bonding with your subscribers but they least irritate them. After all, no one likes to get daily updates from you unless you are updating 1 post every single day.  It‚Äôs been a while since I got a massive insightful comment on guest post üòâ Keep rocking and thanks for stopping by. I too hate pop ups that is why I never tried any popup on my blogs. But recently I tried ThriveLeads on one of my blogs and conversions are mind blowing. I am going to use it on my all blogs soon.  About tip #6 don‚Äôt you think it will kill the user experience if we add email subscription at all possible places? Let me know your views. Thanks a lot for sharing these mistake about building email lists. Hi Brandon, We all hate popups. But they convert like crazy. If you want to skyrocket your leads, you should definitely give them a try once. Placing email optin forms allover your blog‚Äôs design is an aggressive way to collect emails. Yes, you will irritate your audience but if your overall end goal is to get more conversions, that‚Äôs what you should do. Moreover, people won‚Äôt mind it if your content is good enough! Hi Anil, I think #4 is one mistake that cost many beginners either not to build an email list at all, or ended up building a non-responsive email subscribers. If you don‚Äôt know your typical ideal audience, you‚Äôre definitely attracting the wrong audience to your email list. Like I have read on many top blogs about the effectiveness of pop ups, though I never tried it on any of my blogs and like you, I hate them and think is not part of a good users experience. I might consider experimenting with it on my blog someday‚Ä¶thanks Anil for sharing. I am growing my email list, one individual at time, and then the next ‚Äúperson‚Äù in line‚Ä¶ üòâ Have you subscribed to Lyceum Bulletin yet? A new issue will be published soon‚Ä¶ üôÇ #1 concerns me. I don‚Äôt do it on purpose to avoid higher than necessary unsubs. I‚Äôm interested to find out how your unsub stats were affected (if at all) after you incentivized the opt-in.  I do agree with #8 and only send once weekly. That said, I do understand where Freddy is coming from about mailing daily. That‚Äôs coming back around to knowing your audience. If you‚Äôre growing a list of people that need a lot of hand holding to get started, then sure, daily tips would be welcomed by some. For me, my audience already is online so IMO, daily would be a killer.  Robbie Knowing your IDEAL reader is the key to blogging success.  Popups are really conversion boosters. Yes, they are irritating but you can give a try to exit-intent technology just like I do on my blog. The popup appear only when someone exists your blog. Thanks for this informative article.  Here are some thoughts on some of the comments so far: 
1. To get the best results from your emails consider figuring out when during the day your audience is reading emails and time sending your emails accordingly so that the are at the top of their email lists. You can research and schedule your emails using an email system such a AWeber or mailchimp (there are several other similar ones).  This way you wouldn‚Äôt have to write and send multiple emails a day to reach yhe majority of yoit audience.  Some systems can even send ay different times for different audience segments. 
2. I think that quality is as important as quantity for your emails.  Also, when a reader signs on for your emails your welcome email should let them know what to expect from you in terms of the frequency, length and content. Your welcome email should be sent almost immediately. 
3. It make sense to write your emails when you are at your best, edit them carefully later then send them at the most appropriate time for your audience using an email autoresponder system insread of having to do the posting manually. Hey Anil, I think #1 and #8 are the biggest killers to growing an email list. Your visitors that come to your blog want to know why they should subscribe to your email. What more value can they get from you if they decide to give you their email address. If you can give them a reason like an ebook download or a video course then all you‚Äôll just get is traffic and no email or sales conversions. And if you do get subscribers, you definitely want to keep building rapport and trust with them by emailing. I didn‚Äôt do this for a long time which is the main reasons why I didn‚Äôt get any sales, even though I was getting traffic. Great post Anil! You have a great weekend! That‚Äôs so true Sherman. No one subscribes to a blog just because you are asking for them to subscribe. They need to see the real value either in your content or in your offer (incetive). Otherwise it‚Äôs really hard to convince to turn normal website visitors to subscribers. Thanks for stopping by. Hey Anil, I know I am still doing the mistake #1. Even though I did grow my list to a somewhat decent number, but with some incentivews, it will grow much faster. I have a service that I can offer based on my target audience, but need to work on it to finalise and polish it so that I can start offering it.  About th optin forms, what do you think about Welcome Mat? I know popups can be annoying sometimes, so I am yet to give it a try. I was thinking of trying the Welcome Mat once I start offering the service to the subscribers. Hi Anil, You‚Äôve covered all the smart tips that are super important when building a list üôÇ However, I wish to comment on two things: 1. Pop ups are a BAD thing except when they actually show up on the point of exit‚Ä¶personally, I have stopped visiting a ton of sites because of this very reason, especially if there is no exit button ‚Äì and so have many other bloggers! Thanks for including this. 2. Second, placing my optin right under the header has worked magic for me in the past. This is because, everyone that lands on either a page or post sees it‚Ä¶often, in that position, optins of 500+ daily were pretty common. However, for this to work, the optin has to be responsive and as you have previously stated, contain an incentive your audience cannot resist üôÇ You write in a brilliant fashion‚Ä¶do keep it up. Always,

2016-04-17,http://basicblogtips.com/fundamental-reasons-bloggers-fail.html,4 Fundamental But Unmentioned Reasons Bloggers Fail! | Basic Blog Tips,"I have read¬†tons of¬†articles that give us reasons and statistics  . Most of these articles focus on bloggers who are on the scene already and try to bring out some factors surrounding their blogging activities that can bring about failure. 
Some say the content isn‚Äôt good enough, others say it‚Äôs lack of promotion or a solid¬† ¬†Not posting consistently or not having enough time are the other reasons I see being mentioned most often! As a matter of fact, they are all correct. But I have not read where anyone mentioned any of these fundamental factors I‚Äôm going to list here in this post. These are fundamental because they are at the beginning of their blogging activities and they form the foundation on which other factors are built.¬†I think at this level, if any mistake is not identified and dealt with, chances of succeeding and growing a thriving blogging business are slim.¬†By discussing these   factors, I hope to help some who are about to start or who are at the verge of collapsing to take shape and possibly start off on a better foundation. This is one of the bad reasons some people have left business today. Sadly, little or no one is talking about this particular factor. I think the reason is that there are so many great web hosting companies today so much that no one things this can ever be an issue. But I‚Äôll shock you‚Ä¶ People have made wrong choices of where to host their sites. As soon as their businesses start picking up, the next thing is their website is unavailable. That‚Äôs a big punch on¬†your business; Some weeks back, a friend contacted me from   to recommend a reliable web host. The reason was that his local (Nigerian) web hosting company had become so unreliable. His business website and blog were online today and tomorrow offline. That almost crumbled his online business until he took a different move. I sent him a list of   companies I think are reliable but asked him to take time and investigate them. After scouting the net for information to help his decision, he wrote to me about  , which was his final choice: 
 
If your web hosting company is making your business difficult, change it.¬†A reliable web hosting company has the obligation to host your files and data and make them available each time requested by you or your readers. A minimum guarantee must be 99.9% uptime, live customer support, enough disk space and bandwidth to carter for your traffic, tools and resources to allow you create and manage your databases, email accounts, upload files, etc. If your cousin is running a web hosting company, that‚Äôs no reason to buy hosting from him. Affinity should never be a business factor. Most of the other factors that cause people to drop¬†from blogging are supported by the fact that they made some very wrong decisions from the start.¬†As a matter of fact, people blog in different niches for different reasons. Some, to make money, some do it just to express themselves on certain topics, some do it for business, some do it because others are doing it, etc;¬†If you don‚Äôt have a solid reason why you want to blog, you may end up choosing the wrong niche. 
 Note that the wrong niche for you may be the most perfect one for some other people. The reason for this is that people are different! We can‚Äôt all follow the same path, and if we tried, we would all turn into clones or even worse ‚Äì robots! When you choose the wrong topic, you may end up getting really bored, loosing interest and motivation, lacking creativity for picking blog topics, etc. 
Now, if someone drops out here as a result of lack of motivation, everyone else will take that (lack of motivation)¬†as a factor behind your abandonment. But we know from this post that the real reason is a¬†wrong choice of topic that was made at the start. It‚Äôs the foundation that‚Äôs bad. After the   we had here in Douala last year, one of the participants came to me and after about 5 minutes of discussion, she told me she‚Äôd like to blog about Christmas. I told her it‚Äôs a great topic but what will you be doing during Easter? She smiled! You know, it‚Äôs a good thing to create event-based blogs but these blogs become so dormant in dead seasons. ¬†Before you start a blog in any topic, be sure that topic is evergreen. The best way to start a business and minimize cost is to  . But if you choose the wrong guide or coach in the beginning, your success is already compromised. I had a very active guy on my blog. At one moment, he became so silent and his blog went dormant. I shot him a mail, trying to know why he‚Äôs been this absent. But he sent me a shocking reply: ‚Äú‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶‚Äù So sad! You see that the role model you are following could be the reason you are not making it. How did you get to know him? Did you do enough investigations? Does he have a track record as a coach? How can you allow someone without a success story teach you how to succeed? 
 You see that all these 4 reasons have to do with the foundation. Once the foundation is broken, there is no way you can hope for a long lasting structure. The solution is to go back to that bad foundation and do the corrections. Change your host, get a new coach, chose the right evergreen topic and you‚Äôll definitely success in blogging. Drop a comment and let me know what you think. Don‚Äôt fail to check out   for more¬†engagement A very thoughtful post Enstine, Those are really the fundamental things that many people usually ignore while starting their blog and later, the reality will start staring them on the face. If you choose a wrong host while starting your blog then you‚Äôre bound to fail no matter.  Thanks for sharing. Hey bro, 
Thanks for your input on this post. 
As a matter of fact, hosting has always remained a hidden problem but if we address properly on time, we‚Äôre a step ahead. hope you are set for a wonderful weekend ahead Your every words are very true. When I had started blogging then I was not conscious about hosting and I bought a local hosting for running my blog. After working some days, I realized that I am not getting rank from search engine without any reason. I mean, I had analyzed a lot and get no answer why all of these happening. Then I have changes my web hosting and now I am getting better result. Hi  Enstine! These are definitely very important reasons to really pay close attention to ‚Äì when starting a new blog online. Especially number One!!  I have to admit that I did not really care too much about the Hosting Quality for my blogs, at the beginning. And a few months ago one of my growing blogs was having too many down times ‚Äì way too often.  So, I had to make a change of hosting! Ever since I upgraded my hosting ‚Äì my main blog has not been having loading issues and it has not crashed ever since. üòÄ  It was a smart move! The one hosting service I would recommend is called; ‚ÄòTraffic Planet Hosting‚Äô. It is from the ones behind the traffic planet forum ‚Äì for those who might be curious. I think getting a high quality hosting plan from the very beginning of your blogging journey is very important. Because your ultimate plan is to get hundreds and hundreds of visitors every single day, right?!! It would be a pain in the butt to have to move your entire site to a better hosting service. Trust me, I know from my own experiences! üòâ The other 3 reasons you have mentioned here are spot on as well man! Thank you very much for sharing your valuable insights on blogging here, Enstine! Keep up the great work! Enjoy your week. Cheers! üòÄ Hi Freddy, 
Thanks for adding to this post üòâ I remember my first website was hosted for $1/m. That was quite affordable but full of downtimes. As you mentioned, getting the right host is crucial. I have checked out that host before and I think they are great üòâ Thanks for sharing your experience man and do have a wonderful weekend ahead Hey Enstine, Great to see you and this awesome content on Ileane‚Äôs place! üôÇ These four mistakes are too common and mostly done by the newcomers. As you know that thorough research is needed in the initial stage of the blogging; from domain name to niche and host to content. You miss out on the research, you step up the foot on the last footstep of a bus where you have chances of falling more than getting entered inside of the bus. As you spend the money for the web hosting, you deserve the best in industry. And niche selection and topics, oh my!! I can imagine how much headache it causes. You keep on writing and you find no result and interest by people no matter how much effort one puts in. In the last, coaches‚Ä¶ Everyone just kicking the blogging industry finding themselves mentors and able to coach the masses. And in this world of competition, newcomers need to set foot up on the right track from start. But unfortunately, selecting a low-credible, unknown, and with cheap rates, they set fire to their money, efforts and time. I‚Äôd always advice getting in touch with the top bloggers to find their recommendations for picking up coaches. And what I want to add, as I live in a not-so-developed country, the ultimate core reason of the blogging here is to earn money. Just earn a few dollars! For that they do a heck of the effort to monetize their blogs from day one using AdSense, Chitika and InfoLinks. After months of effort, they are doomed and abandoned their blogs because of no money and result. This is the mindset developed over here and long term blogs are hard to find. Blogging does need good time, smart mind and consistent effort! Thank you so much for the great share of you, Enstine! Happy to share it on my social life! See ya! üôÇ ~ Adeel Hey buddy, 
Good to see you here and thanks for covering every point here in the comment. Just like here where most of the bloggers I have met express some desire to make money from their blogs. It‚Äôs not always easy the way they are being told and when they start facing tough times, most of them drop üòâ Thanks for being part of this post buddy. I hope you are having wonderful moments over there üòâ I am new in blogging, so not yet tasted any failure, nor success. However, I was wondering some out there must be failed with the bogging work, and I wanted to know possible reasons. So I went googling through various blogs. True that many guru‚Äôs mentioned acceptable reasons, however most of them skipped the ones you showed here. So it is just great to drop by here. Hi Rocky, 
Thanks man for being part of this post and for dropping a comment üòâ I hope you are doing great and ready for a wonderful weekend ahead Yes, I was about to hurt my blog with the wrong server hosting service. This is a nice post. Thanks for your feedback Sharma üòâ Very nice tips. I would like to add fail to create networking with other bloggers. Hey Ravi, 
Yeah that‚Äôs correct as they grow in blogging üòâ Thanks for your input bro Thanks for nice information.planing is very important you are right many new blogger start blogging in wrong niche and then start publishing other niche post.i think making calendar to update blog or making daily schedule for blogging is very important thing for success. Hey Suraj, 
I have had some bloggers ask me questions to know if content in this or that topic can be good for their blogs. I just simply found out they started wrongly and that‚Äôs why they are trying to feed in content from other topics. Proper research in the beginning is necessary Hello Enstine, You‚Äôve just hit the nail on the head with the Fundamentals of Blogging. Most people want to become master bloggers yet they fail to go through the fundamentals in becoming masters in blogging.  As my team leader usually say, ‚ÄúWhen the fundamentals is flawed, everything will surely come crashing down.‚Äù  Once these 4 fundamentals of blogging are put in place, bloggers are bound to succeed with a long lasting structure. Thanks for sharing. Your leader is right  bro Okolo üòâ 
The foundamentals make your foundation and if that‚Äôs weak, the structure cannot stand. Thanks for your input bro. 
I hop you are set for a wonderful weekend ahead Hello Enstine Muki,                    This is something great stuff to find here üôÇ                   Indeed no body talks about these in their post. You truly said, these are some fundamental 
                  but unmentioned points.                    Web host is something that is really a matter for concern for every blogger out there. 
                  If the web site do not seems to be easy and reliable, the customers are flew away from us. 
                  It should be fast enough and pretty much attractive, so that the customers are still stuck at our web 
                  sites.                   Thank you for this important share among us. 
                  Keep Writing üôÇ 
                  Shantanu sinha Hi Shantanu, 
Good to see you here this morning and thanks for reading and taking time to drop this comment. Hope you are having a wonderful week üòâ Hi Enstine  Not surprised by the quality of this post. You really hit the nail.  This a great reminder and these fundamentals are very important and mostly taken for granted.  Thanks for sharing. Take care Hey bro, 
once the foundation is poorly laid, failure is eminent üòâ Thanks for your comment Hey Enstine, 
Great article once again! I do consider that choosing a wrong web host is one of the biggest mistakes if you are blogger, but I don‚Äôt agree with the fact that there is any wrong niche. The reason is if you are not passionate about blogging, then you won‚Äôt do any better in your favorite niche as well. There are many bloggers out there running popular blogs on topic that they don‚Äôt have any interest in. It all depends on the research and dedication. In my opinion, blogging on seasonal topics is not a mistake, but more of a choice! And I never had a coach, so I can‚Äôt comment on it. What do you think about my answers? ‚Äì Arbaz Khan Thanks for sharing your opinions bro. 
It all depends on the angel you are coming from and the way you see it.  Questions! 
What defines your passion for something? 
Why decide to blog on a seasonal topic? Answering these questions will help know whether a niche is wrong or not and whether it‚Äôs a mistake taking on seasonal topics or not. Hope you are having a wonderful week Adding to that, the type of content some blogs are presenting is totally pushing something else. The blog should give a solution not just talks. Thanks for that contribution Ravish üòâ 
Many people don‚Äôt seek to resolve issues and that‚Äôs why their content is boring. hope you are have a wonderful week You are absolutely right‚Ä¶ Selecting the wrong niche is the major reason for too many failure. The prime reason being people ideally look for niche which pays more rather than focusing on niche which interests them a lot. So after setting up the blog people tend to loose interest as it is something which they are not much aware of. 
Thanks for the share it is really informative for every novice blogger. 
Cheers Hey Aalia, 
Thanks for your wonderful contribution to the conversation. I hope you are set for a wonderful weekend üòâ Hi Enstine, All your points are very valid ‚Äì especially finding the right niche. If you don‚Äôt think it through, it is easy to outgrow your niche and run out of things to blog about. Another area that I think is challenging as a blogger is getting organized. There is so much to do ‚Äì so if you don‚Äôt have good systems in place, it is hard to keep up with the schedule. Hey Neena, 
You are very correct about getting organized and that applies to most areas of our lives. There is a lot to do as you mentioned and not following a plan and being disciplined can lead to general failure. Thanks Neena for adding to the conversation this weekend üòâ Enstine ‚Äì New to your site, but really enjoying the posts! One comment / question on this one: while reliability is obviously HUGE, how much of an impact do you find the web hosts speed makes on rankings? I forget what podcast I was listening to recently, but they were on about having a host that will give you faster page loads‚Ä¶but, assuming it‚Äôs not super slow, how much of difference will it really make? When you‚Äôre talking a second or two difference, will it really impact rankings? I currently thinking about just making sure my images are optimized and possibly using AWS or something similar to host the images for a speed bump. Anyway, just curious if this is something you have insight on. Thanks again! Hi John, 
You know speed alone is just a factor and that really plays a lot if you competitors are better than you. A lot of things affect your load speed, including server configuration, quality of scripts, images,  etc While you can handle areas like images, coding, etc, the server resources can only be a responsibility of your host. I think the impact of speed depends on competition. Google matches different factors to determine the position of your entry on SERP. Speed may not be as heavy as backlinks and content relevance, but at one point, it could help your competitor with a faster site rank better than you. A second or two difference can mean a lot, all things being equal. But a super fast new site with shallow content may not stand an old slower dog with a lot of meaty content üòâ Again an informative post. All these reasons behind blog failure are undoubtedly valid and the one which I think is the major reason is start blogging in wrong niche because many times it happens that bloggers plan to work on some niche and after some time they start publishing other niche post, and this push them to big failure. The points you have shared here must be keep in mind! Thank you again üôÇ Hi Pooja, 
Good to hear from you and thanks for the comment. I hope you are in the right niche üòâ do have a wonderful weekend My niche is inspirational blogging. I am growing a following, close to 4,000 email subscribers, but how do I take it to the next level? I want to stay personal and real while giving inspiration. I am also a Christian blog. Hi Mary, 
It‚Äôs great to hear your story and I have to recommend you stay focused. 
First, there are things you‚Äôve done that have grown your blog to where it is now. Why not rinse and repeat? One of the ways is to connect with like-minded bloggers. It‚Äôs proven to generate impressive results.  Sharing your business cards with other Christians during live events and encouraging them to check out your blog can also be a go step forward. I know people want to connect with positive people so stay positive. Nice to have you here Mary. I hope you are set for an exciting weekend I completely agree with your list of failures. My last blog failed because I was blogging in wrong niche. I am a computer programmer but I created a blog on celebrity news gossips. As I didn‚Äôt had much experience in writing about celebrity.. my posts were not catching attention. Slowly I lost interest and closed my blog. I strongly recommend that .. we should not blindly follow the trend, I f we are not passionate about it.",Enstine Muki
2016-04-11,http://basicblogtips.com/fonts-make-your-blog-pop.html,Selecting Fonts that Make Your Blog Site ‚ÄúPop‚Äù | Basic Blog Tips,"I recently visited a website and was drawn to it in a way that is not customary for me. Now, I‚Äôm trying to figure out what it was that was so appealing about the design. With my own sites, I try to keep them fresh, but also try not to change them so often that visitors start to wonder if they have arrived at the right place! Regardless, I am always looking for that perfect design. The one that says, ‚ÄúYes! This is it!‚Äù 
 
I am so picky (and maybe a little ADD lol) that I don‚Äôt always feel like I have   and that keeps me on the lookout for new and appealing design ideas ( , social campaigns, and everything else that needs doing in life!) One of my personal challenges is that I find myself doing the back-end technical stuff (programming) or the video and podcast things before getting around to design changes. It is that old-fashioned limit on time that also inserts itself as an obstacle to my design dreams. After studying this particular website I realized what had drawn my attention. Are you ready for this? It was the fonts! It was hard to believe that it was not something fancy or technical or complicated, but simply a case of well-chosen fonts that were perfectly placed on the site. Ok. It is wonderful that we know what it is, but how do I replicate it? I‚Äôm not a graphic designer, even though I am a professional trainer and teach professional graphic artists how to use software like Adobe Photoshop to bring their creative inspirations to life with computer software. That doesn‚Äôt mean that  . So, what options are available to me, and others like me? Specifically, as it relates to font selection? Through this experience, I have discovered that if you want to do the same thing, you don‚Äôt need a fancy graphics design degree. It may help and certainty talent helps, but there are some options available for those of us whose talent doesn‚Äôt extend much beyond the drawing of a stick person. Before we get started,  , especially as it relates to fonts‚Ä¶ Like colors and scents, fonts induce emotions for your readers. From jagged-edged ‚Äòcreepy‚Äô fonts to curling sophisticated script fonts, they create an aesthetic ambience that readers use to make inferences about the brand, blog, or other content. There are also some basic rules for the use of fonts. For me, personally, I was blessed to learn these rules while attending university to become a programmer. Hey, the buttons on the software application have to look good, right? The advantage is that now I can pass that knowledge on to you. One of the rules that relates to fonts is that you should not use more than THREE fonts per design (i.e. per website). This is why many times you see a headline font, a body font, and then maybe a sub-heading or navigation font. If you have too many fonts, you create confusion in the minds of your site visitors. Think about it. Visit some sites who have broken that rule and then decide if that site gave you the feeling of professionalism. Did it make you feel like the site owner/company knew what they were saying or did it feel like the site was disorganized and thrown together? Now, just because a rule exists doesn‚Äôt mean that it can NEVER be broken. I don‚Äôt personally believe in the common use of the words ALWAYS or NEVER. The rules are guides and this particular rule is a helpful one, but if there is a good reason to break the rule, then go for it. The key thing is to 1) know the rule; 2) know if/when to break the rule; 3) know WHY the rule is being broken (i.e. the benefit to your brand). Ok, enough about rules for now. Let‚Äôs move on toward our journey. We can always talk rules again or save it for another article, eh? As I see it, there are three ways to get it done: That is the order of simplicity, as well. However, it is also in order of most expensive to least expensive. That said, it doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive. Talking in circles? Not quite. For example, let‚Äôs start with the hiring of a professional. There are ways to do that that are not going to break the bank or empty your wallet and some will give a very high rate of return on investment. This is especially true with what is called crowdsourcing. First, we could probably agree that it also helps to have some graphic elements that say, ‚ÄúHey, this is me!‚Äù In other words, your branding. In this case, we are talking about a selection of fonts (up to three, remember?) that really give your website the feel that you want to provide to the visitor. That ‚Äúfeel‚Äù may be the difference between a visitor being a visitor and becoming a client! Many times the easiest way to get to that point is to hire a professional that knows how to coach you through that and how to present the graphic elements that resonate with you and with what your brand represents. One popular way of doing this is use crowdsourcing for design. At first, when I heard the term, I wasn‚Äôt sure how that worked. I was trying to wrap my brain around it. I decided to interview Rahul Aggarwal, Co-Founder of  . His graphic design company implements crowdsourcing and Mr. Aggarwal explains it so well, in this interview: By using this process, you don‚Äôt have to go through several iterations with one graphic artist, not getting the results (i.e. font combination) that you want. You pick from several ‚Äúdesigns,‚Äù choosing the one that you want. It is like a graphic design contest and it is all about you! You only pay for the results you want rather than paying for iterations of what you don‚Äôt want! You could go out and get a degree. Ok, that is probably more expensive than the first option of hiring a professional. üòâ And, what would your friends at the cocktail parties say when you mention that you are paying $60k for a degree to learn how to choose three fonts for your website? Maybe a slight overkill. However, there are some good books out there. One of my absolute favorites, and one that I recommended while I was teaching Adobe Photoshop and Website Design for Compumaster, was a book called ‚Äú , 3  Edition‚Äù by Robin Williams and John Tollett (affiliate link). The whole idea was that it covers design (superbly!) but covers it in a way that common people can understand! I can‚Äôt say that this is the ‚Äúend all‚Äù for font selection, but it definitely covers what you need to know for web design and is quite a bit cheaper than a college degree or vocational course. The final method is the do-it-yourself method and it may actually be the most fun. However, it does require some elbow grease. At the same time, you get some education and some return on that investment of zero dollars. I‚Äôll get you started here with ten fonts, to get you out of the starting gate. First, there is a handy tool that a graphic designer recommended, that is essential. It is called ‚ÄúWhatFont‚Äù and it helps, in most cases, by hovering over a font that you like on someone‚Äôs site and letting you know what that font is, so that you can go ‚ÄúGoogle it‚Äù and get the font for yourself. ¬† There are a couple of different ways to get WhatFont. One way is as a desktop option  . And another way is as a  . Then, to use it, you activate the tool and hover over the font you want to identify. Keep in mind, there are cases (i.e. embedded fonts) where the font is not identifiable. However, compared to not knowing what the font is at all, the tool is worth the shot! And, it is free! I used the WhatFont tool to dissect a few websites in this article, ‚Äú .‚Äù In that article, I chose the sites and then used the WhatFont tool to determine what fonts made the site design appealing. In this article, I look at it from the other direction and choose some fonts and talk about uses for those fonts (among other things). Speaking of Google‚Ä¶ Do you remember the days when fonts were harder to get and they cost a ton of money (or so it seemed)? Fortunately, now, many wonderful fonts are available from ‚ÄúGoogle Fonts.‚Äù This also makes it easier to incorporate into your site. I have included some examples for you in this article so that all you need to do is click, copy, and paste to implement on your site! We gathered up a few fonts for examples. Obviously, this barely scratches the surface for what is available out there, but it should get your creative juices flowing. All of the following fonts are free (to the best of our knowledge, at the time of this writing); include a readable license (somewhere on the site we have linked); are downloadable (for offline projects); and are also Google fonts (for easy copy/paste into your website). We have included that information, along with a graphical example, for each of the fonts. ¬† Homemade Apple is a sort of scripty, but not too scripty, font that is pleasing to the eye. It works well in embedded quote images as well as block quotes. It draws the eye to the font, making it a perfect addition to the your three-font set, for those special occasions. ¬† Alegreya evokes a sense of tradition and reliability. Alegreya includes serifs or subtle lines on the edges of certain letters. These small marks create a more formal style, similar to old typewriter fonts. Because of this, serif fonts typically evoke a sense of reliability, respect and tradition. Raleway seems playful and informal. Raleway, a sans-serif font, is clean, modern and easy to read. Sans-serif fonts are clearly legible, even at very small sizes. Online prevalence has led san-serif fonts like Raleway to be seen as more relevant and relatable than other fonts. Raleway was featured in Lady Gaga‚Äôs 2013 website redesign (shown in the below image). ¬† Monsieur La Doulaise invites elegance and sophistication. Ultra-elaborate script font Monsieur La Doulaise evokes a sense of affluence and ‚Äúbreeding.‚Äù It is somewhat difficult to read and may slow readers down, but a flourish of Monsieur La Doulaise adds exquisite class to headlines, logos and invitations. Kranky is approachable and fun. This light, fun, and slightly inconsistent font uses occasional block lettering along certain lines. Ironically named Kranky, this font can be used to create an ambience of whimsy and funk in headlines, logos, and other short texts. ¬† Ewert brings Western flair to any project. Ewert is a serif-based display font that looks like the ornamental wood signs of the old West. The large, chunky letters are all capitalized and suggest a sense of old-fashioned Western adventure and charm. ¬† There was a popular font, Bebas Neue, that was used frequently for designs like the one displayed above, as a menu cover. However, it was not free. Fortunately, there is a similar font that has been able to replace the usage of Bebas Neue. It is called, ‚ÄúOswald.‚Äù It is a useful font in places like menus and restaurant design, as shown in the above example, a design that was created around this wonderful font, to showcase its capability. ¬† The Copse font has been a popular font that is paired with ‚Äúcreepy fonts‚Äù for the overall ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù feel of a web site. It is a clean font that is easy to read and so it works well as a complementary font with other more unique fonts that help complete the package. The Ubuntu family of fonts work well with navigation, buttons, and menus. They are a clean font and easy to read. They fit well within the restraints of buttons and pull-down menu items, making them an ideal choice. ¬† Lato is so easily described by the phrase, ‚ÄúSimple Elegance.‚Äù It is simple and yet the gentle curves of the font design create a subtle and comfortable ease. It is not so elegant that it is not readable and yet it is not so simple that it is boring. Lato is able to balance the two worlds with equal appeal. Content creators must ensure that the fonts align with their content. Choosing the right font style is essential, especially since readers will interpret the content through the feelings that are created by the font. Now, we have you started with ten fonts, but don‚Äôt let that stop you! See what you can come up with on your own. Find the fonts that you like and those fonts that look good together (i.e. ‚Äúpairings‚Äù). Then, come share your site design masterpieces with us! I am always in confusion whether I am using the right font and font size. You can make a blog post on the best readable fonts and font size. Hi Deborah It is really amazing to customize your blog. Fonts are always an issue for me as I am very bad in selecting these. Your this post has made me capable of making my blog shine through correct font selection. Thanks Deborah! -Abhishek Thanks for sharing this Deborah.  Fonts may not seem like a big deal but it truly is. If a font is hard to read, we won‚Äôt be getting many visitors to our blog. I‚Äôm going to install the What Font extension after I post this comment. üôÇ  Thanks again for sharing all this information with us. Cori Choosing a Font for a website is headache. WhatFont seems to be an interesting tool. Just to confirm if the tool is perfect, Are you using sans-serif fonts for post? Hey Deborah, 
Glad to meet you.. üôÇ You have shared a beautiful and great informative article and reading this suggestive post was really great beneficial for me.

‚Äì Ravi. Hello Deborah, 
Great writing mate. Specially usage and reference of fonts. Hope, it makes sense for newbie or mid level website designer. 
I am share 1 personal experience regarding website fronts. I have 2 E-commerce websites in New Zealand market. 2 years back, one website was doing really good and the other site was not. 
I talked with my SEO expert regarding this issues. We analyzed google analytic for both site. We found that we was losing traffic when they land to our target pages(less earning E-commerce site). Then, we point out few majors issues and site font was one of them. After re-designing font size, type, and color, we got incredible result for that site.  Any way, Thanks for your blog. 
Cheers Great post. What would be the ideal size of a font of paragraph? I always prefer to use the windows font. 
1. To prevent additional calls to google api, thus increasing site speed. 
2.  To easily view the fonts on older browser, our friend in, IE Out of which, Verdana and Segoe UI is the most preferred. But, everything comes to the User Experience and preference. Really great advice for use of fonts, thanks Deborah. I don‚Äôt currently make pinnable images for my blog posts, but am looking into this now. These fonts are ideal for this. I‚Äôm particularly liking Lato. My preferred blog paragraph font family is simply Google‚Äôs open-sans at size 16 which is clean, crisp and so easy to read on all devices. Many thanks 
Matt",Deborah
