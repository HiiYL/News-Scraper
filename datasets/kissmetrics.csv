,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/marketing-planning-process/,Why Your Marketing Planning Process Is A Mess (And How To Fix It),"If you’re part of a marketing team, you know that trying to wrangle all of your projects can be about as frustrating as playing dodgeball blindfolded. Your landing pages need updating, your content calendar is behind schedule (again), and you’ve been trying to launch that new product video since the Dark Ages. Oh, and sales needs more leads. Yesterday. Why is it so tough to get a handle on everything? That’s where Scrum comes in. In this post, I’m going to show how Scrum can help you transform your marketing processes from a quagmire of frustration into a streamlined bastion of ingenuity that would make even MacGyver proud.Scrum is a rugby term that refers to a closely-knit huddle of burly men who are bludgeoning each other for possession of a leather-covered ball. Scrum is also a learning-based project-management approach. It helps teams focus on priorities while remaining responsive to new circumstances. While it’s commonly used in software development, you can apply it to any discipline. Especially marketing.You can read entire books about Scrum, but there are two principles that I want to outline here:Traditional project management says that you should plan every detail of an initiative ahead of time. Once the planning phase is complete, your team simply executes against the plan. Simple, right? Sure – except real life isn’t like that. And those plans you worked so hard on can suddenly become obsolete. Scrum eschews that approach. Instead of spec-ing out your new website in minute detail in advance, you’ll break a project into smaller chunks – tweaking your plans at each stop along the way. This is why Scrum is called an agile approach. Sanity is now within reach!Wouldn’t it be great if your team got better every week? With Scrum, your team regularly and intentionally improves its processes. You’ll be like HAL 9000 from Space Odyssey: 2000 – you’ll use what you learn to get smarter and will soon want to take over the world (except unlike HAL, you’ll use your powers for good). Scrum even helps you measure your output to see how much you’re improving, which I’ll show you how to do in a bit.There are key concepts of scrum that you should be familiar with first: Here’s a 30-second overview of how to use Scrum:Great, so what do these principles look like in practice? Keep reading for a step-by-step breakdown of how to get started.Just like Ironman needs Jarvis to keep track of everything, you need a repository for all those amazing ideas swimming around your head. Enter the backlog.There’s just one maxim you need to know about the backlog: an unkempt backlog is worse than no backlog. If you don’t nurture your backlog, it will soon turn into an overgrown, abandoned parking lot of ideas that would look right at home in a post-apocalyptic zombie movie. Get a handle on your backlog with these steps:To give you a sense of how this looks for a marketing team, here are a few items from our own backlog:To keep everything tidy, segment your backlog into these three sections: Now that you’ve got your backlog defined, roll up your sleeves, take a swig of coffee and build your first sprint plan…Think about a sprint like planning for an epic journey across Middle Earth. It would be silly to plan every stop in advance. There are too many unknowns that could impede your progress: orcs, elves, and even giant talking trees. Instead, you’ll focus on just the first day. If you’re departing from the Shire, you might target Bree as your destination. All you worry about on day one is getting to Bree. You can map out stops for second- and third-breakfast, debate over which type of beer you’re going to drink at day’s end, and even estimate your arrival time pretty accurately. The following day you’ll focus the next destination, and things can progress smoothly from there (at least until the Eye of Sauron notices you).OK… each leg of your journey? That’s what each of your sprints is like.To build your sprint plan, you focus on a select group of projects – not everything in your backlog. Here’s how to get started:There are two signs that you’ve done things correctly: everyone has a clear idea of what they’ll be working on, and you’ve planned just enough work to keep everyone productive during the sprint.Our first sprint plans were like slow jogs in untied shoes. Some 50 sprints later, we’re like that guy who annoys his friends by telling them about every marathon he’s run. Here are some tweaks we’ve made along the way:This is your opportunity to get a status report from your team. Each person will share three things: what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and what they need from others to move forward. If there are any roadblocks, they’re addressed here.For example, let’s say a blog post can’t be published because the creative isn’t ready. Instead of scrambling at the last minute, you’ll have the chance to solve the problem ahead of time.The daily standup is also a good time to bring up “impromptu” projects (unplanned work that needs to be added). Maybe you discovered an error in an email workflow that needs to be corrected ASAP. During the standup, you can raise this issue, identify someone to tackle it, and adjust the sprint plan accordingly.Bonus: come up with a cheer your team can break on at the end of each sprint. Yes, the rest of your company will roll their eyes at you but that’s half the fun.Remember assigning those story points to your projects at the beginning of the sprint? (Those were the estimates of how much work each project would take.) This is your chance to see how many points your team actually got done. Here’s how:With your baseline established, you’ll easily be able to see when your team under- or over-performs. Which brings us to the real point of the retrospective: constant improvement. Here’s how to lock it in.First, ask each person on your team to share what went well during the sprint. Perhaps someone found a way to reduce the time needed to build a landing page by 20%. By sharing this knowledge with the team and making it part of everyday practice, you can lock in that improvement going forward. Next, ask everyone to share what problems they encountered. This isn’t a chance to blame others – it’s an opportunity to find better ways of getting things done. Keep talking about the challenges you faced until you identify potential solutions. Finally, add the implementation of those solutions to your next sprint. For example, maybe your marketing campaigns take forever to get completed because everything is done ad hoc. For the next sprint, add a project to create a clear campaign process for your team.If you can come up with just one improvement per week, your team could make 50 process improvements in a year. And guess what? Those improvements will add up big time. Not only will you get more story points done, you’ll progress from being Rocky the noob boxer to Rocky the Apollo Creed-decimating prize fighter.While there’s no “best” app for Scrum, we’ve found that Asana works really well for both managing the backlog and planning sprints. It allows us to keep everything in one place and it’s great for handling sub-tasks. Other tools to consider are Trello, Basecamp, and even Google Docs. Heck, some teams even use a whiteboard and sticky notes. Bonus reason for using Asana: rainbow-generating unicorns that fly across the screen when you complete a project. Does your current project management software provide unicorns? I didn’t think so.Slack isn’t just another glorified messaging program – it’s so good that you may be tempted to name your first child after it. We use Slack’s channels feature to help us sort through messages. For each project in a sprint, we create a new Slack channel. Any messages related to that project go there. When the project is complete, we archive the channel and never have to see it again.Scrum isn’t a panacea. In fact, it will probably be pretty messy when you start. But if you put in the effort, you’ll see your team grow like the Hulk (minus the rage, purple pants are optional). Not only will your team produce more, but they’ll enjoy their jobs more. Better planning = less stress = happier people.So if you decide to try Scrum with your marketing team, stick with it for at least a month before you decide if it’s right for you. And make sure to get your team on board first. I suggest having everyone on your team read Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work In Half The Time by Jeff Sutherland and J.J. Sutherland before you begin. Already use Scrum with your marketing team? If so, I’d love to hear how it works for you.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/customer-data/,Level Up Your Web Analytics with Customer Data,"Analytics has become synonymous with data-driven marketing. But there is one important distinction within the realm of analytics that can accelerate your business growth by helping you better understand your customers. I’m talking about the difference between web analytics and customer data analytics.Web analytics includes unique sessions, average session lengths, bounce rates, and other aggregate information. This type of data is great for optimizing a website and understanding campaign performance.However, it’s pretty difficult to use this aggregate data to understand drivers of user conversion or segment users into cohorts to which you can send more targeted emails. Since your success ultimately hinges on your users, the more data about them you can directly collect and analyze, the more you’ll learn how to improve your business.Customer data is any piece of information—who the customer is, what the customer is doing, and where on your page/app the customer is—that indicates how your customers are using your product or service and interacting with your brand. Other terms of this include “customer lifecycle data,” “behavioral data,” or “usage data.”Naming aside, the key here is that this kind of data is generated directly from user actions. You’ll be able to get a complete view of your user’s journey including how they interact with your product.With customer data analytics, you can more easily understand how they heard about your product, what features they love, what features they want improved, etc. Collecting and measuring customer data can help improve your product design, send more personalized emails, and better empower your customer-facing teams. All important things that can drive growth!At Segment, a customer data platform, we use over 20 different customer data tools via our own product to ensure that the data is consistent when it ends up in those end tools. In this post, I’ll share the broad categories of these tools and how you can use them to grow your business.It’s virtually impossible to design something in a vacuum that users immediately grok. Part of the iterative design process is to continuously get feedback from and observe real users using your product.Web analytics data, which is primarily quantitative, can help identify problem areas; for example, that the conversion to Sign Up on this page needs improvement. However, that is about all it can tell us. Customer data, which is tied to individuals, can not only reveal the poor conversion rate, but also show us other actions in each user’s journey or help you uncover qualitative feedback that may be useful in improving the conversion rate.There are three types of tools here that generate this valuable feedback:Live chat tools are exactly what they sound—they are a little widget on your site or app that allows people to chat in real time with your team. This is great for customer development, sales development, providing support, and finding problem areas in the design.Session recording and heat mapping tools are great for seeing what your users are doing on your site or app. Want to know if your customers get stuck on a form? Or see if they scroll down far enough to see the final call to action? These tools can help and inform your design decisions in future iterations.Surveys are another example of a qualitative tool. You can create little questionnaires that appear in a widget on the site. This is great if you don’t want to be manning the chat box 24/7 and if you have a specific question you want to ask that requires minimal thinking for your users to answer. In our experience, if the live chat tools provide vague responses, then switching to a survey with pointed questions might help you generate better insights.By leveraging a combination of these tools, you can quickly understand problem areas in the design of your app and fix them.If there is one thing to know about marketing, it’s that there is no one perfect message—only targeted messages. Emails, push notifications, and display ads that speak more directly to the recipient will see higher engagement rates.But how do you build an email list of your users that has the additional dimensions to allow you to make those segmentations?Well, many modern email and push tools today allow you to do just that. These tools can collect additional traits (of your choosing), which then can be grouped together in the end tool.Here are the common use cases of this:For example, below is sample tracking code that you would send to Customer.IO, a popular email tool (here’s a guide to other marketing automation tools):And here is how you would use those traits and events to create a unique segment of users to whom to send a custom email to:Besides higher engagement in open and click through rates, your users will also appreciate and trust your brand if you only send emails that are relevant.We’ve all been on the wrong side of a call with our credit card companies, where we’re repeating our mother’s maiden name ad nauseum, after being transferred countless times to different departments.The epitome of a terrible customer experience!We’re fortunate that modern companies now have learned from these gross injustices. Companies today equip their sales and support teams with customer data so that they don’t have to put their customers through the same cumbersome exercise. By putting the data in front of the right person at the right time, companies can make that data actionable.There are many ways to pull this customer data for your sales and support reps. Tools such as Zendesk and Intercom offer this ability to look at account data and usage out-of-the-box. Salesforce also provides the ability to create your own custom dashboards in the Account object view.To learn more about embedding custom dashboards, here are two blog posts on getting custom product usage data into Zendesk and Salesforce.Fortunately, there are thousands of tools out there that can help you collect, analyze, and use customer data. But how do you know what tools to choose?Here is a great guide that prescribes a framework to choose tools for your marketing and growth stack.Kissmetrics is a great analytics solution that is geared towards marketing and growth. The customer data collected can allow you to perform granular analysis on any individual user, as well as group them in cohorts to look at activation and retention.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/call-tracking-in-marketing-analytics/,Call Tracking: A Key Component in Campaign Marketing Analytics,"It almost goes without saying that analytics are crucial to developing successful online marketing campaigns. You know all about Kissmetrics, Google Analytics, Google AdWords and everything in between. But even if you’re already tracking all of your online activity, you may still not have a full grasp of lead and conversion data unless you’re also tracking phone calls.Phone call tracking is the missing piece of the marketing analytics puzzle, allowing marketers to alleviate attribution blind spots and better understand their audience by analyzing which digital and offline marketing tactics are causing customers to pick up the phone and call. By integrating call tracking software, you’ll be able to get a 360-degree view of customer behavior and gain a better sense of how to effectively reach your core audience.It’s true that you may already have a decent idea of who your customer is. However, call tracking can offer you additional powerful insights and information on your customer base, allowing you to understand your target audience like never before.It’s pretty straightforward, but the first and most obvious benefit of call tracking is the ability to listen to your customer firsthand. By recording phone calls, you’re able to determine how effective your customer service is and identify where you could use some improvement, all with the ultimate goal of boosting customer satisfaction and conversion rates. You’ll also be able to better qualify leads and determine which callers require more attention in order to turn them into loyal customers.In addition, call recording allows you to listen in on your employees and their interactions with leads and customers. By honing in on your sales team’s conversations with callers, you’ll be able to better analyze their tactics and identify areas that require attention to increase conversion rates.Finally, call recording allows you to get a better idea of where to spend your efforts, whether that’s on your staff, your marketing assets or your product development. Whatever the case may be, recording phone calls can help businesses exceed their own expectations and achieve success.Is there any instance where call recording isn’t beneficial to a business? It’s tough to say, but for smaller businesses just starting out, they may not have the budget or time to implement call recording quite yet. Also digital businesses that primarily rely on the Web for customer conversion and service may not see a great benefit. In all of these cases, free tools such as Google Analytics and AdWords may make more sense before diving into all the features of call analytics software.Beyond call recording, call tracking software offers a variety of impressive features that can give you a clearer picture of the overall success of your marketing strategy. Among these include keyword level tracking, campaign level tracking and multi-channel attribution tracking. These features allow you to examine and analyze each of your campaigns with unparalleled precision in order to see actual correlations between your marketing efforts and results. By gathering such in-depth insights, you’ll be able to better track your individual marketing initiatives and determine which ones are the most successful to your business.We’ll talk about each of these features separately and how they can help you improve your individual campaigns — and ultimately, your business’s marketing strategy as a whole. Let’s first look at keyword level tracking. This dynamic feature allows you to see which keywords are driving the most phone calls and conversions, which can be exceptionally useful in tracking the success of PPC campaigns. Here’s how it works:The benefits of keyword level tracking should be clear. By seeing firsthand which keywords are driving calls, you’ll be able to better understand which marketing efforts are working and which ones need to be fine-tuned.Similarly, campaign level tracking allows you to see which marketing campaigns — both online and offline — are driving the most conversions. You’ll be able to view data from your phone calls in your call analytics dashboard, so even if you’ve implemented a non-digital marketing campaign, you can measure its success alongside your online efforts. By analyzing the results of both your digital and offline efforts, you’ll be able to get a better grasp of the success of your overall marketing strategy. You can apply tracking at the campaign level to a variety of efforts, including but not limited to print ads, billboards, TV spots, PPC campaigns and Facebook ads, to better understand which campaigns are resonating with your customer base.Most customers interact with your business in more ways than one, but it can oftentimes be difficult to track their exact journey from start to finish. Multi-channel attribution bridges that gap, allowing you to track the entire progress of an online lead and effectively measure which online marketing channels lead to offline telephone call conversions.To paint a picture of how this works, let’s say you have a lead who first learns about your business through Google AdWords. They click on the ad, browse your website for a bit then go offline for the day. A few days later they remember visiting your website and decide to visit again, this time finding your site by doing a search or directly typing in the URL. They exit your website, and then a few days later pick up the phone after being retargeted through a paid display ad. Without multi-channel attribution you would only see the first channel a visitor came through, in this case Google AdWords. Call tracking enabled multi-channel attribution provides the ability to view the entire customer lifecycle and effectively measure which online marketing channels lead to offline call conversions. You not only see the first touch point, but the touch point that resulted in a phone call. This data can be used to optimize campaigns and provide proof of successful marketing campaigns that are driving conversions.While all of these features offer powerful insights to savvy data-driven marketers, it’s important to note that they may not be right for everyone. For business owners who may not be very experienced in analytics, call tracking software might seem like a completely foreign land. And as mentioned before, call analytics may not have great benefit for businesses such as e-commerce companies that drive revenue through clicks and not calls. Be sure to thoroughly weigh your options before integrating call tracking into your marketing strategy.Call tracking isn’t just beneficial to individual businesses who really want to hone in on their customer base, but it can be crucial in proving ROI for marketing agencies as well. Call tracking makes it easy for agencies to deliver what clients pay for: proven results. Just like the scenarios outlined above, call tracking enhanced lead attribution capabilities empower agencies to show their clients which campaigns are driving valuable phone calls. Moreover, call tracking can help agencies make smarter marketing decisions, which can lead to a reduction in wasteful ad spending and drive better ROI. Better ROI creates happy clients that stay with an agency for a longer period of time.Agencies also reap benefits by integrating call tracking software with other software applications that they are already using, such as Kissmetrics. Additionally, the leading call tracking providers offer specific features to help agencies serve their clients. These features include white label solutions to provide a seamless agency brand experience, the ability to handle multiple client companies via a single login, custom client reporting, and view-level access to enable clients to access their call analytics dashboard to view their data and see the results for themselves. Kissmetrics has partnered with CallRail to deliver call analytics. Integrating with CallRail alleviates attribution blind spots and allows you to see a more complete picture of how your customers are interacting with your company, not just on your website but also through the telephone. You can track which phone numbers generate more calls and deliver more new customers.With the CallRail Kissmetrics integration, website activity is automatically associated with a phone call without a person needing to collect any identifying information. CallRail is the only call provider that automatically associates phone calls to web visits to phone calls in Kissmetrics. This works beautifully with Kissmetrics’s person-based analytics approach.Integrating CallRail with Kissmetrics is simple two-step process. First, go to the Kissmetrics site settings page and copy your Tracking API.Then head over to CallRail’s Kissmetrics integration page and paste your Kissmetrics API key and click the activate button.Whether you’re a standalone business or a marketing agency, call tracking provides a variety of powerful features that aid you in tracking the success of your marketing campaigns to ultimately improve ROI.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/automated-lead-nurturing/,3 Ways Automated Lead Nurturing Can Supercharge The Sales Cycle,"So you’ve launched an inbound campaign and started to attract good leads. That’s great, but it’s just the start. Now you have to keep those leads happy, while gently leading them through the buyer’s journey to sales-ready qualification. If your sales cycle is a long one that’s not always easy.Sending leads inappropriate content and interrupting them with unsolicited sales calls is increasingly ineffective. Instead, to increase close rates, avoid wasted sales time and reduce the sales cycle, leads should be nurtured with appropriate content to ensure they understand the value of your solution before sales teams contact them.Many marketers may think they already run effective lead nurture campaigns. But using automated lead nurture as part of an inbound campaign ensures all leads get quick responses and are automatically sent the right content for them. No lead is forgotten and no content wasted.According to Gleanster Research, 50% of qualified leads aren’t ready to buy. They might be open to education, and delighted that you can identify their pain points. But actually signing up for your solution? They’re not there yet, and may not be for a while, depending on the length of your sales cycle.That means sectors with long sales cycles, such as the SaaS and software industries, which have an average cycle of 3-18 months (and there’s some suggestion that B2B sales cycles are getting longer across the board), face huge challenges in keeping leads interested and moving them smoothly through the sales funnel.They might lack appropriate content to last the length of the sales cycle, or simply fail to notice leads wandering off the path. Equally, they might bore leads with repeat content, or lose them in bottlenecks.The upshot can be lost leads and a lot of wasted effort by both marketers and sales teams. The wrong content discourages leads from moving along the sales path. Sales teams engage with leads at inopportune moments, wasting everybody’s time.Automated lead nurturing tackles these challenges.We know that lead nurturing works. A DemandGen report finds that nurtured leads produce, on average, a 20% increase in sales opportunities versus non-nurtured leads.But traditionally, nurture is labor intensive. The average buyer’s journey is complex, and the content that helps move them through the sales funnel from awareness (of a problem), to consideration (of solutions), to decision (of what solution to buy) needs to be expertly honed and perfectly timed.Random one-off emails to your database won’t cut it in a competitive world, especially during a long sales cycle. Talking up the detailed benefits of your solution to someone who is only vaguely aware of a problem is pointless at best. By the same token, emailing simplified educational material to a highly educated lead desperately seeking a solution is potentially counterproductive. Automating lead nurturing, on the other hand, allows for the systematic tracking of lead engagements with your content and site, and accurate pinpointing of that lead’s stage in the sales cycle. That means you can drip feed appropriate content at the right time – leads are never forgotten and opportunities never missed.Forrester Research finds that companies who excel at lead nurturing generate 50% more sales ready leads at 33% lower cost. Automated lead nurturing, done properly, is the gold standard in its field.Many marketers already automate some of the nurturing process, but it is the combination of three key points that make automated lead nurturing especially powerful.At its simplest, automating the sales process means being able to track and use a lot more data than would otherwise be possible and use that information to more accurately segment and target leads, speeding their path through the sales funnel.More specifically:If you haven’t automated your lead nurturing process there’s every chance your sales team is wasting time on leads that aren’t sales ready, while irritating potential customers with mistimed and irrelevant contact.Automated nurturing gently leads your targets through the sales funnel, breaking down barriers to sales with timely, appropriate content. The result? Your sales team spends far more time on sales-ready leads, supercharging your sales cycle.About the Author: Alex is Director of Strategic Internet Consulting, a London-based inbound marketing agency with a raft of major public and private sector clients.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/google-adwords-campaign-management/,The Ultimate Guide To Google AdWords Campaign Management,"Moltke, a German military strategist, was of course referring to battle plans, but the same is true with Google AdWords campaigns. The best planned ad campaign will not survive contact with your competitors…In other words, planning and setting up your AdWords campaign is only half the battle. The other half is optimizing your campaign once it’s live. Even the best, most perfectly set up campaign will ultimately fail if it’s not managed properly.Once a Google AdWords campaign is live, then there will be 3 core areas that must be continually monitored and improved. These 3 areas, which we refer to as the “3 Ingredients,” are where virtually all of your testing and optimization efforts should be focused.If your ads are not targeting your ideal customers then your campaign doesn’t have a shot at success.  During the initial campaign setup, you found all the relevant keywords you think your ideal customers are searching, but you never know for sure until your ads go live.In addition to keywords, other targeting factors include geographic location, device, and time of day.  All of these factors must be analyzed to determine the ideal targeting for your campaign.Assuming your ads are targeting the right audience, then the next critical factor is your ad copy.  Again, a lot of work goes into ad copywriting before your ads go live, but there’s a good chance the first drafts of your ads will not survive long.  You’ll need to continually test new ad copy to determine what works best for your ideal customers.Once a prospective customer clicks on your ad, then it’s up to your landing page to convert the website visitor into a lead or sale. It’s important to note that the landing page performance depends greatly on the targeting and ad copy discussed above.These are numbered in order on purpose.  A perfectly designed landing page will fail miserably if you’re not using the right ad targeting and ad copy.  Focus on your targeting, then your ad copy, and then make sure your landing page is congruent.Within each of these 3 ingredients there are dozens of elements that can be enhanced through testing, which can maximize the performance and ROI of an AdWords campaign.  And the key to success is to make sure that you’re following a checklist. It’s like cooking using one of those recipe and instruction cards from Blue Apron. On the card you see all the key ingredients and a step-by-step process for how you’ll carefully mix those ingredients to create a delicious meal. I’m sure you know what happens if you’re not an experienced chef and you try to wing it while cooking. Well, the same is true with AdWords.Now, let’s dive into each ingredient to take a closer look at what needs to be done…Ad targeting sounds simple, but there are actually a lot of factors at play.  Here are the 3 key areas you need to consider when optimizing your ad targeting:As we go through these 3 areas, we want to find opportunities to cut out anything that is not working and is wasting your advertising budget. At the same time, we want to find opportunities to reallocate the budget that was being wasted to the targeting that is performing well.By simultaneously cutting out what’s not working and investing more in what’s working, you’ll see rapid improvements in campaign performance.One of the most critical targeting factors in a search campaign is your keyword selection.  Assuming you launched your ads with keywords your ideal customer is likely to search, then you should have a head start on the optimization process.However, it’s impossible to know every single keyword variation that is going to perform well and many of the keywords that looked great on paper will simply underperform for whatever reason.  Don’t get frustrated if your initial keyword list is not profitable right out the gate!  Most keyword lists require a lot of TLC to find the best phrases for your business.
In this section, I’ll walk through several tactics you can use to fine tune your keyword list once the ads are live.The first is called pruning…The goal of pruning is to delete keyword phrases that are irrelevant or are generating clicks, but not conversions. You can find this information by going to your AdWords account, clicking on the ‘Keywords’ tab and then clicking on the “Search terms” subtab. This report shows you the exact keyword phrase that was searched when your ad was displayed.  Sort by Clicks to see which keyword phrases have a history of clicks but no conversions.To start pruning, focus on the keywords that are not relevant to your products or services. For example, if you only sell women’s shoes, exclude any keywords that include “men’s” in the phrase. The key benefit here is that pruning costly but non-productive keywords will save money, which can be re-allocated to keywords that are generating conversions.Next, we can prune by using negative keywords.Negative keywords can be added to your campaign or ad group to prevent your ads from being shown for specific searches. This will effectively narrow the audience that sees and clicks on your ads to the prospective customers that are most likely to call your business, visit your location and/or make a purchase.	Here’s an example of how designating negative keywords can help a plumbing business…Let’s say the business is using “plumber in NYC” as a phrase match keyword in a campaign designed to attract new customers. This company’s ads could be displayed when people enter search terms like “jobs for a plumber in NYC”. In this situation, when a person clicks on the ad, the money spent for the click is wasted because the searcher is looking to get hired, not to hire a plumber. By adding “jobs” as a negative keyword, the plumbing company would avoid wasted clicks by preventing the ads from being displayed for searches that include that term.Negative keywords can be selected for either the campaign or the ad group level. The plumbing company mentioned above could list “jobs” as a negative keyword at the campaign level, meaning that none of the ads would be displayed for searches that include the term. At the ad group level, listing negative keywords can sharpen the targeting of each ad. For example, an HVAC company that offers heating and air conditioning services could designate “heating” as a negative keyword for its air conditioning ads and exclude “air conditioning” in its heating ads.  That way the ads in each ad group can be 100% relevant based on the searched keyword.Next, let’s prune by Quality Score.Google will rate each of your keywords using a Quality Score based on the expected clickthrough rate, the relevance of the ad and the behavior of visitors when they arrive at the landing page. These scores range from 10 (the highest score) down to the lowest rating of 1. High Quality Scores can give your ads better positioning at lower costs-per-click.To find the Quality Scores for your keywords/ads, click the ‘Keywords’ tab. You can then click the white speech bubble next to each keyword to find the Quality Score.To get started, I recommend you remove all keywords with Quality Scores of 3 or lower. These keywords will drag down the Quality Scores of other keywords in your ad group.  In other words, a few bad apples will rot the entire basket!  If you don’t want to remove them completely, then I recommend you create a new campaign where you continue to test these low quality score keywords without “rotting” your other campaign.Next, work to improve the scores of the keywords ranked between 4 and 6. In the same place you found your Quality Score, Google provides evaluations of the clickthrough rate, ad relevance and the landing page experience. The evaluation on each ad can point to weaknesses that, when fixed, can improve each Quality Score.For example, if ad relevance is below average, you may be able to improve the Quality Score by adding the keyword that has been targeted in the ad copy to the headline of the ad. If the landing page is rated at below average, it’s probably because visitors are bouncing off shortly after they arrive. This would suggest that the landing page content needs to be tightened up around the targeted keyword in the ad.  Next, it’s time to prune by cost per conversion.Some of your ads may be converting, but at a cost that makes each sale unprofitable. If you know your customer lifetime value, then you know how much you can invest to get a new customer and still make a profit. If you didn’t set those benchmarks earlier, do it now!The cost per conversion for your keywords will be automatically tracked if you set up AdWords conversion tracking. If you did not set up conversion tracking, then pause your ads and set that up immediately. Without tracking in place you’re flying blind and won’t be able to complete this critical optimization step.  When you find unprofitable keywords, then try lowering the bids to get the keyword profitable.  If that doesn’t work, then you may need to pause the keyword altogether.  If the keyword is generating a lot of conversions, then you’ll want to test the keyword again after you’ve gone through the other steps to optimize your ads and landing pages.OK, that’s enough pruning…  Now it’s time to go fishing!The goal of fishing is to find additional keywords that either look promising or are already converting, but you’re not yet specifically targeting the search phrase. Like pruning, fishing starts with the Search terms report.  Sort by conversions and review the search phrases to find new keyword opportunities to add to your existing ad groups (if they are relevant) or create new ad groups for these keywords.This leads to another important optimization tactic…Replanting is the process of moving your best performing keywords from a campaign that contains lower performing and unproven keywords, to a completely separate campaign that contains only high performing keywords. Separating your keywords this way delivers the following advantages:Also, consider replanting keywords based on geographic targeting or day-parting. For example, setting up separate campaigns for different states may make sense if certain ads work better in one state than another. Or, if you find that a keyword converts on weekdays, but doesn’t convert very well on weekends, then you could set up separate weekday and weekend campaigns.  Again, this would give you more control over your budget, improve your reporting, and lead to higher Quality Scores.  Now it’s time to switch gears and focus on your bids…The main objective of bid optimization is to determine the keyword level bids that will result in the most profitable conversions for each keyword.  Therefore, to bid effectively, you must have conversion tracking set up in your AdWords account so that you’re measuring conversions at the keyword level.  Do that now if it’s not already set up and then come back once you start to see conversions in AdWords.Warning: This will require some basic math.  If you hate math and numbers scare you, then don’t panic.  I promise to keep this simple.Here’s an overview of what we’re going to do: Here’s an example of how this works…Let’s say you have determined that you can afford to pay $100 for a conversion.  Let’s also say that you have a keyword that has a 2% conversion rate.  To find your maximum cost per click, you can simply multiply the conversion rate by how much you can afford to pay.  In our example, we would multiply 2% by $100 to get $2.That means we can profitably pay up to $2 for this keyword.Note that this calculation needs to be done separately for each keyword because your keywords will likely have different conversion rates.  For more advanced marketers you may recognize the fact that the lifetime value may vary per keyword and that’s true.  For more advanced bid optimization you should use the different conversion rates and different maximum amounts you can afford to pay for each keyword.If you are just getting started with AdWords and don’t have conversion data, my suggestion is to prune your keywords down to a core group and then bid as aggressively as you can within your budget. Being aggressive with your bids will put your ads in prime position to get more clicks and give you a better chance to start collecting conversion data.As the conversion data starts to build, you can start replanting the performing keywords in a single campaign and dedicate most of your budget there. The balance of your advertising budget can be allocated to run tests on low-converting and unproven keywords in a separate campaign.Finally, we need to review your campaign targeting…So far we have focused on keyword selection, keyword organization, and bids. Now it’s time to look at your campaign performance per device, geographic area, and time of day. Device Targeting
Ad performance will likely vary substantially depending on which device the prospective customer is using. For example, mobile device traffic generally has lower conversion rates than desktop traffic. So if you’re reviewing data that is aggregating both devices, you’re not getting the full picture.It’s very possible that your campaign is performing well for desktops, but very poorly for mobile devices. Overall that could mean your campaign is unprofitable, but if you cut out the mobile targeting, then it could instantly be profitable!To review your overall campaign performance by device, go to Settings > Devices as shown below.That report will give you a high level view of your campaign performance by device.  Plus, on this page you can adjust your mobile device bid from -100% (negative 100% turns off mobile targeting) all the way up to +300% (increase your mobile bid by 300% of your desktop bid). Now, if you notice an issue with a device, you’ll need to dig in deeper at the keyword level.  To do this, go to the Keywords tab and then click on the Segment button and select Device.As you can see, this report will show you how each keyword is performing per device so you can see exactly what’s going on. If you find that all keywords are simply not performing for mobile devices, then turn off your mobile targeting. If you find that some keywords do perform well, then replant them into another campaign that targets mobile and turn off mobile targeting in the existing campaign.Geographic Targeting
To review your campaign performance by geographic location, go to the Dimensions tab, then click the View button and select “Geographic.”  Then click on the Columns button to add or remove columns in the report.  You can drill down from countries to individual zip codes, depending on how specific you need or want to get.Sort this report by cost to see where you’re currently allocating your ad budget. Then sort by cost per conversion to see which locations are the most profitable and which are unprofitable.  Finally, go to Settings, then Locations to add or exclude locations from your campaigns.Before we move on from targeting, it’s important to review how your campaign is performing by time of day and day of week.  It’s very likely that your campaign performs better during certain times of the day and certain days of the week.  For example, a pizzeria would likely see more conversions during lunch and dinner hours than in the early morning. In this situation, the pizzeria could scale back bids when conversions are minimal and then bid more aggressively during lunch and dinner hours.  To report on performance by time, go to the Dimensions tab, then click the View button to select Time, and finally select time of Day of Week or Hour of Day.If you find you need to adjust your bids based on the time of day or day of the week, then go to the Settings tab, then click Ad scheduling. From here you can set your ads to run during certain days or hours of the day and/or set bid modifiers to adjust your bids up or down.Now that we’ve reviewed our targeting and we’re confident our ads are showing when they are most likely to convert, it’s time to change our focus to the ad copy…In this section I’m going to assume your ads are:If you have not gone through the steps above, then stop, scroll up and complete “Ingredient 1”.  The best ad copy in the world will fail if it’s displayed to the wrong people at the wrong time!OK, back to your ad copy…In order to optimize your ad copy, you must test different ad variations to see what works best. This process is called split testing.  For example, if you want to test 2 ad variations, then you would show 50% of your audience variation A and the other 50% would see variation B.  Over time, you would see which ad variation gets the higher click-through rate and which variation leads to more conversions.So what should you test? Here are the 5 ad components you need to focus on:The offer you present in your ads is by far the most critical component.  A weak offer compared to your competition is not going to drive much traffic and conversions because most people will click on the more compelling offer.  Don’t make this more complicated than it needs to be. In my experience, many businesses do not have compelling offers and that is the #1 reason why the ads underperform.  Important Note: One of the biggest factors in your Quality Score is your click-through rate.  That means, if your click-through rate is low versus your competition, then you’re going to struggle to get a high Quality Score.  That also means you’ll need to bid and pay more for top placement. This is why your ad copy is so critical – Compelling ads lead to lower costs, more traffic, and more conversions!If you’re not sure what to offer, then start by reviewing your competitors who are already advertising on your target keywords. Remember, your prospects are going to see these ads and then make a decision to either click on your ad, or your competitor’s’ ads.What could you offer that would stand out?To get you started, here are 5 different types of offers that you could make:Use the list above to brainstorm new offer ideas and then create new ads to test them out in your campaign.The headline of your ad is the first thing that prospective customers will read after searching in Google. There are two goals with your headline:To accomplish the first goal, you can add the core keyword in your ad group to the headline of your ad. This will tell Google that you’re 100% relevant, which improves your Quality Score. Plus, prospective customers will know right away that your ad is relevant to their search query.To accomplish the second goal, you must review the competitor ads. How can you write a unique headline that will still be 100% relevant?  For example, test phrasing the headline as a promise and then create another version of the same headline as a question.  That simple change could make a big difference in your ad click-through rate.Once you’ve caught your prospective customer’s attention with the headline, then your description lines need to explain your offer and encourage clicking through to learn more.One of the easiest tests to run is to flip your description lines to see if the order makes a significant difference. Next, test emphasizing different benefits of your offer to see which benefit resonates the most with your target audience.Also, if appropriate, test qualifying language that ensures only qualified prospects click on your ad. For example, if you’re a financial planner who only works with people of a certain net worth, then you can specify that amount in your ad. This tactic can reduce your click-through rate, but substantially increase your sales conversion rates.The display URL displayed beneath the headline in your text ads, but it doesn’t function as an active link. Google requires that the root domain name be included in the display URL, but you have the flexibility to add a subdomain or subfolder to the domain displayed.  This is a great place to reiterate your offer, specify your store/office location, or show a call to action.Last but certainly not least are ad extensions.  Google recently started including ad extensions as part of your Quality Score, which makes them even more important for the success of your campaign. There are 5 main types of ad extensions that every business should set up:Below are examples of the extensions in Google’s search results:The more extensions that Google can use in the search results, the more real estate your ad will take up on the first page of Google. The bigger the ad, the more clicks you’ll tend to get.Of course, getting clicks on your ads is just the beginning of the process. Next, you have to convert the traffic into leads and sales with your landing page…At this point, you have optimized your ad targeting and your ad copy to get prospective customers to your site with cost-effective clicks. But all that work will be nothing if your landing page is not set up and optimized to convert this traffic into leads and sales. Important Note: Your website homepage should not be used as your landing page. This is because the typical homepage tends to be more general in terms of subject matter, often serving to introduce the business and its products/services. Each landing page needs to be tightly focused around the specific product/service and the offer promised in the ad.What if you have multiple ads and multiple offers based on the optimization steps above?You probably already know the answer, but you’re hoping it’s not true… Sorry, but that means you need to have multiple different landing pages that match those different ads and offers.With advertising, congruence is absolutely critical. When your prospect customer clicks on your ad, then she expects to find exactly what your ad promised front and center at the top of the page (not buried down the page).  To ensure congruence, you need to match the headline on your landing page with the offer in the ad. That way it’s 100% clear that the prospective customer is on the right page.  Remember, it’s easier to click the back button than it is to click around on a new site to find what you need.So what makes a good landing page? Here is a checklist you can use to evaluate each key area of your landing pages:  To see this in action, below is an example of an ad and the corresponding landing page that matches the copy in the ad.Once you’ve gone through the list above and incorporated each element, then it’s time to test. Start by testing different headlines to see which message gets the highest conversion rates. Also, test the landing page layout to try to include your call to action at the top of the page before the visitor needs to scroll.Remember, your campaign will likely need multiple landing pages and you’ll need to optimize each one separately.As you can tell at this point, there will always be new opportunities to test in each key area of your AdWords campaign. AdWords optimization is not a one time event!You need to make it a habit to continually test your targeting, your ad copy, and your landing pages if you want to maximize your return on investment.About the Author: Phil Frost is Co-Founder of Main Street ROI, an online marketing, training, and coaching company based in New York City.

You’ve drawn visitors to your website, networked like crazy, collected lots of business cards, and ramped up your social media presence. You’ve gathered data for leads, and you’ve converted leads into customers. But your customers cancel their accounts after a month or so. It’s just not for them. Or your competition is a smooth operator and has swiped your customers right out from under your nose! With fierce competition and customers that are prone to change their minds, you need every tool available to retain your customers. Most companies focus on using Salesforce for closing leads, which is great, but this conversion process costs money, and lots of it. Depending on your industry and which study you read, customer acquisition is 5-25 times more expensive than customer retention. That is why you want to hang on to the good customers you’ve got. And, if that isn’t impetus enough, research from Bain and Company has found that a 5% increase in customer retention has more than a 25% increase in profit. Read on to learn how Salesforce can help you retain customers.Gone are the days when the marketing and sales teams were working in data silos and were at each other’s throats at every opportunity. Suzie Blaszkiewicz, CRM Market Researcher from GetApp, says:An example of a streamlined integration might be as follows: your marketing team uses HubSpot Marketing Software, your sales team uses Salesforce, and your customer service team uses Zendesk. You can integrate HubSpot Marketing and Zendesk with Salesforce, creating a transparent data funnel through which your marketing, sales, and customer service teams can have a 360° view of every customer. This means transparency through the whole sales funnel, and it makes it easier for marketing, sales, and customer service to get on the same page. What does this mean for your customers? Improved customer service! Zendesk found that 52% of customers purchase more from a company after a positive customer service experience. The best way to make sure your customer service is top notch is to make sure your customer service team is as informed as possible about every customer by integrating your customer service platform with your central CRM. Obviously, a transparent system has more benefits that translate for the marketing and sales teams, too, and all this means you can be more effective in customer retention.In the course of your relationships with your customers, you’ve probably gathered a whole lot of data about them. If you’ve followed the above tip, you’ve integrated all this data into Salesforce. You can now take control of the customer relationship and use the data to do such things as personalize your emails so that they resonate with your customers. Why? Because customers want to feel special! Take a look at this email I received from Amazon:As you can see, they used my name, which is essential but pretty standard these days. You can also see that they used my search history from their website to come up with a few buying suggestions for me. I like to paint with watercolors, and Amazon knows this. In fact, Amazon has worked out that I like to use a particular brand based on my buying history. This is a great experience for me because, as a customer, I know that if I open an Amazon email, I will get offers and content tailored to what I am interested in. If Amazon had blasted me with an email of 10% off fishing rods, do you think I would have opened it? (Hint: I have no interest in fishing.) If you’re using Salesforce, you’ve collected a gold mine of customer data, including website activity and downloads, as you can see here:You can use this data to segment your customers and send them personalized emails via MailChimp. I chose MailChimp to be the primary email marketing app, rather than sending emails through Salesforce itself, because not only can you easily create beautiful templates, you can email up to 2,000 subscribers on their free plan, with affordable upgrades if you email more subscribers, whereas Salesforce Enterprise allows you to email only up to 500 subscribers. MailChimp has an app designed for Salesforce which allows you to manage MailChimp subscribers from Salesforce leads and contacts and upload MailChimp subscribers as Salesforce leads. You can also build segments in your MailChimp list, create MailChimp campaigns, and, thanks to the hourly sync between MailChimp and Salesforce, view MailChimp campaign activity and reports within your Salesforce account. It’s simple to integrate Salesforce with Mailchimp. Just follow the instructions in this article. You will then need to use MailChimp’s Query Builder to create groups to add your leads and contacts to. You can also create static segments, and MailChimp will automatically add or delete leads and contacts to the segment based on the query criteria.If you’re running an online store, you can connect it to your MailChimp account using eCommerce360. This app uses link tracking to monitor detailed customer purchases and website activity and passes this information back to MailChimp. You can then use the information to create highly targeted email campaigns. The first step is to turn on the eCommerce360 tracking by linking your online store to the eCommerce360 platform using an integration. MailChimp supports several integrations such as Shopify and Magento. They all have their own setup, so it’s best to click here to see for yourself how to set up your particular integration.Once you have set up the eCommerce360 platform, you’re ready to use the captured customer information to create an email segment.In this example, I’m going to segment my customers based on their purchase history. First, navigate to “Lists,” which is found at the top of the MailChimp toolbar.Then, click on the name of the list you want to segment. In this example, I have one list “PieSync testing.”Next, click on the “Segments” drop-down menu, and then click on the “Create A Segment” button at the bottom of the screen.Click on the first drop-down menu to show all the segment options. Alongside the standard MailChimp segment options, such as email and name a location, you should also see e-commerce options such as this:Because I want to target my most high-value customers, I have chosen to segment the list by the segment criterion “Spent (Average Per Order).”Next, click on the “Preview Segment” button at the bottom of the screen.Save the segment. Now you’re ready to create a campaign in MailChimp and send coupons or other e-goodies to this saved segment to reward them for being great customers!In your MailChimp dashboard, click on “Create Campaign.”Select “Send to a saved segment.”Set up the campaign name, email subject, and the “from” fields. I have also checked the box for “Personalize the ‘To’ field” in order to include the recipient’s name in the message. I have also enabled eCommerce360 link tracking so I can see my subscriber activity for this campaign.Also, I have checked the box for Salesforce tracking option (which will create a campaign within Salesforce and update campaign stats for 2 days after the campaign is sent) and enabled Salesforce “track member activity” (which will allow MailChimp to search for contacts in Salesforce via email, attach notes with campaign stats, and add the contacts to the campaign). Next, write the body of your email. You can design your own or use a template.Then send! The eCommerece360 app also generates reports based on your campaigns. This is a super handy tool for keeping track of how effective your campaigns are.Research from Aberdeen group shows that personalization improves customer retention by 8%! While according to a recently released report from Econsultancy (10th Annual Email Marketing Industry Census), only 22% of marketers named personalization as important, industry experts are predicting that hyper-personalization will become a reality. Omni-channel marketing is ushering in an era of communications that is more relevant in terms of the right person, the right content, the right time, and the right channel.With research finding a 15% increase in churn if you fail to respond to your customers via social channels, you have no choice but to be responsive on social media. Therefore, if your customers are asking you questions on Twitter, answer them on Twitter. You could use Twitter’s Advanced Search feature to keep track of these interactions, but that’s extra work you don’t want to get bogged down in. A good solution is to install the free app Salesforce for Twitter and Facebook to do the heavy lifting for you. This app collates all your Twitter and Facebook messages relevant to your business in one inbox, so you’ll never miss an important or timely message. You can also search based on keywords and schedule the feed to refresh every five minutes. You can respond to a message by selecting it and hitting the “reply” button. You can type in your reply or insert an automated response.You can see below how I jumped in on a conversation that was happening on Twitter. I found it by setting up filters for the keywords “PieSync” and “2 way sync.”You can also view customer social profiles within the Salesforce dashboard.This is super useful for adding a personal touch in conversations with your contacts. All you have to do is take a look at their social media profiles just before important meetings with them to see what they’re talking about or what their interests are. Do you have something in common? Great! Use this as a touchpoint to create rapport. The take home message is, if you care enough about your customer to interact with them in the way they feel most comfortable, you’re more likely to keep their business. According to the latest research from Accenture, 52% of consumers have switched providers (across all industries) due to poor customer service. In the US, the estimated total of lost revenue due to poor customer service is $1.6 trillion. Yes, you read that right, $1.6 trillion. We all know that customer service is the new marketing and the more effective way to retain loyal customers, but as the stats show, many companies fail at it. Matthew Mercuri, Director of Human Resources at Dupray Inc, told me that this happens for one reason:After-sales care doesn’t just mean checking in with your customer or sending them offers. You also have to find a way to deal effectively with customer complaints, because 55% of customers stop doing business with a company when their complaints are not responded to in a timely manner, and 72% of customers say that explaining their problem to multiple people negatively impacted on how they viewed the business. You can minimize this by integrating Salesforce with your customer service platform. Your customer service team will then have access to all customer information, helping them keep track of any outstanding customer issues and preventing issues from falling through the cracks. Service Cloud from Salesforce is an integrated customer service platform that allows customer service teams to easily get an overview of all customer interactions, including phone, email, social media channels, and connected devices. Your customer service team can then respond to your customers immediately, knowing their entire history, without leaving the platform. Implement a system like this, and you can turn complaints into glowing reviews.If your customer hasn’t been in touch for 6 months, whether to make a purchase or download a new e-book, chances are you’re losing that customer. You can track customer interaction in Salesforce by searching the date fields and sorting them by date of last contact. Better yet, automate this process so that it’s brought to your attention on a weekly or monthly basis. Then, check with your customers and extend them an offer based on their previous interactions. In Salesforce, it’s easy to run a report for customers whose last interaction was at least 6 months ago. First, click on “Reports,” and then click on “New Report.”Then, click on the folder “Accounts & Contacts.” Next, click on “Contacts & Accounts,” and then click on “Create.”Make sure the Date Field is on “Last Activity.” Then, change the date range so that there is no date in the “From” field, and the date in the “To” field is 6 months ago. Then, click on “Run report.” Voila! You have a whole bunch of warm leads for your sales team.Here is a huge opportunity that is often missed – inactive subscribers in your email lists. Marketing companies often advise you to prune these inactive subscribers because they aren’t engaging and are therefore detrimental to open and click rates. However, recent research by MailChimp has found that inactive subscribers are 26% more likely to make a follow-up purchase than non-subscribers. On top of that, an inactive subscriber is worth 32% of a subscriber. That’s some serious revenue, so it’s a serious mistake not to pursue it. It’s well known that email lists degrade every year, so you’re probably looking at a huge segment to email. Unfortunately, if you have a Salesforce Enterprise account, you can send only 500 mass emails at one time. Obviously, if you want to send more, you’ll need an integration. Aside from your marketing software, you can also use an email marketing tool, such as MailChimp, and integrate that with Salesforce. In MailChimp, you can segment your inactive subscribers and then send them re-engagement emails such as offers, discounts, or competitions. Here’s a nifty MailChimp article on how you can identify inactive subscribers. Not sure what to send them? Check out this fantastic collection of customer retention emails at Really Good Emails. My favorite is this one from Teespring. Who can resist a sad puppy?After you acquire a customer, it’s tempting to bombard them with even more great offers and try to upsell them. Don’t do it! Customer retention expert Peter Lavers of WCL Customer Management advises that you should only thank them for their business and offer them tokens of appreciation. This is the best way to build trust, and trust is integral to building a long-term business relationship. “The best time to turn a customer into a brand advocate is in the first 100 days after they first buy your product, because they’ve got something exciting to tell,” says Lavers.You can show appreciation by sending physical gifts, like cards or gourmet food, and it doesn’t have to take up hours of your time. Instead, you can use a Salesforce integration like ZenDirect for all your direct marketing campaigns. With ZenDirect, you can send your newly acquired customers gifts, such as personalized postcards, greeting cards, and even a big box of chocolate brownies. With this integration, you’ll be impressing new customers with your company swag in no time.Customer retention is the most cost-effective way to impact your revenue. But, with so much competition, there’s no need for customers to stick with you if something better comes along. Savvy marketers know how to harness the power of data to personalize customer experiences, add value, and truly listen to customer needs. Just keep in mind that it’s the small, personal touches that can make or break a long-lasting relationship.About the Author: Vanessa Rombaut is the Digital Communications Marketer at PieSync. @PieSync helps you sync your customer data bi-directionally between your favorite cloud apps and your CRM.",
,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/buyer-persona-map/,How to Create a Buyer Persona Map,"Buyer personas. Creating potential customer profiles is often enough to make even the best marketer freeze in their tracks – and realize how little they really know about their prospects.If this sounds like you, don’t worry. And even if you’ve never created a buyer persona in your life, today’s article will help make sense of the process by giving you a sort of “map” to follow.  Let’s take a closer look.The very first step in your map is going to be the core information about your customer. Things like:You can likely get that much from the data stored in your CRM.I’d also recommend “humanizing” the persona with a name and image. Doing so tends to bring out more of our emotional, empathetic side rather than looking at the potential customer as a number to slot somewhere into a sales funnel like a puzzle piece.For our example here, we’ve chosen to work with “Lucy”, a marketing director in her late 40s. Her job primarily entails lead generation, sales management, and gathering competitive intelligence. She organizes and prioritizes campaigns. She’s a pro at gathering competitive intelligence and using it wisely to help reinforce the brand and cement customer loyalty in a very competitive marketplace.Because of the huge growth in social media, Lucy’s looking for a way to streamline the interaction process on social media without losing the “personability” of the brand. She’s in the market for a system/solution and wants to make a confident decision quickly.So with this in mind, our persona map is going to look something like this so far:Now, to liken this back to a map concept, we’ve got our starting point. Next, it’s time to look at the journey.Our first stop along the map is the buyer’s needs. She has the basic research to know what’s out there. If we were looking at this from a traditional sales funnel point of view, she’s at the “comparison shopping” stage.  She’ll be looking to make a decision soon.Buyers are eager to tell you what they need. All you have to do is ask. Basic lead follow-up and nurturing questions can reveal quite a bit. Simple polls and surveys can often reveal a great deal about where the buyer actually is in the process (and whether they have an urgent need for your product or service versus basic curiosity). Even if we don’t know specifically what they need, we can make some blanket statements to apply them to our persona. What would someone in this job typically need from our solution?For starters, the buyer likely needs the product to be well documented. She’ll be managing dozens, perhaps hundreds of staff members – some of whom (based on age) may be more technically savvy than she is. Some of the staff may pick it up quickly, others may need more time.  We’ll add the needs and the persona’s place in the decision-making process (one persona can have multiple roles in the decision process — they can be a user and initiator, for example)There’s also the fact that whatever solution needs to be adaptive and flexible to accommodate existing platforms and tools. The company itself likely has certain procedures and requirements of its own that need to be added to the mix, like cloud-based access and certain security protocols. These kinds of factors can influence and even conflict with what the primary buyer wants. Never mind that decisions like these are often made by committee, which lengthens the time needed and the requested features.Like all maps, there are roadblocks that are likely preventing your customer from taking action.  There are constraints and concerns, frustrations and issues that affect their decision.  You can brainstorm these obstacles and add them to the map to ensure that sales knows how to address the most common objections before they become major pain points.You also have to decide where this buyer falls on the scale of decision-making. Will they be using the product? Influencing the decision-maker? Initiating contact with the company? A mix of all of these? Make a note of these objections and the buyer persona’s place in the decision-making cycle on your map.Following our example, we end up with something like this:Here, we’ve managed to discover (and brainstorm) the buyer’s potential:All the kinds of sales-propelling information needed to acknowledge objections, concerns and frustrations while concentrating on needs, requirements and urgency.  We’ve not only learned core demographics about our buyer, but key information that may be preventing them from action, or details that could move a sale into the next stage.Our buyer persona map is less of a neatly-organized, bulleted list and more like a mind-map that’s always being added to and revised.  It may not be as tidy, but our map is more authentic, and closer to the actual customer experience.Think about the last time your company made a major purchase. It’s seldom a “beginning to end” one-time shot, isn’t it? There’s lots of details to hammer out, lots of presentations to sit through, lots of suggestions and sign-offs to gather. It’s a big process and a fancy list of bullets just doesn’t cut it anymore – not in today’s two-way communication world.It might seem counter-intuitive to go through this entire process with every type of buyer your company encounters. After all, you’ve likely got a lot more than just one type of customer. And if you’re in retail, you’ve got suppliers, wholesalers, resellers, and a whole avalanche of personas out there.  Don’t panic, prioritize. Focus on your best customers and find the unifying threads that tie them together, and then build on that persona.And remember that buyers are multi-faceted human beings. Sometimes they make decisions that go against the grain of even the best, most well-developed persona. It happens. But here, it pays to remember that the journey is just as important as the destination, and the easier you make that journey, the more receptive the buyer will be to taking the action you want them to take.About the Author: Sherice Jacob helps business owners improve website design and increase conversion rates through compelling copywriting, user-friendly design and smart analytics analysis.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/email-segmentation-sustains-customer-loyalty/,How Email Segmentation Sustains Customer Loyalty,"Research shows that segmented email campaigns possess a 14.25% higher open rate compared to non-segmented campaigns.Targeted messages grab people’s attention. And SaaS teams must direct that attention to converting buyers into loyal customers.“While enticing new customers is important, no marketing channel can boost loyalty the way that email can. Since people typically sign up for email to be notified about promotions you can use that information to increase sales,” says David Marinaccio, email marketing manager at Active Web Group.Segmentation is an effective method to deliver the right message to the right person. It helps personalize the shopping experience to increase sales.Let’s explore how your next email campaign can retain more customer relationships.Customer loyalty is how your business will continue to grow. Satisfied consumers enjoy purchasing your products, like telling their friends about your brand, and don’t mind sending a promotional tweet. And when necessary, loyal customers will even defend your brand name during a PR mishap.To achieve customer loyalty, your SaaS needs to offer unprecedented value to your buyers. You’re not selling a product; instead, your team is providing an experience.“Customer loyalty is built upon consistently positive, high-value experiences with a brand, often exceeding customer expectations. Loyalty goes beyond satisfying needs or wants. It’s an emotional connection to a brand that customers love and will happily return for,” writes Donna Peeples, Founder and Chief Engagement Officer of Motivated, Inc.In the graphic below, you’ll discover a few effective strategies to improve your customer loyalty. One of my favorites is creating a WOW factor in customer engagements. It’s vital to give people something they weren’t expecting. Then, you exceed their expectations.Convince and Convert reports that “44% of email recipients made at least one purchase in the last 12 months based on a promotional email.” Use email to build a loyal consumer base and boost sales.Email is an intimate channel where your company can talk directly to the buyer. That’s why it’s important to ensure that your marketing messages resonate with the individual.Research says that “41% of people said they purchase more from retailers that send personalized emails based on past browsing and buying behavior.”Your customers don’t like receiving mass emails. They want information catered to their needs. There is value in customer loyalty. Look toward email as a way to build that loyalty.Segmentation is “the process of dividing your customers up into different groups who share a number of similar characteristics.”And loyalty segmentation is how you group customers based on their interaction and engagement with your content. It’s about going beyond demographics and locations.Use segmentation to support personalized email campaigns. The goal is to target your buyer’s behavior and interests.A study reported that “mailings targeted to loyalty program members outperformed overall bulk mailings, with open rates 40% higher, click rates 22% higher and transaction rates 29% higher.”Pat Flynn, podcast host of Smart Passive Income, suggests discovering the different content types within your audience:“In the health and fitness industry, for example, there are people who are interested primarily in losing weight, and there are others who are more interested in strength training. Within strength training, there are those who are interested in looking beefed up, while there are others who are in it to look lean.”Learning your buyer’s likes and habits is mandatory. It will allow your team to deliver messages that matter to the customer. Therefore, saving your company both time and money. Below is an example from MyBinding. This business offers different promotional incentives based on the customer’s purchase history. Churning customers receive a larger discount (15%) to lure them back into the purchase cycle. Since the best customers are more likely to purchase again, they receive a slightly smaller incentive, 10%.What segmentation mix works well for your SaaS? Find out how you can bring more value to a specific audience.Your SaaS might be missing opportunities to build customer loyalty. It’s because you are not sending triggered emails to your segmented groups.Triggered emails are automated messages sent in response to your customer’s actions. And while you’re probably using them to send welcome emails, research shows that triggered emails are underused. MarketingSherpa revealed that “only 24% use them for date-activated trigger messages (such as renewal dates or birthdays), and only 18% use them to acknowledge website behaviors.”Start reviewing your email data. Gain a better understanding of how your team can benefit from triggered emails.Derek Buntin at Adonis Media, says, “Use email analytics to determine which customers are opening emails but not making a purchase. Then, send these users follow-up emails with the incentive.”Priceline tailors emails to consumers’ on-site behaviors. For instance, when consumers book a trip, the brand will send an email welcoming them home after their vacation is over. And the email includes a discount toward their next trip.With a loyalty-targeted focus, your team can send customers triggered emails about redemption reminders, requests for feedback, and invitations to VIP programs.“Loyalty-focused campaigns can span the entire customer life cycle, from the initial entry to program renewal notifications and reminder messages. They also tend to perform better than standard promotional mailings in terms of customer response and revenue,” says John Fetto, a senior B2B marketing manager.Email marketing doesn’t mean sending anything and everything to buyers. You’re striving for retention. So, develop email campaigns with the power of triggered messages.Because all consumers aren’t created equal, customization is essential.And customers are willing to help build personalized experiences. However, they want something in return.Loyalty360 “noted that 67 percent of U.S. adults would be willing to give companies access to basic personal information in exchange for better service or products.”It’s doesn’t matter how great the relationships are if your products don’t deliver. Always be mindful of how you can improve your platform, features, and customer service.Be open and honest with consumers. Transparency helps your organization build sustainable relationships.“We are fighting against years of people feeling like companies are somehow screwing them over with hidden pricing and confusing return policies. The only way to establish trust and loyalty is to show your cards,” writes Mikkel Svane, founder and CEO of Zendesk.Focus on a long-term strategy by testing and experimenting. Measure your results and derive new insights from your findings. You may find out that everyone isn’t on the same page. But that’s fine. Just make the necessary adjustments.“…[E]mail marketing’s biggest challenge: the fact that there is a lot of competition for the same eyeballs. Personalization of your email messages will help your company stand out and generate more attention, higher levels of online engagement and lead to more in-store sales,” says Melanie Franke, Content Marketing Specialist at G/O Digital.Don’t settle for generic or dishonest messaging. Your customers deserve better.Customer loyalty strengthens your brand. With the power of email segmentation, SaaS teams are able to create personalized experiences.Loyalty can lead to increases in brand awareness and sales. Segmenting includes differentiating customers by interests and behaviors. And a powerful email campaign strategy is grounded in data-driven triggered emails.Segment to sustain customer loyalty.About the Author: Shayla Price lives at the intersection of digital marketing, technology and social responsibility.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/seo-only-as-dead-as-jon-snow/,"You Know Nothing, SEOs: Search Engine Optimization is (only) as Dead as Jon Snow","Editor’s Note: The following contains spoilers for Game of Thrones.This Sunday, the world will return to its proper axis as you and me and everyone we know sits back with a flask of grog and a huge roasted turkey leg to “enjoy” the newest season of blood-soaked HBO juggernaut Game of Thrones. Of course, there’s one question on everyone’s mind: Is America’s Sweetheart and Pantene Pro-V Spokesmodel Jon Snow really dead? Like, really really dead?But as I (who am not everyone, but in fact an e-commerce nerd) watched (and re-watched, and re-watched) last season’s finale, I had an additional question: Is SEO really dead for online retailers? Well, I’ve thought about it. And I have to say that Yes, Virginia, SEO is dead (the following said in my craftiest voice)…but only as dead as Jon Snow.  Look, we knew it was hard out here in the WWW (World Wide Westeros). The vicious competition. The cruel indifference of the showrunners Google Gods. The huge amounts of nudity. But did SEO really deserve this?Um, yeah, it kind of did. The dream of search engines has always been to devise the one true king a genuine algorithm that ranked sites and pages in the most honest, transparent, and relevant way. Each and every day the Lannisters Larry and Sergey’s team are paying their debts to internet culture by refining their process. No longer the world of 3% keyword density over 20,000 words of meaningless content, no longer the world of metadata stuffers and link spammers. As a lead SEO likes to remind me, the old basics may get you a seat at the table, but it doesn’t mean you get to eat. And that’s a good thing. It may seem like the way forward for smaller retailers and scrappy start-ups is darker than a Winterfell midnight. It may seem like chaos is a pit…but it’s actually a ladder. The old SEO might be dead, but that doesn’t mean the story is over. SEO just needs to, um, transition. And for that to happen, you’re going to need a little magic guidance.Ok, you know what? Let’s drop the snarky strikethroughs. It’s time to do some serious GoT metaphorin’. You’re gonna have to graduate from a red Wildling……to a Red Priestess. Only then can SEO come back from the dead.In the new world of SEO, the world is not flat. Every online retailer fiefdom is going to have to fight and claw for rank on practically equal terms with big box heavy hitters. And those guys have the resources, the staff, and the brand recognition most online shops can only dream about. They’re the White Walkers. And to take them on, much less take them down, you’re going to need to know what you’re doing. There’s no easy road to the Iron Throne; you can’t Littlefinger your way there by manipulating search engines, you can’t Renly Baratheon your way there by relying solely on social connections (social media), and you definitely can’t Robb Stark your way there by shunning good advice and going it alone.Any expert (the Red Priestess in this increasingly insane metaphor) worth their salt is going to tell you the truth: Bringing SEO back from the dead is going to be hard. Because you can no longer game the throne, you’re going to actually have to win it, fair and square. Today there are four key pillars to modern SEO strategy.The first pillar requires that you get yourself a Red Priestess, stat. That’s Expertise, and you can learn it on your own, Samwell Tarly-style, through years of dedicated study with the Maesters, or you can buy it, Stannis Baratheon-style (R.I.P. Stanny). Watch out for suspicious black smoke. The second pillar is Unity. SEO, like the Seven Kingdoms, is diverse. But if you want to come back from the dead and beat the White Walkers, you have to unite each kingdom in a common, communicative, and coordinated purpose.As I see it, these kingdoms include links (and referral traffic), social signals, content, communities, site architecture, and your brand voice.Now, listen. Lean in close. Because right now I’m going to tell you the secret to modern SEO:It has to be better than everyone else’s. It’s that simple. You simply cannot cheat your way to quality anymore. Like Varys, the search engines have spies and little birds throughout the World Wide Westeros; the only way you’re going to resurrect our fallen hero is by building frictionless architecture, then actually sitting down and writing/posting/building/linking something worth reading, worth sharing, and worth remembering. In other words, come correct or don’t come at all. The third pillar is Trust. I know what you’re thinking: GTFO. But first of all, keep it clean. Second of all, no, this is about GoT.Trust can’t be measured, you say. Trust can’t be quantified. Trust can’t be earned until you’ve killed one of your friends to prove you’re no crow, broken your vows of celibacy, and refuse official legitimization as the Lord of Winterfell. You’d be right if we were talking about the old Jon SEO. But we’re talking about the new and improved version.Industry leaders like Moz are finding ways to define and measure trust in the same ways that search engines do. Just like in the storm of swords and feast for crows (book readers shout OUT) that is Westeros, you’re only taken seriously when serious people/sites vouch for you. A link from momandpopsfakefurnitureblog.com isn’t going to give you anywhere near the juice of a .gov or .edu domain, nor of a major online publisher, aggregator, media outlet, competitor, or industry leader. I mean, when a sellsword like Bronn vouches for you, that’s cool. But it’s just not the same as getting dap from the Oathkeeper herself, Brienne of Tarth. Okay, I’m pretty sure I mentioned a fourth pillar. But right now it’s escaping me…Is there something really essential and badass in this story that I haven’t mentioned yet?I can’t believe we almost got through an entire article about GoT without mentioning the one, the only, the Mother Pillar of Dragons. You don’t think she’s going to have something to say when old Jonny Boy makes his triumphant return to the world of the living? You don’t think those dragons are gonna have something to say about that giant wall of ice in the north and the giant wall of frozen undead a-holes beyond it? You don’t think (SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO THINK I’M CLAIRVOYANT) that Jon and Daenerys are secretly half brother and sister? What!?Are the big box White Walkers knocking on the door? You need a dragon.
Are you getting attention but no conversion? You need a dragon.
Do you want social signals to translate to sales? You need a dragon. In the world of online retail, dragons are unique value propositions, qualities, or strategies that separate you from the competition. They’re the oil in the machine, the grease on the wheels. They’re your company’s special sauce. For Zappos, it’s their legendary customer service. For Dollar Shave Club it’s their unique and super-viral ads. For Amazon it’s two-day shipping with Prime. Your dragon is the first valuable thing that someone says or remembers about your company; the thing that sticks in their minds and separates you from the chaff. The first three pillars of modern SEO strategy will get you all the way to the gates of King’s Landing. But if you want a shot at the Iron Throne, you’ll have to set yourself apart. You’ll have to have that one thing that nobody else has; the thing that makes you special. The thing that makes you fit to rule. And that’s the one thing that no e-commerce pro can give you. You’re going to have to give birth to the dragon on your own in a complicated blood magic ritual involving a funeral pyre, some petrified eggs, a bottle of peroxide blonde hair dye, and, yeah, some nudity (read the contract!). So this Sunday, as friends and family huddle around the fire screen to see the future of our hero, ask yourself this question:What’s your dragon?About the Author: Andrew Scarbrough, Scion of Braavos and First of his Name, is the Co-Founder & COO of Delegator and PriceWaiter.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/small-data-marketing/,"How ""Small Data"" Is Changing the Way We Market to Customers","One of the biggest concerns in this new age of on-demand, customer-centered experiences is the cloud of Big Data to sift through. We know precisely how to collect it, but no one has yet really figured out how to act on it, much less decide what to act on.But one enterprising marketer believes we’re going about it all wrong – and when it comes to learning about our customers – small is the new big. Here’s how his advice is turning everything we think we know about marketing on its head – and causing even big corporations to sit up and take notice.Meet Martin Lindstrom, author of Small Data: The Tiny Clues that Uncover Huge Trends. Martin was asked to build a branding strategy for Lego in 2004. Of course, we all know and love the Lego brand today – but it wasn’t always this way.Right about the early 1980s, Lego started to decline. Newer, more interactive toys, including Nintendo and related video games were taking a serious bite out of more inventive, creative products. As games became more sophisticated well into the 1990s, Lego continued to fall further and further behind. Lego’s reaction to this kind of brand encroachment was to do what every sensible retailer at the time was doing – diversify.Lego branched out into many different pursuits, including theme parks, clothing, movie tie-ins, and even video games of their own.As time went on and the earliest millennials hit their teens and early 20s, Lego commissioned a series of studies. Digital Natives, those of us that were born from 1980 onward and grew up during the onset of the Internet, were fidgety, Lego management reasoned, and needed something to occupy their attention at all times.Lego’s own research into their Big Data showed that the news was bleak. Every generation after millennials would find creativity frustrating instead of liberating. They weren’t up for the challenge. Lego needed bigger blocks instead of smaller, more detailed ones. Every study showed the same thing. Millennials needed instant gratification.So Lego did what the data told them. They made bigger blocks. Sales continued to slip. Enter Lindstrom and his small data mindset.In one of their many customer research forays, the Lego team visited the home of a young German boy. He enjoyed Legos but was also a prolific skateboarder. When asked about his most prized possession, the boy introduced a pair of worn sneakers. Countless skateboarding sessions had worn the shoes down to the perfect fit – and anyone else in the city that happened to be a skateboarder could see that this boy, a Digital Native himself, had poured long hours of time into mastering the board.That’s when Lego realized that millennials and even younger generations weren’t the fidgety, ADD-riddled, socially-obsessed, instantly-gratified clique that other generations so mockingly labeled us as. We’d invest as much time and effort we could into creating something worth sharing with others – something worth bragging about.And to this boy, his shoes were a social currency – a symbol of “street cred” that showed devotion to his craft.Lego didn’t just revert back to what made them great. Thanks to Lindstrom’s small data expertise, they built on it (no pun intended!). They made smaller blocks, more intricate pieces and more challenging sets. Today, with sales of over 2 billion dollars, Lego has surpassed Mattel to become the world’s largest toy maker.And it all happened because they chose to focus on the small data instead of the reams and reams of Big Data pointing to the very opposite.And it’s not just toys that benefit from this small data focus. Lindstrom has taken his ideas and put them to work for every product from Roombas to refrigerator magnets. Finding the small, seemingly insignificant things and turning them into pivotal brand shifts that customers love.So how does he do it? Lindstrom likes to quote, “If you want to see how an animal lives, don’t go to the zoo, go to a jungle.” He calls this process “subtexting” – a detailed process that involves gathering information both online and offline, watching for clues and visiting consumers in their own homes to see how they interact with the product. More often than not, there’s always a moment where he uncovers some base desire – something that the company or its developers have overlooked or simply ignored, that creates the base for the brand’s new image or even a new brand entirely.Lindstrom even goes so far to (with the family’s permission) spend time in their homes, comb through their refrigerators and wastepaper baskets and sift through their garbage. While I’m not advocating that you go dumpster diving in your clients’ places of business, it just goes to show how microscopically small and focused “small data” can be. Was the revelation from the eleven year old Lego fan about his shoe a lucky break for the company?Lindstrom and many other small data proponents don’t think so.And oftentimes, the issue that small data uncovers isn’t even about the product itself or what it does and doesn’t do. Like with Roomba, the little disc-shaped floor vacuum created by iRobot.Small data reported that people owned Roombas not purely for their practical value, but what they communicate to others – quirky, fun, creative.Human beings all instinctively want to be viewed as more than the things they do. So much of our time is spent at work, that we strive to not become so attached to what we do that it becomes an extension of us. For example, I do a lot of work with conversion optimization and copywriting, but I also love to travel and am learning the guitar. Walk into my house, and you’ll see neat sculptures, pottery and other neat cultural pieces from places I’ve been. I’ll share some neat stories with you if you happen to ask about them – and I hope you will.Lindstrom calls this “Breaking the Frame” and the Roomba is a prime example of it. As it turned out, people didn’t just own the Roomba because of its ability to clean floors in a smarter, automated way. They owned it because it made an emotional statement about them – that they were fun, quirky, even “cute” (words consumers used to describe the machine itself). They’d even go so far as to put it in a more conspicuous place so that visitors could see and comment on it.It seems so small and insignificant but small data is really little pieces of us – pieces that we might not readily share online but still want to be seen. Although no one is advocating stalking your customers for the sake of unearthing their odd habits with regard to your brand, it does beg the question, “what is small data revealing about our target markets that large data is ignoring?”What are your thoughts? Is small data the next big thing? Have you seen instances where small data has picked up on a trend that big data overlooked?

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/choosing-the-right-mobile-channel/,Secrets For Choosing the Right Mobile Messaging Channel,"Have you ever deleted an app from your device because it sent you too many push notifications? Or wondered why your latest flight info is popping up as a text message, rather than in your digital wallet? Bad messaging channel choices, that’s why. Mobile devices offer you a huge number of different ways to connect with your users and customers. Each channel is best suited to convey different types of messages. Pick the right one for what you want to say!Even without an app, you have a few options for getting messages to your users on their mobile devices.The original mobile channel. SMS and MMS can reach anyone who’s given you their number, and your messages arrive right away. You’re limited in how nice you can make your message look, and text messages aren’t very interactive. But all you need is a phone number to get started.Text is best used for simple, urgent messages, particularly transactional ones, like flight status updates. (But only if you don’t have an app!) They’re often used for discounts and another infrequent announcements as well, but you’ll have much more success with messages sent through an installed app.Marketers often don’t think of their website or web app as a communication channel. But it is. It’s just passive; mostly, you have to wait for your users to come to you. This makes it difficult to provide timely updates, and you lose a lot of context, like your visitor’s exact location. But you can closely track what your user is doing, and let them immediately take many different types of actions.Your website is best used for messages that aren’t urgent, and that are meant to be acted on when your user is on your site. For example, a month-long sale is useful to promote through your site, since many of your regular visitors will see it, and you can link them right to sale items. Shipping notifications are much less useful to send through your site, since your user won’t see them right away. As another example, it’s hard to re-engage dormant users on your site, but it’s a great channel for acquiring new ones.Apple and Google are constantly adding features to digital wallet passes. It’s appropriate to think of the digital wallet as a lightweight version of an app. Passes are easy to distribute, easy for a user to add, and can have some branding that helps users recognize and remember you. They can pop up at certain locations where they’re most useful, for example, near your store. And they can be updated with new information as needed.Use a digital wallet pass any time you would otherwise hand your user a piece of paper or plastic. Tickets, loyalty cards, payment cards, and coupons are all great uses for digital wallet passes. Specific messages about product updates, promotions, and transactional communications are not as good a fit.If you have an app, your options broaden considerably.Everyone’s received a push notification. If you get a user to install your app, you can send one at any time; your user doesn’t even have to be in the app to see it. They’re easy to brand, and you can even specify actions for the user to take with a single tap.Push notifications are great for delivering small amounts of real-time information (like sports scores, notifications, and news), and also for getting a user to take an action, such as learning about a special promotion. However, they only reach people who have opted-in, which is usually less than half of your users. They’re also high stakes; users will notice immediately if you send irrelevant content, and they’ll turn off push access off for your app, or even uninstall it.In-app messages are similar to push notifications, but they’re delivered to your users while they’re active in your app. You can put real-time updates in them, and, unlike push notifications, they don’t require opt-in in order to be received. In-app messages are great complements to push notifications for users who haven’t opted in, and can be used to send similar, highly-targeted messages, such as real-time information that’s relevant within the context of your app.This is a completely passive channel inside your app. The message center archives messages that have been sent to your users in the past, and makes them accessible later. This is a great channel for storing things that don’t require immediate action and that might be most useful when a user is already in your app.No matter what channel you use, your user’s attention is a precious resource, and you have to make sure that what you’re sending is valuable to them. Answer these questions before you use any of these channels:What action do you want the user to take when they receive it? Figuring this out will make it easier to decide on whether you need a channel with interactivity; it will also help you figure out how truly urgent your message actually is, and how to measure its success. Is there a call to action, or is this purely for brand awareness? Mobile messaging is all about context: time, location, user preferences. Deciding what context is truly important will help you pick the right channel. For example, if something matters in real-time, you’ll want to use push. If it matters when the user gets to it, you could try an in-app message.Worry about whether what you’re sending is useful. If you’re Twitter, it might be OK to send 20 push notifications a day, if your user wants to keep a close eye on their followers. If you’re Candy Crush, maybe you shouldn’t even send one push notification a week, because your user is a casual gamer who doesn’t care about new features. If you focus on delivering what your user wants, you’ll have to worry a lot less about everything else.As a mobile marketer, you’ve got lots of channels to choose from. We haven’t even touched on emerging channels, like chatbots and wearables, which will play an increasingly large role in delivering useful content to your users. The key with any channel is to match the characteristics of the message to the medium. And don’t forget to listen to your users, too — if you pay attention to their responses and preferences, they’ll tell you how and what they want delivered.About the Author: Justin Dunham is Lead, Marketing Technology and Analytics at Urban Airship, the leading mobile engagement platform.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/marketing-stack-needs-a-foundation/,Why Your Sales and Marketing Stack Needs a Solid Foundation,"Imagine the best pancakes you’ve ever had. What made them work? They likely started with a solid recipe of core ingredients, then added just the right blend of proprietary variations to make an unforgettable short stack. But it all started from a solid foundation – flour, eggs, whole milk, baking powder, salt, cooking fat, and sugar. Your marketing and sales stack is no different. The foundation will make it or break it. Luckily, the ingredient list isn’t nearly as long as the pancake mix.  What are the core ingredients that make up a solid sales and marketing foundation? It starts with a strategy focused on the customer and your content, and the right tool to whip it all together.The right recipe will help ensure you deliver the right message to the right person at the right point. An effective sales and marketing strategy starts with the customer and content at its core, and is further refined by understanding the journey that customer makes. Glossing over this part often results in half-baked strategies that fall flat. It’s critical to understand what the buyer’s journey looks like – the stages of awareness, consideration and decision, and the transitions in between. Each phase or stage will be specific to your buyer, which means getting to know your buyer is imperative.Enter: The buyer persona. These are detailed accounts of your target customer. They go well beyond basic demographics like age, gender, and occupation. A good buyer persona will detail what their motives and priorities are, how they determine success, what their perceived or actual barriers are, where they search for solutions, and who impacts their decisions. While surveys and reviewing analytics from online behaviors can provide some level of insights, one-to-one interviews are the best way to gather in depth details. You can conduct phone interviews or in-person visits with existing customers, or use industry events and trade shows as opportunities to talk to prospects, current customers and even the customers of your competitors. You’re looking for answers to questions such as:With this level of detail, you are better equipped to understand and interpret their actions, and the questions they might ask within each stage on their path to purchase. At this point, the recipe will start to come together as you determine how to align your sales and marketing strategies to harmonize with the buyer’s journey and be there with the relevant content they need to answer their questions or solve their problems.Understanding the framework – the customer, their journey and the desired outcome of the content you produce – you will be able to identify what parts of the recipe can be changed as goals change or you learn more about buyer preferences. These three ingredients – the customer, their journey, and the content – will be staples, but how that content is delivered or the type being created can be substituted. In-depth buyer personas and a map of the customer journey is almost like cheating the system. Marketing and sales teams armed with these are better equipped to make a calculated, winning recipe – serving up the right stack (authentic content), at just the right time and in the right place.Now that you’ve got a solid foundational recipe in place, there’s one final element – a solid platform to serve it from. Today, there’s a near endless supply of sales and marketing tools to support with everything from automation to customer relationship management and sales enablement, but even the best stack of tools can become unstable without the right foundational platform.How do you identify the right platform from which to build the recipe? First and foremost, it should support you in building a solid foundation. In other words, it should enable visibility into your customers, the purchase journey they go through, and the delivery of your content at the right place and time. Internal portals, analytics and collaboration amongst the various players on your team is also essential. Try to avoid a cobbled together “Frankenstack” of sales and marketing tools. This creates silos within your team and makes for an unstable strategy that lacks cohesion. Instead look for a primary platform to serve as the hub. It should play nice with a variety of tools – everything should work in concert. Before you commit to a platform, consider the following:If you are working with an indirect sales channel, that platform should also support them with the training, marketing and sales tools they need to do their job and nurture their customers.  Before you start throwing together sales and marketing recipes, be sure to understand the role of each of those core ingredients and how they can be used to direct all recipes that follow. This will enable you to create far more effective strategies rather than hoping something will work.  The customer and customer journey, and content that originates from those two ingredients, produces a winning recipe and helps ensure your efforts won’t be lost in a sea of marketing messages.About the Author: Jen Spencer is the Director of Sales and Marketing for Allbound, an innovative SaaS platform that helps companies empower their resellers and distributors to be more customer-focused through content and collaboration.

Because whether you’re in-house or you are working at an agency, the PPC and SEO teams struggle to communicate with each other. They operate isolated from each other, unable to properly leverage their most important assest: first party data.We are going to dive into actionable ways you can correctly utilize data from both SEO and PPC  to ultimately increase your conversion rate and decrease your cost per acquisition.We will touch on the following three techniques for practical takeaways on how to integrate your search channels:In the end we are going to wrap all of these tactics together and provide a gameplan for cross-channel success.Google is an ad engine. They are not a search engine operating without a financial objective. As Google evolves, they are constantly taking more SERP real estate.As Google daily takes more room above the fold, they also have restricted the availability of free keyword data. While there are plenty of tools that allow for keyword tracking (Moz, SEMrush, Advanced Web Ranking, etc.), none of these tell you the most important piece of data: Which keywords are converting…In order to obtain this data, we have to pay. Pay Google via AdWords to be exact. By having access to Google’s keyword data, we can prioritize our SEO efforts correctly. For example, imagine you are an online retailer selling men’s shorts. How would you traditionally choose your keywords? You might analyze search trends, scope out the competition that is currently ranking and analyze how well they are answering the searchers intent. You may even just look at the search volume and go for it. Unfortunately, these approaches leave you operating in the dark without the ability to quickly understand what keywords convert best historically for your own target market.By beginning with paid search and then integrating the data into our SEO efforts, we are able to align search volume, rankability, and other traditional SEO metrics with the keyword conversion data from our PPC efforts. We can then correctly prioritize our content marketing and on-page SEO.Unfortunately, as search engine marketing has grown into a science, departments have become isolated and more specialized. General practitioners knowing both SEO and PPC are a rarity. Instead, search professionals are focusing on a specialty: technical SEO, local SEO, international SEO, AdWords display, remarketing, Google Shopping, local PPC, etc.As things become hyper specialized and fragmented, the data is lost in communication and SEO departments optimize in the dark relying on frustratingly futile metrics like keyword rankings, page views, overall organic conversions, and time on-site.When marketing struggles like this arise, the silver lining is that tight knit teams and agencies are able to leverage the data from both the organic and paid search channels for collaborative success.There is no universal magic wand for search success. Instead, best practices exist. Below are best industry practices on how to integrate your paid and organic traffic for multichannel success.Google search ads are expensive. For some industries (plumbers, lawyers, etc.) cost per clicks (CPC) can exceed $100. It is difficult for most businesses to justify this high of an advertising expense on even one visitor let alone a lead. Instead, these businesses will often focus their efforts solely on SEO.As they do so, they begin to build models of varying certainty that particular keywords are what generate their revenue. Thus, when launching a new PPC campaign and there is significant organic traction it is essential to audit not only competitors and CPCs, but also, the Google Search Console report. Here is a practical step-by-step process for launching a campaign for an account with organic rankings. Lastly, if you are using a keyword ranking tool then simply mine your top keywords driving the largest percentage of qualified traffic and take additional market share with search ads: build, launch, test, measure.   As search marketers, it is our responsibility to interject ourselves into our target market’s online buying journey. Specifically, we need to strategically position our business within SERPs at all stages of the search funnel from ideation to retention. When our target market searches for what we offer or sell online, they need to find us within the search engine results page (SERP). This can mean that we are advertising on sites that rank for our keywords meaning we show up via AdWords, in the local pack and Google Shopping, etc. The possibilities are endless, but we need to strategically execute.One essential way search is not integrated enough is content marketing and PPC. These two services are treated far too often as distant planets operating in their own solar systems.It’s time to end that. No longer shall these services/departments operate in their own silo. Instead, there needs to be a practical intersection of the two services. But first, a basic understanding of both areas of expertise is needed.In the example below, you will find shopping ads, search ads, and a highly relevant piece of content. Imagine if the PPC team and the content team were on the same page and your brand was in all three spots! In the discovery stage of PPC, the specialist is looking to design an account architecture that allows them to position their keywords in different areas of a target buyer’s journey through the SERPs. To fully understand what their target market is searching for, they will often begin with broad match modified keywords. This tactic will show your ad in any search that contains your keywords. For example, “+blender +smoothie” will show your ad for any searches containing both keywords regardless of the order. By mining the search term reports, we are now able to see the user intent of our target market based on the keywords they are searching for when they click on our ads. We can now provide this data to the content marketing department with all of our highest converting longtail keywords. With this information, the content marketing team can analyze search volume, rankability, and brand fit to create content around this query.The end goal is that we are now able to not only show an ad on these high converting SERPs, but also rank organically on this page above the fold.Often times, we are not able to take total market share for high performing queries. Let’s use my company, Directive Consulting, for this example. We want to rank for “seo company” in our area, but, because “seo company” is localized, we have a greater chance of ranking in our city, Irvine, CA. If, however, we want to rank nationally and increase our lead volume, it is pertinent that we look at national results and see if any of those results/websites have display ads.For this exact query, Forbes wrote an article entitled: “4 Tips for Hiring the Right SEO Firm”. The article ranks very well nationally, and is a frequent stop for someone looking to hire an agency. In a freaky intersection of SEO and Google’s Display Network, we can take advantage of a site that ranks well for our target keyword and position our business once again within the buyer’s journey by advertising with a display ad on that website.We simply need to go into our Adwords account, create compelling display ads, and position ourselves on the page above the fold! See below.The goal should no longer be to rank solely organically for a keyword or for pay-per-click advertising. Instead, we need to integrate both channels through remarketing, display, and search.The key is to place yourself as many times as possible in your target markets SERP journey, while measuring the performance and budget according to results and re-allocating.No longer are isolated search campaigns an option. The landscape is too competitive and the buyer journey is multi-faceted. Your campaigns need to think beyond isolation and move towards integration.As mentioned, the following tactics provide a foundational way that you can take a step towards dynamic integration:The tactics provided here provide a brief look into the dynamic ways you can integrate your campaigns, but the execution will be key.As Google daily takes more SERP real estate for paid advertising, PPC will play an even larger role tomorrow than today. Furthermore, as the field becomes more competitive, the CPC’s will only rise.The businesses that best leverage content and integrate their efforts with first party data from their paid search department will lead the pack.About the Author: Garrett Mehrguth is the CEO of Directive Consulting, a Google Partner and MozLocal Recommended Agency serving mid-enterprise level firms.He has been published in Moz, Ahref, Convince and Convert, Wordstream, Raven, Local Search Ranking Factors, and more.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/marketing-funnel-sabotaging-conversion-rate/,Why the Traditional Marketing Funnel is Sabotaging Your Conversions,"The sales funnel. It all seems so smooth and simple, doesn’t it? Lots of prospects come in through the top, only to move in various, predictable stages like “Awareness” and “Discovery” only to come out the bottom as loyal, committed customers.Except the reality of today’s sales and customer experience process is anything like that.Things like brand advocacy, social media, and even our own experiences have changed the way we market to others. Why then should we stay stuck in this rigid, old funnel structure?We shouldn’t – and today’s article will show you why.According to the Harvard Business Review, there are a myriad of ways that people learn of and interact with a product. There are even times when customers don’t come through the top of the funnel, but rather somewhere in the middle.A typical marketing funnel starts with more customers in the “Awareness” stage and ends with fewer in the “Retention” phaseLet’s say you were in the market for a new pair of running shoes. A friend recommends a specific brand and links to them on Facebook. On their page you can see user comments and testimonials as well as active discussions. You’ve just completely passed the Awareness and Discovery parts of the funnel and moved on to Engagement and likely even Purchase – because a recommendation from someone you trust is that valuable to you.On your way to purchase these shoes, the company recommends some specialized insoles to help cushion your feet. Great idea. Now you’ve instantly moved from consideration to purchase. It’s also possible that you could go back and forth between funnel stages while you evaluate different products or brands.And with networks like Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest always available at the tap of a button, the traditional sales funnel we all know and refer to ends up looking more like a pretzel, with twists, turns and overlaps at every corner.Users will often double-back on their decisions, or switch between two points instantlyAccording to Antonio Lucio, Chief Brand Officer at Visa, the end goal is to shift priority from the transaction to the customer relationship. To that end, Visa has created the “Customer Experience Journey” which looks at the process from transactions being a part of the customer relationship rather than the customer relationship being viewed purely in terms of transactions.He gives the example of a family planning a trip from the U.S. to Mexico. Visa has mapped out the whole experience:You may see this list and think “Well, Visa is part of only one of these options” – which is true when you’re looking at each one as a transaction.But step back a moment and look at the bigger picture. Every one of these points is conducive to building and nurturing the relationship with the customer. The transaction itself is just a small piece of the puzzle and not the end goal. According to Lucio, “[w]hen you change from decision to engagement, you change the entire model.”Here again, if you’re looking at the funnel purely from a revenue point of view, or spending too much time focusing on transactions, the customer experience gets lost in the shuffle. It becomes too much of a focus to think only of the numbers and not of the people driving them. If you zero in on numbers alone, you miss out on so much more. Just look at brands like Tesla Motors on Facebook. Do you think there are nearly 1.5 million Tesla owners?Tesla Motors has nearly 1.5 million followers – not all of them customersNot yet – but these people admire what the company has been able to build and the values they stand for. All of those things feed back into the brand itself and create the customer experience. Even digital products and services like SaaS and mobile apps can benefit from this adjusted funnel. As the Harvard article explains, with traditional funnels, marketing is a separate entity. With SaaS and other platforms, the marketing and the service go hand in hand.The Salesforce AppExchange, for instance, doesn’t just look at the process as “how do we market this?” but rather, “how do we add value to this so that the things we recommend market for us?” Many of the apps profiled here weren’t made by Salesforce, but Salesforce and the apps it works with form a kind of symbiotic relationship where both parties win.Not all apps featured on the AppExchange were built by Salesforce, but all of them use it to enable their own customer experience journeysAnother example is Google. What started out as solely a search engine has branched out to become a search engine, email service, word processor, storage service and countless other services, all entwined under a single brand umbrella. Every service plays well with other services – making it faster and easier for us to create, communicate and share. And our brains thrive on faster and easier.Sure, there are other search engines out there, even other companies that have just as much influence as Google. But they don’t integrate in a way that makes our experience faster, easier or better. When was the last time you found exactly what you needed within seconds, using Bing?As the Harvard article says, the traditional funnel isn’t going away anytime soon. There are still products and services out there that gain new customers this way. But to overlay and apply that to our more open, two-way communication world is just trying to fit a round peg in a square hole. It’s not flexible, not adaptive, and just doesn’t work – leading to poor experiences for everyone.When you look at marketing as the multi-faceted beast it is, you’ll be able to create your own funnel “roadmap” that incorporates all the steps you need to engage and empower your customers in a way where everyone wins.What are your thoughts? Have you thrown out the traditional funnel in favor of another sales model?

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/content-distribution-metrics/,5 Content Distribution Metrics Your Marketing Team Should Be Obsessing Over,"Output is seductive. It feels great to crank out lots of content and call your strategy a success.But prolific doesn’t always mean effective. Marketers must resist the allure of vanity metrics to ensure their content actually resonates with their intended audience.Consumers’ social feeds and dashboards are flooded with content from colleagues, friends, family, and the high school sweethearts they stalk on social media. A brand might publish stellar long-form articles, but what’s the point if people ignore its posts and just keep scrolling?To cut through the noise, marketers must track and measure the right data and up their distribution games. They need to focus on metrics that reveal which subjects to cover, where to publish, and when to share for maximum impact — not just ones that revolve around page views and traffic.Let’s be honest — we all love vanity metrics. Racking up likes, follows, page views, and subscriber tallies seems to validate our hard work. If people like our posts on Facebook, we must be doing something right.Right?Well, not necessarily. Most of these popular metrics don’t accurately reflect ROI.Marketers often tout web traffic as the No. 1 metric to monitor, but traffic is deceptive, and it often raises more questions than it answers. Who are all these people visiting your site? You might see a million hits a day, but they’re worthless if they’re coming from the wrong people.Search engine rankings can also cloud your thinking, leading you to become overly consumed by thoughts of “Are we on the first page?” “Are we moving toward the top of Google’s search results?” and “Are we trending in the right direction on Bing?”Depending on which keywords and search terms relate to your business, obsessing over SEO rankings could be a huge time-waster. If only a few hundred people find your company through search engines, you’re spending way too much time, money, and effort fighting a battle that’s not worth winning.Without distribution data, creative decisions are tough to quantify. Design, layout, and copywriting choices all tend to rely more on intuition and gut instinct than hard data.Content distribution, on the other hand, is a numbers game that should drive your creative. Once you complete a masterpiece, its distribution data should dictate the how, when, where, and why of your future content projects.Focus on the following distribution metrics to best reach your goals:Likes may validate your message, but shares are what actually distribute it and help it become viral.People share content when it’s useful, entertaining, informational, and relevant to their overall interests. Use Buzzsumo or another social metrics tool to analyze social shares based on content type. Buzzsumo will also tell you where your content has been backlinked and how many people it’s reached through outside platforms.Widespread sharing is an excellent indicator that you’re producing the kind of content your audience craves. Build future articles, blog posts, videos, and other materials around the themes that attract the most attention.People who create and share positive content about your company without being asked to do so are your bonus brand ambassadors. Scour the web for this material, and recognize it on your social accounts. Show your appreciation by sending the content creators a personalized thank-you message. You can even consider inviting them to company events, asking them to review products as beta testers, or including them in any other activity that makes them feel like VIPs.At the other end of the spectrum, don’t ignore your haters; hug them. When people write negative reviews, they usually don’t expect to get a response from the company they’re complaining about. However, if the company does interact with them, empathize with their struggle, and perhaps offer gifts or incentives to offset their hardships — they’ll be much more likely to change their negative opinion.Conversions happen when prospects respond to your call to action. Opening an email, clicking a CTA link in that email, and filling out a registration form on a landing page are all conversions. But, of course, buying your product is the ultimate conversion.Use your content to lead prospects further into the conversion funnel by educating them about your company or by inviting them to download in-depth gated content. You’ll get their contact information, and they’ll benefit from your ideas. It’s a win-win, and it’s one step closer to conversion.There’s a fine line between vanity retention metrics and true retention metrics.The ones you should be tracking are those in which customers exchange personal data for your content or products. The average buyer requires seven touchpoints before he’s ready to buy from a brand (known as the Rule of Seven), and content is a great way to demonstrate and reassert your value during this process. Metrics that share or create new content are much better than likes or hearts.This measurement indicates how much of the sales pipeline has been influenced by one or more pieces of content. You can focus on single articles, a group of pieces, or all content collectively, but the bottom line is the same for each scenario: If your content marketing and distribution aren’t impacting the sales funnel, your efforts are being wasted. Sales pipeline impact metrics should indicate how much money you’ve earned in potential opportunities and actual sales as a result of your content. Products like Kissmetrics (see how Kissmetrics can tie content to revenue), Marketo, and Salesforce are able to assess how much pipeline a piece of content has generated.With so much content being pumped into your customers’ feeds, distribution is now the code to crack. It’s not about who produces the most content; it’s about who can get it in front of the right eyes.About the Author: Russ Fradin is a digital media industry veteran and an angel investor with more than 15 years of experience in online marketing.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/facebook-ads-tips-and-features/,10 Must-Know Facebook Ads Tips & Features,"It’s no secret that paid social is drastically on the rise. Social advertising spend jumped 50% year-over-year in the last quarter of 2015. Social media ad revenue is expected to reach $35.90 billion by 2017, reaching a staggering 16% of the total global digital ad market.Facebook (including Instagram) unsurprisingly comprises a big piece of this pie, making up an estimated 65.5% of all 2015 social ad spend. This is driven by changes in their CPC model, launch of Instagram ads & the addition of powerful new features.This post will arm you with 10 important tips & features to ensure you’re getting the most out of this channel.One of the most recent campaign types added by Facebook are Lead Ads. This campaign type allows advertisers to collect lead data without a landing page and directly through a form without leaving Facebook.Some early advertisers found Lead Ads to result in a 4x reduction to their CPL (according to Facebook).To get started with Lead Ads, simply:1. Create a new campaign with the “Lead Generation” objective2. Build out your campaign/advert set, as you would for any campaign3. Create your lead form at the advert level4. Choose the questions you’d like added and optionally add up to three custom questions5. Link to your privacy policy, add your disclaimer and destination URL6. Customize your form7. Preview then create your formNow you’re ready to get started with Facebook’s newest and most powerful lead generation tool.Tip: Twitter has had this campaign type for years, they call it Twitter Lead Cards.Some of the biggest wins are always found within the reporting section. One of the most important parts of reporting is the ‘Breakdown’ section.These are all important questions that can be answered under the ‘Breakdown’ drop-down.In this example, the Instagram placement converted a near 500% better than mobile news feed placement, at a fraction of the CPA. Knowing this, we’d shift more spend to Instagram and remove budget from the mobile news feed placement to maximize performance at our budget (if there’s volume available).It’s important to understand Facebook’s attribution models, where to change the view and what makes sense for your conversion goal. These are the ‘rules’ for how each conversion is counted, in regards to the timeframe after an interaction with your advert and the method of the interaction (click or view).This is important to take note of so you have a clear understanding of the value of your conversions and how they compare to the other networks you may be running. Within ‘Manage adverts’, the option to change the attribution model can be found under ‘Columns’ > ‘Customize Columns…’ > ‘Change Attribution Window’.Since September 2015, Instagram placements have been made public in 30+ countries within the Facebook Ads Dashboard. Getting started with this is as simple as connecting an Instagram account and choosing the Instagram placement.Break out some test budget and see how this placement compares.I’ve found lookalike audiences to be one of the most effective targeting methods on paid social.A lookalike audience is a targeting criteria where Facebook generates an audience of user who are similar to your current customers or audience.This audience can be based off an email list, segments of your Facebook Pixel or any conversion goals you have set up. Facebook matches these users with Facebook profiles then finds similarities in demographics, interests, behaviors, etc. Lastly, Facebook uses these finding to generate a list of similar Facebook users which you can target in your campaigns.Learn how to create a lookalike audience here.An often overlooked targeting criteria is Facebook’s more granular location targeting options. It’s important to keep this in mind while creating your campaigns and use the targeting option that makes the most sense for your business.Are you trying to target people living in a specific city, or all people within this city? These are two very different targets.Take for example, a local service business operating only in downtown SF. You wouldn’t want to be targeting people visiting for the weekend, or commuting in for work.With Facebook’s granular targeting methods, in most cases you know who you’re speaking to (at least the interest, behaviours, etc. that define your audience).Use this knowledge to tie copy and creative closely with each specific audience you’re targeting.Targeting a recent homebuyer? How about something like “Your new home would be complete with [Brand Name’s] contemporary/ modern furniture line”.All digital marketers know the importance of remarketing, so don’t level this out of your Facebook Ads strategy be left out.Make sure to take advantage of Facebook’s audience segmentation options, where you can include/exclude specific pages & domains, as well as choose the remarketing window length.This feature allows advertisers to remarket specific products to users who’ve previously viewed or added them to their cart. The creative and copy of your ads will dynamically change based on what products your visitors have viewed.Always test many creative and copy variants to see which ones resonate best with your audience. Facebook will optimize ad serving based on performance and your conversion goal.An interesting and relatively new creative type I recommend testing is the ‘Carousel’, which allows you to fit multiple images and links into a single creative.This creative type has been found to reduce your CPA by about 30-50% & decrease your CPC by 20-30% (according to Facebook).Use this creative type to:Tip: Don’t forget to run a statistical significance test to see if the improvement you’re seeing is indeed valid and not just by chance.The different placements offered by Facebook perform very differently. It’s important to keep an eye on their performance and where your spend is being directed (details of how to do this are found in #2 above).When optimizing for clicks, I find most of your budget will get pushed to mobile or audience network (since these have the most effective CPC), however these placements may typically not have the best overall performance.In most cases, I find it makes sense to break out your campaigns by placement (or at least mobile vs. desktop). This is especially true if you’re setting manual bids, or if your campaign is set to optimize for clicks.I hope you find these Facebook Advertising tips & features useful.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/ways-data-improves-saas-funnel/,5 Ways Data Improves Your SaaS Conversion Funnel,"Not using data is a missed opportunity for SaaS companies.If your team is seeking to bring in more revenue, data helps your conversion funnel. It’s the difference between knowing your customer or simply taking a wild guess.Matt Ackerson, founder of Petovera, says, “The rise of the smart sales funnel is happening now. You can expect it to become a near marketing ‘requirement’ as businesses adopt the strategy and new tools and tech come out around the concept.”Whether it’s acquiring more qualified leads or retaining loyal consumers, build your sales system on a foundation of analytics. This provides your team with the ability to produce informed decisions.Make a deliberate effort to focus on the data. Here are five ways to improve your sales funnel.Studies show that “72% of buyers turn to Google during awareness stage research.” Your customers are constantly searching for solutions to their problems. That’s why your team must be ready to provide solution-oriented content. Not only will it answer their most pressing issues, but great content also will engage them in learning more about your SaaS brand and products.Grab your prospects’ attention with data-driven content. “…[D]etermine their interests and how they act upon those interests. While it may not be feasible to develop true one-to-one content at scale, you can use this data to pinpoint common characteristics and habits of individual audience segments…” writes Brad Messinger, senior vice president of marketing, Rise Interactive.Conduct keyword research to understand your consumer’s intent. Find high-performing keywords with tools such as, Google Keyword Planner and Keyword Tool.Find out what your customer desires. Then, generate awareness around that subject.For example, host a webinar. It will display your SaaS’s expertise and provide your audience with useful information. Keep it short and engaging. After the webinar, you can post a recap on your blog with the slides and additional details.MarketingSherpa reports that “79% of marketing leads never convert into sales. Lack of lead nurturing is the most common cause of this poor performance.”Several reasons exist for inadequate lead nurturing. Your team may be targeting the wrong people. Your lead capturing system fails to filter out unqualified leads. Or you’re not providing the right service to the right client. “Evaluate your target market and make sure you understand what B2B buyers in your sector really value. With this in mind, you can communicate the cost benefits, ROI, and affordability of your products or services in a way that will really resonate with your audience,” says Leo Patel, freelance writer and digital strategist.Nurturing involves catering to several types of customers. Data segmentation is an effective tool for sending tailored messages to different people. Moreover, a targeted campaign can help reduce your budget costs.Develop buyer personas based on industries, website behavior, and past purchases.Think of nurturing as a process, not a one-time transaction. It’s rare that people will make a purchase from just one interaction. Rather, train your SaaS team to execute multiple customer touch points. Explore what excites and intrigues your customers.Customers don’t buy products from companies. They buy from their family and friends. In other words, consumers make purchasing decisions based on recommendations from people they respect. Trust is the cornerstone of most sales transactions. Ensure customers that your SaaS product is trustworthy. And social proof helps decrease the customer’s purchasing resistance.“The best part about social proof techniques is that they are fairly simple to implement. They don’t require a lot of effort to be put up, and certainly not much investment in terms of cash,” says, Deeksha Bahl, social media manager at VWO.Case studies provide insight into a current customer’s story. They also convince prospects who need that extra push to purchase. HelpScout provides interested buyers with video case studies. Trust is hard to earn but easy to lose. So, don’t take it for granted.Walter Rogers, CEO of CCI Global Holdings, advises to never misrepresent the benefits of your product:“Customers don’t want a product or solution that only comes close to meeting their needs, or that usually functions properly. Give them the whole, unvarnished truth, and let them decide if the proposed solution will work for them.”McKinsey found that “satisfaction on customer journeys is 30% more predictive of overall customer satisfaction than measuring happiness for each individual interaction.” Just because the sale is complete doesn’t mean your work is done. An effective onboarding process cements your new customer’s success.“After the initial welcome email, you have a great opportunity to keep your new customer engaged and educated by sending them a drip campaign of emails. This is your best chance of getting the customer to really use all the features of your product,” states Ed Shelley, Director of Content Marketing at ChartMogul.Identify friction points preventing your customer from loving your product. What’s causing them to stop using your service? Are their questions being fully answered? How can you improve customer interactions? Delivering accurate onboarding means understanding what customers value. Use multiple inputs from the customer analyses to make improvements.One way is to collect qualitative data from in-app messaging conversations. Observe what features and functions interest customers. On the Frontleaf blog, Rachel English also suggests analyzing various customer data streams. Monitor what your onboarding customers do:After the sale, go above and beyond to satisfy your customer. Your goal is to create the best user experience.According to reports, “80% of your company’s future revenue will come from just 20% of your existing customers.”SaaS companies normally get anxious about renewals. They want customers to renew today or else. That’s when unethical sales practices arise. Then, customers that once loved your services become skeptical and decide not to repurchase.Develop loyalty programs that encourage relationships, rather than more sales. Give customers a reason to be a part of your brand, not just your product. “[I]t’s reducing customer effort that’s the single most important factor in creating customer loyalty,” states Len Markidan, head of marketing at Groove. Insert personalization into your customer retention strategy. Customization provides relevancy and a one-of-a-kind experience to your loyal consumers.Carol Roth, on-air contributor for CNBC, writes:“Many of the biggest brands have failed to do this despite having multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns. Customers are all driven by different parameters, which means that you need to do a lot of listening and keeping track of the likes, dislikes and drivers of your customers’ behavior.”Luxury hoodie retailer Evy’s Tree created the Who’s Hoo Rewards Program. It focuses on creating engaged customers through rewards and referrals.We all know data is important for SaaS conversions. It’s one way to gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. Gain brand awareness with customized content. Use analytics to discover new ways to cultivate customer relationships. And adjust your process to fix any onboarding problems.Data is here. Improve your sales funnel.About the Author: Shayla Price lives at the intersection of digital marketing, technology and social responsibility. Connect with her on Twitter @shaylaprice.",
,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/analytics-in-customer-engagement/,Stop Neglecting Analytics in Your Customer Engagement Strategy,"Customers desire experiences, not transactions.In a world full of distractions, engaging customers beyond the typical purchasing routine is vital for SaaS success. And B2B consumers crave unparalleled engagement. They want personalized advice, solution-oriented features, and revenue-generating products. An IBM annual survey noted that “as many as 65% believe customer engagement will be the primary driver of growth going forward.”Analytics is one of the few ways to gain insights to meet your customers’ needs. It helps bridge the gap between providing a service to solving real challenges.Enhance the experience between your brand and consumers. Build data into your customer engagement strategy.Studies show that “86% of buyers will pay more for a better customer experience, but only 1% of customers feel that vendors consistently meet their expectations.” That’s a major disconnect for SaaS companies striving to improve customer engagement.B2B customers aren’t concerned about aesthetic features. And they aren’t amped to hear how your team worked around the clock to fix a bug.Your consumers want a service dedicated to solving their problems in an efficient manner.Natalie Chan, an expert handling customer retention at Outbrain Amplify, writes:“Businesses that focus on customers engagement are focused on value creation, not revenue extraction. These are businesses that know how to engage their customers by providing them with real value whether it be through an exceptional end-to-end customer experience, great content or strong customer support that are about delivering more than the traditional sell.”Offering value means addressing your customers’ desires. And it’s all about how they perceive what’s important. For example, if a prospect is concerned about increasing open rates in email campaigns, it’s not in their best interest to discuss layout designs.Value requires laser-focus. And that’s where analytics steps in. Monitor usage data to assess the customer experience. Track acquisition channels to observe where customers are coming from and if they’re converting. Interview customers and ask them why they chose your product. Figure out how they expect to use your product and what business goals they want to achieve.Create and deliver unprecedented value. Connect with the customer.In order for customer engagement to work effectively, your team must know your buyer. And that goes beyond the usual demographics, like annual revenue, company size, and location.More importantly, for B2B companies, your team must not only focus on the business itself, but also on the employee of the business. Learning about the decision maker is crucial to your sales.“Leveraging big data to better understand and act upon customer behavior, forces you to think differently not only about what data to keep (all of it!) and how long to keep it, but also which data you should begin capturing,” states Duane Edwards, Co-founder and Senior Vice President of Globys.Analyze your primary behavioral data to create in-depth customer personas. Understand the decision maker’s goals and challenges. Also, know how you can provide short-term and long-term guidance.Bruce Swann, Sales and Marketing professional at Adobe, suggests applying predictive analytics: “Once you’ve compiled data attributes to create a panoramic view of customers, you can begin to understand and predict customer behavior, which adds depth to that view. Examples include using a range of analyses, including customer value analysis, market basket analysis, customer profitability, response modeling, and churn analysis.”Use data as an indicator of future behavior. If you know your client’s customers, it may lead to helping your client differently.For example, NoWait is an app that simplifies the process of waiting for a table at a restaurant. Instead of having a guest tote around a clunky pager with a range of 50 feet, restaurants only need the person’s cell phone number. When the table is ready, the guest receives a text. Plus, after dining, restaurants can text customers additional discount offerings.Moreover, with the app, restaurants learn “who their patrons are, what time they come and go, which patrons come back the most frequently, who purchases more.” This data can be used to create messaging that appeals specifically to each customer. Know your buyer and your buyer’s customers.Content is more than just blog posts. It includes everything from checklists to webinars. Research shows that “64% of visitors who watch a video are more likely to buy a product online.” Therefore, content isn’t just helpful for your brand awareness; it’s a vital part of your customer engagement strategy, which leads to sales.Examine heat map data to improve your content. It will help you learn what content is important to the consumer. Then, your team can focus on content placement and how different images and colors in your content affect your website visitors.Pete Mehr, Principal at ZS Associates, says, “By quantifying which content the customer engages, and how frequently, it becomes straightforward to continue to provide content back to the customer. This continuing content consists of an ongoing series of messages to a customer.”Moreover, analytics will uncover which type of content matters to your customer. Is it eBooks? Or maybe 30-second video clips? Mention understands their audience. They produce content that resonates.The social monitoring company creates webinars highlighting experts in the field. For instance, Mention invited Sujan Patel (who is hosting a webinar with Kissmetrics next week) to talk about ways to create content for “boring” industries.Study your data to find content that speaks to your customer. It’s an effective way to boost engagement.In America, “the cost of poor customer service is $41 billion per year.” That’s a heavy burden for most companies. Moreover, a report found that “retailers are not listening and responding to their audience enough. Some 89% of consumers’ comments are left unanswered.”Approach customer service differently. Think beyond phone support and Q&A forums.Social media has presented another solution. Now, SaaS businesses can provide Twitter and Facebook support. Under Armour created a Twitter handle solely for the purpose of answering customers questions about their products.From your analytics reports, determine what channels of support satisfies your customers. What works for your competitor may not work for your SaaS.“It’s not about deploying on all channels, but deploying the right channels that align with your business. Only deploy on the channels that make sense for your business,” says Kate Leggett, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.In addition, you must streamline your processes when using multiple channels. For instance, phone support data for a specific customer must also be available to your Twitter service reps.At ComputerWeekly.com, Lisa Kelly suggests that “organisations need an accurate knowledge base where companies can link information from other channels, including peer-to-peer interactions, web self-service and communities, to share with customer service agents.”It’s not enough to offer various customer service routes. Your team must work together to use data to enhance the overall customer experience on each channel.Customer engagement isn’t anything new. However, your SaaS can approach it differently with the help of analytics. Add unmatched value to the customer’s experience. Use data to gain insight on your buyer’s habits and preferences. And provide customer service from a multi-channel perspective. Stop neglecting, and start respecting your data.About the Author: Shayla Price lives at the intersection of digital marketing, technology and social responsibility.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/customer-journey-maps-increase-conversions/,How to Perfect Your Customer Journey Maps to Increase Conversions,"Want more conversions? Increase the quality of your consumer interactions.Salesforce reports that “86% of senior-level marketers say that it’s absolutely critical or very important to create a cohesive customer journey.”To understand how your team interacts with every customer, it’s vital that you design a customer journey map that highlights every part of the purchasing experience.“Journey mapping is a holistic approach to understanding the flow of experiences a customer has with an organization; it uses pictures to represent a process that cannot be adequately captured with words,” writes Adam Toporek, author of Be Your Customer’s Hero.Let’s explore how to earn more sales. It starts with your journey map.E-commerce businesses must be ready to adapt quickly to convert prospects. It’s one of the few ways to stay competitive in the market.CSO Insights found that “companies with ‘dynamic, adaptable sales and marketing processes’ reported an average of 10% more sales people on-quota compared to other companies.”You can’t box a sales transaction into a one-time occurrence. It involves more than just exchanging money for a product. It’s called the customer’s journey for a reason. The cycle encompasses all the interactions and decisions leading up to the purchase and after the sale.“Customer journey maps allow you to walk in your customers’ shoes by traveling with them as they interact with your company. When based on sound research, they provide an accurate outside-in view, focusing on desired outcomes from the customer’s perspective,” states Michael Hinshaw, CEO of McorpCX.Decades ago, companies worried about gaining new customers. But today’s business climate requires your SaaS to retain consumers. Therefore, nurturing the customer through the cycle holds greater purpose.Identify the touch points where customers interact with your brand. Understand how each interaction affects one another. Develop a buyer journey map using the five W’s: Who, Why, When, What, and Where.Learn where your team can fill in gaps and exploit opportunities to increase conversions. A customer journey map gives your team context. For example, if a customer calls your phone support line and waits 12 minutes without receiving assistance, then how should your team respond to a not-so-nice email from the person? Connect the dots in the customer experience. It will guide your business forward.Research shows that “74% of buyers choose the sales rep that was first to add value [and] insight.” Customers want to be educated, not sold. And for your SaaS to offer value-added information, your team needs to focus on consumer data. You’ll uncover what matters to your customer, when to give specific content, and how to present your content. So, if data is an afterthought in your customer journey, it’s time to rethink your strategy. Quantitative and qualitative data is a stepping stone to giving your customers value. Dom Nicastro, staff reporter at CMSwire, suggests the following methods to collect data:As your team analyzes customer interaction data, you will master how to “accelerate customer acquisition, encourage repeat business, and improve customer loyalty.” This leads to adopting new product features, defining customer segments, and identifying churn signals.Monitor how you acquire data. Ensure that it’s accurate.  Paul Boag, author of Digital Adaptation, says, “Be careful to make clear what has research behind it and what does not. Making many decisions based on assumptions is dangerous. Once management sees the benefits of research, they will be willing to spend more time on it.”Moreover, integrated customer journeys provide a competitive edge. Harvard Business Review cites Oakland-based Sungevity for their personalized digital customer journey. It helped the company’s sales double to more than $65 million.Gather data to learn more about your customers’ behaviors. Analytics is necessary for understanding the customer’s journey.Despite the effectiveness of customer journey mapping, only 34% of companies have undertaken the process. It’s an opportunity for your SaaS to take advantage of the benefits. The value of mapping includes recognizing functional silos, identifying growth factors, and establishing development priorities. If you don’t know how your customers flow through the sales cycle, it’s harder to serve their needs. The customer journey map doesn’t have to be elaborate. Initially, forgoing specific data may be an option for your company. Here’s a recommendation from Forbes contributor Micah Solomon:“Your customer journey map needs to be, or at least needs to start out its life being, independent from all considerations of internal processes and departments, because your customer will never have precisely the same viewpoint as the viewpoint you have internally, nor fully match up to the inevitably awkward divisions of task in your organization.”And every journey map isn’t the same. Maps can vary based on the industry, customer base, or management style. Several types exist, including business to business and tactical.But all journey maps should serve the same purpose: Illustrate how the customer engages with you brand. It shouldn’t be rooted in what your business thinks. Your team needs to document real experiences. “Actionable journey maps clearly identify both positive and negative customer emotions throughout their journey and put them in context of customer behaviors, goals, and expectations. Businesses use their data to identify opportunity areas and to assess the impact of current and future CX/UX investments,” writes Kathleen Hoski and Phil Goddard of TandemSeven.Build your plan to gain deeper insights to earn more conversions.Consider your journey map a living document that will continue to evolve. Get ready to add, subtract, and maybe even multiply your blueprint.In this digital age, customers are becoming more sophisticated. Their interests pinpoint to niche markets. And their problems need customized solutions.The key is to anticipate change. Recreating a linear path of the customer experience is only a waste of time, because we know customers take many routes to complete a sale. That involves research, justification, and cost analysis.Your team also should aim to build ongoing trust with your customers. CMO Council’s Content ROI Center reports that no more than 9% of B2B buyers fully trust vendor content. “They trust information that comes from people they trust: friends, family and network connections. You can’t be everyone’s friend, but you can stay in contact with a vast number of potential buyers on a regular basis thanks to social selling and automation,” says Daniel Ku, content marketing manager at Sales for Life.And lastly, possess a full perspective of the customer. Avoid making one-sided decisions.“Disparate systems and questionable data inhibit marketers from knowing and understanding who their customers are every time they engage. Without the single customer view, marketers face huge barriers from the very start,” says Bruce Swann, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Adobe Campaign. Challenges will arise. Prepare accordingly.Every SaaS team needs a path to sales. Build customer journey maps to facilitate the buying process. Learn how your SaaS is currently engaging with customers. Use data to pinpoint unknown consumer behaviors. And develop a blueprint that illustrates your buyers’ needs. Map out the customer journey. Increase conversions.About the Author: Shayla Price lives at the intersection of digital marketing, technology and social responsibility. Connect with her on Twitter @shaylaprice.",
,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/learn-from-ge-digital-marketing/,What We Can Learn from GE’s Digital Marketing Strategies,"Aside from being at the forefront of technological innovations, what else does industrial titan General Electric excel at?Believe it or not, it’s digital marketing. General Electric’s strategic approach to its online marketing campaigns are admired by both seasoned and rookie marketers alike. From participating on popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, GE is also present on Vine and Tumblr.The brand is exploring new frontiers with help from Wattpad creative writers as well. If that’s not enough, they have teamed up with National Geographic to bring TV audiences incredible glimpses of the future through their series, Breakthrough.Of course, not all brands have the budget for six-hour series productions, nor the resources to be seen from LinkedIn to Medium. But General Electric has a thing or two to teach today’s digital marketers. What makes GE’s content so endearing? Is it the stunning visuals? The hundreds of shares on social media? The answer: none of the above. If you observe the types of content that General Electric shares online, you’ll see that they are all about innovation, new technology, or looking at science with a new perspective. It’s GE’s vision for its company and for the world.This is the main reason they stand out above their competition. In order to successfully market yourself online, you’ll need to first find WHAT you do that’s different. In the case of GE, they want to bring science closer to average folks. They want to make it fun, entertaining, yet educational. Thus, #6SecondScience campaign was born.It’s one of their most successful online marketing ideas to date. It began with a quick science experiment on Vine, which rapidly became popular that the brand decided to create a social media contest out of it.One small business that has recently been gaining plenty of buzz thanks to their unique branding strategy is condiment master, Sir Kensington’s. Founded by Scott Norton and Mark Ramadan in 2008, the brand promotes itself as a more refined alternative to mass-marketed products. Just how “refined” are they? Check out their monocle-wearing logo, fancy Twitter quotes, and their vintage-inspired stories, and you’ll soon find a sophisticated food lover in you. One who shares Sir Kensington’s vision that good food doesn’t have to play by the rules.When it comes to profit, familiar is better. Trying out something new will no doubt eat up valuable resources and require fresh talent. Depending on your industry, trying something new is just a waste of time and money. In digital marketing however, it could spell the difference between staying relevant OR being forgotten. General Electric knows this. That’s why they are usually the first brand to begin a marketing campaign on a new social platform before their competitors.Back when Snapchat was still gaining traction with brands, GE joined in the fun – just in time for the 45th anniversary of the moon landing. They created their first Snap on July 15, 2014, accompanied their announcement with a “special surprise” for fans. And in 2015, the industrial company had its very own geofilter to get young fans fired up and ready for their Holidays. The Snapchat feature, activated only with location services, will show a specific GE travel filter for photos so you can tell friends and family where you’re headed. The brand hopes to remain relevant to Snapchat’s young demographic because they are the “next generation of customers, investors, and employees”. Wise words indeed from a brand with vision.Interested in knowing how Snapchat can help promote your business through geofilters? You can now create on-demand geofilters that showcases your logo, business name, or any other type of promotional content that you’re authorized to use. Make sure to register for an account first before you could try out this marketing strategy. This is great for local businesses who want to spread the word about their enterprise or event. One of the most challenging aspects of digital marketing is connecting your brand’s message to what people are talking about. This can be exceptionally tricky if you’re in niche markets such as construction and engineering. After all, who wants to chat about science, innovation, and manufacturing? Always on the forefront however, General Electric was able to rise up to the challenge and even succeeded in attracting people to their campaigns.Their Pinterest profile is proof of what happens when creative digital marketing ideas meet trending topics. One of their most successful boards, “Hey Girl”, is a collection of romantic pickup lines from famous GE scientists and has almost 18,000 Followers.Another brand that refuses to fall behind on trends is hemp-clothing maker, Jungmaven. Founder Robert Jungmann’s ultimate goal is to get everyone on a hemp tee by 2020 to help mitigate climate change. To make his goal a reality, he makes sure the Jungmaven line is just as competitive when it comes to style.Their Instagram account is filled with inspiring and trendy images that are an obvious hit with their 7,000 Followers.Today’s consumers are smart. They have the Web and social media at their fingertips. They are no longer easily swayed by TV ads, Facebook promotions, or BuzzFeed videos (entertaining as they may be). Today’s consumers want to be a part of something BIG. Millennials in particular, are highly concerned about social impacts and becoming change agents.If you want to achieve big things, you need to think BIG – and pair up with someone big, too. That’s why GE teamed up with National Geographic to give an old message a new twist. The special series, “Breakthrough”, is all about cutting-edge innovations that explore how far we can go to pushing the boundaries of science.But what if you don’t have the budget to have your own series? As attested by wool company, Duckworth, businesses don’t need to go after expensive TV channels in order to accomplish BIG things. The Montana-based wool clothing brand is slowly establishing itself in the niche of outdoor clothing thanks to news features with select publications such as Powder, Backpacker, and Men’s Journal.These publications not only showcase their products, but also tell their company’s story, which is important if Duckworth wants to connect with their customers on a personal level. It’s definitely tempting to want to go viral. After all, you’re guaranteed hundreds if not thousands of hits overnight. Plenty of digital marketers even plan their strategies based on viral success stories like Dove’s “Real Beauty Sketches” or Lay’s “Do Us a Flavor”. While these brands have definitely won in the arena of online marketing, the REAL question afterwards becomes: now what?A viral digital marketing campaign is awesome, especially if you’re a small firm who wants to compete with the big boys in your industry. However, businesses should also think about long-term marketing. How will your strategy hold up in five or ten years from now? Are the things you’re doing now aimed at ensuring consumer loyalty? Is your marketing plan designed to withstand changes in technology and the Web?That’s why GE has diversified their marketing tactics to reach more of the younger generation, which they consider to be their company’s future. They’re not just inspiring buyers: they are also attracting potential investors and employees. According to CMO Linda Boff in an interview with Adweek, General Electric had always been about stories of bringing people passionate about science together. Unlike viral sensations, stories stick.If you look closely, you’ll see that their online marketing content is ripe with stories: even their photos have a tale to tell.Right now, GE is also investing in creative writers on Wattpad to put a new spin into their old Science comic books. General Electric’s official Wattpad account currently has more than 30,000 Followers, and their featured story “Our Place in Space” has been read more than 16,000 times.Another long-term strategy that GE is implementing is customer reviews. They are today’s version of word-of-mouth advertising. Not only are they a powerful tool when it comes to local SEO, customer reviews are great social proof that your products and/or services are better than competitors.Customers who visit the GE appliance website can leave testimonies about the electronics they bought. If they have issues or concerns, a GE representative is also standing by to provide assistance.In an overly competitive world of electronics, perhaps one of the best things that could separate you from your rivals is excellent customer service – told through stellar reviews. That’s how ABT Electronics in Glenview, IL has remained in business for more than 80 years. If you take a look at their Facebook account, you can see a separate tab for reviews alone.Their account on Yelp also boasts of good reviews from new and repeat customers.Thanks to this strategy – as well as their exceptional attention to customer service – they have managed to remain strong despite the growing preference for tech giants like Best Buy.Remember: viral hits are just that – viral hits. General Electric and ABT Electronics have proven that by combining digital marketing tactics with good old-fashioned concepts, you can be competitive for the long haul.General Electric is not the only brand in the market today that utilizes clever digital marketing techniques. You too, can play it smart by observing what they do best and then adopting them into your own campaign. You don’t have to spend millions on partnerships or ads: it’s all about having a clear picture of where you want to be.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/adwords-ecommerce-mistakes/,Are You Making These 8 AdWords E-Commerce Mistakes?,"AdWords is one of the most effective methods of driving traffic to your e-commerce website. However, if poorly managed, it can result in a huge waste of money. In this post, I’ll teach you 8 mistakes that could be frustrating your AdWords efforts.I’ll also show you, step by step, how to fix the mistakes so you can unlock the full potential of AdWords and achieve the maximum possible ROI. Running your ads when your products are out of stock is a sure-fire way to burn through your budget with no return. If you’ve got a large inventory of several thousand products, then it’s hard to keep track of what is and what is not in stock. However, there is now a smart way to keep track of your whole inventory and automatically pause ads when your products are out of stock.Russell Savage recently wrote a script that allows you to do this automatically at scale, even if you have an inventory of tens of thousands of products.When Base Fashion introduced a similar feature, they saw an increase in their conversion rate of 12%.To implement this into your account, follow these 6 steps:Step 1. Go to this URL and copy the script.Step 2. Go to your AdWords account and, under “Bulk operations,” select “Scripts.”Step 3. Click “+ Script” and paste the script that Russell Savage wrote into your account.Step 4. You will need to slightly modify the script. Don’t worry, you don’t need any coding experience for this. Find an out-of-stock product on your website and check your website’s source code. Search for the word “stock,” and you should see that one of them will look something like this: “in_stock”:false. Make a note of this.Step 5. Check a product that is in stock, and you should see something like this: “in_stock”:true.Step 6. Go to line 23 of the script and replace the OUT_OF_STOCK_TEXT variable with the one you found on the page. In this case, “in_stock”:false. Because this is different for every website, I would recommend using Russell Savage’s script on one product first as a test to be sure you have identified the variable correctly.Building incredibly granular accounts that target adverts at category pages, right down to subcategory and product pages, is the key to success with AdWords. But I still see advertisers who don’t write adverts for every product they stock. By writing ads for each product, you can capitalize on high click-through rates and conversion because shoppers searching for exact products are late in the buying cycle. Conversion rates of 5-10% are common.If you have a large account of thousands of products and you have new products going in and out of stock all the time, this can seem like a daunting task. There is, however, a smarter solution.Both Google DoubleClick and AdWords Robot have introduced something called inventory-aware campaigns that create ad groups, adverts, and keywords for all your products automatically, using pre-defined templates, based on the data in your Google Merchant Center.Here is how it works:By implementing this strategy, a trendy apparel and accessories company was able to increase their conversion rate by 50% and their CTR by 26%. The most staggering fact was that they were able to save 38 hours by automating this task.Trust symbols and reviews are a great way to build trust in your brand and occupy more real estate on the first page of Google search results. (Studies have shown that 61% of users read online reviews before making a purchase online.) There are two main ways to obtain this trust and positioning – seller rating extensions and review extensions. Seller rating extensions are the 5 stars that appear alongside your adverts in Google search results. Below, you can see Comparethemarket using them effectively.A study by Google found that by implementing these extensions, advertisers have seen rises in CTR of 17% and increases in conversions of up to 4.8% with 50 positive reviews.The easiest way to implement this type of extension is to sign up to an independent review service that has been approved by Google, such as Revoo or Trustpilot. Simply acquire 30 customer reviews over a 12-month period on one of Google’s partnered review providers, and the stars will automatically appear alongside your ads.Review extensions are another way to add social proof to your ads. To add review extensions to your ads, you will need an independent review on a reputable website.By implementing review extensions, advertisers have seen increases in click-through rates of between 26-44% depending on the industry, and increases in conversion rates of approximately 27%.Review extensions can be implemented within the “Ad extensions” section of the AdWords interface.When I’m browsing through Google, I see no end of advertisers running sales without countdown timers to generate urgency and increase CTR’s and conversion rates.Matt Umbro recently ran a case study on the effect of using countdown timers. They saw the CTR increase from 2.87% to 4.02% for adverts with a countdown timer and a $3.66 decrease in cost per conversion.It’s also interesting to see how conversions increased dramatically as the number of days to the end of the sale decreased. If you look at the graph below, you will see that conversion rate increased from 8.24% to 10.80% at its peak just before the sale.If you want to start using countdown timers inside your ads, then follow these steps:Step 1. Go to this URL and copy the script.Step 2. Go to your AdWords account and, under “Bulk operations,” select “Scripts.”Step 3. Click “+ Script” and paste the script that Russell Savage wrote into your account.Step 4. Apply the script to the ad groups or campaigns that contain the adverts you want the countdown timer to run for. Full instructions on how to edit the script to do this are on Google’s Developers page.Step 5. Add parameters to your advert that will be replaced with the number of hours remaining. For example: Only {param1:a few} days {param2:and} hours left!Savvy shoppers make as many as 9 visits to your e-commerce store before they make a purchase. However, Google shows you only the last keyword that was clicked on before a user makes a purchase. What this hides is that you have several profitable keywords within your account contributing to conversions, but they have no conversions attributed to them. Because the keywords look unprofitable, advertisers routinely pause them, thinking that they are a waste of money. However, without these keywords, users would not have found the brand and consequently would not have made a purchase down the line.For example, here is a search funnel for a fictitious airline company. You can see that a searcher first found the website by searching “Hawaii vacations,” then saw an ad when they searched “flights to Hawaii,” and then finally visited the website again when they searched “flyaway Hawaii” to book their holiday. In the company’s AdWords reports, the company would see only one conversion for “flyaway Hawaii,” which would hide the fact that without having ads appear for “Hawaii vacations,” the searcher would never have found the website.To see the keywords that contributed to the conversion, the company would need to look at the click-assisted conversions column and the impressions-assisted conversions column. These would show which keywords and adverts contributed to a conversion. Before you pause a keyword that is not performing well, make sure you view these columns. Also, make sure the keyword is not part of a search funnel. Otherwise, you are likely to significantly reduce your conversions if the keyword is fundamental to people discovering your brand in the first place.Attribution modeling is also important when bidding in AdWords, and it’s very important that you choose the right model. Google provides 5 different models you can use to analyze your data. As this is quite an in-depth topic, I won’t discuss it here. However, to learn about it, I would suggest reading “embracing the reality of multi-touch attribution.”Single keyword ad groups are one of the most effective methods of improving the performance of your account. When Audi applied them to their account, they saw a 50% reduction in the cost per lead and a 106% increase in conversions.So, what are single keyword ad groups and why do they work this well?Simply put, they are ad groups with just one keyword and two ads.The reason this works so well is the ads in the ad group will show only for that one keyword, which means you can make the ads highly specific to that keyword. As a result, you will see a considerable increase in CTR.Furthermore, you can direct people to the most relevant landing page. For example, if the keyword is men’s medium red t-shirts, you can use the filters on your website to send users to that exact page. The beauty of this is that you achieve a good increase in conversion rate as people see exactly what they searched for straight away.In an ideal world, you would have every keyword in your account in its own single keyword ad group. But the problem with doing this is that it would take forever. Instead, be smart. I have found that 85% of conversions come from the top 5% of keywords in an account. This roughly correlates to every search query with 2 or more conversions. So create single keyword ad groups only for these search queries. I won’t go through how to create single keyword ad groups here because there are already several guides, such as this one and this one from Unbounce.If you have thousands of keywords generating thousands more search queries, keeping on top of them can be very difficult and time-consuming. However, there is an easier way. It takes a little bit of time to set up, but once you have it set up, it will work automatically, and you won’t need to think about it again.Daniel Gilbert recently wrote a script that effectively puts the keywords back into AdWords Shopping Campaigns. It works like this: You add the keywords that you want your shopping campaigns to be shown for into a spreadsheet. The script then reads the search query report. If the search query does not match your keywords in your spreadsheet, then it’s added as a negative keyword. Each ad group has its own set of keywords, which can be defined in a spreadsheet, giving you unlimited control.To get this script to work, all you have to do is download it here, and then create a new spreadsheet in Google Docs.In your spreadsheet, you need three columns – campaign, ad group, and keywords. Every row of the campaign column should read “Exact Shopping.” Then, enter the ad groups and the only keywords that you want your shopping ads to be shown for in the ad group and keywords columns.Finally, change the URL in the script on line 15 to the URL of your spreadsheet, and schedule the script to run once per day. The script will run daily and will add any search queries from the previous day that don’t match your keyword list as negative keywords.One thing that surprises me when I’m managing e-commerce AdWords accounts is the number of advertisers who don’t know their customer lifetime value. On average, 32% of customers will place a second order within the first year of purchasing from you, and 5.48% will purchase from you 6 times. Furthermore, on average, the customer lifetime value is 46.2% higher than the initial purchase value. Of course, this will vary from industry to industry. To maximize your PPC returns, you need to do two things. First, you need to maximize your customer lifetime value by adding upsells, encouraging purchasing multiple items using offers, and selling effectively using email campaigns, to name a few. By doing this, you can afford to spend more to acquire customers, and you can generate a lot more traffic to your website.Second, you need to calculate your customer lifetime value. Once you know your customer lifetime value, you can better assess how much to spend on your paid search marketing campaigns, and you can scale your budgets accordingly. Any of these 8 AdWords mistakes can have a significant impact on your ROI. So review your AdWords account and ensure that you’re not making these mistakes. If you are, take positive steps to fix them.Do you have any questions after reading this article?

Marketing costs money, so the higher your conversion rate, the more bang you get for your buck.Improving your conversion rate is a great goal, but to do that, we need to look at your conversion tracking.One of the fundamental ideas behind conversion rate optimization (CRO) is the notion that you are effectively tracking conversions.Think about it, in order to improve your conversion rates, you have to actually know what your conversion rate is to begin with!And, to do that, you need fantastic conversion tracking in place.Unfortunately, most marketers aren’t tracking their conversions effectively. To understand how this affects conversion rate, let’s take a look at how well marketers are implementing conversion tracking in AdWords.AdWords is an ideal medium for conversion tracking.Google itself makes implementing conversion tracking incredibly easy and paid search is typically a direct response marketing channel, which means that most of your conversions should be directly attributable to clicks on specific campaigns.In contrast, higher funnel marketing campaigns like social media or branding efforts can be a lot harder to effectively track.It’s doable, but it’s harder.Since conversion tracking is so easy in AdWords, you’d think that every marketer would have great conversion tracking in place, right?Sadly, that’s not the case.Over the past 2 years, we’ve audited well over 2,000 AdWords accounts at Disruptive Advertising. Amongst all of those audits, perhaps one of the most common problems was a lack of effective conversion tracking.To the credit of everyone who’s encouraged conversion tracking over the years, 57.7% of AdWords accounts had set up some level of conversion tracking.But, if only 57.7% of accounts have tracking in place, then 42.3% of AdWords account managers have absolutely no idea whether or not their campaigns are working.Not surprisingly, AdWords campaigns without tracking rarely turn a profit.In fact, according to Hubspot’s State of Inbound report, 97% of inbound marketing campaigns without tracking fail.So, even in AdWords—one of the most trackable marketing platforms—42% of campaigns have almost no chance of success.Of the 58% of AdWords accounts with conversion tracking, half were only tracking a small percentage of their actual conversions.In other words, 29% of AdWords accounts are technically tracking conversions, but their setup is so poor that they might as well not be tracking anything at all.For example, in the plumbing/HVAC industry, phone calls are a major source of leads.However, most plumbing/HVAC companies only track form submissions, which are few and far between—making forms a terrible indicator of campaign effectiveness!Plumbers aren’t the only ones with this problem, either. Many companies with millions of clicks have only a handful of conversions to their name.Are they tracking conversions?Technically, the answer is “yes,” but their conversion tracking isn’t painting an accurate picture of the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.Generally speaking, a conversion rate of 2-3% is considered “typical” for an AdWords account.Based on our data, it’s easy to see why:Clearly, the vast majority of accounts—regardless of how many clicks they get—fall into the 0-5% conversion rate window.A couple of years ago, Wordstream ran an analysis on hundreds of AdWords accounts to try and create conversion rate benchmarks for AdWords performance.Here’s what they found:To validate their results and see if anything had changed, we used Wordstream’s criteria and ran the same analysis on our audit data.Not surprisingly, our results were very similar:Here’s how the conversion rate distribution breaks down.As you can see, 75% of AdWords accounts have a conversion rate between 0% and 5.34%.It’s a little harder to calculate from this chart, but the top 10% of advertisers have a conversion rate of over 11.03% (in Wordstream’s study, the top 10% had a conversion rate of 11.45% or better).So, if more than 5.34% of your clicks are converting, that means your conversion rate is better than 75% of AdWords advertisers.If your conversion rate is above 11.03%, your account is in the top 10% of all AdWords accounts.Great news, right?Well, maybe…As we were replicating Wordstream’s analysis, we realized that our results weren’t representative of actual account performance.The data was skewed by bad conversion tracking.Remember, in our audit process, we discovered that while 58% of AdWords accounts were tracking conversions, only 29% actually had an effective setup in place.By including all of those poorly-tracked accounts in our analysis, we were heavily underestimating the actual conversion rate of AdWords accounts.To Wordstream’s credit, they had tried to account for this by excluding accounts with less than 10 conversions, but that still left a lot of accounts that we knew from our audit process weren’t tracking conversions effectively.So, we reran our analysis. But, this time we only included the few hundred accounts we knew had good conversion tracking in place.Here’s what we found:Here’s the conversion rate distribution for well-tracked AdWords accounts:As it turned out, well-tracked AdWords accounts have a nearly 50% higher conversion rate than the average AdWords account.What does that mean for your company?Well, if you are advertising on AdWords and have conversion tracking in place, it’s even odds that you are only tracking two-thirds of your conversions.If you’re advertising in one of those harder-to-track channels like social media, you’re probably missing out on even more conversions.This brings us back to improving conversion rates.To put it simply, the easiest way to improve your conversion rate is to start effectively tracking the conversions you are already getting.That means tracking everything—phone calls, form submissions, sales, sign-ups, online chats, in-store visits—everything!In many cases, simply accounting for your missing conversions will increase your conversion rate by 50% or more…overnight.This will probably make your boss very happy in the short-term, but—more importantly—it will set you up for long-term success.Think about it, if you are only tracking some of your conversions, do you really know which campaigns are your top producers?A campaign that drives very few form submissions may actually generate a ton of chat leads. But, if you aren’t tracking chats, you might assume one of your top campaigns is a flop.Regardless of which online marketing medium you’re using, great analytics tracking is key to advertising success. Without the right data, you could be leaving a ton of money on the table.By knowing which campaigns deserve your dollar, you can dramatically improve your conversion rate, return-on-investment and capture a lot more market share.So, take the time to work with an analytics platform like Kissmetrics or Google Analytics, get your conversion tracking set up right and start making more money.Proper conversion tracking can make a world of a difference to your conversion rate.We’ve seen the short- and long-term benefits of implementing effective conversion tracking with hundreds of clients, so it’s well worth the time and effort.The data may not always be as clearcut as our AdWords findings, but regardless of how you are marketing your company, quality conversion tracking is always the key to better conversion rates.How does conversion data affect your online marketing decisions?

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/data-management-plan/,How to Craft a Data Management Plan that Pays You Back,"When it comes to wrangling and taming Big Data, a data management plan is a solid first step. But what exactly is it and what does it involve? More importantly, how can you create such a plan? In this article, we’ll be taking a look at how businesses large and small can create data management plans that are both smart and seamless.Silos were meant to help keep people focused on their respective tasks. Instead, they divide people, waste resources and hamper productivity. The very groups that need to be working together the most, namely sales and marketing, are shut off from each other which in turn stifles growth and innovation.Instead, creating a more hub-and-spoke collaborative center, where each group feeds into and extracts relevant information from said Big Data, is where forward-thinking companies and organizations are headed.Image Source: CompendianDesignate at least one person from each group to be the “representative” – and this applies to C-level executives too. These are going to be the people who essentially build and steer the Big Data ship. It’s easy to get lost in the sheer volume of information. Alongside these representatives, name people from each group who will oversee the various strategies to ensure that they’re continually on point and not being bogged down by minor details and technicalities.One of the biggest sticking points with Big Data is the question “how is this really relevant to us?” Realize that different pieces of the Big Data pie are going to matter to different groups and seeing how it all comes together is like a fantastic puzzle. There’s good stuff in the details, as well as the big picture.At this point, however, it’s really easy to get caught up in the sheer volume of it all. But as with every good marketing strategy, you’ll need to ask yourself:“What’s going to bring us the biggest lifts?”And make those your priority. Then gradually trickle down through lesser and lesser priority pieces until the whole thing comes together.
At this point, ideas should be coming together from all the different representatives and groups you have working together. And it’s very likely that you’ll want to jump right in and start getting your hands dirty with all the data.  But take the time to figure out how you’ll be organizing that information first. If you don’t do this at the beginning, the data will start to accumulate like a snowball rolling downhill, and eventually it will bury everyone and everything in its path.It’s also worth noting that your Data Management Plan needs to have security as its foremost priority. Kiki Burton, Senior Manager of Product Strategy at Adobe reiterates on her podcast just how crucial security is when you’re formulating such a plan. In her interview, she comments that:With this in mind, Kiki further advises that companies interested in building such a strategy take an inventory of all of the first party data they have. First party data includes:There’s also the data collected by surveys, email marketing and other avenues – all just sitting there mostly untapped and unused. Once you have those points nailed down, then you can see about getting other information to round out your user profiles.You may be surprised to learn what other departments in your newly cohesive group have as data. It may be something your own group never knew about or never thought to use. Here again, when we build these silos (more like giant walls) between departments, crucial information like this tends to fall through the cracks. So it’s as much an organizational mission as it is a learning experience.Now that you have all the data together, it’s time to decide what’s relevant. Here again, relevancy depends on your industry and what the end goal is. You could be selling an entirely digital product and be focused on subscriptions and sign ups.Or you could be a retailer focused on in-store engagements like QR codes, co-branded credit cards and other promotional magnets. All of that information needs to be prioritized and put into the plan. This is what helps you build and “flesh out” your user personas without using any personally identifiable information.Remember that as your users interact with your site across multiple types of media, multiple devices and different promotions, you’ll be gathering information as well as providing them with a branded experience. Data management goes well beyond advertising and seeps into every interaction your customer has with you – from email to shopping in-store, to upsells, down sells and cross-sells.The bottom line when it comes to creating the kind of system that pays you back is what Kiki calls the “data economy”. In her words, “it’s not just about buying data for advertising; it goes back to this larger, more cohesive personalization message and really having a platform where brands and publishers can exchange data and share data in an open marketplace.” Like it or not, the Data Economy is here to stay, and you’d better start crafting a plan now to help make sense of it. Fortunately, you’ve now got the starting points and a more concrete idea on what to draw upon to make it happen.Have you built a data management plan using the strategies outlined here?

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/urgency-to-fuel-ecommerce-sales/,How to Create Urgency to Fuel eCommerce Sales,"Swift action.Our marketing and sales teams dream of prospects who see our product, know they want it, and then buy without hesitation.We all know that’s an anomaly. Most sales require your team to nurture the customer relationship and even demo the product. However, there is a way to speed up the process. The key is to create a sense of urgency that will move the buyer forward in the sales cycle.Dan Tyre, sales director at HubSpot, writes, “[The] top 2% salespeople can recognize ‘tells’ in prospects that indicate whether they’ll move toward purchase or delay the process.”It’s time to harness the power of your team’s existing expertise with practical steps. Let’s explore how to create a sense of urgency within your customers.Urgency gives us a reason to think differently about our purchases.Expert behavioral psychologists found that “urgent situations cause us to suspend deliberate thought and to act quickly.”By creating a sense of urgency in the sales process, you motivate potential buyers to take action on your website. And that includes signing up for an email, enrolling in a free webinar, or actually purchasing your services.Your goal is to break through the cognitive friction that delays people from converting. Be wary of assuming that urgency equals persuasion. Because no level of motivation will convince someone to buy a horrible product that doesn’t meet a need.“Winning a conversion takes two things: A feeling of desire (“I’ve got to have this thing!”) and a nudge that refuses to allow the lead to procrastinate (“But I’ll get it later”). Your sales copy is the hook, and urgency is the tug on the reel,” writes Joel Klettke, a conversion-focused copywriter at Business Casual Copywriting.The longer your prospect waits to make a purchase, the less likely the sale will actually happen. More time translates into unrelated life distractions, the opportunity to shop with a competitor, and mental barriers to hinder the deal. Procrastination is not your friend. Build urgency to seal the deal.Words have meaning. Therefore, every word on your website matters. So, choose wisely.Write copy that will be a no-brainer for customers to take action. The key is to resonate with the shopper’s inner thoughts to sell your services.Start by showcasing benefits, not features. Give visitors a glimpse of the results they will receive after using your services. People don’t buy products to remain stagnant. Showcase how your product will make their lives better. Highlighting the value-added benefits will keep you at the top of their minds. Vishal Ray Malik, founder of ConversionLink, notes that urgency is a driving force for effective sales copy. He suggests using a few of these keywords:Inbound.org knows how to create urgency. Here’s an example of how the company elicits a response:To understand which words trigger action within your customer base, spend less time selling. Instead, focus more time listening to your consumer’s word choices. Tell your team to jot down what your clients are saying during sales calls or demos. You also can have your live chat agents record specific examples after chat sessions.In the end, you want to help your prospects recognize their needs and why now is the best time to buy. Give them a reason to solve their problems today, not tomorrow.Scarcity can entice people to take action. It’s human nature to want to be part of something special. And to speed up the sales process, businesses must tap into their customers’ brains to create that scarcity.“Businesses keep this legacy alive by creating new products or consistently updating versions of the products they already sell. Anything new and improved, or rebranded, helps a salesperson who is creating a sense of urgency,” says Borja Obeso, Founder of Rebel Growth.Another way is to include countdown timers on your product page, rather than showing the date the sale ends. MakersKit implements this strategy on sale items. Timers give the precise “deadline” of when a customer will miss an opportunity. So, it encourages the consumer to either buy or face the consequence of not having the product.Moreover, clarifying the consequences of inaction may induce FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). This occurs when people don’t want to be left out of the “in” crowd or conversation. Restricting quantity works, too. It produces exclusivity. Knowing that a limited supply exists tramples procrastination and entices people to take part. Amazon is well known for this technique.Limited offers let consumers know up front that action is necessary, in order to obtain what they desire.E-commerce centers around being the most visually attractive product. People hate ugly websites, and don’t trust them either. Smart design can be used to appeal to a customer’s sense of urgency. Graphical elements, like color, size, and shape, play a major role in whether people click a call-to-action or abandon a shopping cart. Colors impact your customers’ buying decisions. Oranges, reds, and similar shades work well because they remind us of emergencies. Zendesk, a customer service software company, uses orange for their “Try it for free” button.Arrows can also help draw people’s attention to particular information or deals. Notice how content curation tool Quuu uses an arrow to highlight their “hand curated, not machines” benefit.Copywriter Christina Boyes, says, “Most designers and marketing writers will tell you that placing social proof and testimonies near the call to action buttons can improve your credibility and improve conversions.”Video hosting company Wistia adds testimonials to their pricing page to help induce sales faster.Induce emotion with your visual cues. And compel customers to learn more about your services. Influencing their behavior will create an urgent demand for your product.Knowing what to do is half the battle. The other 50% involves knowing what will not cause urgency amongst potential customers. So, sit down with your team and discuss the copy and design tactics that should be eliminated from your website conversion strategy. Here’s a list to get you started:Use these no-nos as a foundation to build an honest sales campaign. Your customers will value your business more.Urgency is part of our human DNA. Sometimes, we just need a little push to move forward. Learn how urgency can work for your business model. Word selection in your copy determines whether your customer will act or not. Offer limited offers to pique interest. Produce visual aids to draw in the buyer. And avoid common pitfalls, like dishonesty.Don’t wait for sales. Instead, create customer urgency.About the Author: Shayla Price lives at the intersection of digital marketing, technology and social responsibility. Connect with her on Twitter @shaylaprice.",
,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/google-analytics-360/,Google Analytics 360 Suite: What You Need to Know,"In a marketing world that’s buzzing with phrases like “marketing stack integration”, it’s no big surprise that Google is in the early stages of releasing a new suite of enterprise-level products that together, form a more comprehensive platform. Google Analytics 360 aims to help marketers get a holistic view of their online marketing efforts via fewer standalone tools.But the question is: Will Google Analytics 360 truly make online marketing a more seamless experience, or will users still be missing the key information they need to make more informed marketing decisions–that previously has been supplied by third party solutions?The verdict is still out on whether or not this new suite of products will be an instance of “jack of all trades, but a master of none.” In the meantime, let’s look at what’s new, the details of the DMP, and how Kissmetrics compares to Google Analytics 360.Within the Google Analytics 360 suite, there are six products (four new, two re-branded) aimed at connecting  a marketer’s daily work. The new products are still in limited beta testing, and introductions to current Premium customers is just rolling out now::Google Analytics 360: Formerly known as Google Analytics Premium–the paid, enterprise level tool for large companies.Google Optimize 360: This product in the suite allows marketers to A/B test experiences without having to write any code. From here, marketers can pinpoint which site/ad variation is most successful for different audience segments.Google Audience Center 360: The data management platform that ties in with Google DoubleClick and Adwords (as well as other third-party providers and demand-side ad platforms) to help marketers connect with customers on different channels and devices.Google Tag Manager 360: Home to tag management of APIs and site code for streamlined workflows and more efficient decision-making.Google Data Studio 360: Tool for quickly and easily sharing real-time marketing data visualizations across company departments.Google Attribution 360: Cross-channel attribution tool that tracks all marketing spend information (online and offline) to determine overall marketing performance by channel.Limited screenshots of the suite have been released, but this image from Business Insider helps us get a better feel for what the dashboard will look like for users:The intent of the products in the suite is to help enterprise marketers connect the data across platforms, including mobile, PPC, and offline marketing channels, to name a few.Google commissioned a study by Forrester Research to discover what pain points marketers were truly struggling with today. According to the study’s findings, marketers reported that their success depended largely on their ability to integrate analytics with other advertising and marketing technologies. The study also found that found that the most successful marketers tied their marketing data directly to business goals.One of the big questions so far is: How’s it different? While Oracle and Adobe are already offering cloud-based DMPs, Google Analytics 360 enters the market as a DMP add-on for more data quality control–meaning users will likely use it in addition to an existing, more robust DMP–not as a standalone.One of the unique details of Google Analytics 360 is that while it of course integrates with Google resources like AdWords and DoubleClick, it also integrates with other standalone tools like Optimizely that allow marketers to test sales funnel workflows, page layouts, offers, and more. Optimize 360 extends these testing capabilities to PPC advertising, too.The open system helps marketers ensure they’re not duplicating remarketing efforts by allowing imports of both first-party and third-party data. The suite also touts its focus on user privacy, and the fact that users can be tracked safely without putting their personal data at risk.Currently, SMBs are not being targeted as Google Analytics 360 customers at this point in time. That being said, the free tools offered in Google Analytics 5 will still be available for SMB users–but it appears that Google’s hope is to build up more premium, paid GA users via the new suite’s increased functionality.For those enterprise-level marketers who are interested in the suite’s products, there will be an opportunity to purchase products a la carte, but specific details on price point have not yet been released. The good news is that since the platform is open, users won’t be forced into using only Google-based products–and that means more PPC advertising options.Early testing of Google Analytics 360 has been opened to a few select customers, such as L’Oreal Canada, Progressive, and Google-owned Nest. A few case studies with these companies showed positive results, but it’s still unclear how the initial enterprise users will view the product once it is fully released.If you’re wondering how Kissmetrics is different from Google Analytics 360 (as opposed to the free version of Google Analytics), here’s what you need to know:Kissmetrics is a people-based analytics platform, tying all visits back to a person across whatever devices they use. Our tools let you see how specific users found you, help identify who your power users are, and allow you to study cohorts of different people. Google Analytics 360, however, still takes a more session-based analytics approach–so despite the new focus on mobile, user data on multiple devices can become cloudy and confusing at times.It also appears that Google Analytics 360 is still lacking an effective conversion optimization resource beyond testing. Kissmetrics helps marketers optimize their marketing with tools like Engage, which allows marketers to target the right people and nudge them towards conversion.Will the Google Analytics 360 Suite be worth the investment for all enterprise-level companies? It’s hard to say at this point. However, the open system and early case studies do show some promise. As marketing integration becomes even more of a top-priority for harried marketers across multiple departments, this new suite may rolling out at just the right moment.About the Author: Kaleigh Moore is a social media consultant and copywriter who helps SaaS companies craft intelligent content with a charming human element.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/biggest-customer-acquisition-mistake/,The Biggest Customer Acquisition Mistake Your Company is Probably Making,"Generating new sales leads and acquiring new customers are the biggest obsessions of every sales team and startup founder. Companies spend big money on lead generation, PPC ads, social media marketing, sponsored posts, content marketing, and other varieties of inbound lead generation techniques to get new customers. But what if I told you that the real problem facing your business is not “getting” new customers – it’s “keeping” the new customers that are already interested in your company? The biggest customer acquisition mistake that many companies make is not qualifying their new sales leads. Without careful handling and a consistent process to get to know your new prospective customers, your new sales leads are likely to fall through the cracks.Here is a surprising truth about digital marketing: many companies are pulling out all the stops to get new customers, and then not paying any attention to what happens once those new customers actually reach out to contact the company. Inbound lead generation is a huge preoccupation for many sales teams and digital marketers, with big spending on automated lead generation software, content marketing platforms, social media ads, and all of the other ways that companies invest in generating new sales leads. But here’s the disconnect: after spending all that money, far too many companies don’t make any effort to analyze, sort, rank, and prioritize their follow-up strategy for these new business leads. Some new leads are urgently ready to buy and are eager to enter the sales process; others are just doing their preliminary research and might need a longer-term “lead nurturing” process before they have enough trust and confidence in your solution to be ready to buy. But too many companies act like every new sales lead is the same! According to statistics cited by HubSpot, 61% of B2B marketers simply send all of their new sales leads directly to the sales team, but only 27% of these leads are actually qualified and ready to buy. This means that there is a huge amount of wasted time and miscommunication happening. If you’re sending unqualified sales leads to your sales team – without even asking any preliminary questions to get to know the prospects better – you are wasting your sales people’s time and missing out on big sales opportunities. Every unqualified sales lead is diverting your sales team’s attention from better-qualified leads that are more eager and ready to buy. Here are a few easy ways to improve your inbound lead qualification process to make sure your sales team is getting the best sales leads – and thus saving time and delivering more efficient sales results: Whenever your company hears from a new sales lead for the first time – whether it’s a phone call or email or social media contact – you need to have a process in place to follow up with that prospect and ask them a few preliminary questions. This is called “pre-qualifying” your sales leads – you need to find out upfront how much they know about your company, how far along they are in their purchasing process, and how much “pain” they’re experiencing that is motivating them to buy. For example, you could ask the following questions – either by phone or via an email or even an online intake form:Note that all of these questions are open-ended – not simple “yes/no” questions. Your goal is to get your prospects to open up a bit and share what’s on their mind – this can give you good insights into which prospects are really ready to buy. Pre-qualifying sales leads is not an exact science – sometimes prospects will be misleading or vague – but having a preliminary conversation is an essential step to get your sales process started.Once you’ve asked preliminary questions and gotten some feedback from the prospect, it’s time to rank your sales leads in priority order. You can make this as simple as ranking them as “A, B, C” – with “A” leads being the most urgently ready to buy, and “C” leads requiring longer-term follow-up. Again – ranking sales leads is not an exact science – sometimes your “A” leads will turn out to be more lukewarm than they seemed at first, and “C” leads might turn out to suddenly be ready to buy. But it’s a good start to help your sales team prioritize the leads that require immediate follow-up.The most efficient sales organizations know that the sales process starts with pre-qualifying your sales leads. Many sales teams have a misguided focus on acquiring new customers at the expense of everything else. Yes, of course it’s important to get new sales leads – but what happens once you have first contact with those new sales leads matters even more. Without a consistent process to pre-qualify and rank sales leads, your sales team is likely to get overwhelmed with too many bad sales leads and too many wrong approaches. Help your sales team get off on the right foot in building relationships with new customers – pre-qualify your new sales leads and learn more about what your customers want, before they ever talk to a sales person.About the Author: Gregg Schwartz is the vice president of sales and marketing at Strategic Sales & Marketing, a lead-generation firm based in Connecticut.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/retain-customers/,Retain More Customers Using These Three Proven Techniques,"If your customer retention rate looks more like the jagged drop off of a cliff instead a glorious mountaintop – you know you’re in trouble. Assuming you’ve got all the major pieces of the puzzle put together — you’re gathering relevant data, creating tailored marketing campaigns and engaging with your customers in a way that makes them feel cared for, you may be asking yourself…“What else could possibly be wrong?”Maybe you hit all the right buttons when it comes to social, or you’re a master at lead nurturing. But people are still leaving in droves. Sit back. Take a deep breath.Maybe it’s not your marketing that’s at fault. Maybe it’s your approach to it. Let’s take a closer look:In a recent survey from Adobe and eConsultancy, client-side marketers were asked which touch points were most important in the customer experience. Take a look at these numbers — particularly the “not important” percentages:Text messaging, push messages and even apps themselves have wide swaths of participants noting that they’re “not a focus”.Have you ever wanted to reach through your screen and shake someone? Because this survey’s results just might make you do it.Repeat after me: “Every interaction a customer has with our company deserves our attention and focus.”It should be seamless. Branded. As tailored and invaluable to the customer as possible. You wouldn’t think an app could be part of someone’s lifestyle, but there are plenty of examples to show that it can.Check out Ikea’s app — with 3D furniture modeling, print media tie-ins and much more:Image source: LocalyticsThe app could’ve just been a reprint of Ikea’s catalog. Or pushed sale notifications to the customer, but it does much more by eliminating a problem that many furniture shoppers have — wondering how the end result will look in their home.Now, you may not have Ikea’s app ingenuity, much less their budget. But ask yourself what unique, exclusive or otherwise share-worthy features can you add to improve any facet of the customer experience? There’s a reason — perhaps more than one — why customers are leaving. And if tangible reasons (product quality) aren’t it, it could be because your competition is giving them something they can’t get anywhere else.Here’s another big reason customers are leaving. They know they can comparison shop, read reviews and take to social media to get feedback and recommendations from others. If they email customer service with a problem, and they get an auto response that says “Do not reply to this email. Messages to this inbox will not be replied to” How do you think that reflects on the company?It’s great that you’ve automated your email system. But business hours are going the way of the dial-up modem. When people have so many channels to interact with and get assistance from — if you can’t give it to them, they’ll simply go elsewhere.It’s understandable that you can’t man the phones every hour of every day. But there’s hope. A study from IBM Retail Research showed higher levels of customer satisfaction with a DIY model. The reasoning? Customers are a lot more patient and forgiving of themselves when it comes to self-service. According to the survey, 72% of respondents prefer it over picking up the phone, and a whopping 91% would use it if it were available.Here’s another retention strategy that will perk your customer numbers back up. Write relevant content. “But Sherice!” I can hear you saying “We already produce awesome content!”Hey, that’s great! How useful is it?[Silence…]It’s true, you’re producing awesome content. Surveys show that your customers are eagerly lapping it up. And that’s precisely the way it should be.The problem is, they’re taking, taking, taking — and not giving back. Look at these numbers. We can all say with confidence that we’re creating the kind of content people want. But watch the numbers nosedive when it comes to figuring out the ROI of that content:It’s not rocket surgery. And determining the dollar value of your content is easily done using Google Analytics and Excel. Here’s a step by step guide from the Content Marketing Institute.But this only measures the dollar value of the traffic and its ranking in the search engines.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/cta-button-your-leads-click/,Building a CTA Button Your Leads Can’t Help But Click,"It’s the great marketing paradox. We spend hours brainstorming and months testing the copy of our calls-to-action, but whether we ask our users to Sign Up Now, Start a Free Trial, Get Started, Request Access, or Learn More, all we really want them to do it click the button. Just click the button. So why do so many of our quality leads fail to comply with our simple request? The way your CTA button is set up on a landing page is just as important as the CTA itself. Otherwise, it’s a button to nowhere.Visual appeal is everything. Before they see your CTA button, your landing page is the first impression your potential customers will have. Choose attractive, simple imagery – if your page is cluttered, your visitors won’t know where to look. Color scheme also is important: Using complementary but contrasting colors help a page to pop. Notice how the below example from PopSurvey is coordinated with shades of blue, allowing the pink in the logo and CTA to pop out on the page. The secondary CTA, “Pricing & Sign Up” in the header is a slightly duller pink that still stands out but doesn’t distract from the main call-to-action button.Ensure your page is easy to read and draws the attention of your customers’ eyes – don’t make them strain to read the text. The following landing page from Website Magazine is cluttered, has too many distracting colors, and small text. It’s impossible to know where to look!Customers won’t have the patience to stay on your page if they don’t know what you’re offering. Use clear, strong wording to elicit the quick reactions that all good Calls-to-Action invoke. Active verbs like “join” or “discover” can make people feel like they’ll be a part of something or learn something new. Negative questions like “worried?” and “confused?” can tap into human fears – always an attention-getter. And make it personal and urgent – use pronouns like “your” or “my” to convey ownership, as well as time-sensitive words, as in “Get my free newsletter now.”Dollar Shave Club is the perfect example of this. They speak to men (notice the “No commitment”) in a take-it-or-leave-it offer. Do it or don’t. Either way, it’s impossible to miss that big CTA.The copy here is also fantastic. It flows well, the value proposition is clear, and each sentence subsequently gets shorter up to the CTA. At Socedo, one of our landing pages, is frill-free. We’re still A/B testing variations around “Start My Free Trial” or “Start My 14-Day Free Trial.” Regardless, previous testing has confirmed that the phrase “Free Trial” is crucial to our CTA buttons. It’s simple and to the point, and users know exactly what will happen when they click the button. No matter where you look on our site–the landing page, the navigation, or the blog–you’ll see a blue button with the “Free Trial” copy. But just like any marketing strategy, you should always be A/B testing. What works for one brand might not work for another, and things can change over time. Drive more leads by offering your unique selling point. When a customer clicks on your CTA button, they should know why it will benefit them. Start with a confident headline on the page that conveys a key value you offer, and support it with a subhead that explains it. Follow with clear button copy that encourages users to claim these benefits. If you’re like everyone else – boring and wordy – you won’t get your customers to pay attention or even to think about clicking your CTA. Add personality, emotions and enthusiasm to help draw in customers. This landing page from Manpacks is fantastic and hilarious. It has a header with a clear benefit, in this case convenience on men’s essentials. Then the subhead explains exactly what Manpacks offers. By the time the user reaches the CTA button, they already know what they are going to “Get Started” with.Sqord is a fitness and game tracking wristband for kids. Their landing page isn’t bad. It has a coherent color theme that reflects the audience and the product, the button pops, and it gets to the point. The headline is catchy but not very specific, and the subhead only provides a few more surface-level details: “Sqord is your online world, powered by real world play.” By the time the user reaches the button text “Buy Sqord Membership & Gear” it’s hard to know what they’re actually buying. Is it the wristband, the app, or both? And why should I care?You always want what you can’t have, right? It’s all about urgency. Customers hate missing out on a short-term offer. Focus on deadline phrases such as “limited time” or give them and end date. Add exclusivity to your product, when appropriate, with phrases like “while supplies last.” And CTAs that save money will always be a winning tactic. Customers can’t ignore it.This landing page from Slope, a visual marketing platform, creates FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) by implying only a limited number of people will be allowed access to the beta. In addition to avoiding this negative, the button creates a positive experience of exclusivity. If you’re one of the select few who request early access, you’ll be part of the inner club–the talk of the town at your next marketers’ get-together. You’ll probably notice a pattern to the successful landing page CTAs mentioned here. They all have a high-benefit header, an explanatory subhead, and a button with active verbs. They all have a coordinated color palette, with the button standing out. They all get right to the point.Most importantly, they all have some level of creativity. You can read as many prescriptive tips for CTA buttons as possible, but at the end of the day, it’s the unexpected element of your page that will give you the edge for higher conversion rates.About the Author: Aseem Badshah, Founder and CEO of Socedo.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/determining-keywords-to-bid-on/,A Step-by-Step Guide for Determining Keywords to Bid On,"When it comes to pay-per-click (PPC) and paid ads, a lot goes into these campaigns. You have to create the landing page, design the ad, and set up a framework for the campaign. Not to mention A/B testing various aspects of the ad and landing page.If there’s one step that can’t be overlooked when setting up your campaign, it’s selecting keywords to bid on. Keywords make or break a PPC campaign because they determine who sees your ad and who doesn’t. Even the most clever paid ads will fail if they don’t get in front of the right people.Choosing keywords wisely ensures your audience is well-targeted and relevant, and your budget is put to good use. These 4 steps are all you need to determine the best keywords for your next paid campaign.The first step in choosing keywords for any campaign is to brainstorm a big, long list of potential terms. Your list should be based on the landing pages the ads will link to.The key is to get inside your customer’s mind. What are they searching for? How do they phrase search queries? What are they typing into that magic Google box when they’re looking for your product? Don’t forget to include synonyms that customers might use instead of another word and alternate spellings.Another thing to consider: Your list should include both head terms and long-tail keyword phrases. Head terms are broader and likely bring in a lot of search volume, while long-tail phrases get your ads in front of a highly targeted audience — so it’s good to include both in your campaigns.To ensure you have a comprehensive list, consider all 4 types of keyword terms:The sky’s the limit, so find a whiteboard and list every keyword you can muster to consider bidding on. You’ll whittle this down later, so it’s impossible to have too many keywords at this stage. Once you’ve completely racked your brain, we can move on to Step 2.Local search keywords are exactly what they sound like — search terms that involve a particular location. The query “shoe stores in wicker park, chicago” is a good example. For businesses that are more than e-commerce, these are a big deal. With so many searches happening on mobile devices, these queries bring you even closer to an actual sale. If you have a brick & mortar location, local search keywords will draw the most engaged and relevant audience to your site and your store, because searchers are literally right down the road from you.Keep local search in mind when creating and refining your list of keywords. Be sure to include terms that relate to your street address, neighborhood, and town. There’s nothing more valuable than getting your ads in front of potential customers who are looking for exactly what you offer, right where you are.Now that you have a huge list of more keywords than you can possibly bid on, it’s time to start narrowing it down. The most effective way to choose which terms to eliminate and which to keep is to weigh relevance.The key to determining how relevant a search term is is to consider the searcher’s intent. Are people who search this term actually looking for what you offer? And how likely are they to buy from you? For example, if your industry has strong brands, then search traffic around competitor terms may not be relevant enough to include. Users who search explicitly for a particular brand — i.e. “Nike shoes” — are probably not interested in buying from Puma.Another important factor to consider is where in the buying cycle users are. Someone who searches “Nike Womens Free 4.0 Flyknit” is probably a lot closer to making a purchase than someone searching “good running shoes.” Depending on the type of content your ads link to, you’ll want to target terms that indicate a particular time in the buyer’s journey. If your ad is for a blog post called “What Characteristics Make a Great Running Shoe,” then target users early in the cycle. For product-specific landing pages, you want to get in front of people who are ready to make a purchase.Negative keywords are terms and phrases that you explicitly don’t want your ads to show for. By including them in your campaign, you’re essentially telling Google, Don’t waste my budget on these terms. As your campaign runs, you can find negative keywords in your search query reports. If you see any terms that aren’t a good fit for your campaign (they’re irrelevant or offensive, or user intent doesn’t fit), you can add them to your negative keywords at any time. However, you should be able to identify some negative terms right off the bat. For example, if you’re located in Tulsa, you can eliminate queries like “shoe stores in atlanta ga.” If you’re selling software that doesn’t include a freemium option, omit terms like those pictured above. Including these from the get-go will help you spend your budget on terms that actually drive revenue.By now, you should have a decent-sized list of keywords that have been refined to reflect what your business really does and what your customers really search for. This list is your ideal campaign. However, now you need to consider the competition for these keywords and how much you’ll have to spend to actually show up for them.Here’s an example, if your company is named “Apple Running Shoes,” can you realistically expect your ads to show up when people search for “apple?” (Hint: The answer is no.) It can also get expensive to bid on your competitors’ brand terms.It’s important to do your research to determine who else is bidding on the keywords you want, how much they’re spending, and average cost per click. This info will help you determine which terms are worth spending your budget on and which ones are just a pipe dream that will chew through budget with little return. Once you have cost and competitive data, you can eliminate overly competitive and high-cost keywords from your list.Great news: You don’t have to do all of the above by yourself. There are plenty of tools available to help you determine user intent, competition, and the overall value of bidding on specific keywords.There are tons of other options for keyword research, too. All you have to do is find the one that works for you.Now it’s time to get moving. To get started with your initial list, keep these brainstorming rules in mind:At first glance, it might seem obvious which keywords make sense for your business and your campaign. However, taking the time to complete the steps above will ensure your campaign is well-informed and highly effective. Choosing the most targeted keywords through adequate research and data analysis can be the difference between success and failure.About the Author: Kiera Abbamonte is the Content Marketing Specialist for Citrix Grasshopper.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/saas-employee-customer-success/,Why Every SaaS Employee Is A Part of Customer Success,"Customer success is a necessity.For your SaaS business to survive, your team must focus on solving the consumer’s problem. Lincoln Murphy, founder of Sixteen Ventures, defines it even better: “Customer success is when your customers achieve their desired outcome through their interactions with your company.”So, how are you serving your customer? What keeps them satisfied with your solution?Customer success isn’t a lonely department. It should be engrained in every employee’s position. Work with your entire team to fully engage your customers and to add more value at every stage of the buyer’s journey.Let’s explore your team’s role within customer success.Justification is one hurdle associated with customer success. Senior management may have doubts about allocating specific resources for this function.The question is usually the same: Is this worth the expense? Despite reluctance, the answer is yes. At the 2015 Gainsight Pulse conference, Jason Lemkin noted that “customer success is where 90% of the revenue is.” Therefore, it’s important to stress the power of customer success to your team. Think of customer success as a long-term strategy. It should focus on how every team member can help customers accomplish their goals.The image below depicts how Mike McKee of Rapid7 structures his customer success team. It shows how the company “sells a contract, deploys its software, engenders adoption and expands accounts.”Sarah Brown, a growth marketer at ServiceRocket, suggests investing early in customer success:“There’s no such thing as too early for starting to define a Customer Success model — in fact, it’s smart to think about it as soon as you do a customer acquisition model. This may start as: “How do we do great customer onboarding, promote adoption, and deliver value in the first 30-60-90 days?” and then scale into a full-blown Customer Success program over time.”Avoid pinning customer success to one particular person. Prepare a strategy today and get everyone to take part in the customer’s journey.In this new era of shopping, customers have more information at their fingertips. They surf the web diligently and compare prices at their leisure. To stand out from the competition, start engaging your prospects with value. That translates to offering product benefits and prices upfront. People want to know now. Sometimes, they don’t want to wait for a phone call from a sales rep, which will only waste their time with a long sales pitch. Instead, nurture your leads.MarketingSherpa reports that “businesses that nurture their leads experience a 45% increase in lead generation ROI when compared with businesses that don’t.”Prepare content that will entice prospects to learn more. For example, you may want to try creating a 60-second explainer video or hosting a webinar.“By dripping your sales team with new marketing content that they can use to help sell your product, you can position marketing as a valuable resource to sales,” writes Jenna Hanington, Senior Content Strategist at Pardot.“This includes content like data sheets, new eBooks, competitive one-sheeters, and even educational videos that provide selling tips from other sales reps.”In a blog post, Steli Efti of Close.io dissects the Hubspot’s email drip campaign. Here’s the first email he received after signing up for their free trial:The key is to understand that lead nurturing shouldn’t be a sales or marketing goal. Think about how everyone’s core skills can transform prospects into customers. Most SaaS companies fall short in the onboarding process. They don’t realize that once the sale is complete nurturing doesn’t stop. It’s up to your team to ensure that customers accomplish their intended goals. Because if they don’t, customers will see not see the value in keeping your service.Meet with your marketing, sales, and product teams to create a specific approach. An integrated plan will provide a clear perspective on everyone’s role. Guy Marion, CMO of AutopilotHQ, states, “By mapping these processes into the onboarding nurture journey, vendors can codify their best practices, help more customers get started ‘the right way’, and enjoy improved user satisfaction and fewer support inquiries from new customers. Satisfied customers produce higher lifetime values…”Begin by welcoming your new customer into your brand’s culture. Create videos introducing them to your team. Let users know who will be helping them achieve success.Furthermore, send tailored emails to your users based on their behaviors, because no two customers are alike. Studies reveal that “trigger emails have a 152% higher open rate compared to traditional email.” These emails appeal to your users and keep them engaged. Set easy milestones for your customer. What do you want them to accomplish on the first day? What about the second week? There should be a natural progression toward the goal. And the customer should know the timeline. Process Street offers its users milestones in the form of lessons via in-app messaging.Use onboarding as a tool to gain valuable insight on how to improve the customer experience. Ask users questions and gauge their satisfaction.If you’re using Kissmetrics, you can also use the Funnel Report to optimize your onboarding process. Research reveals, “companies with a dedicated customer success team see a 24% lower churn rate than companies without customer success.” In other words: If you make customer success a priority, your SaaS will experience growth.To retain more customers, build quality relationships with your customer base. And this doesn’t mean, sending emails to them when you need something. Des Traynor, co-founder Intercom, agrees:“Trying to be cute and saying ‘We miss you, please log in’ doesn’t work. You have to motivate a user to log in. There are often some features that will bring customers back, or prevent them from switching. By offering churning customers a glimpse of what’s coming down the line, you can excite them about future releases.”Similar to the pre-sale process, offer your current customers undeniable value. Have they set new goals? How can your team help? When you understand their objectives, then you will have a foundation to build a solid retention strategy. Team meetings should focus on providing more value, not increasing logins.Identify your brand advocates. These customers love your products.Enlist these users into a special referral program. Give them discounts for signing up new customers or cool swag bags for spreading the word about your services. For instance, Evernote offers their customers premium services for referrals.Retention is all about relationships. How will each team member build a better relationship with your customers?Customer success is still a fairly new concept for SaaS companies. The best way to approach it is by educating your employees. Plus, according to the Workplace Research Foundation, “increasing employee engagement investments by 10% can increase profits by $2,400 per employee, per year.”Recommend blog posts covering the topic to your team. Suggest webinars that will expand their knowledge about the subject. You can also offer specialized in-house training to your team. That way, your employees know what customer success looks like for your particular organization. Trainings should provide real-world examples and scenarios on how to approach different situations. “Know your ideal customer. Communicate with your ideal customer. Understand what that customer wants, and track whether or not they’re getting it. Then, help them get more of it,” says Nichole Elizabeth DeMere, a SaaS consultant and customer success evangelist.In the end, your team should understand the value of customer success and its purpose.How your SaaS approaches customer success matters. Everyone in your company plays an integral part in ensuring that consumers achieve their desired outcomes.Entice prospects with content that captures their attention. Help your customers exceed their expectations. And improve your services by encouraging customer feedback.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/idiot-proof-your-ad-campaigns/,How to Idiot Proof Your Ad Campaigns,"Marketing promotion sucks when you treat people the same.That goes for conversions, and it goes for advertising too.But the minute things start to go awry, people start messing with their landing page headline or ad descriptions.As if those tiny, miniscule elements are the primary reason traffic’s not comin’ or visits aren’t convertin’.The best landing page, optimized 100% correctly, can’t make up for the wrong audience seeing that message.Ad campaigns are already difficult. But the good news is that you don’t need to possess ninja PPC skillz.Instead, here is a dead simple way you can isolate where problem areas might pop up and stop them dead in their tracks.Commonly accepted best practices are a starting point. The tip of a metaphorical iceberg.They get all the attention and ink online. But there’s a mountain below just waiting to sink your campaign.On a GREAT day, landing pages convert around 10% of visitors (and those are the ‘uncommon’, special ones that vastly outperform all the rest). That means the majority of page visitors are doing, well, anything else besides converting. Slapping on a different ad-description isn’t going to budge that number. It won’t change the fact that those people simply aren’t ready to buy. It might get you from 6-7%. Which is great! But in a world where over 50% of all customers interactions follow a ‘multi-event, multi-channel’ journey that takes various touch points prior to converting, we should look beyond tactical ‘best practices’ to make sure the entire funnel aligns to deliver the best conversions for our buck.Managing the growing complexity is a top priority for marketers, with most juggling anywhere from 5 – 31 separate tools to manage messaging in a multi-channel marketing environment. This can be best illustrated with the help of Google’s Customer Journey to Online Purchase, which shows how a typical customer’s journey might look (including which channels influence which parts) for most industries. Yay visuals!The point is, there are many things involved in a single conversion. Whether we’re talking about a product purchased or lead generated.Unfortunately, ad campaigns today can’t be simple, static paths from New Visitor -> Conversion. Not in a world where it takes a minimum of 6-8 customer touch points prior to conversion. Or when your most profitable customers are NOT the ones who visit your site 1-3 times, but 14-20 before signing up.Today’s ad campaigns are more like a delicate system of variables that depend on each other for success. (Enter your best ’synergistic’ MBA speak here.)Making sure those things come together harmoniously is the best way to boost conversion rates for the long-term. Here’s how.Ad campaigns should align with an appropriate stage of the sales funnel. Same as any inbound deliverable like an infographic, offline tradeshow, or other campaign. You know, that whole Awareness, Consideration, Decision bit?   (If you  have NO idea what I’m talking about, read about the buying cycle and triggers from David Skok. And then spend another 20 minutes reading everything else he writes – it’s worth it.)Ad channels (and even different campaigns on the same channel) can then be used for different purposes, whether that’s driving new sales to generating leads or simply boosting awareness. The opportunities are vast, but the execution needs to be precise. Let’s start with generating initial awareness to see how this works.The goal here is to bring in new, targeted visitors. Obviously.Problem? Nobody knows who you are. And frankly, they don’t really care. They haven’t yet become aware that they have a need for you yet. So help them. Literally.Start with their daily life. What issues pop up, take too long, or cause them frustration (that can also possibly tie back into your widgets)?Listen:Consumers ignore 86% of display ads. And those average banner ad click through rates are a dismal 0.1%. It ain’t easy out there.Botching this jeopardizes everything else. So your value proposition needs to be awesome. Not good, or great. But, “Holy s$*% I need to [click this link / read this post] right now”.Typical display ads, AdWords, and Facebook are well tread options. So let’s look at new, fresh examples like Twitter and Instagram. Less competition typically = less expensive = higher return on ad spend. And the principles are the same, regardless of channel.For example, let’s say you’re trying to get the attention on Twitter. Instead of simply promoting your account (and making it all about you), solving a huge pain point or even providing a fun distraction can be enough to start introducing your brand to consumers.The best social ads at this stage also ‘blend’ in with the content people are already consuming. You know, like that whole native advertising thing. For example, this one from I.D. Sarrieri is very Instagram-ish – selling a mood or theme featuring their products.Find this one, and many more great Instagram ad examples here.Last but certainly not least, is your headline.The best headlines are a crystallized version of your value proposition, and they tap into some deeper primal motivation to grab maximum attention. Bnonn’s SHINE headline formula is a great way to get started, giving you the ‘essential’ ingredients like Specificity and Immediacy that are critical to getting people to take action.  You can also study the masters like BuzzFeed, who crank out brilliant headlines day-after-day that can be templated for re-using later. For example:This one might look like:Once you’ve captured attention, the next step is to get them interested.You do that by constructing a ‘bridge’ between their problems or pain points, and your widget which can ultimately solve those things for them.One of the most popular techniques here is some kind of ‘lead magnet’ to generate a micro-conversion like a basic email address. Chances are, you’re familiar with all the usual suspects like eBooks, webinars, checklists, and more. But ‘content’ based offers can mean much more.For example, most designers are starved for stock photos, especially with the exorbitant costs at the well known sources. Here, Bigstock is providing 35 free!(Here are a few more Twitter ad examples to browse for inspiration.)Even something as simple as a recipe could work wonders because it blends (pun intended) an offer to get attention with the products they’ll need (and can purchase from you). Smirnoff’s example below is a perfect example of bridging the gap between those two worlds.By this point, prospects should know who you are and at least have some interest in your product. Otherwise, we run into that original problem of trying to convert cold, unaware leads (which all of the best tactical practices in the world can’t help).The key? Make them an offer they can’t refuse. Especially if switching costs are an issue.For example, MailChimp executes brilliantly by running a competitive offer to Constant Contact peeps with a free three month offer. That should help soften the blow of having to move all email templates and contact records, while also giving those people enough time to settle in with the service.(The actual content and CTA looks a little sloppy, but the overall offer is great.)Admittedly, selling on Instagram is a, well, tough sell. It’s still early days, and the channel is mostly known for brand awareness.But still, the Cromwell in Las Vegas does as good a job as any, highlighting their attractive property in a multi-ad set with an appropriate CTA.If you’ve done all the hard work up to this point (like getting awareness, building interest, and developing trust), the sales offer should be simple and straightforward. A great offer or promotion can help, but shouldn’t be required to get people to open up their wallets. But if it is still difficult or damn near impossible, this next section can help.Creating different ad campaigns for specific sales funnel stages can help illustrate potential gaps, making it easier to break down exactly where you’re excelling (or falling short).That way instead of overreacting and making rash conclusions, you can start measuring those micro-conversions between stages or steps to find leading indicators of success. For example, experiencing low sales but demand seems to be there? Insert more lead gen and nurturing campaigns into the mix to bridge that gap. The end result, should resemble a complete ‘customer journey’ that seamlessly moves people from one step to the next.But what if those things check out, and still nothing. You’ve got ad campaigns targeting each step, and they seem to be performing well. Except for that whole sales thing.Break your ad campaigns down even further into the individual variables that dictate success.Google AdWord’s Quality Score is kinda the gold standard for using algorithms to award and set pricing in an auction based ad system. Facebook has also been testing different algorithms that act similarly. What’s unique, is that these algorithms use factors like ad relevancy from the ads you’re running, to the keyphrases or audiences, and even through the landing pages. They factor all of these details, and then create a holistic score that dictates (a) how often your ads show and (b) what you’re going to pay.Algorithms like these force advertisers to consider how every single ad campaign element works together to produce the best ROI (instead of simply focusing on the single ad creative you’re working on). So let’s start with the tactics, and work backwards to see if we can get any quick wins.Addressing or changing elements like the ad creative and landing page are far easier than ripping up the offer and starting from scratch. You can A/B test these elements according to commonly accepted best practices (which take all of 5 minutes Googling). And it’s the easiest, ‘low hanging fruit’ to quickly improve your Quality Score (or similar relevancy scores in other social ad platforms) that deliver fast results.If issues still persist, take another step back to address the audience you’re targeting (or keyphrases in AdWords which inherently have a certain type of audience searching). Chances are, improving audience targeting could give you that breakthrough. For example, custom audiences on Facebook help you get more specific by targeting segments of past customers, retargeting website visits, or even the individual product page visited. Target saw a “20% increase in conversion [using Facebook’s Dynamic Product Ads] compared to other Facebook ads”, according to Senior Vice President Kristi Argyilan.Assuming your offer or value proposition is sound and that the channel is appropriate, iterating on the audience, ad creative, and landing pages should deliver something at the end of the day. Otherwise, you have bigger issues (beyond advertising) that are holding you back.The tactical best practices you read about all over the interwebs are important.But only to a point.Breaking things down by sales funnel stages can help you determine where you’re excelling or falling short in key categories. They alert you to gaps in the customer journey that can cause breakdowns in driving new sales.Once that’s completed, you can get even more granular by looking at each independent variable within a single ad campaign to see where further bottlenecks are choking results. Working backwards from the ad creative and landing pages to your audience will give your campaigns a quick lift (assuming your offer or value proposition + channel selection check out).Big conversion increases don’t happen overnight by swapping out your headline or button color. They come from iterating on these tiny details along the way, making small improvements at each little step.And best of all, isolating different variables helps assign priority, keeping execution focused and simple in an increasingly complex world.About the Author: Brad Smith is a founding partner at Codeless Interactive, a digital agency specializing in creating personalized customer experiences.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/email-marketing-segmentation-strategies/,10 Quick and Easy Email Marketing Segmentation Strategies to Try Today,"Marketers know that segmenting email marketing lists can improve open and clickthrough rates. MailChimp’s latest user data showed that segmented campaigns get 14.64% more opens and 59.99% more clicks than non-segmented campaigns. That said, figuring out the best way to segment your email marketing lists can be a huge undertaking. To make it a little less daunting, this post will show you 10 quick and easy segmentation strategies that you can get started on today. The first way many marketers begin email marketing segmentation is by demographic data. Information such as age, gender, company position, and income level can tell a lot about a person’s needs and interests. The more information you can get about your audience in the sign-up process, the more options you’ll have for demographic segmentation. Be careful with this, though, because asking for too much information can scare people off from signing up at all. Decide which metrics are most essential for your business and include those questions in the signup process. For example, if you’re a B2B software developer, company position would be an important demographic. If you’re a clothing retailer, then gender would be extremely valuable to know. Add 1-3 of the most relevant demographic factors for your business (or more, depending on the complexity of your segmentation needs). The easiest way to segment by demographic information is with your website forms. Your email marketing platform will allow you to customize the email sign-up questions, or you can use a plugin (such as Rapidology) to create opt-in boxes.If you use a tool like Campaign Monitor, demographic segmentation is a part of the email builder. Just select the content you want to segment, and the demographic you want to show it to:Some marketers are minimalists who wouldn’t dare to ask for more than an email address to sign up for their mailing list.That’s fine – you can still get access to nuanced data about your customers by creating a survey or quiz.A survey gives you the opportunity to not only get that valuable demographic information, but also insights into individual tastes, preferences, and beliefs. If you want to send out a survey to your audience and get a lot of responses, you should probably create some kind of incentive for completing it – such as entering them in a drawing to win a prize.Or, instead of pitching it as a survey, turn it into a quiz that offers results that would interest your audience. There are a lot of different ways to create custom surveys for your audience. If you’re on WordPress, you can use the Quiz and Survey Master plugin to create your custom survey. It also integrates with MailChimp, so you can export your results. If you use Aweber, you can create a free survey with Google Documents, Survey Monkey, or SurveyGizmo, and then integrate them into your Aweber emails.Email engagement is another very basic way to segment your lists, but it can have a huge impact on your overall results.Open rate and clickthrough rate are the main metrics here, which you keep track of in your email marketing service. You can segment by engagement by designating active vs inactive users, such as someone who hasn’t opened your emails in three months. You can then create a specialized campaign designed at re-engaging your inactive subscribers.Or you can focus on subscribers who do engage, and target them more specifically. For example: you send out an email announcing an upcoming sale, and everyone who clicks through the email link can be categorized as “interested.” You can then create a special campaign to further target them as likely buyers from the sale. If you use Mailchimp, segmenting by engagement is simple. In the “Activity” tab, you have options to see a variety of subscriber behavior:You can then create unique segments including any or all of these metrics:There are a lot of different ways to use geographic location data, making segmentation by geographic area a valuable tool – especially for businesses where location greatly influences purchasing decisions.Litmus, for example, used geolocation to send out targeted emails for their Email Design Conference in San Francisco, London, and Boston, including helpful details for each location: Their targeted emails got them a 68% open rate, compared to a 22% open rate for the general conference announcement. Other ways companies can use geographic data include:Segmenting by past purchases is another simple way to optimize targeting. The easiest way is to start sending out email recommendations for similar items or accessories that would go well with their previous purchase.Or, if a customer bought something that requires replacement, refilling, or renewal, you can send out targeted emails based on their potential needs.For example, if someone purchased a certain hair styling product, you can make an educated guess about when it might run out – and send her an email after a few months suggesting a reorder. To do this in MailChimp, you’ll need to use either the eCommerce360 plugin or eCommerce360 tracking for purchase activity to appear in your campaign reports. Then you can segment by product purchased, category of product purchased, or even combined factors.If you sell a range of high and low dollar items, amount spent can be a great segmentation strategy. Use customer expense history to determine which customers are likely to buy more expensive items and which are more interested in affordable, low dollar items.Then you can send out targeted emails featuring products that are actually in each person’s price range.In Kissmetrics, you can pull a segment based on how much people spent on an order in the past:
Intermix, a women’s clothing retailer, used this strategy to decrease the value of discounts they sent out. They segmented customers into three groups:VIPs were sent out non-monetary offers (exclusive invites and events), while the other two segments were sent discount offers ranging from 10-30%. After everything was said and done, the effort got them a 15% increase in annual revenue.Segmenting by where your audience is in the sales funnel is one of the most valuable ways to customize your messaging. Someone at the top of the funnel should be receiving different targeted emails than those at the bottom. For example, for a group of brand-new subscribers, their emails should be more generalized, giving a range of the products or features you offer – such as a series of welcome emails introducing them to the brand.If they’ve been signed up for a while and interacted with certain email content (such as clicking through a link), you can use this information to determine what exactly they’re interested in, and send more targeted emails on that product or service.Cart abandonment is a common indicator that someone’s at the bottom of the funnel. In 2015, the rate of cart abandonment was 68%. They had intention to buy, but something stopped them.This presents an opportunity – you can send out a follow-up email reminding them that their cart is still available, or a message featuring the products they were about to purchase. You can easily track cart abandonment in Kissmetrics:Here’s a nice example from Fab on how you can follow up:Keeping track of website behavior is another simple way to get more information about visitors’ interests. For example, you can send targeted emails based on the specific pages they visited – but that’s far from the only option.The sheer amount of behavioral data you can gather now is pretty impressive. There are tools, like BeamPulse, that keep track of visitor scrolling behavior, icons clicked, time active on page, menus visited, and more.With the ‘Goals’ feature in MailChimp, you can also send out targeted emails based on website activity, such as:Set up Goal Autoresponders with Mailchimp, and you can send out automatic targeted emails based on the content people did or didn’t engage with on your website.Time since last purchase can be a valuable segmentation strategy, since it doesn’t make sense to lump a customer who last bought from you months ago in with one who bought something last week. Instead, you could split them up into two major groups:This group purchases something from you at least monthly. They like your brand and are obviously interested in your products, so you target them by:This group bought one of your products six months ago but hasn’t been back since. Or maybe they used to be a frequent buyer but fell off the grid. Your emails should be targeted at drawing them back to your brand, by:Onward Reserve, an online menswear retailer, used a similar approach, segmenting by best customers (at least three purchases), non-purchasers, and churning customers. They tailored messages to each group:Their efforts got them:This tactic is a little more advanced, but it’s still fairly simple to do with the right tools. You can get detailed information about subscribers’ personal interests by creating user profiles on your website or using an email subscription center. Here’s an example from Amazon:You can ask your audience to indicate their preferences when signing up – and give them plenty of opportunities to update those preferences by including a CTA in your emails. By asking your subscribers to indicate their preferences, you can easily cut through the noise by targeting your audience based on their real interests. You can create custom subscriber preferences with email marketing tools like Mailchimp or Campaign Monitor. Then, just add the preferences tags to every email you send out.Email marketing segmentation isn’t a tactic reserved only for brands with the most advanced marketing automation software. With a simple email marketing service and a bit of creativity, you can start targeting your audience with these easy segmentation strategies today.Know of any other easy ways to segment?

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/better-customer-acquisition-engine/,5 Neuroscience Secrets to a Better Customer Acquisition Engine,"Your brain contains approximately 100 billion neurons, which are the cells that enable you to process information. What makes these neurons exponentially more powerful is the electrical or chemical connections they create with one another through synapses – your brain actually houses approximately 2 ½ miles of neuronal network interconnections in every cubic millimeter of gray matter. Clearly, your brain packs quite the punch. In fact, last year a PhD student from Carnegie Mellon University collaborated with one from University of California, Berkeley to calculate that the human brain is actually up to 30X more powerful than the world’s most powerful supercomputer. Incredible, right?When considering the dominating influence that the human brain has on the purchase decisions being made by a company’s target audience, it’s stunning how little focus is applied to neuroscience in the customer acquisition development process at many companies. It behooves any marketer to leverage the power of neuroscience in attracting attention, building relationships, and moving prospects to action. To that end, here are five effective ways to use neuroscience to rev up your customer acquisition engine.First, you need to grab the attention of your target audience. On average, your prospective customer encounters over 5,000 marketing messages daily, and this doesn’t even count social media. What’s a marketer to do to cut through all the noise? Deviate! The brain is hardwired to love surprises, as evidenced in neuroscientific studies lead by Gregory S. Berns, M.D., Ph.D at Emory’s Neuroimaging Group. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain activity, Berns’ team showed that the brain actively responds more to the unexpected than even to things a person likes or finds pleasurable. The dashboard SaaS company, Domo, which targets business executives, ran a series of ads screaming “CFO Porn!” and “Stop making I.T. your report monkey” in an otherwise serious market where they could have otherwise released standard ads about big data. When seeing the ads, you couldn’t help but click on them. With Domo’s annual revenue reportedly approaching upwards of $100 million, deviation has certainly helped it to stand out.The monthly razor subscription company Dollar Shave Club has utterly upended a mature industry with its series of jaw-dropping, laugh-out-loud videos, mocking the restrictions in drugstores that treat razor customers like felons or making fun of the excessive technology claims by the established players in the industry. Within 48 hours after launching their first video, approximately 12,000 people signed up for the subscription service. Within a few months, that exploded to 330,000. That first video? It now has more than 22 million views.Deviating does not necessarily mean shock and awe, though. It just means being demonstrably different from the competition. Take the customer support software company Groove. Its blog first documented its rise from zero to $100K in monthly revenue and now to $500K in monthly revenue. They reveal EVERYTHING, showing you every pimple and scratch along the way. The level of transparency is unprecedented, and you can’t help but get sucked in and become a fan.So shake it up and be different. Really different! If your brand awareness and direct response activities at the top of the funnel are currently blending in with the massive amount of noise enveloping your audience, craft your marketing for surprise and delight.Not only does deviation help you to stand out among competing marketing messages, it also helps your target audience to remember you. Today’s consumer or B2B buyer has a higher threshold for stimulation than in the past. If the messages they are consuming are similar, it becomes more difficult for the brain to do the work of figuring out which messages to remember. The more you can deviate from the other inputs, the more likely they are to recall your message when it’s time to buy.If you want new customers, evoke an emotional response. Peter Noel Murray, Ph.D., principal of a consumer psychology practice, reports in Psychology Today that emotional ads outperform content-based ads based on purchase intent by 3-to-1 for TV and 2-to-1 for print intent. Murray also points to fMRI neuro-imagery that shows consumers primarily use emotions over information (brand attributes, features, and facts) to evaluate brands.According to a study from Google and CEB titled From Promotion to Emotion: Connecting B2B Customers to Brands, B2B brands achieve twice the impact with buyers when using emotional marketing that communicates personal value compared to marketing based on business value. From the study, “Despite our attempts to make purely rational decisions, we are primarily driven by emotional motivations… Purchase intent dips when messaging becomes less emotional.”In studies by the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, it was revealed that without emotions, people found it almost impossible to make decisions. Damasio studied a group of people with damage to the part of the brain that triggers emotions yet with their reasoning otherwise unaffected. What Damasio uncovered was that these individuals couldn’t feel strongly enough about one option versus another to make even simple decisions like what to eat, let alone what to purchase.In other words, if your website is not evoking an emotive response in your site visitors, your marketing is essentially pushing your prospects to NOT make a purchase decision. This is why the marketing of companies like Mailchimp, Autodesk, and Google are centered on emotions. It’s why marketing powerhouses such as Nike, Apple, P&G, Red Bull, and MasterCard focus their marketing on your heart.The benefits of a strong emotional connection with your audience extend even beyond the purchase itself. Emotion was the number one driver of customer loyalty in 17 of 18 industries studied by Forrester. Not only are emotions critical in ensuring your prospects make the purchase in the first place, but they are also critical in making sure your prospects continue to purchase from you again and again, reducing churn.People visit your website for one of two reasons. They either want to achieve a goal or eliminate pain. So figure out exactly how your offering does either or both for your site visitors, and then cut the crap and focus all of your messaging on this. There are different methods to achieve this. One way is a hardcore message that takes your audience by surprise with its penetrating directness. For example, certain marketing teams find it painful to create landing pages in order to drive new leads. Sometimes, they are required to have their web team do the heavy lifting for every page. The SaaS landing page solution Instapage eliminates this pain, with a website containing the super simple and short headline, “Create a Landing Page in Just 3 Minutes” and the call-to-action button “Build My Page Now.” The clarity, directness, and boldness make the message not only immediately understandable, but also immediately impactful.Another approach is to use the power of mirror neurons to move your audience to action. Mirror neurons were identified by a team of scientists led by Giacomo Rizzolatti in Parma, Italy that was monitoring the brain waves of monkeys. When a graduate student walked into the lab with an ice-cream cone and then raised the cone to his mouth, the monkey’s brain started firing neurons in reaction. What was amazing was that those neurons were the same neurons as if the monkey were eating the ice-cream itself. In other words, the monkey’s brain did not differentiate between the observation of the eating of ice-cream and the actual act of eating it oneself.Let’s say that your site visitor is looking for financial management software. Instead of showing only screens of your interface, show your prospective customer what their life could look like if they used your product. The top of the Mint.com home page displays a person by the waterfront under the headline “That Horizon Might Be Closer Than You Think. We’ll help you get there by managing your money and budgets better every day.” The urgent want of the site visitor is not the tactical idea of organizing one’s finances, but instead is peace of mind by achieving sufficient wealth and eliminating money-related anxiety. And through mirror neurons, Mint is triggering their neurons so that site visitors feel as if they are already achieving this.This is the strategy that many fitness and weight loss programs use in their marketing. All the before-after examples that they feed you are to activate your mirror neurons, because they know that your urgent want is to lose weight and look fit. If they focus instead on specific exercises, or diets, or ingredients in their messaging, the impact is weakened, because the brain does not react as viscerally.People fear loss more strongly than they seek gain. This aversion to loss is powerful, and can be used effectively when you show prospective customers all the negative effects caused by not purchasing your product. What’s especially surprising is that even if you present the same information to the prospect but frame it in the sense of what they lose, your conversions can increase. For example, instead of speaking to how your product saves the prospect money, tell them to avoid losing money by making the purchase.A UCLA study was the first to provide neural evidence that people are hard-wired to avoid loss more than seek gain. The study examined the behavior of people who were given 250+ opportunities to gamble with $30, with a 50-50 chance of winning each time. For example, would they agree to a coin toss in which you could win $30 but could just as easily lose $20? On average, with the risk of losing $10, participants in the study needed the chance to win $19 in order to accept the gamble. The study found that the reward center of the brain responds not only to actual gain and loss, but to potential gain and loss.Quantifying people’s predilection for loss aversion, Professor Daniel Kahneman at the University of California, Berkeley, who later won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, found that most people are about twice as sensitive to potential losses as to potential gains.In the examples below, the automated investment software company Betterment uses loss aversion in its messaging to make its site visitors anxious about losing money to excessive fees. They then take that message further by detailing the different types of fees site visitors should worry about losing, such as trade fees, transaction fees, and rebalancing fees.You know that the price you set will influence whether a prospective customer buys from you. But beyond just the price, the actual display of the price can also have a major impact at a subconscious level on the buying decision. Research findings by professors at the University of Richmond and Clark University published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology reveal that the brain believes that a price is actually more affordable or more expensive in just the presentation of the number itself. For example, the price $1,000.00 could be written as $1,000.00, $1,000, $1000.00, $1000 or $1K. The shorter the display of the number, the more affordable it is perceived, even though all of the actual numbers are exactly the same. A University of Pennsylvania/Carnegie Mellon University study published in the Journal of Consumer Research further revealed that the framing of a price can have a drastic impact on purchase rates. For example, by changing the language for an overnight shipping charge from “A $5 Fee” to “A Small $5 Fee”, purchase rates of tightwads increased by 20%.Another pricing strategy to drive your prospects to make the purchase is through the use of multiple price points. Even if you have only one product, it’s important to segment the pricing into multiple options (even if one option is going to end up representing 90%+ of the sales). When I worked at Panasonic, we would always add a more expensive option to any product. Psychologically, when the brain sees two options, it makes it easier for the prospective buyer to make the purchase, as they are either going to feel good about saving money and purchasing the cheaper option, or feel an elevated sense of worth by buying the more expensive option. This is called perceptual contrast.  But keep it simple! Getting carried away by offering more pricing options can easily backfire. In a study by Sheena S. Iyengar at Columbia University and Mark R. Lepper at Stanford University, researchers set up a jam-tasting table at a supermarket. At times they offered six varieties of jam, and at others 24 varieties. While more options brought more tasters, only 3% actually bought the jam. Compare this with a 30% purchase rate when only six varieties were offered. That’s a 10X difference in purchase rate!The brain is a major influence on whether your target audience will respond to your marketing and will make a purchase from you. By structuring your customer acquisition funnel based on an understanding of neuroscience, you can significantly accelerate your customer growth, increase conversions, and build your business.About the Author: Tom Shapiro is the CEO of Stratabeat, Inc., a branding, marketing, and design agency.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/website-redesign-mistake/,The Biggest Mistake Companies Make During a Website Redesign,"Let’s get straight to the point. A website redesign is no small undertaking. Every team, from developers/IT and design, to marketing and sales, has to be on board and understand what’s expected of them. Everyone contributes. But in the midst of inevitable page or section additions and improved navigation menu and other major changes, one small but nevertheless vital point is often pushed by the wayside.Analytics.It’s easy to understand why. After all, you’re redesigning layouts and shifting pixels around — you’ve done everything but put up a “please excuse our digital dust” sign. Restructuring and reorganizing are messy, and it can be incredibly tempting to want to pause your analytics while you’re reorganizing and rebuilding.Don’t do it.The fact is, you can gain some very important information by leaving your analytics on and collecting data during your redesign.“Why would I want to do that?” You may be asking.It’s completely understandable that you’d want to wait until the new redesign is polished, shiny and ready to roll out before flipping the switch on your analytics again and then keenly watching your visitors interact with your site, but in doing so, you’d be doing a huge disservice to them. If you’re running a seasonally-focused business, you’d also be missing out on year-over-year data to determine particular seasonal trends that could affect design tests (such as putting up holiday-related images over Christmas).Leaving analytics on during a website redesign can give you valuable insights you may not otherwise getDuring a redesign, restructuring or rebuilding of your site, leaving analytics on can give you some juicy, revealing information you may not otherwise get after “the big reveal”. For example, let’s say you unveil a brand new navigation structure for your menu. Preliminary tests have shown that this new menu is better organized, mobile responsive and easy to use.But when it all rolls out, things go south in a hurry. Users struggle to find what they’re looking for. Stuff isn’t where it used to be, and they’re frustrated. They try the site search, but partially due to the redesign process, it may not be performing as well as before.Had you left analytics on during this time and split tested your navigation menus, you would have captured valuable insights on the user’s experience (and frustration) with the menu (and the subsequent migration toward search) — taking you back to the drawing board to find a way to blend the best features of the old menu with the responsiveness of the new. You’d have saved time, and most importantly, saved sales.But navigation and layout aren’t the only potential casualties of a redesign. There’s also the issue of what’s happening behind the scenes.Leaving analytics on can also help you get better results from split tests during a redesignYou may feel the temptation to shut off analytics during a redesign because you want to make the right impression with your customers. After all, no one wants to see a half baked website. But by split testing the traffic between old and new, you can again learn what’s working and what isn’t. You can use features like heat maps to see where traffic is dropping off and where the user’s attention is primarily focused. And if it’s not where you’d hoped, you can make adjustments on-the-fly.Remember that best practices seldom apply broadly to every product or industry. What works well even for your competition may absolutely crush your own conversion rate. Your analytics will give you the raw data that shows you how well a proposed design change works for you, then you can tweak and refine it to improve it further.So if you leave your analytics on – what exactly do you measure during the building and rollout phases of your redesign? Well, it’s not much different than the key metrics you should be measuring ordinarily:User Engagement – How your users interact with your site. You’ll want to focus on incremental conversion here – monitoring the click-through path step-by-step to see where customers may be dropping off in the process. Social media referrals may also affect the degree of engagement and interaction on your site.Conversion Rate – Many people know that the “conversion rate” is important, but they’re not sure why. Essentially, conversion rate is the number of people who take a specific action on your site that you want them to take — whether it’s signing up for a subscription or proceeding to checkout. Your conversion rate is affected by many variables, but a redesign is one of the biggest overarching changes possible.It’s entirely possible that your conversion rate could drop initially after a redesign, as customers and visitors alike get accustomed to the changes, but then rise slowly and steadily — showing that the changes you’ve made are indeed working as intended. What many people don’t know about conversion rates is that you can specify various paths that consumers can take to get to the end result – and then judge those paths according to how much of an ROI they bring you. Ideally you’d also get a view into the types of customers who are converting — are they at a higher pricing plan or average spend, for example?In short, you can see what’s working and what isn’t — letting you concentrate your efforts on the stuff that works, while trimming the stuff that doesn’t. Over time, this leads to a better, laser-focused trail of what resonates with your target audience and keeps bringing them back.The bottom line is this: when it comes to analytics, leaving them on even during the midst of a website restructuring can provide unusual details, user behavior insights or patterns that you may not ordinarily see. Making these kinds of course corrections in the middle of a redesign (rather than scrambling after the fact to pick up all the pieces) saves time, money and effort in the long run.Have you recently redesigned your site or made it mobile responsive? Did you leave analytics on during that time? What interesting data did you collect? Anything in particular stand out? It’s amazing what you can learn, even during an “under construction” phase.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/emotional-targeting-converts-more-leads/,How Emotional Targeting Converts More Leads,"A study found “that websites with a stronger emotional impact produced a greater intent to buy.”Appealing to your audience’s emotions creates a connection. Whether you’re designing product descriptions or landing pages, your team must aim to evoke emotion into your messaging. That’s why storytelling works so well. It’s a powerful way to engage your customers.Research by Pringle & Field found that “emotional campaigns outperform on almost every metric,” including revenue, profit, and share gain. Emotional targeting produces authentic content that speaks the consumer’s language. It’s those irresistible stories that touch people’s hearts and propels them to purchase your products.Ready for a challenge? Learn how to convert more leads with high-impact emotional messages.Emotions determine our everyday decision-making. We buy when we’re sad. We buy when we’re happy. However, most brands miss the opportunity to develop an emotional link with shoppers. They focus on product features, rather than understanding the feelings behind the purchase.In 2014, Facebook “revealed that it had manipulated the news feeds of over half a million randomly selected users to change the number of positive and negative posts they saw.”This controversial psychological study found that people mimic the emotions expressed in online content. So, if people read a positive post, they are more likely to respond positively.With that in mind, prepare your SaaS to develop digital marketing campaigns ingrained with psychological triggers. For instance, happiness induces people to share. Serial entrepreneur Neil Patel says, “When your content drives people to a state of happiness or joy, they will automatically respond to your offers, feel obliged to share your content, and will stop at nothing to tell others about you.” Here’s an example from Moz. Their Whiteboard Friday videos express excitement as experts teach SEO and online marketing skills, and they receive thousands of YouTube views.Also, A/B test your campaigns based on behavioral and emotional marketing, not tactical elements.Talia Wolf, the Founder and CEO of Conversioner, states, “Great marketing campaigns look at the entire product as an ecosystem. Rather than just changing the headline, or the colors of individual elements, they approach the product as a whole.”There is real value in tapping into people’s emotions. Work with your team to develop digital content that connects to your shoppers’ sentiments. It will help maximize your lead conversions.Memories are precious moments in our lives. We remember graduating from high school, breaking up with our first romantic partner, or even that embarrassing moment when we flopped a presentation. These experiences evoke us to think about how we felt at that particular time. To harness the power of memorable experiences, associate your brand’s shopping experience with your customer’s life events. For example, transfer the same emotions customers felt when they got married or bought their first home.For instance, chocolate is usually associated with joy. Hershey’s is keeping that alive with its #HelloHappy campaign. Stacie Stauffer, senior brand manager at Hershey’s, told AdFreak the following: “The second you say ‘Hershey,’ the most amazing thing happens. This giant flood of emotions and memories happens—when I made s’mores camping, or stirred up chocolate milk with my mom. That solidified that we should be speaking more as [one] brand, and from a much more emotional place.”This type of emotional targeting makes consumers feel subconsciously connected to your brand. They are compelled to read more, click on your offer, and even purchase your services. Chris Dalton recommends offering value without expectations. He said, “Sometimes, the best sales pitch is no pitch at all. Consumers have become savvy to ignoring direct sales tactics or sleazy methods. If you offer information relating to your products with honesty and transparency, your customers will notice.”Buffer does an effective job by giving its customers an inside peek at their operations. Check out their BufferOpen blog about their “journey to greater productivity, more transparency and a happier work culture.”Map out a path to connect your customers’ memories with your brand. And sometimes that means not selling, just providing value.DemandGen Reports noted that video content for B2B marketing increased by 8% to 54%, and infographics jumped 9% to 52% in 2014. It’s becoming a necessity to use visuals as part of your marketing strategy.A good visual stimulates people’s senses. It can create fear, elicit pity, or showcase friendship.  Font styles make a difference, too. People consider clear, readable font as trustworthy.But you can’t just plop any picture on your website or Instagram account. Freelance writer Dawn Papandrea agrees:“To make visual storytelling work, however, you can’t simply slap a few stock photos onto your blog or social media posts. Just as headlines and calls to action must be crafted carefully, your visual content deserves more than a second thought.”From screenshots to actual photographs, think about how to convey emotion to your audience. Do you need a wide-angle shot? Will a big red arrow show more impact for the viewer?In the above picture, Nike displays the endless possibilities customers can experience with their apparel. It’s all about the adventure and the limitless options the brand offers its consumers. In addition, be aware of diversity in your visuals. Cultural shifts happen within our society. Not everyone will be on board with your company’s inclusiveness. But don’t let that stop your eCommerce store’s progression.General Mills faced negative backlash for featuring an interracial couple in their 2014 Cheerios Super Bowl commercial ad. Despite some disapproval, there was also an overwhelming positive response applauding their diversity efforts.Use visual storytelling to communicate emotion to your customers. From infographics to videos, give your shoppers a better understanding of your brand’s culture.We’re humans. We want to belong. Social proof in marketing activates those desires to be affiliated with a specific group of people or worthwhile cause.Social media strategist Michael Sherman, says, “For many, a proven testimonial or example is the emotional trigger a person needs to say yes on buying your products and using your services.”Old Navy appeals to shoppers’ sense of belonging. They focus on offering trendy clothes at affordable prices.In the tweet below, the retailer implies that if you want to get ready for spring and be happy with your friends, purchase from their wide-selection of clothes. For social proof to work well, your brand must truly understand your consumers’ motivations and intentions. For example, expert social proof may emotionally influence your consumers to take action. This happens when an industry influencer or well-known blogger publicly approves a product. Those endorsements look like a basic quote or a video testimonial.Rent the Runway experienced a 200% higher conversion rate from mentions by a fashion magazine or blogger than paid search.Learn what riles up your consumers. Identify experts that appeal to your audience and coincide with your brand’s values. Give people the social proof they need to buy your products.Strive to build an emotional connection with your buyers. As a result, customers will feel connected with your brand and purchase more.Strategize on how to add psychological triggers. Ditch transactional relationships for memorable experiences. And invest in visual storytelling to express your brand better.Target people’s emotions to convert more leads.About the Author: Shayla Price lives at the intersection of digital marketing, technology and social responsibility.

And as we know, not all leads are created equal.Some leads may be more ready to buy than others, some may have little interest in ever purchasing, and others may just want to poke around in your product until the trial expires.With all these leads coming in from all over the world, how do you know which ones are the best?Kissmetrics has taken another step towards helping marketers better understand where in the world their best customers are coming from. Visitors to your site are probably coming from countries all around the world. Some of them convert into customers, others never will. Knowing which countries don’t convert can save you ad dollars and your sales team some time and agony.Kissmetrics already shows you which backlinks are driving signups, but we haven’t previously showed you how Kissmetrics can show you where your best traffic is coming from. Here’s how to do that:Let’s say you’re the Director of Marketing for a medium-sized SaaS company. It’s your job to drive leads. You’re given a moderate budget to allocate towards paid campaigns. Since you want maximum results for your campaigns, you want to know not just where your best leads are coming from (traffic sources) but also where in the world they’re coming from. Is the traffic coming from Australia the highest quality? And what about all the traffic from Iceland? Do those leads go anywhere?To get this data, you set up the Kissmetrics Funnel Report and look at your funnel. Here’s what it looks like:Here’s what we’re looking at:You’re getting a good amount of traffic to your site, and about an average conversion rate. Most of the people that signup at least try the product, and about 20% of them end up paying for it. Like any funnel, there’s always room for improvement. To improve this funnel, you want to refine the traffic coming into it. You’re thinking there might be certain countries that send traffic but not customers. To find this out, you segment your funnel by KM Country. This will breakdown all traffic by its originating source. So all visitors that came from the United States are put in that bucket, all traffic from Germany in the Germany bucket, all the people that visited from Brazil are in the Brazil bucket, etc. We’ll select this option and get our data:We’re not looking at all the countries that send us traffic, just the top 7. Taken together, these countries account for nearly 90% of total traffic.  Throughout the funnel, we can see that there are two countries are sending us traffic but not customers. We get a little over 2,000 people from Australia visiting the site, signing up, and using the product, but none of them ended up upgrading to paying. Phillipines have a similar story. We get a small amount of traffic from this country, but only 4 signups. And of those 4 people, none of them even began using the product. On the other hand, Germans seem to love our service. While only about 1% of traffic we get from that country actually ends up paying for the product, that is more than double than what we from the United Kingdom, India, and Canada. With this data, we can make decisions that will improve our marketing. Here’s what we should change:This is part of the process of building a more efficient and effective marketing machine.By reducing the number of bad leads to our sales team, we building a more efficient and effective marketing machine. Our sales team will be talking with more qualified leads that are actually interested in using and purchasing our product.This location feature isn’t just available in the Funnel Report.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/truths-about-saas-customer-retention/,4 Inconvenient Truths About SaaS Customer Retention,"Forrester Research found that “70% of CMO’s did not list retention as a top priority.”But in order for your SaaS to stay profitable, it’s critical for your business to retain more customers. Humans are creatures of habit. So, prove to your current customers that you’re worth the recurring subscription. For customer retention to increase, focus your team’s efforts on improving the user’s experience, addressing customer service issues, and strengthening brand loyalty.Don’t wait until it’s too late. Create a strategy to override your current SaaS challenges. Here are four inconvenient truths hindering your company’s growth and how to overcome them.In today’s marketplace, the consumer has the power. They search the Internet to find the best deals on blogs and social media channels. And with so many competitors vying for their attention, consumers can take their business elsewhere if their needs aren’t met. So, if your customer service isn’t meeting their standards, expect them to unsubscribe today. Experts report that “it takes 12 positive experiences to make up for one unresolved negative experience.” To take your service to the next level, find new and interesting ways to connect with your shoppers. Also, remember that customer service includes everything from website functionality to sales interactions to help forums.Serial entrepreneur Neil Patel suggests following up with every customer interaction. It’s all about taking that extra effort to ensure your customer is satisfied. Here’s how the process should look: Most of the time, companies are putting out fires that have already started. But what if you could forecast customer expectations? Prep your team to provide proactive customer service (aka customer success). For example, call users and ask them about their experiences. Learn when, where, and how they gain value from your services. These insights will help your team solve small concerns before they become major issues.To boost retention, keep your customers happy. Customer retention is a marathon, not a sprint. Therefore, develop your retention plans across the customer lifecycle.“The data shows that the faster you get your prospects started in your Free Trial, the more likely they are to convert to a paying customer,” says Lincoln Murphy, founder of Sixteen Ventures, a SaaS growth consultancy.“Likewise, the faster you get them on-boarded and your service adopted within their organization after becoming a customer, the more likely they are to stay a customer…for a long time.”Fixate your attention on your customers. Activate long-term interest through gamification. Adding a gaming element to your strategy gives customers a new experience. For example, Nike+ connected customers with a mobile and Facebook app that recorded their running goals. Users earned rewards and received personal messages from famous athletes. As a result, the membership of Nike+ “grew by 40 percent in 2011 and helped boost revenue by 30 percent.”Build a community. People want to be part of something special. Create a system where individuals can contribute ideas for new product features. Then, let the community vote. It’s a two-way street for the community and the brand to communicate.And continue to add content to your help center. FAQs become a customer journey tool. Miko Levy, VP of Customer Acquisition at Outbrain, writes, “At Outbrain, we’ve structured our Help Center to reflect our customers’ needs from the pre-signup stage to first-time campaign creation to more advanced optimizations and reporting.”Consider your help center a working document that will progress as you improve your product. Be creative. Improving the customer’s experience will impact your churn rate. The Direct Marketing Association found that “every $1 spent on email marketing provides an ROI of $41.” That’s a huge opportunity for your SaaS!Email efficiently connects your product to the customer. Therefore, your business stays at the top of their minds as your team nurtures these relationships and offers valuable content.Intercom incorporated user activity data to personalize their email experience.The in-app messaging platform re-engages customers with trigger based email automation. Here are a few lessons they learned: In addition, create promotional emails worth opening. Evernote is widely touted for their eye-catching emails. The company focuses on benefits and features before stating a compelling call-to-action.Evernote target one specific benefit and frame each email around one problem. Then, they offer one effective solution. The copy is short and includes action-oriented verbs with a big and bold call-to-action.Sending well-timed emails can also bring back dormant customers. It centers on delivering the right message to the right person at the right time. What will intrigue them to use the product again? A steady stream of engaging emails excites people. Improve your email automation to personally connect with your customers.Recognize customers with an effective loyalty program. They deserve a little love for sticking around. And with the help of social media your team can continue to build those relationships. Research reveals that “people just love being VIPs or gold members of programs.” However, it’s only effective when people know there is a group below them. So, develop a loyalty program where gold members are aware of the silver group. Also, ditch the idea that a purchase equates to loyalty. Reward shoppers for non-purchase activities. For example, give customer points for referring a friend or joining your email list. Office Depot rewards shoppers for recycling their ink and toner cartridges.Build a social media strategy based on customer loyalty. Your team should screenshot examples of how customers love your product. Essentially, you’re transforming social media into social proof. And don’t just let your customers talk. Join in the conversation. “One way to influence the internet’s conversation about your company is by gaining and using valuable information to your best advantage. Customer surveys are an excellent way to do just that. Address pain points head-on, and promote the living daylights out of your best reviews,” states Katy Katz, Content Director at Inturact.Lastly, be the expert in your field to retain more customers. As a trusted advisor, consumers will rely on your company not only for your products, but also for recommendations about other services within your industry. When your SaaS becomes the trusted source, consumers come to you first before making any future purchases. So, if you sell the product they need, it’s highly likely the customer will purchase from you first.Strive to increase your customer retention. Build a strategy that will challenge your team’s current tactics. Give unmatched customer service. Think long-term when creating a plan and add gamification to the mix. And show your customers some appreciation through well-developed brand loyalty programs. Find your truth. Retain more customers.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/seo-for-conversion-funnel/,Effective SEO for All Stages of the Conversion Funnel,"In 2013, the data scientists at Wolfgang Digital set out to answer one of digital marketing’s greatest questions: What is the average conversion rate?The answer, according to 56 million visits to 30 different websites, is 1.4%.How does your site measure up? Do you think you could you do better?Optimize each stage of your conversion funnel, and yes, you probably could.A conversion funnel is a way of visualizing the stages that prospects go through before they convert. It’s called a funnel (rather than a tunnel), because the inverted shape represents how prospects drop off along the way to converting.How many stages a funnel has will depend on who you ask, but for the purpose of this article, I’m going to keep things simple and talk about a three-stage funnel: top (awareness), middle (evaluation/research), and bottom (conversion).Most visitors to your site will arrive at the “awareness” stage. Your visitor numbers will drop off as they move closer to the “action” (conversion) stage. Barring a few exceptions (Amazon for instance, where Prime visitors convert at 74%, and non-Prime visitors at 13%), only a fraction of those who visit you at the “awareness” stage will go on to convert – the 1.4% mentioned above, to be precise.Rethinking how you use SEO to support your site at each stage of the funnel can get those visitors that make it past the awareness stage that much closer to taking action.At the top of the funnel (TOFU), you are trying to capture potential customers at the “awareness” stage. At this point, the customer has realized they have a problem, and they are searching the web looking for a solution. They may go on to make a purchase; they’re just not quite sure what they want to buy, or when. Yet. Think of it like the modern-day version of window shopping.If you want to capture these potential customers (and why wouldn’t you?), you need to provide content that’s geared around the type of search queries that are asked at this early stage. The goal is to answer these queries in the hopes that your content will rank in the SERPs and bring searchers to your site. This means setting commercial intent aside, and focusing on query-based keywords. There are a number of tools that can help you to do this. Most marketers’ go-to keyword research tool is Google’s own Keyword Planner, but let’s forget about that for a moment. It’s very useful, but it’s also very commercially-minded.Optimizing your site for customers at the awareness stage entails uncovering longer-tailed phrases that lack the search volume needed to appear in Keyword Planner.Answer the Public, Ubersuggest, and Infinite Google Suggest are all free, effective tools for identifying long-tailed phrases that customers search for early on in the buying cycle.So you can begin to understand the sort of information available through these tools, head over to Answer the Public and enter a relevant head search term in the search box.For the purpose of this exercise let’s pretend we own an app design agency. We’ll call ourselves “App Design Inc.”This means I’m going to want to find out what sort of questions companies are asking about application design, so I might search for a phrase like “mobile apps”.This search has brought back 132 questions in total. Many of them are pretty useless to me at this time, but many more could easily be worked into content that targets companies who are curious about mobile applications and eager to find out more.The sort of phrases I’m looking for at this stage are things like:These are all questions that are likely to be asked by companies who know mobile apps are popular right now and that there’s a reason why – but that’s it. In other words, questions that companies right at the top of the funnel will be seeking answers to.In addition to tools built specifically to assist with keyword research, sites that are geared around users asking and answering questions can provide invaluable TOFU inspiration, too: think Quora, Reddit, and even Yahoo Answers. Customers who move past the awareness stage and into the middle of the funnel (MOFU) are getting pretty serious about making a purchase; they just haven’t decided exactly what they’re going to buy, or who they’re going to buy it from.If the “top of the funnel” is equivalent to window shopping, then the “middle of the funnel” is equivalent to heading to the mall knowing you want to buy a sharp pair of pants – you just don’t know which pair, or where you’re going to buy them from.Customers at this stage are extremely valuable. They’re keen to purchase something you offer. You just need to find a way to get yourself in front of them.Adding content to your own site remains an effective way to do that, although the keywords you target will differ, as might the format you use to present the content.Customers at the middle of the funnel are researching their options. They want to buy a sharp pair of pants, but first they want to see what different styles of pants are available, and how prices and value compare. This could mean writing a blog post that targets relevant search terms, or optimizing existing landing pages to capture a wider variety of phrases. Since we’re moving into the buying stages of the funnel here, I’d probably use a mixture of long-tail keyword tools and Keyword Planner to help me pinpoint the right words and phrases to include.We’d be looking for things like:Other content formats that work well at this stage include infographics (as seen in the example below), checklists, and comparison blog posts (articles that pit your product directly against your competitors’).Just remember to pay attention to keyword usage on the page and in your metadata, regardless of the type of content you’re creating.Another great way to capture middle-of-the-funnel searchers involves heading outside the safety of your own site. Instead of waiting for customers to come to you, you go where your customers already are. Writing guest articles for big-name sites and publications is an awesome way to build your profile and get your brand in front of your target audience. Why do you think I do this? It’s not just for fun (even though I enjoy it).The trick here is to target the right audience without being self-promotional. You want to educate and inform, to give people all the information they need to make their own decision.Keywords are important here, too – even more so if the publications you’re contributing to have the domain authority to rank more easily for key terms than your own site. Use that authority to your advantage.At the bottom of the funnel (BOFU), you have visitors that are seriously considering making a purchase from you – they just need a little persuading in order to push them over the edge. To stick with the shopping-for-pants analogy, the BOFU is equivalent to a fitting-room assistant telling you how great you look (as you try on the most expensive pair, naturally).At this stage, keyword tools become somewhat less important. Prospects at the bottom of the funnel know you exist and may have visited your site multiple times. Your job is to do that last little bit of convincing that persuades them to buy.At this point, your on-site search becomes a goldmine of data. What questions are visitors to your site trying to get answered? If you’ve already answered these questions, make the answers easier to find. Create new content for questions which haven’t yet been answered.Returning to our App Design Inc. example this might include questions like…“How much do you charge for app design?”
“How long will my app take to complete?”
“What happens once my app has been built?”Beyond your on-site search data, reviews, testimonials, and case studies all make excellent forms of BOFU content – especially when it’s been crafted from some in-depth competitor research.At the BOFU, you’re likely to be up against one or two rival companies. If you want to ensure visitors wind up choosing you, you need to be analyzing your competitors’ BOFU content and creating your own content that’s a (big) cut above it.If they have written testimonials, you should be making video testimonials. If they’ve crafted a case study that shows how their product helped a customer cut costs by 40%, find and feature a case in which your product helped a customer cut costs by 50%. This is where the competition really gets tough, but luckily, it’s the simplest round to win – you just have to create content that’s better than everything else you’re up against.There’s a lot more to optimizing the conversion funnel than just using the right keywords. App Design Inc. would be analyzing their site architecture to ensure there’s a clear path for visitors to follow through each stage of the funnel.They would be using analytics to identify where in the funnel customers leave the site, and will use this information to make changes that will help boost the number of visitors that remain and move closer towards converting.They will be monitoring user behavior on key pages and adapting content accordingly.They’ll also be executing strategies to gain links and will make the most of the site’s internal linking structure to ensure link equity flows freely to critical awareness, comparison, and conversion pages. On-site and technical SEO plays a key role in optimizing a conversion funnel, as it does in optimizing any element of a site. The trick to designing a site that’s built to capture and convert visitors at all stages is a strategy that combines keyword-driven content with a technically-sound website.Do you agree?

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/whats-your-analytics-data-worth/,What’s Your Analytics Data Worth?,"It can often be hard to nail down the exact worth of analytics data.For most companies, data doesn’t have any inherent worth. No one comes to your site and says, “Hey, I see you’ve got a nice web analytics setup. Can I pay you for your data?”It also takes work to get value out of your analytics data, which is why so many companies don’t set up analytics or don’t use their analytics setup.However, the data most companies are ignoring has value—a lot of value.Analytics is valuable in two ways: 1) it shows you where you are wasting money and 2) it reveals new opportunities for growth.Let’s look at a couple of case studies that demonstrate the value of analytics data in each of these areas:The goal of marketing is to produce profitable sales. That’s it, end of story.It doesn’t matter whether it’s a branding play or a high-intent, low-volume PPC campaign, the goal of marketing is to produce more revenue and profit for a business.In other words, if a campaign isn’t producing profitable sales, it’s not a successful campaign.The problem is, according to HubSpot, only about half of companies track return-on-investment (ROI) for their online marketing. That means half of online advertisers have no idea whether or not their marketing is even working!Simply tracking ROI isn’t enough, though. You can know your overall marketing efforts are profitable and still waste a ton of money on individual campaigns.For example, last year I audited the AdWords account of a potential client. They were in the half of marketers with analytics data, however, they weren’t using it to guide their marketing decisions.After managing their advertising in house for several years, they were generating leads at a decent clip and made a lot of money on each sale. However, their cost-per-conversion was so high that they weren’t actually making any money off of their campaigns.In the hopes of improving things, they had recently increased their budget by 30% only to find that generating more unprofitable traffic doesn’t make you more profitable.It was at this point that I started looking at their account. They had the budget and profit margins to succeed at pay-per-click, but something just wasn’t working.Here’s what their 90-day history looked like:As you can see, over the past 3 months they had spent a lot of money to get about 1 conversion per 500 impressions. At 8 million impressions, though, that was a lot of leads.But what about sales?Unfortunately, only 1 out of every 100 leads became a paying customer, which meant their cost-per-sale was about $2,000.Not a great situation.Clearly, a $20.29 cost-per-lead wasn’t good enough, so I took a closer look at where their money was actually going.After digging into their analytics data, it became clear that they were spending $49,000 a month on clicks that had never produced a single sale.In other words, they were spending 42% of their budget on the wrong audience.By failing to use their analytics data, this client was wasting $49,000 a month.Simply eliminating that $49,000/month of useless ad spend would have dropped their cost-per-lead to $11.86 and their cost per sale to around $1,200, making their campaigns instantly profitable.Even better, if that $49,000/month had been invested in their effective campaigns, it would have produced an additional 4,150 leads and 41 sales per month.Between opportunity cost and wasted ad spend, this client was losing around $81,000 a month simply because they weren’t using their analytics data.In addition to showing you where you’re losing money, your analytics data can also show you opportunities to make more money.Analytics data answers the question: who is interested in what you’re advertising?Often, it’s not who you think it is.Typically, certain market segments respond particularly well to a certain product, offer or advertising approach. If you can identify and specifically target those market segments, you can dramatically improve the performance of your advertising.To get at this data, you have to examine your target market in depth.Here are some things to consider:This sort of information isn’t always immediately obvious, sometimes you really have to dig for it.For example, location information should be readily available from most advertising or analytics platforms. For pain point insights, however, you might have to look at how ad content affects conversion rate across a range of different ads.If you haven’t been meticulous in testing different hypotheses, you may need to run some tests to start getting the analytics data you need. It’s a little extra work, but trust me, the results will be worth it.The thing is, once you actually dive into your data, you start make unexpected discoveries about who is really responding to which marketing campaigns.For example, one of my first AdWords clients operated in a highly competitive market, where the cost-per-click and cost-per-conversion had doubled over the previous 12 months.The company was good at turning conversions into sales, so their campaigns were profitable, but after months of fruitless campaign optimization, it looked like our cost-per-sale was simply as good as it was going to get.I’ve never been one to roll over and accept defeat, though, so I went through our analytics data in search of options.As I reviewed where our conversions and sales were coming from, I discovered that a significant portion of our sales were coming from a set of keywords that seemed largely unrelated to our current offering.More importantly, those keywords were converting at a 67% lower cost-per-conversion and had an enormous, virtually uncontested search volume.I quickly realized that I had uncovered a marketing gold mine and immediately began building campaigns around these untapped search terms.Almost overnight, our cost-per-conversion began to plummet.In fact, the new strategy was so effective that the company had a hard time hiring enough competent sales people to field all of the leads. Within a few years, the company grew from 25 employees to a staff of over 250!For this client, the secrets contained in their analytics data were worth well over $5 million in profit and millions in VC investment.So, what is your analytics data worth to you?For most companies, unlocking the secrets hidden in their analytics data can be worth tens-to-hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in additional revenue and reduced waste.In most cases, the difference between successful and unsuccessful marketing is how well you use your data. It takes extra time and effort to tease the value out of your analytics, but taking the time to do so can be worth millions to your business.What sort of value has your analytics data driven for your business? Do you think that data analysis is worth the effort?About the Author: Jacob Baadsgaard is the CEO and fearless leader of Disruptive Advertising, an online marketing agency dedicated to using PPC advertising and website optimization to drive sales.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/secrets-to-lower-ad-spends/,11 Little-Known Secrets to Lower Your Ad Spends,"“That’s it! I must do something about it,” you whisper after seeing your ads dashboard.For the last month or so, you changed your ad copy, images, did split testing and even hired an ad manager. Yet you only have spent more ad dollars.In fact, sometimes you’re stretching your budget far outside from your pocket.And now, it’s got you thinking…Is it normal to spend so much in ads?Am I the only person who’s suffering from this uphill struggle?Deep down, you know you can’t carry on like this.You know you have to find a way out.So how do you change it? How do you lower your ad costs so it will result in more savings and ultimately higher conversions?Let’s see!Powerful words help you get more click-throughs. They make your copy look fascinating so that visitors stop, read your ad, and click on it.In fact, studies have shown that words are more powerful than sound.That’s why you should aim for including those powerful words that makes your copy look more convincing and appealing.This in turn helps reduce your ad costs and get more clicks from the same budget.This ad from Matthew Woodward is a great example. Not only did Matthew use powerful words in his copy, but he also added social proof by using the keyword phrase “Award Winning Blog”.Smart use, isn’t it?To get started, you can use these 9 powerful words to inspire viewers to take action.Recently, Neil Patel found that a LinkedIn ad costs considerably higher, but their quality is often better than any other platform.On the other hand, Facebook ads were cheap, but their lead quality was considerably lower as compared to LinkedIn ads.This was possible because Neil played and tested with different ad platforms.Once you start running ads on different platforms, you’ll often find this type of pattern in your ads. So, go ahead and run on your ads, at least, on these top performing ad platforms:Invest the same amount of money for each ad platform and calculate overall ROI from each ad platform.This may sound contradictory, but it’s true.When you’re advertising online, you’re competing with thousands of companies and brands, some of whom may be spending millions of dollars per month on paid advertising channels.That means you’re joining a huge, worldwide auction. You’re competing with hundreds of thousands of advertisers.And this narrows down your chances of getting more engagement.So, the only way you can avoid this scenario is by spending more or stretching your budget.But, that doesn’t mean you need to spend more when you’re just starting out.In fact, you should start with a small budget. Once your ad begins to get some clicks, calculate your results and see if you’re getting a positive return.If it is profitable, scale up your campaign and scale the bid higher to a profitable amount, otherwise stop running the ad and start again from scratch.This way you’ll ensure that you don’t spend anything extra on your ads.As time passes, your ads are likely to get older and this in turn can affect your ad spends and budgetFor instance, take Digital Marketer.This was one of their best performing ads in 2014:But as time passed, the ad conversion rate began to decrease.Then they came up with the refreshed version of the ad.And it went on to generate more leads at a much lower cost.And the best part?They didn’t change the offer, just refreshed the older version.Likewise, when your ad cost is going higher- refresh the ad copy and target it to a newer audience.Refreshing the ad will cost you just 15-30 minutes, but creating a new ad with a brand new offer will obviously take hours if not days.When running ads to a landing page it’s always recommended to create a free tangential offer that aligns with your viewers.Why?Because anything free can lure your targeted audience to your site.This YouTube ad from GetResponse sends the viewer to this landing page.This is a highly targeted offer for the visitor.However, that doesn’t mean you need to deliver an immensely valuable service for free.When starting, you can use these freebies to giveaway to your audience:Or even a case study of somebody whom you helped, just like Beth Hayden, who offers a tantalizing case study to new email subscribers.When you’re spending lots of money on ads, you have to keep a regular check on your ads dashboard.If you’re running ads on different platforms, then this makes your task even more difficult.Just one mistake and you lose thousands of dollars.That’s where ad tools come in.They can help you:Keeping all those things in mind, it’s always favorable to use ad tools when you’re spending a lot of money.Or you can even hire an ad manager or PPC expert.There are many ad tools like:There’s a reason why ad networks introduced quality scores.It helps you, as an advertiser, know the quality of your ad. And of course your quality score affects:Here’s a great visual graphic by Wordstream detailing how much you can save by scoring a high quality score:But you often avoid ad quality score by assuming that you can never improve your ad quality score.However, all it takes to improve is focusing on these key areas:A rule of thumb is to keep refining your ads and strive for the best.It’s super important to split test your ads. Without doing so, you’ll never know the villain in your ads.Once you start running split tests, you’ll always come up with a winning version.And the best part about them?It can be applied to anything: landing pages, emails, popups, blog posts, sales pages, and ads.In digital advertising, you can test every element that you think will improve your ad performance. For example:…and there are countless possibilities.All you need to do is just copy the ad. Then, change the element you want to split test and then run the ad.That’s it!Adespresso, for instance, ran a split test on this ad by changing the image:And the results?Well, it reduced their ad costs by 61.24% from $2.673 to $1.036, just by changing the image.However, while split testing with your ad do not change more than one element. If you do, you can’t attribute success to any one element within your ad. For example, don’t change your background image and the headline in your variant. If you do, you won’t know if it won/lost because of the headline or image.As you’ve seen earlier in the example above, images can affect your conversion and ad costs.If used properly, images can help your ad stand out and instantly catch the visitor’s attention.On the other hand, they can be the biggest conversion killer in your ad copy.That means to stand out, get more conversion and lower your ad costs, you need an eye-catching image that stands out from the ecosystem.For example, this ad by GMAT Club is great example of standing out:They strategically used a “Free Webinar” button to catch viewer attention.Here are some tips to make your image stand out:You can hire a graphic designer to design your ad images, or you can use a DIY tool such as Canva.I’m sure you don’t want to target non-interested persons.That would only increase your website traffic not sales. And you’re in this to make sales. Traffic that doesn’t convert isn’t going to pay the bills.That’s why you need to spend some time in targeting your ad to the right people.Fortunately, ad platforms these days are robust enough to create more targeted ads so you can find a suitable audience.For instance, Google allows you to add negative keywords.Those keywords that you don’t want to rank for.For example, for an SEO agency it might be:As all of these are very general broad terms, which definitely will increase your ad costs not sales.On the other hand, social ad networks like Facebook makes it super easy to target the right people using demographics, location, and even interests and behaviors.With these features in hand you can easily advertise to the right people with the right message.This not only will result in a higher conversion rate but also at reduced costs.It’s evident from research that: approximately 96% of visitors leave your site without converting or buying anything from you.That means you’ll have little to no chance to convert them at all.Yes, you can use those annoying exit-intent popups.But still, you can’t stop all of them.Then there comes retargeting ads as your savior.These ads will target those visitors with your ads. So wherever they go, they’ll see your ad.They’re pretty decent in catching those lost visitors.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/multichannel-marketing/,Managing Multi-Channel Marketing (Without Losing Your Mind!),"Remember back in simpler times when online advertising was just web and email? While the marketing was much simpler, the opportunities were also very limiting. You essentially could only reach the user while they were on their computer – and even then, countless other emails and ads were competing for their attention.Fast-forward to today and we now have more channels than ever with which to reach prospects: Internet radio, digital television, native ads, re-marketing, social media. But with so many opportunities comes the dire need to formulate a plan to be able to wrangle it all and not lose your brand’s voice in the process. So how do you do it? Let’s take a closer look into how to create a strong foundation that resonates with your customers (and helps you stay sane).A December 2014 study from SAP shows that multi-channel (also known as omni-channel) is paying off – big.  Fully 86% of those surveyed reported that their multi-channel efforts were leading to increased consumer and customer expectations  Eighty six of those surveyed also agreed that investing in omni-channel clearly outweighs the challenges it presents.Nearly 75% of those same respondents agreed that this type of approach lead to an increase in sales, while 64% noted increased customer loyalty and 62% found a competitive advantage respectively. Over half of those surveyed reported a better customer experience.With that being said, however, only 16% revealed that they were meeting all business and customer analysis needs surrounding the customer experience using their multi-channel approach. When not even a quarter of high level executives are struggling – you know there’s a disconnect.Of course, you can’t just pile on more channels and hope for better results. And as marketing evolves online, this is what many companies will do. It’s a race to see how much you can wring out of various methods and channels before they become too saturated. But where’s the foresight in that?The first step in taming the multi-channel monster is to decide on a unified approach.This is the single-handedly biggest change you can make that will ripple out and affect all of the other departments and campaigns under it.  Back in the 1990s, people wouldn’t be caught dead with an Apple computer if they could avoid it. Today, people can’t get enough of Apple or their products – often waiting in line for weeks for the next big release.And just look at how Apple reinforces that feeling of excitement anticipation. Whether it’s through iTunes, the App Store or the Apple Store itself, every customer touch point lends itself to that unifying experience of “must have tech”.But I get it – you’re not Apple. You don’t have millions to invest in modernizing your equipment. Does that mean multi-channel is out of reach for the rest of us?Absolutely not. But it does mean we have to approach things a little more conservatively.Since you can’t be everything to everyone at the same time, you have to prioritize which channels make the most sense starting out. But don’t just look at channels from a profit standpoint (that’s important too, but it’s not the only criteria you should measure). Look at things like:Gauge your various channels to determine which one is delivering the best quality leads at the lowest cost – that should be your first item of business.  There’s no sense in chasing down customers through traditionally expensive mediums like television or radio, if they’re not conducive to a purchase at that point.The question then becomes – what kind of indicators do we use to see how these various channels are performing? Radio is different from TV is different from social media is different from postcard mailings. Many strategists try to find a unifying indicator that they can use across all channels – but that seldom works, because you’re reaching people at different stages in the buying cycle.Every campaign is going to have its own objective, conversion rate and cost.  The most important part to keep in mind is to not spend money on a campaign that’s providing tepid results at best. So many companies look for ways to put their fingers in every pie, when those pies may not be relevant or even useful to their audience.  By narrowing down your targets to what’s working, you can concentrate more of your resources into dominating that channel and providing the kind of seamless experience your customers long for.There is no “one size fits all” approach in multi-channel. And the vendors you choose will depend heavily on how far back you have to go to integrate all your customer information. Are we talking about wrangling legacy point-of-sale systems or can we skip the complicated stuff and leverage our digital information quickly?For traditional brick and mortar stores who have to juggle inventory management with IT know-how and supply chains, there’s no shortage of powerful platforms to do the heavy lifting.  Tools like Websphere Ecommerce from IBM and Hybris Software from SAP can confidently monitor and engage from store to web to social media.If you’re looking for a more innovative approach, companies like Adaptly and Adgorithms are using human ingenuity and artificial intelligence to calculate, learn from and adapt to various shifts that are par for the course when it comes to multi-channel management.So as you can see, multi channel can seem overwhelming at best. But the payback in terms of revenues, customer loyalty and reinforced brand messaging are there for those bold companies willing to make a concentrated effort and make that leap. By creating a singular brand voice along with crafting a plan that puts your best channels first, while measuring the metrics that matter, you’ll be able to make a confident foray into the world of multi-channel – without losing your shirt.Are you currently leveraging multi-channel marketing initiatives in your business? How is it working out for you? Do you think multi-channel marketing still has a ways to go before it can be more mainstream for large and small businesses alike?  Share your experiences with us in the comments below!About the Author: Sherice Jacob helps business owners improve website design and increase conversion rates through compelling copywriting, user-friendly design and smart analytics analysis.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/ab-testing-myths/,It's Time to Bust These 7 A/B Testing Myths,"A/B testing is a familiar practice to many marketers and businesses. But, if you’re just getting started, here’s a quick, dirty definition of A/B testing – it’s basically exactly what it sounds like. You take two different variants of a test subject and categorize them as the control variant and the challenger variant. Then, you conduct a performance test against a set of specific success metrics to determine which variant is better.Quiz any industry expert on the best way to optimize conversion rates, and we bet the answer you’ll get is A/B testing. In fact, TruConversion.com explains that correct A/B tests can boost conversions up to 300 percent.But, there is a fair share of marketers and businesses that constantly choose not to use A/B test experiments. Don’t take our word for it. Check out these stats: Given these stats, it’s not difficult to understand why most businesses and marketers steer clear of A/B testing for optimizing conversions. One of the major reasons marketers don’t A/B test is the string of myths associated with it. So, before you dismiss running A/B tests, there are a few things you need to know. Here are 7 A/B testing myths we’ve busted to help you stay ahead of the curve in 2016:A/B testing started way back in 1908 when William Sealy Gosset altered the Z-test to create Student’s t-test. However, it took a really long time for A/B testing to hit the mainstream. Until recently, it wasn’t a popular technique for boosting conversions.By testing a feature or an element of your website, landing page, or even your emails, you can maximize conversions and minimize the impact of the ever-changing market dynamics. Take the example of Nature Air, a popular Costa Rican airline. Nature Air conducted an A/B test experiment on its landing pages to understand why its conversions were low. They found out that their CTA wasn’t prominently placed. So, they put a contextual CTA in the content area, and their conversions improved by 591%!Given this example, it isn’t too difficult to understand why A/B testing has become a familiar practice for a large majority of marketers and businesses. In fact, Unbounce reports that 48% of businesses plan to spend more on A/B testing in 2016.But, its superb efficiency in terms of conversion optimization and its ever-increasing popularity have also caused confusion. A large number of businesses and marketers believe that A/B testing and conversion optimization are the same. However, this is not true. Let’s understand the difference between the two: Conversion rate optimization is a structured and systematic process of increasing the percentage of website visitors who convert, meaning they take the action the website wants them to take. For example, conversion for an e-commerce website could be a product purchase. But, conversion isn’t necessarily always a purchase. Conversion for a media site could be a survey completion. Commonly referred to as CRO, conversion rate optimization is a collective term for all the tools and methodologies marketers use to optimize their sites and campaigns. Pretty much every marketing tactic can fit under the CRO umbrella, including personalization, web data analysis, retargeting, user surveys, and A/B testing. Remember, CRO is about using tools and methods to squeeze out the most conversions from your website. A/B testing is one of the many conversion optimization tools that help marketers gather data and understand what’s working and what’s not in order to help them make necessary changes and boost conversions. Myth Busted: A/B testing is actually a small part of the conversion optimization process. There are a host of other activities included in conversion optimization strategies. In fact, ConversionXL has found that A/B testing is just 20% of the overall conversion process. The site describes conversion optimization as an elaborate process where: The success rate for A/B testing is marginal. And, many people believe that tests that make no real statistical difference are just a waste of time and resources. Indeed, given the following stats, it’s no wonder most entrepreneurs and marketers tend to steer clear of tests that provide inconclusive tests:If you’re reading this, chances are you’re already aware of what an inconclusive test is. But, in case you’ve been living under a rock, here’s a quick, dirty definition of an inconclusive test – it’s a test that doesn’t show a solid, statistical difference in your conversions. As an example of an inconclusive test, here’s a case study from Groove HQ. In a bid to lure in more customers and increase its credibility, the company decided to test customer logo examples from a variety of industries to determine which logo designs were most relatable to visitors. But, the results of the test were inconclusive. Logo design of their customers and clients in the challenger version made no drastic difference in influencing prospects’ buying decisions. Now, we’re sure you must be thinking it’s better to steer clear of inconclusive tests in the first place in order to save time, money, and resources. You are not alone. Most people think that inconclusive tests are a curse. But, contrary to popular belief, inconclusive tests can actually point you in the right direction. They can direct your attention toward things you’ve missed and things that can make a radical difference.  Let’s take another example of an A/B test on Ruby Lane conducted by Grigoriy Kogan. Kogan tested the original checkout page against a simple checkout page that included the most essential information and prominent checkout buttons. The hypothesis for the test was that prominent checkout buttons and fewer distractions would increase the checkout rate.But, the test proved to be inconclusive. Taking a cue from the test, Kogan scrutinized the targeted audience data more closely and found that due to a minor difference in checkout flows between existing users and guests, some guests never saw the new variation but were included in the results anyway. After learning this, he conducted a retest with a more precise activation method. In the retest, the test variation improved checkout rates by 5%. Myth Busted: Inconclusive tests aren’t failures. Instead, they give you an opportunity to rethink your interpretations. Inconclusive test results could mean either your customers did not like the changes you made, only a few of them liked the changes, or your test was measuring the wrong things.  If you devote a little time to mulling over the inconclusive test results, you may find where your interpretations are wrong and how you can fix them. The success of your A/B tests are essentially underpinned by what you learned from your previous tests. So, analyze the results and iterate. A day without a test should be considered a wasted day.This one is perhaps the biggest myth of them all. But, why is that? Let’s look at some stats to understand this point a little better:Given these stats, it’s not difficult to understand that A/B testing different elements can lead to a substantial increase in conversions. Unfortunately, it’s the lucrative benefits associated with A/B testing that tempt impatient marketers to run simultaneous tests and test everything and anything possible under the sun. As a result, they aren’t able to get the desired results. In fact, most marketers who test everything fail miserably. Let’s take the example of Timothy Sykes as featured on Quick Sprout. He made the mistake of changing his video, headline, copy, and the form field design all at the same time. It resulted in a dramatic decrease in conversions. In addition, he didn’t find out if changes he made were worth implementing. Now, the big question here is what should you test? The answer to this question is a little tricky. So, let us simplify it for you. Though there isn’t really a silver bullet as to what you can test, it makes sense to test things that affect conversion. Testing and changing elements that do not affect your customer’s decision-making ability doesn’t make any sense. Prioritize elements with high potential for improvement. Check analytics data to find the problem areas of your website. ConversionXL.com suggests you select test subjects based on value and cost. You must start with high-value, low-cost testing ideas.In addition, testing and changing elements that aren’t backed by solid, actionable data won’t bring you any positive results. The major objective of A/B tests is to find out what your user wants and demands from your brand, and then make the changes accordingly. Myth Busted: As a marketer, you may become infatuated with metrics, but remember that A/B test experiments are all about persuading your customers to take a desired action on your site. Testing everything, every time won’t be of any use in leading your clients or customers toward conversion. Your test subjects must depend on your business objectives and goals. Though there are a lot of things you may test, Daniel Louis from TruConversion.com explains that the pages listed below are tested in almost all cases:A large percentage of marketers believe that everyone should run A/B test experiments to optimize conversion rates. Sadly, this is just a myth. Though conversion is the highest leverage point for any business, it doesn’t mean that everyone should run A/B test experiments. Remember, A/B testing is just 20% of the overall conversion optimization process. So, who shouldn’t run A/B tests? Well, if you don’t care about sample size, A/B tests aren’t the thing for you. An insufficient sample size may tilt your test results toward figures that wouldn’t be anywhere close to real life. In addition, if you have solid data indicating there are some elements that aren’t working well, it makes sense to go ahead and change them without waiting to A/B test. You will optimize your conversion rate much quicker without diluting your information with a test. You can find elements that need changing in a host of other ways, including:Myth Busted: Contrary to popular belief, A/B testing isn’t for everyone. For small fixes and issues, such as broken pages and driving traffic, you do not necessarily need to run A/B test experiments. You can simply use one of the many other CRO strategies to make improvements effectively. In addition, testing with an insufficient sample size will produce inaccurate data anyway.  This is yet another myth that surrounds the phenomena of A/B testing. A considerably large segment of marketers are of the belief that test results remain constant after you complete your test. However, test results are never constant, they keep on changing. No matter how well your website or landing pages are doing, they may always experience changes. Remember, test results are nothing but a picture of your A/B test’s performance for a specific time period. And, there are a host of factors that can make your conversion data change dramatically in the future.It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that time impacts conversion rates in a big way, such that test results obtained in the month of October may vary dramatically from results of the same tests carried out six months earlier in April.But, why is that? There may be a host of reasons. Maybe your visitors’ intentions about visiting your site or spending on your site are different during those two months. Therefore, it makes sense to periodically monitor the conversion rate of your A/B test’s winning variation. It will help you track any imaginary lifts that materialize later. Imaginary lifts are common scenarios that occur due to insufficient sample sizes or unrealistic metrics. Besides helping you understand false positives, monitoring will also help you identify more optimization opportunities. Check out the example below: In this test, the joke version of the ad garnered more clicks than the carefully created one. Though the challenger version of the test generated more clicks, it doesn’t mean that the second ad “worked” better for the business. This is a false positive. Other common factors that may change your conversion rate include: It makes sense to monitor all these factors in order to get an idea of how your conversion rate changes. Myth Busted: False positives may impact your test data. As a result, your data may gradually change over the course of time. So, don’t forget to monitor your data for a considerable period of time before making any projections. Remember, the only way to stay ahead in the game is to keep testing. And, if your tests are successful, don’t get complacent. Start a new test experiment and look for other optimization opportunities in order to minimize the impact of false positives.Given these stats, we’re sure that almost every marketer with even a hint of experience in the industry is plagued by this myth. A large fraction of marketers believe that A/B testing can fix their conversion rate. Sadly, this isn’t true. As discussed earlier, A/B testing is a part of the bigger conversion optimization process. It helps you gather data that facilitates decision making. A/B testing can help you find out what’s working and what’s not working on your site, but it can’t turn your site into a conversion machine. Based on the insights you get by running A/B test experiments, you can devise a strategy or plan a solution to increase your conversions. But, you do this with the statistical data you get from the test, not the actual test itself.   Remember, you’re just one click away from oblivion. And, A/B testing won’t prove to be helpful if your website design, offers, and content fail to capture your target audience’s interest right from the get-go. Myth Busted: A/B testing can’t fix your conversion optimization. It can only offer you insight into what’s not working on your site. You’ll need to devise strategies to fix your conversion based on the data or insights you gather from your A/B test experiments. In addition, your A/B tests won’t bear fruitful results if your site is broken. In order to boost conversions, you’ll need to ensure that everything on your website – from the content to the overall voice of the design – comes together in a way that makes your customers and prospects want to know more about your brand and want to stay.   This is another popular myth that constantly haunts marketers and has plagued the A/B testing industry. Many marketers believe they need to gain some technical knowledge before they run A/B test experiments. Some even believe that A/B testing is only for the tech-savvy marketers. Here’s a disturbing fact: A large number of marketers believe that A/B testing involves adding complex scripts and updating algorithms. On the contrary, A/B testing isn’t rocket science to understand and put into practice. You don’t need to depend on your tech team or learn complex technologies to run A/B test experiments. A/B testing is what it sounds like: You take two different variations of a test subject and test them against defined success metrics. Then, depending on the results, you choose the winning variant. Simple, isn’t it? Remember, testing technologies just reveal numbers. You are the one who is responsible for applying them to increase your conversions. Myth Busted: A/B test experiments aren’t just for tech-savvy marketers. All you need is to know how to run A/B tests and have are the right tools in your arsenal. Here’s is a list of easy steps that will help you run A/B tests:Here are a few tools to help you run A/B tests without having to attend tech classes:Now that you know the steps and resources for successfully running A/B test experiments, you are all set to take the plunge. Here’s a piece of advice from TruConversion’s Hammad Akbar: Refrain from content cloaking, use 302 redirects, and most important don’t be impatient. So, there you have it: 7 of the deadliest myths that have long been keeping marketers away from A/B testing! But, fortunately, the world seems to be awakening to the power of A/B testing. It’s slowly becoming a fad among marketers who earlier were apprehensive about it. We’re sure these debunked A/B testing myths will help you recognize right from wrong and truth from lies!So, if you’re really looking forward to converting the strangers to your site into paying customers, we suggest you get over these 7 A/B testing myths and start fresh.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/conversion-optimization-techniques-to-improve-rankings/,5 Killer Conversion Optimization Techniques That Improve Your Rankings,"Conversion optimization and SEO have a rather symbiotic relationship — they rely on each other in order to function.  Just as no salesperson can perform their job without a steady flow of customers in their store, no call-to-action can drive conversions without traffic coming to the website. On the other hand, what good are droves of customers if you don’t have an effective strategy to influence them into making a conversion? Leveraging SEO and conversion optimization offer a balanced approach to your marketing strategy, addressing both sides of the equation. Even if your company primarily invests in PPC to reach its target traffic, ignoring the organic side of search is a mistake — don’t lose out on an opportunity for new customers. Whether you’re developing new content or simply want to revamp your existing landings pages, these tried and true conversion optimization techniques can improve your performance in organic search over time. Google loves websites that provide immediate answers.The first page of search results is loaded with pages considered most efficient in terms of answering your search query.While it’s tempting to optimize pages for a broad audience in order to attract more visitors, this approach often creates a poor user experience.Addressing a wide range of topics all but guarantees your audience will need to dig for the information they need. Landing pages that speak to everyone speak to no one in particular.Sharpening your focus is a top-down process that starts with the structure of your website. If you’re not familiar with the concept of SEO silos, it’s time to read up. How you organize your pages directly impacts how search engines crawl your site and users find the information they need. So-called ‘silos’ give your content a natural place to exist within your site.With a well-defined site architecture in place, your next task is ensuring the content of your landing pages remains highly focused. Segment variations of your central theme using a clear header hierarchy and tie in a strong call-to-action that speaks to the specific reader.The difference can be dramatic to your organic performance and overall conversion rate. A website’s content is arguably the most important factor influencing conversion rates. It also plays an integral role in how your individual pages perform in organic search.Great marketing content has the ability to seamlessly blend conversion opportunities. Take a look at the example below for instance:There’s a few things to keep in mind when developing new content to ensure you’re getting the most out of it in regards to conversions and SEO. First and foremost, your content should be designed for human audiences. While it’s important to include keywords from an SEO standpoint, you quickly turn off readers with content designed for search engines that’s overloaded with terms. Remember, too many cooks in the kitchen can spoil the broth.In finding keywords to optimize your content, don’t fixate on volume. Keywords with less volume but obvious intent behind them are worth far more. Think discount running shoes vs. shoes — which is more likely to lead to a conversion?Craft your content with clarity and conversion in mind. Write with a sense of urgency and utilize strong calls-to-action throughout that compliment the natural thought process.   The above example from Kissmetrics does a great job simplifying the benefit of the service and prompts the reader to make a conversion.Keeping this content clean and concise makes it easy for your audience to absorb the value proposition and large call-to-action buttons influences their next move.Nothing encourages a visitor to flee your site faster than encountering a massive wall of text.Breaking up content with visual elements can help make your content more digestible and keeping your audience engaged could ultimately make the difference in terms of creating a new conversion.While incorporating images can dramatically improve readability and decrease your bounce rate, they must also serve a purpose. Always keep these elements highly relevant.Determine whether a portion of your content is better served presented as an image. Mine your analytics for landing pages with higher bounce rates and see what opportunities are present to enhance the count with visuals.  Apart from better engaging your audience, images also affect the SEO value of your page. Be sure to optimize your images using file names, alt text, and appropriate captions.Does your website utilize heavy amounts of Flash? If so, you’re living in the past.Once a cornerstone of the web, Flash has long since been labeled an outdated technology. Originally developed with a mouse and keyboard in mind, today’s internet users have evolved beyond traditional desktop computers — over half of all internet searches now attributed to mobile devices.Modern web design has moved away from Flash, citing it as major hindrance in terms of accessibility. Flash hampers mobile and tablet users from accessing your full site; similarly, search engines can’t crawl Flash elements of your site, negatively impacting your overall optimization.While having a few Flash elements won’t hamstring your site completely, it’s a major accessibility issue to address if it affects the way users navigate or interact with your content.Beyond improving the accessibility of your site, stripping Flash elements can dramatically improve loading times. Faster loading times also give your site an edge in relation to how Google ranks your site.The bottom line is you want to ditch Flash altogether to create the best user experience and improve your organic search performance — start preparing an exit strategy with your developers.HTML 5 is the best alternative to Flash and other outdated third party media players. Simple in both form and function, this developer-friendly format ensures your video and audio files are accessible to users across all devices.It’s nearly impossible to improve your conversion rate without setting a benchmark. Routine testing allows you to monitor your performance and inform your overall marketing strategies going forward.If you’re just getting started with analytics, start simple. The first thing you’ll typically want to identify is your top pages, easily identified through Google Analytics (Behavior → Site Content → Landing Pages).Using your top pages as a benchmark, identify the areas of your site where people most commonly exit (Behavior → Site Content → Exit Pages). Is there anything these lower performing pages might be missing present in your top pages?Additionally, there’s a lot of intelligence related to your conversions to be gained from tracking goals in Google Analytics. Most importantly, you’re able to identify the areas of your conversion funnel that might need the most attention.Use your data to make small improvements across your pages, making sure to monitor changes in traffic and user flow. Perform regular A/B testing to refine your strategies whenever possible.Conversion optimization and SEO are complementary forces designed to build an audience and guide their behavior. Utilizing these techniques can move your website in the right direction in terms of both.Remember, the benefits of a well optimized site don’t appear overnight — you’ll need to diligently test and revise your landing pages to see the difference to conversions and organic search performance.About the Author: Tyler Thursby is a Senior SEO Analyst for Zion & Zion, a leading advertising agency out of Phoenix, AZ.

,https://blog.kissmetrics.com/cart-recovery-email-strategies/,5 Steps to Building a Cart Recovery Email Strategy That Will Increase Conversions,"For an e-commerce business, shopping cart abandonment is the most common and most inevitable scenario. A Baymard Institute study states that 68.63% of carts are abandoned every year. That means that only about 1 in every 4 customers actually finishes their purchase.Despite this loss of sales, most e-commerce marketers are targeting these lost customers with nothing more than retargeting ads. There is a lack of proper marketing strategy to target these potential customers early in the buying process. The shoppers are simply retargeted later with Facebook ads alone.Although retargeting is an effective way to recover the lost revenue, the most important tactic I’ve found for tackling shopping cart abandonment is to send cart recovery emails. Cart abandonment emails are not just highly conversion-centric, they are also personal, re-engaging shoppers with a human touch. These emails have a high open rate and click-through rate compared with promotional emails.Also, email marketing has been shown to have a better ROI than social media marketing, SEO, and content marketing, which is why email marketing is a key part of the marketing strategy of every e-commerce business.But, most of these online retailers do not have a properly crafted email strategy for cart recovery.Here are the five best strategies for a successful cart recovery email program:The success of an email campaign is directly proportional to its relevance. When subscribers receive personalized emails, they are more likely to take the desired action. Your cart recovery emails are no exception to this rule.But, when it comes to abandoned cart emails, most marketers believe that handing out discount coupons to every abandoner can solve their problem. Unfortunately, that’s not going to happen. Why? Because to recover these lost carts, you have to address the intent of the abandoners.Now, the question is, how do you do that? Well, segmentation is the key to slicing and dicing your cart abandoners so that you can follow up with customized messages based on where they are in the customer lifecycle. The reason a first-time shopper might abandon their cart can be different from the reason a loyal customer might not complete their purchase. By segmenting your abandoners into different categories like first-time abandoners, repeat abandoners, and existing customers who abandon, you can send more relevant messages. Remember, cart recovery is a battle, and segmentation is the sword that can help you win the battle.When an email lands in your inbox, how do you decide whether to act on it or not? If you like the subject line, and if you trust the sender, you will open it; and if not, the chances are high that you won’t open it. In fact, 33% of email recipients open an email based on subject line alone.Your emails are unique. Your subject lines should be, too.When recipients read your subject lines, they should be reminded of what they left behind. A well-written subject line can go a long way toward piquing the interest of reluctant customers. So, don’t be lazy when crafting your subject lines for cart recovery emails. Depending on what is triggering (discussed in step 5) the email, you can include urgency, scarcity, or emotions like anxiety to influence hesitant shoppers.Craft your subject lines to convey your call to action in a way that whets the appetite of your subscribers. But, being direct doesn’t mean you can’t be creative. Here are a few subject lines that have caught my eye:Also, make sure to optimize your subject lines for mobile as more than 50% of emails are opened on a mobile device these days. And, keep your subject lines short. It’s advisable to keep them under 30 characters as the average mobile screen has room for only 4-7 words max.Timing is everything when it comes to recovering your lost carts. According to statistics, 90% of your leads go cold within an hour. But, before you automatically follow that statistic, consider the type of product (perishable or non-perishable), ticket size, etc., and then decide when you will send your email. For example, if someone has abandoned a smartphone in their cart, they might need more time to finalize their purchase, but the same rule doesn’t apply when a shopper has left a shirt in their cart. You can create a great email that includes rich product images, compelling copy, a good offer, and a good CTA. However, if it’s not responsive across all devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, it’s not going to increase your conversions.Being responsive is the key to making the customer experience seamless because people are checking their emails on different devices, mostly mobile. How optimized your emails are for these devices will play a significant role in determining whether or not people will complete their purchases.While a single cart recovery email can boost your conversions, sending 1 or 2 follow-up emails can get the most out of your cart recovery campaigns.We recommend a series of 3 emails be sent at pre-determined time intervals. The first email, triggered within an hour, could be a gentle nudge reminding customers they’ve left something in their cart. If the first email does not persuade customers to complete the purchase, then a second email could be triggered with an aim to induce urgency. And, for those customers who still don’t convert, a third and final email could be triggered to persuade them with an incentive to complete their purchase.Follow-up emails can also be triggered by inventory levels of the product in the cart. For example, if the number of units of the product in inventory drops to a certain number, that could trigger an email.Here is an example of a 3-email series cart recovery campaign:But, don’t be tempted to blast your abandoners with too many emails without testing the impact of these additional reminders in your cart series. Also, personalize these recovery emails based on the customer actions, and optimize accordingly. For example, by including relevant recommendations based on the products in the cart, you can even upsell/cross-sell.To aid your cart recovery efforts, you should customize your email messages according to the various stages of the customer lifecycle. For example, if a repeat customer abandons his shopping cart, instead of sending a friendly reminder, you should ask him if he faced any issues during checkout. Also, for these customers, don’t fork out cash to incentivize the purchase lest you risk conditioning them for a discount on purchase every time. Ideally, you should test a number of customized approaches to get better results. And, don’t forget to test the ideal number of cart recovery messages for every stage.About the Author: Reshu Rathi is Digital Marketing Manager at Betaout, a customer segmentation and marketing automation platform for e-commerce.

It’s highly underutilized compared to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the other social giants.In this post, I’m going to make a case for why you NEED to be using SlideShare in your B2B marketing efforts and how anyone can start on SlideShare and ace it.In 2009, I started out with zero following on SlideShare and after posting up my first SlideShare presentation, I got a flurry of leads and subsequently got even more after my next one. Fast-forward to today and I now have around 1M views on my personal profile with an additional 2M on my agency channel – HighSpark.After speaking with other power-users including Conrad Wadowski at Teachable who made $6000 from one presentation on Growth Hacking to Jake Wengroff at JBX1 marketing who earned $300,000 in revenue which with Frost and Sullivan directly attributable to leads coming from SlideShare – we can really see the awesome power of a great presentation.In this post, I’ll talk about how to add SlideShare at the top of your sales funnel and get real email leads and conversions with your first presentation.If you’re not already collecting email leads for your business, you need to get started immediately. Email is simply the most effective revenue conversion vehicle for your business.Here are the stats from Unbounce:We did this with our presentation on Seth Godin’s Really Bad PowerPoint, which got us featured on Hubspot and continues to bring us 400 leads every month even though we published it 2 years ago! If your presentation has provided enough value and they see you as the expert on the topic they will be hungry for more.So give them something they can sink their teeth into – whether that’s a webinar, video or email series, swipe file or anything else that relates to your product or service and offers a possible up-sell opportunity.Throwing up a landing page and attaching your lead magnet only takes minutes with software like PageWiz. Before you know it, you’re on your way to collecting leads from SlideShare – don’t make it super complicated just get it done.Pro-Tip: You can’t start adding outbound links until after the 3rd slide but on that fourth slide make sure you do because each after slide less and less people will see.Most people make the mistake of not investing in their presentations.The simple fact is there is 400,000 presentations uploaded every month on SlideShare and to stand out you need to start what little time you have to focus on the things that are going to give you the most results.By purchasing professional graphics made by top-notch designers affordably from places like Creative Market, you get to build quality SlideShares fast without a hole in your wallet.This is how we get 80% of our presentations ranked on the first page of SlideShare and had one of the ones we did for a client, named one of the top presentations of 2015.  To get these gorgeous images, we shelled out only $29 for these ‘Comic Book Elements’ from Creative Market. Imagine that, 399,082 views for $29 (plus our time) – you do the math.This small investment can add a whole new dimension of design to your SlideShares with very minimal effort, so consider this for your next SlideShare.Check out sites like Pexels.com that aggregate totally free and high-quality images from different reliable sources like Gratisography, Unsplash, and the like.All images are under the Creative Commons Zero License, which are free for both personal and commercial use and requires no attribution. This means you can use these images for virtually anything, without any consequence. In this case, using it for SlideShares ain’t such a big stretch.If you’re not willing to shell out the cash to use paid repositories like Shutterstock or Getty Images, these are the next best thing.I recommend you pick images that have plenty of whitespace so it’s a no-brainer where you should put your text.Instead of scouring for the images you need from the varied smaller free stock websites, everything has been compiled and is easily searchable in one place.The only drawback is that you’ll need to be creative with the context of your images, because you might not always find exactly what you’re looking for. (i.e. if you wanted a guy riding a horse holding a camera)Another feature to note is the ability to download different sized images. To make your life easier, I recommend downloading images larger than 1024 x 768 for 4:3 or 1280 x 720 for 16:9 presentations. This way, you can be assured that your SlideShare images are always high quality and full-bleed.Freepik is another great alternative to grab FREE vectors, logos, stock photos, illustrations, PSD, and icons that you can use to increase visual appeal and maximize conversions for your presentations.You get to pick from diverse themes that range from Fashion, Sports, Weather, Food, Music, Movies, Multimedia, Medical, and People; to name a few – whatever suits your SlideShare presentations. There are premium ones that you can choose from wherein you can score images for a reasonable price tag.If you’re shooting for a conversion, this usually happens on your site, an asset that you can control. But putting a link to your site on every slide isn’t going to work.The best way to do this is to link certain slides back to relevant content on your site, that way it incentivizes your viewer to enter your owned media.Here’s an example:
Instead of going ‘Buy my product’ all of a sudden all over your deck (this usually goes at the end). Feed your audience with resources like blog posts, email courses etc. as you tell a visual story in your SlideShare.By having 3 different lead magnets (yet all linked to the same page) in our Really Bad PowerPoint deck, we were able to capture viewers of different interests throughout our SlideShare resulting in more opt-ins overall.People think that Search Engine Optimization is this black box that you need to hire a professional to break into. This couldn’t be further from the truth.Anyone can do it and I’ll show you the basics in a moment. But first, let’s talk about why SlideShare is so powerful for SEO.There are more or less two parts to SEO: Page Authority & Domain Authority.Page authority is basically how popular that specific page is and is heavily dependent on the number of quality links pointing back to your SlideShare presentation.Basically, this is a score between 1 and 100 as developed by Moz, which predicts the behavior of a specific page as to how it will rank on search engine pages. The results are a composite of many factors that affect how your presentations’ rankings behave.SlideShare in itself is a high authority site. Creating high-quality content with curated content from highly reputed speakers or game changers in your industry is sure to build authority and amplify the PageRank of your presentations.Here is Page Authority and Domain Authority MozBar results example from Digital Guide:Also, this one from Quick Sprout:Because SlideShare presentations encourage sharing and get a ton of shares and embeds – you can count on a healthy dose of links pointing back to your presentation, which in turn means better Page Authority and rankings.Domain authority on the other hand references of the domain that is hosting your presentation – namely SlideShare.net – a website that gets 70M views per month.This is the most comprehensive comparative metric to determine how your domain ranks in comparison to other competition sites. The results fluctuate but are mostly on a progressive state. Site ranking for Domain Authority is dubbed to be site-dependent, which means you need to focus on on-page SEO and optimization to step up your page ranks. Thankfully SlideShare largely takes care of that. Needless to say – the domain authority of SlideShare.net is off the charts at 95.This is probably WAY higher than your personal blog and as a result, presentations you make on SlideShare have a MUCH better chance of ranking high in the Google search results in comparison.So what we have is a very viral medium (presentations) paired with a strong domain, which is a recipe to rank high on Google SERP.Here’s a story on how Dave over at Driftt.com got 28,000 views and ranked his presentation “What is Product Marketing” on the first page of Google within 30 days of posting it. If you want to learn how to research keywords – checkout this handy guide from Quick Sprout.Pro-Tip: Don’t do keyword research until AFTER you have chosen a topic to write about. The concept for your presentation is MORE important than keyword hunting.We all hear about the power of collecting emails but sometimes we forget that there are multiple ways to get a positive interaction with the reader.Include a “PayWithATweet” so people can spread the love and get the presentation in return:Or if you just want to direct audiences to a standalone lead page using both big buttons and discrete links:The point is that each call to action will appeal to a different person and you can capitalize on that by given each of them the choice.Head over to PayWithATweet.comCreate a new campaign and enter the details:Copy the link and insert it into your presentationThat’s all there is to it – now you have a viral presentation waiting to be published.Using tools like ContentMarketer.io, you can start your own outreach strategy to influencers in your industry.If you don’t have a huge audience to begin with, it makes sense to try piggybacking on someone else’s audience.ContentMarketer.io connects you to top influencers by exporting Twitter handles, email addresses, and other contact details from the names of the people mentioned in your SlideShare presentations in a couple of clicks. Initially – it’s not what you know but WHO you know that will help you get that leverage on your SlideShare presentations. The strategy here is to make it known that you’ve mentioned them in your SlideShare in hopes they’ll ‘scratch your back’ as well.With their massive followings, even a small shout out back to you will result in impressive traffic for your SlideShare.In our case, we reached out to high-stakes presentation consultant, Cliff Atkinson to collaborate. We repurposed an existing blog post of his with permission to create this deck: The result was better than we expected. It got featured as SlideShare of the day, garnering 50,000 views and 900 social shares. A win-win for both. We got quality content to upload while he got more reach for his work.So that’s how I went from 0 to 2,000,000 views on SlideShare. As you can see, it’s not rocket science, but really consistent and targeted efforts to achieve our objectives.Now that you have the tools, how will you use SlideShare?
