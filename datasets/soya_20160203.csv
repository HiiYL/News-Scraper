Rory Lee,Microsoft Lumia 950 XL review: A beautiful mess,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/03/microsoft-lumia-950-xl-review-malaysia/,,,2016-02-03,"Windows Phone has never had a proper champion. Not one that was on par with the big boys at Android. Much like Apple, it always banked on its OS optimisations to keep things running smooth despite the less than stellar specifications. This time, though, it seems Microsoft have come out swinging, pulling out all the stops for their latest device, the Lumia 950 XL.Is it any good though?Well, yes and no. It does have a fantastic camera that can definitely replace your average portable camera. I guess a proper PureView unit will be able to do that. Plus, it has a bunch of cool concepts like Continuum and Windows Hello. Unfortunately, thats where the good news stops.The one or two things that Microsoft gets right with this smartphone simply gets overwhelmed by everything they did wrong. It is almost painful to watch something that could have been a true contender for the best smartphone of 2015, fall so hard so fast.If youre looking for the next best smartphone, you wont find it here. If youre just looking for a decent smartphone, you might not find it here either. I simply cant justify recommending this smartphone to any but the most stalwart of Windows fans.Why?"
Rory Lee,Celcom is one upping Digi and U Mobile with their most competitive postpaid plan yet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/02/celcoms-first-gold-15gb-rm80-postpaid-plan/,"Celcom,Celcom FIRST Gold,Celcom FIRST Gold promo,Celcom Postpaid,Celcom Postpaid Plan,Celcom WiFi,Celcom WiFi plus,FIRST Gold,FIRST Gold promo,Players on the Field,postpaid plan","Celcom,Industry in General,Players on the Field,Promotions",2016-02-02,"As the telco war rages on, Celcom hasrevised their FIRST Gold plan in a bid to make their plans more competitive. This new FIRST Gold plan offers users 10GB of mobile Internet + 5GB of WiFi and unlimited free calls and SMS for only RM80 a month.This new FIRST Gold plan is a bump up from the existing plan, offering users 10GB of mobile Internet that is split between 5GB of mobile data and 5GB of weekend data (1.25GB for every weekend) + 5GB of WiFi, compared to the existing plans 8GB mobile Internet (4GB mobile data + 4GB weekend data) and 4GB of WiFi.Not only thatbut the entire plan itself has received a price cut of RM20 working out to a theoretical RM5.33/GB of Internet. An emphasis on the theoretical part though because your Internet quota is split between three different types and even in the most ideal of situations it seems unlikely that you will be able to make full use of it all.Nevertheless, this plan also comes with unlimited calls and SMS to all networks which gives it the slight edge over Digis recent promotional SmartPlan 75 and the U Mobile Hero P70 which only offers unlimited calls, but as those two plans are cheaper at RM75 and RM70 respectively, it definitely evens things out.Plus, if youre counting raw 24/7 data alone, both of the plans offer 7GB mobile data, which is 2GB up from Celcoms 5GB. But, depending on your weekend data usage, you may use more than 2GB over four weekends which would once again place the plans quite evenly with each other. You will get to bring over any unused quota (up to 5GB) to the next month though, which is a nice touch.Whats more, if you exceed RM225 on your monthly usage, Celcom will give you 1GB of bonus data and 2GB of bonus data if you exceed RM500 per month. This means youre eligible for up to 3GB of bonus data per month if you spend more than RM500 on your monthly usage.Celcom also provides free music streaming from Yonder for 12 months to their FIRST Gold subscribers. Besides that, you can also be in the running for Celcoms giveaway promotion where they have given out free movie tickets and petrol thus far.Do keep in mind that this plan is only a promotional plan, so it will be available from 2 February to 31 March 2016 only. If youre interested, head on over to your nearest Blue Cube or Celcom Service Centre. For more information, you can head to their website instead.[SOURCE]"

Thats another flagship processor that has been (supposedly) hit by the thermal bug, as last year we saw it on the Snapdragon 810.A timeline leaked yesterday that state that this processor will be on rolling out at the end of March but with this overheating issue, thatll be a problem for sure to stick to the schedule.Posted in Weibo, a user stated that Xiaomi, HTC and Lenovo will scrap the Helio X20 processor on their upcoming devices due to the processors heat issues. A debacle that some smartphone manufacturers faced when using the Snapdragon 810 chipset a year ago.You can only trust a rumour as far as you can throw it so dont take everything at face value. But once MWC 2016 rolls around youll see how two smartphone makers  Zopo and Doogee  manage to handle this overheating, if any at all.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

As Alphabets market cap has just breached US$ 570 billion; a good US$ 31 billion higher than Apples  for the time being. Stock go up and they come down so its too soon to tell if this will last long enough to be remembered.Posting their 2015 Q4 earnings just today, stock trading allowed their shares to balloon to a gargantuan size. Apple posted the same result last week and theyve shown that their dominance in the smartphone market has begun to stagger.Insights from CNBC highlight that this is the first time that Alphabet (formerly Google) has snatched the title from Apple to be the most valuable company. We heard that the main MVP raking in their earnings was obviously Google, through their crazy ad revenue.For the most part their revenue has been going back into R&D; a good US$ 3.5 billion in 2015 alone. Theyve placed big bets on their moonshot projects and its autonomous cars  that make absolutely no money until theyre proper realised. Yet while being in the red in their ambitious projects, the company still made a decent US$ 23 billion in the same span of time.A reliance on just one particular product will always hurt a company when the market has (in some way) been tapped to oblivion. Of course, Apple being Apple will ride the storm and selling 74.77 million iPhones in Q4 isnt bad, in fact, that makes some smartphone makers seem tiny in comparison. And do remember that Apple was valued at US$ 774 billion in February last year.Page and Brin both deserve credit, so do other heads of Alphabets portfolio but they have to continue to provide solutions to solve the worlds problems  from search engines to self-driving cars.[ SOURCE, 2,VIA, 2, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

Microsofts focus is in its predictive technology and it goes in line with their ambition to develop intelligent systems for greater productivity. For its current users, nothing will change as SwiftKey will continue to be available for free to Android and iOS. Development for the keyboard is still on-going but soon they will integrate its technology onto Microsofts own Word Flow keyboard. In case you missed it, Word Flow was a Guinness World Record holder and Microsoft is working on making it available for iOS users very soon. With SwiftKey on-board, Word Flow is just going to get better and Microsoft will share more updates in the months to come.

To make phone ownership easier, Celcom has introduced its NewPhone program. On the surface, this is similar to the Maxis Zerolution program as it lets you change phones every year for free.The Celcom NewPhone program is open to current and new Celcom customers and you can own your phone with monthly installments over 24 months. On top of that, you get to change phones for free every 12 months. Unlike Maxis, Celcom gives you the option to change phones earlier. If intend to do this before 12 months, an advance change fee will apply that ranges between RM300 to RM1,000 depending on phone model.Similar to Maxis, you are required to return your existing device in good condition. For greater peace of mind, they are also offering Device Protection which gives you coverage for damages, theft, and even water damage.For new Celcom customers (or those who have only been Celcom customers for less than a year), if you do opt for the NewPhone plan, you will be required to pay 3 months of your NewPhones installment upfront, which will be rebated back to you over the coming months. However, for existing customers who have been with Celcom for over a year, you will not be required to make this upfront payment.Also, if you intend to stop at any time, you have the option to keep the device while paying the balance RRP of your installment or to return the phone completely with a one-off penalty charge. When we checked, returning the Galaxy Note5 will attract a penalty charge of RM900.At the moment, Celcom NewPhone only offers Samsung devices which include the Galaxy J7, Galaxy A8, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+. The Galaxy Note5 can be yours at RM125/month or RM145/month if you take up its device protection coverage. As comparison, Maxis Zerolution offers the same model at RM123/month (with Zerolution Upgrade) or RM146 that includes Device Protection.The key difference between this and Maxis Zerolution is that you can choose any plan you want to pair with your NewPhone. This means if youre happy with your current postpaid plan, you can just add-on NewPhone even theres an on-going device bundle contract. So if the MaxisONE plan isnt your cup of tea, you can go for Celcoms more affordable First Gold plan that offers 10GB of mobile data, unlimited calls and SMS for RM80/month.For more information, head over to Celcoms NewPhone."

Yes, a case that adds functionality to your Pebble. The TYLT VU Pulse is being kickstarted and the pledge for a single unit begins at US$ 39 (RM 164.60). Not too painful, and thats definitely cheaper than buying a whole new watch with an HRM. When used together, your Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel will be able to charge wirelessly too, through a Qi wireless charging pad. Charging times wont be spectacular when wireless  two hours to full.As its a case, itll add 3mm to the wearable height and an overall thickness of 4.4mm. As far as straps go, itll be compatible with both Pebble straps as well as other 22mm watch bands.When attached, the Pebble will be able to monitor your heart rate in two modes  passive, tracks your hearts beats every 30 minutes; while active mode takes your heart rate every 10 seconds for fitness related activities.The people behind the case state that using the heart rate monitor for one-hour in active mode will drain the battery by (roughly) 8%. Using the case wont require any additional software, as it integrates with Pebbles own Health app  meaning all your steps, heart rate, calories and timer will be all in one place. Though, HR info can only be accessed in the app for the time being.Itll also support Google Fit and Apple Health if youre not into their own system. TYLT is trying to make the case waterproof but maintains that before the actual prototypes are out  sometime in March and April  they cant say for sure if itll withstand water.After theyve hit 1,000 units, the pricing tiers will increase to US$ 44 (RM 185.69 ) and US$ 49 (RM 206.91) subsequently. Do note that the three prices mentioned are exclusive of shipping.To purchase, head over to their Kickstarter page."

And the latest reports claims that they are testing internet-delivering drones.The report coming from the Guardian suggests that Google has been testing out these drones in New Mexico. Flight-testing is currently taking place in the Spaceport America hangar that they share with Virgin Galactic. Two aircrafts apparently exist a commercial one that can be optionally piloted named the Centaur and the Solara 50 plane that relies on solar panels. Both were supplied by Titan Aerospace that were acquired in 2014.It is reported that the Google X team is equipping these drones with technology to experiment with the millimeter-wave radio transmitters and will aim to place these drones around the world to deliver 5G internet around the globe.According to the 5G classification by the FCC, 5G speeds range from 1Gbps and 10Gbps  thats 40 times faster than 4G LTE. For these drones to do so, the engineering team are battling with distance and signal propagation issues that come accompanied in delivering these higher frequencies.Adding this to Project Fis ensemble would do wonders to their cellular network but before they manage to place these millimeter-wave transceivers in smartphones, Google is placing the stationary antennas around the test site.This is pretty much a more space-age attempt compared to Googles Project Loon balloon that hopes to do the same thing. That particular system allows 4G LTE speeds beamed down through a hot-air balloon. If you want to check out this balloon yourself, youll have to travel to India, New Zealand or Brazil.You can check out the Project Loon video below:With this technology, Google will provide hard to reach places with internet access.

If you peel back the panel, it looks a little less elegant, but if were rating his cable management out of 5 stars, I think he deserves, at least, a passing 2.5 stars.It runs on an Android API via an Amazon Fire TV Stick that is plugged into what Braun says is a board from China that can convert anything in the universe to a 40 pin display cable.The UI is equally sleek, with the skinny and minimalistic font plus generous white spacing (mirror spacing?). For now the mirror has a Forecast weather widget and an Associated Press RSS feed plus a clock. Braun says its incomplete though andis currently playing with concepts like traffic, reminders and basically anything that has a Google Now card.He says that the idea is users dont have to interact with this UI, and it updates automatically. For anything else, its got an open-ended voice search interface.Super cool.

Rory Lee,The iPad Pro outsold Microsofts entire Surface lineup in Q4 of 2015,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/02/the-ipad-pro-outsold-microsofts-entire-surface-lineup-in-q4-of-2015/,"Android Tablet,apple,apple ipad pro,IDC,International data corporation,iOS tablet,iPad,iPad Pro,microsoft,Microsoft Surface,Microsoft Surface Pro,Surface,Surface Pro,Tablet,tablet sales,Windows tablet","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-02-02,"Ah, tablets. If a tablet was one of the characters in my sappy rom-com, itd be the one that got away. To me, it was a novel idea where you could have your smartphone with you for the serious business stuff while your tablet showed you a good time between working hours  literally, with videos and movies or a good book  but when you actually think about it, the tablet simply isnt practical.If you take a look at the International Data Corporations (IDC) latest report on their preliminary data from the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker, youll find the truth in my words as tablet sales are on a downward trajectory. Thats not to say its all doom and gloom though as their report also says that detachable tablet sales have reached an all-time high  lead by the sales of none other than the Apple iPad Pro.Spearheading the detachable (or convertible/2-in-1) pack to finish at 8.1 million devices sold in Q4 of 2015 is Apples biggest iPad, the Pro, raking in just over 2 million units sold  more than Microsofts entire Surface lineup put together. Thats quitesurprising if you ask me because we think that the Surface, especially the Pro 4 is a fantastic little 2-in-1 that can easily replace your laptop, at least for productivity anyway.On the other hand, if you look at reviews online, the iPad Pro is nothing more than a ginormous iPad with a flimsy looking rubber keyboard that has the word Smart in its name. Uh oh, am I bashing Apple again? Oops.I guess I was wrong thenif were going off sales figures because Microsoft only sold about 1.6 million Surface devices in the same quarter. Thats a gigantic gap especially if you consider how many Surface devices there are on the market versus the lone iPad Pro. Quite a feat then but its worth noting that this is only one quarter and well have to see if the iPad Pro can keep this up over the coming quarters.We can definitely see the appeal of a 2-in-1 because it brings the power of the laptop into the form-factor of a tablet. The emphasis is on power though as IDCs findings reveal that of the Surface devices sold, more of them are of the pricier and more powerful Surface Pro line, as opposed to a more affordable Surface 3.That said, Microsoft wasnt the biggest loser in the last quarter because that title belongs to Google. According to the IDC, Googles recent stab at staking a claim in the convertible market was rather lackluster and that it will require a lot more refinement to achieve any measurable success.Oh dear. Google better get cracking on that Chrome OS/Android operating system if they want to carve a slice out of this market.Rounding up the report though is the sad news of the slate tablets slow demise as the entire tablet sales dropped 10.1%, from 230.1 million to 206.8 million devices. The way we see it, the problem with the slate tablet is that theyre neither here nor there.Unless youre picking up one of Apples iPads (theyre leading the sales by the way at 16.1 million units shipped  7.1 million more than the second-placedSamsung) which do offer some tablet optimisations, youre usually stuck witheither an unoptimised Android tablet or a buggy Windows tablet.Amazons USD50 (around RM210) Fire tablet, which runs on their own Fire OS, did come in at a surprising third place  accounting for 7.9% of the market share, beating out the likes of Lenovo and Huawei. Though IDC does note that Amazons success is purely based on the price of its tablet.Trying times for the tablet industry it seems, though, there is some hope in the convertible market, it looks like the slate tablet is slowly dying off.[SOURCE, VIA]"

This time, we supposedly get a glimpse at how Samsung are addressing one of the biggest weaknesses of their previous Galaxy S6 flagship  the battery life.According to popular leakster Eldar Murtazin, the Galaxy S7 can last 17 hours of continuous video playback with maximum backlight  which according to Eldra is a record for this class of devices.Video playback consumes quite a lot of battery power  especially at maximum brightness on what should be a Quad HD display. If this is true, 17 hours of continuous video playback at maximum brightness is borderline bonkers. Even tablets cant last 17 hours of continuous video playback.We are curious how they achieved this feat, if its true. If we compare the Galaxy S7s purported 3,000 mAh battery to its predecessor Galaxy S6 actives 3,500 mAh battery you can sort of get a scale of how insane this claim seems as the Galaxy S6 active can only manage about 10-11 hours of video playback with Netflix.Whats more, Murtazin revealed that the Galaxy S7s battery takes 100 minutes to go from 0-100% charged which is a touch longer than the existing Galaxy S flagships, but we doubt that people will mind that if the battery can truly last as long as Murtazin claims it to be.That said, this is just a rumour with no word on the conditions of the test  for example, was this streamed or played offline  so do take it with a pinch of salt.If we add this to the list of purported specs that the Galaxy S7 is said to feature  a Snapdragon 820 SoC (and likely the Exynos 8890 in different regions), 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, a 12-megapixel BRITECELL primary camera and a 5MP wide-angle selfie camera (f/1.7 aperture for both)  plus waterproofing and a microSD card slot, Samsungs next flagship looks to be a beast.The S7 is also said to come in two variants, the 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge. I guess well find out if these specifications are true at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2016 event in Barcelona.[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

Pop-up ads are just too annoying to not use an ad block program.While many are religious about using an ad block extension for browsing online, when it comes to mobile browsing, most dont care anymore.Mostly because the process of installing an ad blocker on your phone is just so complicated.Well, Samsung wants to help you along byadding support for content and ad blocking plugins to their preinstalled web browser.This updated browser is being pushed to all Samsung phones with Android Lollipop or newer starting today. It will allow users to install helper apps that block ads from websites they visit, similar to Apples Safari browser in iOS 9.The first content blocker available for Samsungs Internet app is Adblock Fast  which is supposed to be the worlds fastest ad blocker. Whether that claim rings true doesnt matter because it is said that this plugin can decrease the web page load times on Android by 51 percent  makes sense since you dont have to load the banner/popup ads on a page. Still 51% isnt a number to scoff at.A quick search on the Google Play Store, there are several browsers with built-in ad block functions but none of them have been able to really get people to jump over from Google Chrome. Lets see how well this does.It is available for Samsung Internet 4.0 and users can download it from the Google Play Storebut keep in mind that the Internet version 4.0 is only being pushed out, so it may not be available on your device yet.

Well you could also opt for the white (knight) coloured variant but thats all up to preference. The black drew us in better  just saying. Picking up the tablet youll be captivated by how compact it is: 6.3mm thin and 693 grams in weight.Even at that footprint, this sleek device manages a 12-inch Super AMOLED (2160 x 1440) screen. Holding it horizontally, youll find it easy on the hands and nice to hold as the sides are rounded.The body is mainly made surrounded by magnesium though the rear will have some plastic elements. Nevertheless, just because it has some plastic, its still quite handsome in a business fashion kind of way.On the tablet itself, youll find only two ports: USB Type-C and headphone jack. Theres also a single SIM-tray slot and dual-side firing speakers on either horizontal sides. On the top left, youll locate the power button and volume rockers that sit side by side. Sitting near the top right of the tablet is a single button that lets you go to the start menu when in tablet mode.Many will be shouting that Samsung could easily paste another USB Type-C slot but maybe on the TabPro S 2? Anyway, the rear and front 5-megapixel cameras are basic and will suffice for video conferencing. PLEASE, unless absolutely necessary do not take photos with this tablet.On the bottom, youll find a Pogo pin system that bears a resemblance to the Surfaces proprietary connectors that allow you to attach, pair and type on the included keyboard cover.In a pinch, itll do but youll notice in the picture above that when you adjust to the two different viewing angles the plastic connector strip looks a bit scary when moved. Were not sure how durable the magnetic keyboard cover will be.Yes, its a large customer. When holding something that has a screen thats 12-inches, youre definitely holding a large slab. If you love consuming media in front of your face, this is definitely a worthy companion. Its Super AMOLED display doesnt hurt either, allowing it to get really bright. Black pixels will be as true as can be since its an AMOLED panel.A fanless number thanks to the Dual-core Intel Core M processor thats clocked to 2.2GHz, the tablet will rarely be noisy. To help with multitasking 4GB of RAM and a 128/256GB SSD is onboard as well.This Windows tablet supports a single-SIM slot thats capable of 4G LTE Cat6 speeds. Samsung made this feature proof by making WiFi 802.11 ac MIMO enabled too. Other connectivity options include NFC and Bluetooth 4.1.Samsung shouts about the 150 minute charging time of the tablet that has a 5200mAh capacity battery but we didnt spend enough time with it to touch bases on that. Maneuvering around the OS on the tablet was smooth with little hiccups but it didnt have any heavy-duty apps on it in the first place.When typing on the keyboard cover, we found that it was made fairly well (aside from the plastic connectors we highlighted) but the 6-rows of full sized keys dont really have much travel and typing wont be the best experience. You should still tip your hats to Samsung as they included it out of the box, unlike the Surface Pro tablet.There wasnt a lot of positive takeaways from the trackpad either, it was jumpy and when touching it, we found that it wasnt as smooth as some of the proprietary 2-in-1 keyboards out there.Well, the South Korean tech giant decided to leave out any availability and pricing details. If you want us to base it on German pricing sets it at 999 (RM 4,506.30). The aforementioned pricing refers to the base WiFi model while the LTE model adds another 100 (RM 451.10).And upgrading to the Windows 10 Pro costs an additional 100 (RM 451.10).Thats a whole lot of dough to burn considering that the tried and true Surface Pro 4 (Intel Core M / 4GB RAM / 128GB Storage) costs RM 3,999 (w/ GST). Thats without the keyboard which fetches an additional RM 529  totaling to RM 4,528. Thats a slightly more expensive but remember that the Surface Pen comes bundled.If Samsung sets the price lower than Germanys, as they do with most of their devices sold in Malaysia, consumers will likely to try out the convertible but the thing that could deter them would be pricing.Well let everyone know when we manage to review this tablet  hopefully together with the add-on stylus and multi-port adapter."

The plan offered 30Mbps fibre broadband at RM179/month, while a faster 50Mbps connectivity can be yours at RM229/month. While downloads are faster, many had frown upon its slower upload speeds. As a comparison, its original UniFi VIP plans offered symmetrical speeds (5Mbps download + 5Mbps upload or 10Mbps download + 10Mbps download). Probably after getting a lot of flak, TM has finally doubled its upload speeds on their latest plans. The base UniFi Advance with 30Mbps download now gets 10Mbps for upload (5Mbps previously), while its higher 50Mbps plan gets 20Mbps upload (10Mbps previously). Theres no change in pricing and those who are already on UniFi Advance including BIZ users can enjoy faster speeds immediately. You can try running a speedtest to find out your current upload speeds.The promo price of RM179/month and RM229/month for UniFi Advance 30Mbps and 50Mbps respectively are still applicable for new sign ups today.

This time, we get an official announcement of the date  February 21  exactly one day before MWC.And so the stage is set.Pretty darn sexy box if you ask me. Since now we have confirmation that the Unpacked event will be happening on the 21st, that means Samsung will be going head-to-head with its fellow South Korean manufacturer LG who is also holding an event on the same day.Clash of the titans?While we dont think LG can even hold a candle to Samsung when it comes to sales, the flagship devices that these two giants can produce are pretty close in performance and capabilities. I mean the LG G4 is a great flagship phone and the V10 is basically a better version of the G4.In any case, it will be an interesting day to say the least as these two giants vie for media attention. It is said that the Samsung Galaxy S7 (and its variants) will be revealed on that day itself, which were inclined to believe.If youre unable to attend the event in Barcelona itself, Samsung will be holding a live stream of Unpacked on YouTube at their channel or their Samsung Newsroom. The event will begin at 19:00 CET on 21 February which translates to 2 am local time on 22 February. Plus, if were looking at the video it looks like there might be a virtual reality stream. 360-degree video hype?To recap, besides a host of internal upgrades, the Galaxy S7 is said to feature a similar design to the Galaxy S6 but with dust and waterproof capabilities as well as a microSD card slot. If youd like to know more about what we know about the S7, head on over here.Speaking of Samsungs anticipated next flagship, new renders from serial leakster @evleaks have appeared on the web that confirms our suspicions about what the device will look like  which is almost exactly like the previous Galaxy S. Either way, these are only renders so well leave it up to your judgement on the validity of these images.[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

It has just gotten the SIRIM green light with the model number 2015116. This is Xiaomis first metal-clad smartphone and its also their first to feature a fingerprint scanner.The Redmi Note 3 was announced shortly after the Redmi Note 2 was released in Malaysia. There are 2 variants available, with the base model getting 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Meanwhile, the higher spec model offers 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The front gets the same 5.5 Full HD display and it also runs on a MediaTek Helio X10 processor. For photography, the cameras are carried over from its predecessor with a 13MP main camera and a front-facing 5MP unit. The battery isnt removable but it gets a generous 4,000mAh capacity built-in. Like most Xiaomi smartphones, this is a dual-SIM device with 4G LTE but unfortunately, it lacks a microSD expansion slot. In China, the Redmi Note 3 is priced from 899 CNY (about RM569) to 1099 CNY (about RM695). For those who cant wait, a couple of retailers are selling grey import units from RM699. So far we have no visibility of its local launch but we reckon it is likely to be after Chinese New Year.Redmi Note 3 SIRIM Certification

Be warned, this man is revered by tech journalist all over and hes someone Samsung doesnt want nosing around their business.At it again, Mr Blass has released press renders of the two Galaxy S7 devices and were convinced that theyre real.Taking a closer look at the two smartphones, they dont really look much different from their predecessors. The Galaxy S7 looks to be a smaller 5.1-inch device while the S7 edge will be a step larger at 5.5-inches. From their profile, the duo appears to be thinner than before and thatll mean youll feel more glass than ever before with the metal frame taking a back seat. Although, Blass was the same individual that claimed that Samsung was going to release not two but four models at MWC 2016  something Samsung has never done before. Shortly after, he alleged that the manufacturer decided against it and may have been postponed to a later  likely September during their phablet season  date.The two Galaxy S7 devices look more alike than ever and the only difference  other than the size  would be the curvature of the edge tapering over the sides as expected.If were continuing to take evleaks word for it, the display on the two devices will be of a Super AMOLED Quad HD (2560 x 1440) resolution and include an always-on-display function (AOD) that allows the glanceable screen to consume only a tiny bit of battery per hour.Battery-wise the two devices will get larger lithium-ions cells too: 3000mAh on the Galaxy S7 and 3600mAh on the Galaxy S7 edge. Running its core(s) will either be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor or Exynos 8890 processor which will be region dependent. Both phones will have 4GB RAM on board and come in two internal storage variants: 32GB and 64GB. Blass claims that the microSD will make a return on the upcoming flagships as well.On the camera front, Samsungs BRITECELL technology is about to make its first showing and itll do so on the purported 12-megapixel rear sensor with an aperture of f/1.7 on both S7 smartphones.During the BBC interview that Blass gave, he candidly mentions that sometimes these smartphone makers purposely pass him information to keep the hype high. Is Samsung one of them? Well, thats up to you to decide.Ultimately, well have to wait for the 21st of February to see if Evan Blass leaks are the real thing though we wont be betting against him.[ SOURCE, 2 ]"

You can get free internet when you reload as little as RM10, and enjoy up to 1.5GB free each month. Nope, this isnt your free basic internet but non-throttled internet at full speeds. There are 3 options available which vary on reload amount and validity. For most users, a typical RM30 top up would grant you 1.5GB of free high-speed internet thats valid for 30 days.As comparison, both U Mobile and TuneTalk offer 1GB of free high-speed internet when you top up RM30/month each month. The only cumbersome step, is you would need to redeem it manually from Digi by dialing *888*1# and you have to do it within 3 days upon reload. To squeeze more data from your ringgit, you can get a total of 3.5GB high-speed internet on Digi for only RM30/month. After redeeming the free 1.5GB internet, you can subscribe to a 1.5GB monthly internet plan at RM30/month, and then redeem another 500MB from its Super Deals promo.

With the Galaxy S6, the South Korean electronics company showed that they could do premium incredibly well and I wondered if that aspect would carry over to the Galaxy A lineup, or if it would just be a half-arsed rehash.Well, when I arrived at the launch venue floor, that thought was quickly answered.The one I was waiting to find out about. Was it going to live up to the hype? In short, yeah it did that and more. Like the Galaxy S6, the glass panels of the A series (yes all three of them) came together with the metal frame about as well as glass and metal can possibly come together. The 2.5D contoured edge glass helped with giving the side of the phone a rounded and more natural feel in the hand.Each panel was a massive fingerprint magnet,though  as glass usually is  but at least theyre Corning Gorilla Glass 4, so that should keep scratches at bay. The buttons were fantastically tactile and had a satisfying click, even the home button.The three devices are specd accordingly, with the smallest 4.7-inch Galaxy A3 being powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon quad-core processor paired with 1.5GHz on RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. It is also powered by a smaller 2,300 mAh battery.On the other hand, the bigger 5.2-inch Galaxy A5 has the same processor as the Galaxy A7  a 1.6GHz octa-core Snapdragon SoC  with the only difference being that the 5.5-inch Galaxy A7 has 3GB of RAM over the Galaxy A5s 2GB of RAM.Performance across the board was relatively smooth, the most buttery of which is the Galaxy A7. If you place the Galaxy A3 next to either the Galaxy A5 or Galaxy A7, you will notice a slight delay when it comes to switching between multiple applications. In terms of connectivity, all 3 models support Dual-SIM andyoull be pleased to know that the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 has a dedicated microSD slot, so you can pop in two SIM cards with no compromises.For a series separated by price and tiers, buyers would be happy to know that Samsung didnt skimp on the camera optics. Well, not by much anyway. All three devices share the same 13-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo, except for the fact that the Galaxy A3s snapper is missing optical image stabilisation.Though, with a large f/1.9 aperture lens I dont foresee poor low-light performance to take too much of a hit. That said, we will have to put them through a proper camera test before passing judgement.As these are Samsung devices. it isnt surprising that they come preloaded with some extra features. While some were fairly gimmicky, there are two features that stand out. The first of which is the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7.Its supposed to be an improved version over the existing Galaxy S6 and from what we can tell, its pretty good. Nowhere near as snappy as a Huawei or Apple sensor, but its not bad.Another great feature that we were happy came over to the midrange devices was the double tap home button to quick launch the camera. It works as well as on the other flagship devices.In conclusion, these are really pretty good devices. Theyre well built and look really premium but theyre expensive. Very expensive. The Galaxy A3 is priced at RM1,299 while the Galaxy A5 is priced at RM1,599. The top of the range Galaxy A7 is going for RM1,899, which is encroaching flagship price territory. Tomake the Galaxy A series more enticing, all 3 models will come with an extra 32GB microSD card, giving them a total of 48GB of storage out of the box.If youre looking for something affordable, I cant honestly recommend any of these devices. But, they do come in pink (EVEN THE CHROME AROUND THE HOME BUTTON IS PINK), so if that tickles your fancy, then these will be the devices for you."

The report claims that Apple is in search for the holy grail of wireless charging and it might arrive as early as next year.Cutting-edge technology (as quoted from Bloomberg) would put their devices in a whole new playing field. To put it in perspective, other smartphone makers already have developed and released wireless charging mats but thats what they are  mats. You need to physically place them on these stations in order to get them juiced.Apparently they want to allow charging in mid-air (like this company hopes to) and wants to remove the physicality associated with wireless charging of today. But theyll have to deal with the charging efficiency issues that comes with charging a device further way from its charging station.The British news outlet highlights that Apple has registered numerous patents that explore the concept of true wireless charging. One of which is making an iMac a wireless charging hub with the device that needs some power needing to be within 1 meter  utilising NFC to do so.If Apple does do this, itll allow them to do away with ports altogether, making that rumour of ditching the headphone jack all the more promising. Obviously, that lighting cable has to be there but what if it didnt?Chances are Jony Ive and Co will maintain the charging port to make way for a lighting cable audio jack but with wireless charging possible, the Verge dutifully points out that youll be able to listen to music while wirelessly charging your smartphone.Bloomberg reached out to Apple reps but received no feedback.True or unlikely?

It comes preloaded on all new LG G3 devices and displays a variety of notifications and suggestions, including recommendations to stay in touch with favourite contacts.What happened was, the app failed to validate the data presented to users, making it possible for attackers to manipulate the data and lace it with a malicious code that can be executed on affected devices. According to the researchers who found out about this vulnerability, the malicious code could be triggered when events like callback reminders or birthday notifications were displayed.An estimated 10 million LG G3s were said to be affected by this vulnerability.

Rory Lee,"Windows Phone has died, heres why we think it will stay dead",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/29/windows-phone-has-died-heres-why-we-think-it-will-stay-dead/,,,2016-01-29,"A recent post by The Verge announced the death of the Windows Phone platform. What started out as a promising third player in the mobile OS game was quickly shot down.In a recent report by the IDC, it showed that in the recent quarter, about 400 million smartphones were sold and if you compare that to Microsofts earnings report, only 4.5 million of them were Lumia devices. Thats 1.1% of the market share. To contrast, Samsung moved around 85 million devices in that same quarter.Things dont get much better if you compare all time sales between Android + iOS and Windows, where Microsoft and Nokia only shipped 110 million devices total compared to the 4.5 billion Android and iOS devices sold in the same period. Thats only about 2.4% of the market share. And, if you look at this graph, things look like theyre going from bad to worse.I loved the Windows Phone. I spent two years of my life committed to my little Lumia 625. I loved the way it looks, the cool animations and most of all I loved the unified idea behind this new operating system. Despite all the qualms, despite all the bugs and despite all the problems, I convinced myself that the OS was new and it could only get better. Right?Well, I cant say that with certainty anymore.When Windows Phone first came out, many jumped for it. Extensive investment went into the platform and developing devices for it. Dell took a stab with their Venue Pro, HTC went all-in with a pretty stellar lineup of devices (some were tempting from a looks standpoint) and even manufacturers like LG and Samsung had a pretty decent lineup to offer.However, as pointed out by Vlad Savov, these investments proved fruitless. Microsoft wanted to be the leading light in their own OS  understandably  and the apparent favouritism towards Nokia (which they later acquired) was enough to piss the other manufacturers off.Have you seen the new Lumia devices? Theyre plastic slabs that are almost indistinguishable from the rest except for that Windows tramp stamp that adorns the back of the device. Gone is the inspired unibody plastic build. Missing are the funky colours that turns the phone into candy. Poof, goes that sexy subtle curve of the screen on Lumi flagships of old. Such a shame really."

Work, play, productivity, browsing and even the occasional phone call or text, can all be carried out in the palm of your hand. Its just so much more convenient that way.Add that to the fact that smartphones now come with added security and encryption services, like the fingerprint, and you have another avenue for smartphone utilisation  paying for stuff at the store.Samsung Pay is one of these wireless, moneyless, wave-to-pay services that lets you use either of the following devices:to store your credit or debit card information and let you pay with your phone at virtually anywhere you can swipe or tap your card. Support for Samsung Pay is alsoavailable on the Gear S2 smartwatch.To illustrate, heres a clever advertisement about Samsung Pay:As you can tell from the video, its fairly simple to get started on using this service. Simply swipe up on your phone to launch the app, pick the card you want to use, secure with your fingerprint and hover your device over the card reader to pay.

A mish-mash of live tiles on Windows 8 and the desktop-loving Windows 7.Samsung is no different, trying to captivate the same market that was revitalised and made mainstream through Microsofts Surface line. If you wanted something crazily thin (only 6.3mm) that can handle Windows 10, you might want to pay attention to the Galaxy TabPro S.There are many comparisons to be made to the Microsoft Surface Pro series, as the Galaxy TabPro S has (roughly) the same screen size. Utilising a 12-inch sAMOLED (2160 x 1440) display and packing a Skylake (6th-gen) Dual-core Intel Core M processor clocked at 2.2GHz.Often, these fanless Core M chipsets usually get brushed off because they rarely have the computing power that the powerhouse user needs but theyve gotten a lot better in the past few years. Accompanying that Intel SoC, are 4GB of RAM and a 128GB/256GB SSD.The tablet also supports LTE Cat 6 connectivity, WiFi 802.11 ac MIMO (as well as older bands), NFC and Bluetooth 4.1. It also betters the Surface by embracing the port of the future aka USB Type-C 3.1. However, they only plastered one USB-C port so everything from charging, data transfers and (additional) peripherals will be solely through that one port. Maybe they didnt learn from Apples Macbook that shares the solo port.Housed in a magnesium and plastic body, the 12-inch tablet only weighs 693 grams  the Surface Pro 4 weighs 786 grams. And the kicker is the detachable keyboard comes packaged with the tablet, without any extra Ringgits, making it slightly easier on your wallet.If youre one of those people who take photos using a tablet and love having conversations via video calls, youll be pleased to know that there are two cameras on board: the two front and back cameras both make use of 5-megapixel sensors.Samsung hypes the battery and charging capabilities on the Galaxy TabPro S. They claim that through fast charging technology, youll fully charge it in 150 minutes and when full, that translates to 10 hours of battery life on that 5200mAh capacity cell.The included keyboard doubles as a case but when used, youll only have two fixed angle viewing  unlike that on an adjustable hinge on the Surface Pro.As a keyboard cover, its great to find that they managed to pack 6 rows on the full-sized typing peripheral. Also, it connects to the tablet through the Pogo pin, so that takes care of pairing and charging in one go.To further your Galaxy TabPro S experience, a multi-port adapter that includes an HDMI, USB Type-A and USB Type-C; and a Bluetooth stylus pen will be sold separately.Samsungs Galaxy TabPro S runs Windows 10 Home or Pro, pricing will be announced later in the day, well keep everyone updated when we find out. Itll come in two colour options: Black and White.For a rough estimate, Germany sells it for999 (RM 4,506.30); upgrading to the Windows 10 Pro costs an additional100 (RM 451.10); while the LTE model adds another 100 (RM 451.10).Check out our hands-on and first impressions of the Galaxy TabPro S here."

Lenovo Malaysia has started selling the Moto 360 2nd gen exclusively on Lazada with a starting price of RM1,399. Powered by Android Wear, it has access to a wide variety of apps and it will work for both Android and iPhone smartphones. There are 3 options available for Malaysia. The 42mm version in Black with a matching black leather strap is priced at RM1,399 followed by a Rose Gold 42mm version that comes with Brush Leather at RM1,499. The larger 46mm version is priced at RM1,599 and it gets a silver watch case and a cognac leather strap. The Moto 360 features a durable 316L stainless steel case and the front is toughen with Gorilla Glass 3. Display wise, the 46mm unit gets a 1.56 display that does 360330, while the 42mm model gets a smaller 1.37 display that pushes 360325 resolution. Like the first moto 360, it isnt a full circular display as theres a flat-tire on the bottom of the screen. Apparently this flaw was necessary to make the bezels smaller. The Moto 360 connects via Bluetooth and Wifi and it also gets a heart rate sensor, IP67 water/dust resistance and a dedicated button on the right which mimics a crown. The price is similar to Samsungs Gear S2 smartwatch thats priced between RM1,399-RM1,599. If you prefer Android Wear, the Huawei Watch can be a better alternative with its full circular display that does a higher 400400 pixels resolution. The Huawei Watch is priced between RM1,799-RM1,999 in Malaysia. Prefer the Moto 360 2nd gen? You can head over to Lazada."

So instead of driving, you can beat the highway jams by taking a KTM train to Ipoh, and get around town using Uber. Uber highlights that since they have just started, availability may be limited at first. They added that they are working hard to get more cars on the road to minimise wait times.

Releasing the information on VentureBeat, it seems like HTC wants to make up for its lackluster devices of late and the One M10 (codename Perfume) could give it a shot.Their tip comes from someone who apparently spent time with a prototype of the device  we recommend everyone take it with of a heap of salt.Its reported that the device will be running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow under the Sense 8.0 skin that HTC has adopted. Purportedly, the screen will size in at 5.1-inches and feature a QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display. The leaker also claims that the device will carry a fingerprint scanner, in the typical home button placement as we saw in the M9+.On the inside, Qualcomms top of the line Snapdragon 820 chipset will be running the show and itll be coupled with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Information from the anonymous source states that after all the OS and bloatware youll be left with 23GB of storage but theres a microSD slot to mediate that.In terms of how it looks the leaker mentions that the design is still being drafted so there was no reason to talk about its aesthetics. Ultrapixels are going to make a comeback and were not sure how to react. The rear camera will supposedly carry a 12-UltraPixel lens and have supported laser autofocus to dial in on images quicker. The front and rear lenses will also carry OIS.And the other big disappointment is the (rumoured) drop of BoomSound speakers. Something that we really loved and still think is the best audio listening experience on any smartphone brand. Other than the two features that we didnt like, it seems like HTC could make a return to the market in a big way. But it wont come during MWC 2016 since theyve yet to make any announcements. Meaning itll likely be launched at an independent event thatll happen later.After hearing all this could you see yourself purchasing an HTC smartphone? Let us know in the comments below.[ SOURCE ]"

A new image captured shows off specifications on the last three evolutions of the Galaxy S-line  including the upcoming Galaxy S7.Though, its nothing that we didnt already know (from rumours). The slide suggests that the Galaxy S7 will front a 5.1-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display. It also states the two processor variants that has been heard many times: Qualcomms Snapdragon 820 and the home-grown Exynos 8890.Also seen on the slide are the smartphones camera credentials  the rear only which is listed as a 12-megapixel BRITECELL sensor. Theyve dropped the 16 to 12 but apparently the new sensor takes care of low-light pictures better as it is larger to absorb more light.There will also be a steady increase in RAM with the Galaxy S7 slated to get 4GB. When considering how the device itself looks, it appears to be a placeholder. So maybe this leak could have been intentional? Cause if you think about it, almost every Samsung flagship in recent times have fully leaked even before the actual launch.Sidetracking a bit, @evleaks aka Evan Blass has been busy providing more information on what the Galaxy S7 could offer. And to recap, he has mentioned that the upcoming flagship will be rated IP67 for water resistance and dust proofing, feature a microSD slot and arrive with bigger batteries. A notorious leaker with a great reputation, Blass says that the aforementioned specs are all confirmed. But well not jump the gun just yet.MWC is about to hit us really hard in the next three weeks and were gearing up for the storm.Let us know what you think of these leaks. Are they substantial?

This would enable the 3 telcos to expand their reach and to provide a better internet experience for their customers. The first agreement inked between Celcom and TM is to extend its partnership in TMs Next-Gen Backhaul service. This would help Celcom to accelerate its 4G LTE coverage by providing a robust and high bandwidth capacity to their sites through TMs fibre network. Celcom taps into TMs HSBB Network
The next agreement is to extends Celcoms access to TMs HSBB Network. This would allow Celcom to offer High-Speed Fibre Broadband services for both home and business users, similar to Maxis and P1s Fibre offering. About 3 years ago, Celcom did offer Fibre Broadband on TMs HSBB infrastructure and theres a possibility of them relaunching this soon. P1s new 4G LTE service gets a coverage boost from Celcom
As you probably know, TM will be introducing its new mobile 4G LTE service this year via P1. In order to provide a a wide nationwide coverage from the start, Celcom has been signed as P1s Domestic Roaming partner. This is similar to U Mobiles Domestic Roaming arrangements with Celcom and Maxis, to cover places where U Mobiles own 3G/4G sites are not available.So if youre out P1s LTE coverage, you can always rely on Celcoms extensive coverage in Malaysia for a seamless experience. It has been mentioned that both P1 and Celcom have been conducting user trials and network tests to ensure full readiness for its launch in the first half of 2016."

Thats all peaches and unicorn farts, but whats gonna happen to this ad?MyTeksi notseksianymore? Aw, shucks.Regardless, this rebrand does bring more features to the existing Grab app. In an attempt to unify their services into one platform, Grab is adding three new features to their service.No, not that kind of flash, get your head out of the gutter. What this Flash does is put every kind of vehicle (from a standard taxi to a GrabCar+) on the map. Simply hit it and it will call the nearest vehicle to you regardless of the type of ride  perfect for when youre in a hurry. Keep in mind that Flash is currently only available in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam whereas roll out in Malaysia is set for 30 January.This service lets you input more than one credit card, or choose to pay with cash or use someone elses verified credit card to book a ride. Once again,the multiple card function will only roll out to Malaysia in February of this year.What this does is basically keep your business rides and expenses separate from your personal ones. In-app features include the expense code, trip detail fields for tracking and expense claim purposes. Passengers can log onto the Grab Passenger Hubto download their consolidated business or personal statements for claims submissions purposes. You can also add a corporate card via the multiple credit card support and toggle between them easily.You can also add a corporate card via the multiple credit card support and toggle between them easily.Besides that, Grab is holding a Grab Freedom Day, across the capital cities of the six countries Grab operates in, where over a hundred Grabbers (including the management team) will spend a day as Grab drivers.If you happen to book a ride with a Grabber, that ride is on the house plus the value of the ride will be donated to charities across the region  Malaysias being the Mobiliti Association of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.Wanna get your hands on (ha, see what I did there) this app?Its available on Android, iOS and BlackBerry."

After just a week of releasing the OPPO F1 in Malaysia, the manufacturer has just announced plans to release a larger-screen model of the same device.Size always matters, right?The smartphone maker announced this as it was launching the little brother in Mumbai, India. With the help of Nora Danish, OPPO has been marketing the F1 as a selfie smartphone and selfies always look better on a higher resolution display. That said, the OPPO F1 Plus will come with a 5.5-inch Full HD display (1920 x 1080)  upped from the 720p screen found on the original F1.And with a bigger screen, it doesnt hurt to have more RAM so the F1 Plus adds an additional 1GB found on its sibling  making that a whopping 4GB of RAM on board. During the Mumbai announcement, they felt compelled to also let everyone know that the camera will get a more sophisticated front camera experience.Leaving us to believe that the current -inch 8-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/2.0 is going to get better. How? Well, in all honesty, weve felt for the longest time that megapixels dont make up the whole equation  so some image processing and software enhancements could possibly do more for OPPO rather than adding more pixels to the shutter.Otherwise, the smartphone will remain the same in looks and internals. That means youll still find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 chipset; 16GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD; hybrid Dual-SIM (Micro and Nano) 4G LTE slot; and its 13-megapixel ISOCELL f/2.2 with Phase Detection Autofocus and a single LED.Upping the screen and resolution, could also mean that the battery might get a bump but no mention of that was brought up during the Mumbai announcement. If they decide to stick to the 2,500 mAh battery the battery life might take a big hit if maintained.When it goes on sale, the OPPO F1 Plus will retail for Rs. 26,990 (RM 1646.56) in India. In Malaysia, the smaller OPPO F1 goes for RM 1,198 and you can pick it up from their online store.If youre interested to know more about the OPPO F1, you can check out our hands-on and first impressions here.[ SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

Now they have enhanced its offering further with its new Hero Plus thats designed to give you more data for you and your loved ones. For RM120/month, you get a total of 10GB of internet and unlimited free calls on 2 separate lines. Theres no change for the current Hero P70 postpaid plan and essentially whats new is their new Share 50 supplementary line. Each Share 50 line costs RM50/month and it lets you enjoy unlimited free calls plus additional 3GB of data. You can add up to 3x Share 50 lines under a Hero P70 postpaid account, which gives you a total of 16GB of data thats shareable across principal and supplementary lines. For a family of 4, that comes out to RM55/month per person for unlimited calls with an average of 4GB of data each. The Share 50 line is also applicable for i90 and i130 postpaid plans as well. Since the internet quota is shared, theres no wastage as all lines will utilise internet from the same pool. So if one uses less, the other line holders will get to use more.

The rest of the plan remains the same with 10 sen per SMS and 20 sen per MMS. You can also send unlimited SMS to your 3 friends that are on Digis network. On top of that, you also get to enjoy unlimited WhatsApp and WeChat connectivity. So even if have depleted your 7GB quota, you can still use them at regular speeds. To restore full speeds, you can top up additional 1GB at RM8 and it is valid for 2 days. Overall this is an interesting response from Digi and they are closing the gap with U Mobiles Hero Postpaid which offers 7GB of data and unlimited calls at RM70/month. Digi is even cheeky enough to mention Real heroes should be smart as well on the SmartPlan 75 page.

Its either both of them will live like happy neighbours or one will get kicked off the street. There no point in leaning to one side yet since we havent seen what the Surface team can do on a smartphone.In retrospect, this could just mean Microsoft wants to pre-book the domain just in case they decide to bring a Surface Phone to live. But since Windows 10 (Mobile) updates have been delayed and lackluster response to the Lumia 950 and 950 XL has bogged them down, a Surface Phone would be a really good idea  just make sure the software is ready before releasing it.

When you sit down, you whip out your phone. When the food comes, you whip it out to post a picture what youre eating on social media. When you want to avoid awkward conversations with that family member youre supposed to be close with but barely remember their name, you have to whip it out.I think you get the gist.Its a bad habit but most of us are guilty of it. Dinner time should be about the food and the people youre having it with  especially when it is a family dinner. So, IKEA decided enough was enoughand came up with an inventive solution to this particular conundrum: They created a new.table?Who wouldve thought of a smartphone-powered-steamboat-machine-table-thingamabob? I definitely didnt. It sounds fantastic. While the table was definitely interesting, whats equally interesting are the subjects responses.When they sat down, the usual routine of whipping out the smartphone begins right up until the steamboat pot is placed on the fire. One eagle-eyed observer noticed that the soup wasnt boiling and after some clarification, hit the button and raised the steamboat platform in a futuristic sci-fi manner.Obviously, everyone started freaking out at how cool that was, but when the waiter told them to take out their phones the subjects thought it was to take pictures of the contraption. When they found out they had to place their devices into the base of the machine to power the steamboat, many were hesitant but eventually gave in to their tummies demands.The result was pretty awesome. Everyone made a whole lot more eye contact and looking at each others faces rather than the Zucks Facebook. Conversation happened with their mouths as opposed to their thumbs. Smiles were exchanged without the need for round yellow emojis.It was heartwarming, to say the least. Were big fans of good tech and are always on our devices  for work and for play. But sometimes its better to just disconnect from your devices and reconnect with actual people and respond to them without needing a notification tone to prompt you.Are you guys guilty of phubbing at the dinner table?

Basically, the case allows you to record phone conversations with its internal microphone.The cover is only available for the iPhone 5 (and later) for now and allows you to record any incoming and outgoing calls made to an iPhone. Theres no app necessary; no internet and server issues; and no worries about people hacking your accounts and deleting these recordings.Of course, there are some non-ill intents for this case too. Say youd want to record the voice of a loved one for memorys sake or a long work related conference call to make sure you dont miss anything.You dont actually need to have a phone conversation to record anything so the case basically doubles as a regular voice recording device. All your recorded MP3 files are stored on the 2GB microSD that it comes with. The case also has its own battery so it wont suck up anything from your iPhone battery.Record up to eight hours of voice playback with the case and dont worry about not hearing conversations as the mic is able to pick up conversations up to 16 feet. The manufacturer claims that the 2GB card will allow at least 20 hours of conversations. If 2GBs isnt enough, the case will allow bigger capacity cards too.In a less than discreet fashion, the silicone case comes in three colours (red, black and white) and the outer plastic shell comes in six colours (red, black, blue, white, yellow and green). It is made out of plastic and silicone and has apparently gone under vigorous drop (10 feet) and pressure (220 pounds) testing without a hitch. JIC charges via micro USB.To purchase a JIC case, you can head on over to their Indiegogo site. The most affordable pledge currently goes for US$ 29 (RM 123.13) without shipping. That pledge will entitle you to a JIC case, a 2GB microSD card, rechargeable battery and USB cable.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Often having those two elements lets you bend the truth a little and sometimes youre caught saying things that dont really add up.Google is going to make your life a little harder now since they want to help people differentiate the politicians that know their facts and those who fall short. Which side are you on?Taking place in the United States during the Presidential debates, Google will be doing this by combining their efforts with Fox News Channel  not necessarily the best news outlet. This fact-checking will utilise quotes directly from candidates; real-time Google Trends data; and face questioning from well-versed YouTube figures.Pulling this off would require a whole lot of computing and itll help American voters make informed decisions on who deserves their check mark. At the same time, Google thinks that itll allow all those running for the seat in the White House to have an even playing field to share their thoughts with the masses.So for those in the States, when you search for Fox News Debate youll get the whole shebang  quotes, photos and social messages from all those running in the race. Itll be accompanied by trending results from alternative news sources as well and a fact checking system.The system will instantly pull a contradictory statement said by a candidate which in a debate can either sound very convincing or totally full of sh*t, whichever is based on facts and no flip-flopping.Were glad to hear that Google has started this in the US and hope that theyll use this again  maybe in Malaysia  when the opportunity arises.

Drones that can sail across the surface of the water like boats are also pretty cool. Just the other day we were talking about a whole bunch of really cool drones. But what we didnt include was this drone. This guy, is a helicopter, a boat, AND a submarine.While drones can let you get some sick wedding shots and awesome drag racing footage, theyre also a little creepy. People can use these little things to spy on you, streaming video directly into their creepy little devices. If you thought you could escape them like you escape bees (diving in the water, in case youve never been chased by bees before) youre sorely mistaken.This flying, swimming and diving device called the Loon Copter was developed by the Oakland Universitys Embedded Systems Research Laboratory. It uses a barrel like body, attached to an otherwise regular quadcopter, to act as a ballast tank in a submarine. Filling it with water allows it to sink beneath the surface. It fills in a unique way that rotates the quadcopter ninety degrees in the water, so that the propellers bcome like outboard motors, allowing the drone to navigate under water.It cant really navigate very deep bodies of water, but as this is nowhere near mass production, we can forsee it diving much deeper in the near future. When you want the drone to fly again, simply empty the tank and it will send the Loon Copter to the surface again.While, swimming and flying drones arent all that new, what sets this drone apart is the fact that it uses the clever ballast system. According to the projects lead scientist, the drone can sit on the surface of the water without any energy usage, as well as change and control depth with little power and no propeller use.Currently, you cant stream video from the Loon Copter to your smartphone  so you need to record it for playback later  but the creators have noted that future versions of this little guy could make use of acoustic modems or repeater buoys to allow for live streaming and control options.Created out of noble aspirations to help with search and rescue operations, this drone could also be misused  like all good things in life. The end result would come from the user, and while we think that it could be a little scary to give people this much flexibilty when it comes to filming spy footage, there is no denying the cool (and potentially useful) factor of this little device.That said, imagine how much easier filming the next Jaws movie will be with the Loon Copter. All you need to do is strap a fin to its side and queue the music. Dum dum, dum dum![SOURCE, VIA]"

Sure you might have some practical functions, but none that doesnt scream ZOMG WHAT A DWEEB.Okay, maybe Im being a little harsh here but the point is, I would never, ever, ever, use a flip cover caseunless they did this.Click to enlargeSo with a flip case for your smartphone, youre often left with a lot of space on the inside of your flip case. Space which can be used to either let your toddler/cousin/nephew/niece enthusiastically doodle on, or perhaps use it as a space for you to stick photos of your loved ones  yknow like the inside of a locker door.However, neither of those are particularly practical, nor do they help you do more with your smartphone in any way. Well, it looks like the boffins at Microsoft Research  Microsofts research division (go figure)  seem to have figured out a brilliant way to make use of that space.Enter the Microsoft Type Cover for your phone. What theyve done with the flip cover is line the inside of the case withan always-on, low-power display that can display useful information. Some examples provided by the concept includes the displaying of travel itineraries, tickets, the calendar while youre composing an email, and (my personal favourite) a fully qwerty touch keyboard. That sounds fantastic doesnt it?It is, until you realise that if this inside screen is touch sensitive and is attached to the side of your phone, how on earth are you going to type with both hands? Heres a picture to illustrate my point:So unless youre typing with your index fingers on the table, or if you tuck the case behind your device, its kind of unfeasible. Plus, if you do the latter, you might as well just use the multitasking button to switch between apps.There is promise when it comes to the full QWERTY keyboard though, but even that has its problems. Because if the phone/case does not have a kickstand itll just end up looking like this really silly case for a Samsung Galaxy S6.Either way, it looks like this is merely a concept and could do with a lot more polishing. The good news is that we might not have to wait for the rumoured Surface Phone to (hopefully) test this case out because Microsoft Research is supposedly in deep talks with the Lumia division to turnthese flip covers into real products.What do you guys think? Is one screen enough?[SOURCE, 2]"

Being one of the companys first moves into the budget-premium market, the original Galaxy A series was fairly well received and Samsung hopes to replicate that success with the 2016 versions.Much like the original Galaxy A smartphones, these 2016 models feature a premium metal body that is reminiscent of the electronics giants flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone. The glass panel on the backs of the devices definitely gives them an air of exceptional build quality.Today, they unveiled three phones  the Galaxy A7, Galaxy A5, and Galaxy A3  which are differentiated by price. As these phones are not created as equals, the more expensive Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 have a fingerprint sensor embedded bellow the home button, a big feature that is missing on the Galaxy A3. However, they do share several key features.The first, and most notable of which, is that all three devices  even the little Galaxy A3  sports a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture primary shooter plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 front-facing selfie camera. What separates them is that the Galaxy A3s primary camera unit does not have OIS while the bigger two do.All three devices also have support for dual-SIM plus an expandable microSD storage slot. Except for the Galaxy A3, the devices dont use a hybrid-SIM set up so you can use two SIM cards and a microSD card simultaneously. On the Galaxy A3 you will have to sacrifice one SIM for storage expansion.The king of the hill among the Galaxy A lineup, the Galaxy A7 sports a large 5.5-inch full HD Super AMOLED display on the front of the phone. Inside, its powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). Giving this smartphone juice is a large 3,300 mAh battery.What is basically a shrunken version of the larger Galaxy A7, the Galaxy A5 comes in at only 5.2-inches, but sports the same Super AMOLED full HD panel found on the Galaxy A7. It packsa 1.6GHz octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. For battery, the Galaxy A5 gets a respectable 2,900 mAh unit in the back.Finally, we arrive at the runt of the family, the Galaxy A3. It comes with a small 4.7-inch HD Super AMOLED display and a quad-core 1.5GHz processor on the inside. Helping you with running apps is 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Since its the smallest device here, Samsung have fitted it with a small 2.300 mAh battery to keep things going.It is worth noting that none of these devices will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Instead, they will default to the older Android 5.1 Lollipop, though we do expect them to receive the Marshmallow update sometime in the future.If you want to get your hands on these three devices, the Galaxy A7 will go for RM1,899 while the Galaxy A5 retails for RM1,599 and the Galaxy A3 will set you back RM1,299 including GST. All of these devices can be purchased at the official Samsung retailers from 28 January onwards.All purchases will be bundled with a 32GB microSD card free of charge. The devices will come in four colours  Black, Gold, White and Pink Gold. From today until 31 January 2016, there will be a roadshow at Sunway Pyramids Blue Concourse for the general public to experience the features that the Galaxy A Series 2016 has to offer.

This isnt just all talk as one of the three smartphones that they outed comes with some glowing credentials  literally.So first, lets formally introduce the brand first. Wiko Mobile is a Marseille (France) based smartphone maker that does most of their manufacturing out of China  as does everyone  but what makes them different is that there are reports that Shenzhen-based Tinno Mobile Technology has a (big) stake in Wiko.Perception is key and since theyre selling in Europe, showing face has been working well. Most recently, the company claims to be Frances second largest smartphone seller; up one spot from 2013 when they had an 18% French market share.But with appearances, accompanying specs have to be reasonable too. Make no mistake, these smartphones dont carry amazing flagship specs but they do have a few tricks up their sleeves.Highway PureSwarovskiThe first model is the most beautiful out of the bunch. As expected, you can find 16 Swarovski Zirconia stones on the device, making its volume rockers and power button extra shiny and textured. Screen-wise theres a 4.8-inch HD (1280 x 720) AMOLED display while its processor is a Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor clocked to 1.2GHz. As well as 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 64GB through microSD.Its camera sensors boast an 8-megapixel rear lens and 5-megapixel front lens. Out of the box, it runs Android Lollipop 5.0.2Android 4.4.4 KitKat which were hopeful will run Lollipop in the near future. Its battery is rated at 2000 mAh.Wikos single-nano SIM Highway Pure is claimed to be the slimmest 4G smartphone as it measures just 5.1mm thick and weighs just 98 grams; were not sure what the Vivo X5 Max (4.75mm thin) and OPPO R5 (4.85mm thin) have to say about that.FeverNext we have their glowing number that goes simply as Fever. This device comes with a larger 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The screen tapers off at the edges thanks to the 2.5D glass and the sides are made with a metal frame. Fever has an Octa-core MediaTek MT6753 processor at its heart and features 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. If you want to up the storage, theres a microSD slot handy that can handle up to 64GBs of additional memory.Its rear camera specs are a little better with a 13-megapixel shooter at the helm while the front gets the same 5-megapixel sensor with selfie flash. As talked about earlier, when in dimly lit situations this smartphone will glow thanks to its phosphorescent lines making it easy to locate in the dark and really cool too.The battery that powers this dual-SIM 4G LTE smartphone is a 2900 mAh capacity lithium cell and it runs Android Lollipop 5.0.2 out of the box.Lenny 2The smallest and most affordable of the bunch is the LENNY2 and for the price of RM299, the specs easy out seat any feature phone. Itll arrive with a 5-inch FWVGA (854 x 480) screen and a Quad-core MediaTek 6580 processor clocked to 1.3GHz.Together with the screen and chipset specifications, itll be coupled with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of expandable internal storage with a microSD slot (up to 64GB).In terms of the camera sensors, youll find a 5-megapixel rear shutter with a 2-megapixel sensor up front. Surprisingly, given the price point, the device will be Dual-SIM (non-4G LTE) compatible and run 5.1 Android Lollipop.Wikos Fever goes for RM799 while the Highway Pure will cost you a little more at RM999. All three devices will arrive with a free screen protector and back casing."

Yes? Then have you ever been too lazy to get into your car and drive all the way to a shop to grab a bite to eat not knowing if the food will even be good thus making the trip not worthwhile?Well, now you might not have to pull your hair out over it because popular food review app Zomato is teaming up with Uber to help bring you to good food. At least, we hope its good food.If you havent already heard about Zomato, its an app that helps you discover new food by providing information such as restaurant reviews and ratings as well as create your own network of foodies for trusted recommendations.How this works is: You launch the app and sign in to your account. Then you can scroll through a timeline-esque UI of food reviews and ratings based on your current location. Then, you can hit on whichever restaurant tickles your fancy to find out more information about the establishment. While previously it only gives you directions to the restaurant, now it will give you the option to Ride there with Uber.Why is this better than just launching the Uber app and inputting the destination? Well, because it happens with a single touch. Hitting the option would bring up apickup time plus the estimated price range for the trip  just as you would find on the regular Uber app  without needing to launch a new app. Saves some time I guess?This feature has been available to Zomato users in 30+ cities across 13 countries, namely India, Australia, Canada, The UK, South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, The Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Turkey, UAE and the United States.Unfortunately, asof right now, we are still unable to get the option here in Selangor. Curious, we contacted Zomato and they told us that the function would roll out in stages. So far only users in Kuala Lumpur can access this function, with Selangors availability on the way soon.While I think this is pretty neat, Ive actually never tried it before. So do let us know, if youre a Zomato user, what you think about this little feature. If you arent a Zomato user, would you be interested in trying this out?The Zomato app is available on Android, iOS and Windows."

Nothing was really based on hard research at that time. Now a Reddit user going by the name pbrandes_eth has drawn up a scientific approach to see how the Facebook app kills your device. And the evidence says pretty much the same thing.Many have called it a hogger of resources when installed, bugs out and sometimes just fails to work. Facebook hasnt even changed the looks of the app since material design is all the rage now  with Marshmallow in play.Monitoring how detrimental the Facebook app is on an LG G4, the Reddit user used DiscoMarks benchmark and ran 13 test  with and without Facebook  to see the differences in performance. After the tests, he found that there was a 15% performance difference. Thats hard facts, no placebo nonsense.Its pretty obvious that adding/removing any app on your device is going to affect the performance of the CPU but the fact is, why is an app that is only 39MB in size, accounting for such a big gap in performance? We can only think of the bloated coding that was mentioned by a Facebook engineer in the past.A realisation hit me that our reliance on Facebook goes much deeper than just social interactions. Cause if it wasnt for Zuckerberg, there would be many happy memories forgotten. Posing me to think that if we have to rely on it, at least, be smart of how to make it more efficient  or, at least, make our own experience with the social media platform better.Well, now you have it, dont want your smartphone to be handicapped further than it usually is, uninstall the Facebook app and use it on your browser instead.Want to try out this experiment yourself?

Rory Lee,honor 5X hands-on and first impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/26/honor-5x-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"Honor 5X,honor 5X first impressions,honor 5X hands on,honor 5X launch,honor 5X launch Malaysia,Honor Malaysia,Huawei Malaysia","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-26,"Many have been waiting for the arrival of the honor 5X on local shores, and it isnt particularly hard to see why. A metal build, a nice full HD display and a snappy fingerprint sensor are hard to come by at this end of the market. While honor have not announced when the device will go on sale or how much it would cost, we got to take a quick look at this all-metal midrange device.A premium metal construction is almost a necessity these days. While we dont think that a metal body is all that, smartphone manufacturers and people who want to show off certainly do. Has honor delivered with the 5X?Well, I can tell you that it definitely feels better than the more expensive honor 7. The front of the device is nothing to shout about, but when you move to the sides of the device, you can see where all of honors effort went. They talked endlessly about the sandblasting they had to do to keep the device feeling smooth in the hand and they did accomplish that to a certain extent.The sides are nicely chamfered (ala-Nexus 6P) to help with grip and very smooth to the touch. They decided to go with a brushed metal look for the back plate but the moment your fingers touch it, the panel feels in no way shape or form brushed. It was smooth as a babys bottom  which may appeal to some, but I like a little grain and roughness.There are other niggles that come from the buttons. While they had nice tactile feedback which felt really premium, the power button shifts around a little too much and if you apply pressure to the center of the volume rockers you will be greeted with an incredibly unpleasant flex.Since this isnt really a high-end device, you cant really expect much when it comes to performance. It sports a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. With proper optimisation, those specs would do fine for light to medium tasks, but from our brief hands-on it doesnt seem to be the case.Switching between applications was slow and sluggish. Exiting the camera app was the most painful thing to watch as the frames stuttered and choked. It was a disaster. That said, this can probably be fixed with a quick update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow.The honor 5X comes with a decent 13-megapixel f/2.0 main camera with a dual-LED flash mounted on the rear, right above the fingerprint scanner. Its a pretty decent snapper with a host of features as is the hallmark of EMUIs camera app. Stuff like beautification, HDR, panorama are all bundled into it. Shots from that sensor are decent with reasonable amounts of colouraccuracy and detail. The front 5MP f/2.4 selfie cam also takes reasonably good pictures, though we would have liked if it was a little wider for those crucial wefies.Its Huawei-made fingerprint scanner is as fantastic as ever. I loved the accuracy and speed though I would have appreciated a little haptic feedback when it successfully reads your finger but thats me nitpicking. The honor 5Xs sensor only needs 6 taps to register your fingerprint yet it has an amazing level of accuracy.As is a common theme in Huawei made devices, the fingerprint scanner at the back is more than simply a fingerprint scanner. You can swipe down on it to pull down your notifications, as well as hold it to exit your application and return to the home screen. It also allows you to take photos by tapping it though we found that quite pointless and horribly unergonomic.It also has a curious function that lets the fingerprint scanner act as a back button allowing you to tap it once to go back to your previous task. So what if Ive enabled the camera single tap to take a photo? Design oversight? It also lacks the swipe left and swipe right to scroll through pictures or text.All in all, its a pretty decent budget premium device with an okay camera and decent specs. All it needs is some proper optimisation (please patch ASAP) and a little skill when taking photographs.

Word had it that Microsoft was sending out invites to selected people to try out their new Word Flow keyboard for iOS, targeting users of the iPhone 5S or higher.Well, sources familiar with Microsofts plans have revealed to the Verge that the new Word Flow keyboard will feature a unique one-handed typing experience that will surely appeal to fans of both iOS and Word Flow.While most keyboards, the Windows Phone version of Word Flow included, have support for one-handed typing  mighty useful on the phablets of today. But, while other one-handed typing modes resemble squashed keyboards, this one fans out.Yup, it can beanchored either on the right or the left side of the device, but then it fans out in a quarter-circle shape which is supposed to make it easier for users to swipe/type one-handed with their thumb. That makes sense if you pick up your phone and try to type on it with one hand. Reaching the Q button was always a stretch, but now it seems a lot more plausible.Other than the one-handed mode, everything else seems to be every similar to the Windows Phone version. You have access to word suggestions, emoji and swipe letters.Weredefinitely interested in trying this out. It seems the trend of Microsoft making better apps for other people is continuing with their record-breaking keyboard.

The compact package will also apparently arrive with a 16 GB entry-level internal storage, moving up all the way to 64 GB.Making smaller phones could allow Apple to re-enter the smaller device market that has people with smaller hands fumbling and tumbling their larger devices in recent times. And it fuels Microsofts keyboard beta-testing for iOS that allows easier one-handed texting.We just hope that making it smaller might allow Cupertino to slash prices if they want to be seen as a competitor in the more affordable market. Countries in Asia could benefit the most, together with some European states also having the majority of their citizens opting for more affordable devices.Prices of iPhones have skyrocketed through the roof in the past few generations with increments getting out of hand. Could selling a smaller iPhone allow them to price it closer to the other top end devices and earn them an even larger market share?

Our own device (also from the US) has for the past week and, for the longest time, nobody claimed responsibility or could even identify what was wrong with the device.Well, thanks to our knights in shining armour over at Android Authority and Techradar, we now have an answer.After picking up the story about the bootloop issues from LG G4 users, Android Authority gathered what they knew and confronted LG about it. Thankfully, instead of denying any problems the electronics giant admitted that there was a problem with the smartphones hardware and said that they would repair the affected devices, though it is unclear if your device needs to still be under warranty for it to be eligible.The problem puts the phone in a boot-up loop where it tries to reset, fails and tries again and again which then proceeds to brick the phone. We thought it was a problem with our devices battery, but now according to LG, it is resulting from loose contact between components.Currently, it is unclear if this problem affects all LG G4s or if it is just limited to those units in the US. However, according to Android Authority, the bootloop issue persists and affects all regional and carrier models of the device. LG advises its customers who have bought their devices via a carrier and are experiencing such issues to contact their nearest LG Service Center for repair under full warranty.On the other hand, customers who have purchased their G4 smartphones from non-carrier retailers should contact an LG Service Center with the understanding that warranty conditions will differ.We dont know if this problem affects local Malaysian units, so if you are using a local LG G4, do let us know if youre experiencing such problems.

Many havepointed towards the success of the V10 when launched in certain markets.The tech multinational foresees that competition in the smartphone segment is going to be real stiff. They anticipate that pricing and is going to be a key factor in this space. The same can be said for the cost of premium materials and better processors slowly dipping. Touching on the topic of newer OEMs gaining traction by packing all they can in their devices, LG is probably realising that Huawei and Xiaomi are a big threat. Now at least, theyre recognising that publically and have assured that their lower to mid-range devices will get some new additions as well.Its clear that the one of those flagships will be released during MWC 2016, with a February 21st announcement date already written in the books. Theyve been many rumours with some going as far as suggesting a modular battery slot.Well, whatever the case, come February LG will be in a stare down with Samsung to see which flagship gets more attention.

To me, its a hotly debated issue that stems from the history of intelligence agencies spying on their nations citizens. In most cases, its to protect a countrys interest and to ensure the safety of their people.Uber has decided to go big brother and began monitoring how drivers are driving since late last year. The Verge points out that this isnt their first rodeo as theyve tracked drivers in China during the unruly protests that were happening in Eastern China.Now its taken that isolated situation a step further in a bid to safeguard passenger safety by using gyrometers, GPS signals and accelerometers in drivers smartphones. CSO (Chief Security Officer) of Uber, Joe Sullivan says that theyre doing this because If a rider complains that a driver accelerated too fast and braked too hard, we can review that trip using data.The ride-sharing platform will utilise gyrometer data to see if those behind the wheel are moving their smartphones too much while driving. That means more time looking fumbling with their devices and less time looking at the road. Speeding will be monitored too, by using technology to take note of the average time between two points and calculating if the drivers being too friendly with that accelerator  so to speak.Digging up some extra info on the subject, the Guardian has narrowed down where this monitoring is taking place  Houston, Texas. Its no question that these experiments will only help Uber maintain rider satisfaction and safety above all else but also will help provide proof to any bad ratings; justifying why a one-star rating was given  if it was because of reckless driving. Providing a case for both the driver and rider in the scenario of an accusation.Were sure that Uber partners/drivers wont be happy having someone watching their every turn (figuratively) and as a class-action lawsuit has been filed in the Bay Area demanding for equal rights  drivers might not have to put up with this for long.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

At first, it was TM with their UniFi + iflixplan, then now it seems that its Digis turn. The telco is offering a 12-month iflix subscription (worth RM96) to its subscribers for free.Unfortunately, this deal isnt for every Digi subscriber as it is only applicable for those under the Digi SmartPlan 65 banner or higher. If you arent one now though, from today onwards you can sign up or upgrade to the SmartPlan 65 (or any higher plan) and get this very offer as well.But theres more. This deal is supposedly limited and it will operate on a first come first served basis which means that if you want to take advantage of this free year of iflix, it would probably be wise to act soon. That said, Digi never specified a specific limit to this offer  no dates, no number of customers, nothing. Could this be a marketing strategy to generate hype?Well, if it is, this wouldnt be the first time Malaysians have been lured in by the word free and limited. Lets just say we like free things.In any case, much like the TM deal, this one requires no login because Digi has back-end integration with iflix allowing the streaming service to automatically detect if youre on a Digi line and grant you unrestricted access to their library. All you need to do is download the app (via a Digi network) on either iOS or Android, and launch it. iflix will take care of the rest. Plus you get 1GB of extra quota (until March 2016) to watchiflix content.If youre not interested in upgrading to a Digi SmartPlan 65 or higher, you can still opt to retain the 60-days free subscription with iflix that is the result of the first collaboration between the telco and the streaming service. For those who are curious, Digis SmartPlan 65 offers two variants  one that has unlimited calls to all networks plus 3GB of data, versus one that has 5GB of data and only 200mins of free calls.

Do you make use of public transport or rely on your own car?

Hell be commuting from his home in BukitPuchong, while Ill be getting around from mine, in Bukit Damansara. The difference in location will be the main variable here  suburbs vs city. On top of that, well also look at how reliable, convenient and comfortable Uber is opposed to driving.Were looking at a big difference in travel time(s) for both of us. He takes anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to get to work. As for me, Ill take about 15 minutes to 30 minutes. In terms of fuel, he forks out roughly RM65 weekly and RM20 on tolls.

To get one officially would probably take months but a couple of grey importers in Malaysia have started to selling the metal unibody smartphone. Like most imported handsets, the first wave of Redmi 3 stocks wont be too friendly on your wallet.Retailers Satu Gadget and DirectD have started selling the Redmi 3 at RM688 and RM699 respectively, which is pretty steep compared to its original asking price in China that goes for 699 CNY (RM452 with current exchange rate). In fact, you can get the bigger and better Redmi Note 3 from as low as RM699 for the low spec 2GB RAM + 16GB storage model. That gets a faster Helio X10 processor, full HD 5.5 display and it even comes with a fingerprint scanner at the rear. The only feature disadvantage of the Redmi Note 3 is the lack of a microSD expansion slot.To refresh your memory on the smaller Redmi 3, the budget unibody metal device gets a 5 720p display and it runs on an Octa-Core Snapdragon 616 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. You can add a microSD card up to 128GB on its hybrid Dual-SIM slot and powering the device is a huge 4,100mAh battery that supports 5V/2A fast charging. In terms of imaging, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 rear camera and a front-facing 5MP f/2.2 unit for your selfie needs.If Xiaomi sells this officially in our market, we reckon that it should go below RM600.

Some said there could be as many as four models launched at the same timewhile others dismissed that right out of the bat. There was never any official confirmation beyond anentry in the Indonesian certification agency (which has been removed) and an exclusive by SamMobile.Now, though, thanks to Indian import-export tracker Zauba, we at least have confirmation of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edges screen sizes.
Click to enlargeBased on this listing, the two devices bearing the model number SM-G930R4 and SM-G935R4  which is the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge respectively  have been listed to pack a 5.1-inch screen for the S7 and a 5.5-inch screen for the S7 edge. This reflects the earlier specifications outed by popular benchmark AnTuTu. Plus, since only two models have been imported, it is becoming less and less likely that Samsung will launch four devices at the same time. Then again, smartphone manufacturers have done crazier things. Though, it is worth noting that only two of each device have been imported, probably because theyre tester units (as can be seen in the description FOR TESTNG).Based on most leaks, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge should come with a Quad HD display packing either an Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 processor (likely depending on region) plus 4GB of RAM and either 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of expandable internal storage. Yes, there will be a microSD card slot. The camera will probably be a 12-megapixel BRITECELL rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing selfie cam. These devices should also have support for Cat.12/13 LTE connectivity and a USB Type-C port. They should also come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.If youd like to catch up on what we know about the new Galaxy S lineup, you can find more info here and here. We will definitely know more once Samsungs Unpacked event in Barcelona which will take place in February. Until then, thesespecifications could change  though we think unlikely because they match up with our earlier report on the Indonesian certification agency  so dont follow them blindly.[SOURCE]"

As something for you to browse the wealth of Kickstarters library, this application is pretty decent then.However, if youre a project creator, your hands are tied. You would have to resort to the browser version because the application will not allow you to manage your projects with it. It seems a little silly that such a feature was left out front the start and would only be coming in the future, but I guess if you consider the number of backers versus the number of creators, that percentage is pretty lopsided.Kickstarter could instead just make another app specially for creators  like what Facebook does with its Pages Manager app  though that seems unlikely especially if youre looking at the iOS app. If youre a big Kickstarter user, definitely try the app out (you can download it here) and definitely let us know what you think about it versus the browser version or even the iOS version.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Selfies are taken care of by the front-facing 5MP f/2.4 snapper. The 5X also sports a large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0, plus a dedicated dual-SIM tray  so none of that hybrid-SIM nonsense. The device will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with the EMUI 3.1 skin on top.As you can tell by the name, the honor 7 Enhanced is slightly improved version of the old (but gold) honor 7. It still packs the same 2.2GHz octa-core Kirin 935 processor paired with 3GB of RAM thrumming under a 5.2-inch full-HD display. It also brings over the honor 7s 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash plus an 8MP front-facing camera with its own LED flash.What has changed then? It has more storage  double in fact at 32GB from the old 16GB found on the original honor 7. While it may seem like a simple change it is a significant one as one of the biggest qualms users had of this otherwise excellent device was the fact that it had a measly 16GB of onboard storage, which as we all know is not going to be enough especially with that 20MP snapper.This is also the first non-Nexus device to come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box that has been launched in Malaysia.If you want to get your hands on either of these devices, you can register your interest on Vmall.my from 26 January onwards. There is currently no information on the price of these devices, but we believe that the 5X should come in below RM1,000."
Alexander Wong,Malaysias Fastest Mobile Network now gives you more throttled internet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/22/u-mobile-free-3gb-power-prepaid/,"Free Basic Internet,Free data,Free High Speed Internet,Internet,mobile internet,Power Prepaid,prepaid,U Mobile,U Mobile free 3GB Prepaid,U Mobile Prepaid","Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-01-22,"U Mobile has just refreshed its Power Prepaid, giving you even more free internet each month. When it was first introduced, it offered the most free high-speed internet at 1GB as long as you top up a minimum of RM10 each month. With the growing demand for internet on the go, Power Prepaid now comes with a whopping 3GB of Free Data. You should be impressed by now but wait until you see the full picture.While it looks like youre getting a whopping 3GB with full speed internet on the surface, the reality is that nothing has changed. As a mobile internet user, youll depend mostly on high-speed internet which in this case, remains at 1GB for free. The remaining 2GB extra is for Basic Internet, which is throttled internet at 64kbps. Previously, when you used up your free 1GB of data, you have a choice to top up more with its UMI plans  or continue using with slower 64kbps speeds at no extra charges. U Mobile didnt specify a limit for its throttled usage back then and now they have officially put a cap at 2GB. Assuming there was never a limit in the first place, this could be even seen as a downgrade. Considering other telcos are offering 500MB of Basic Internet, U Mobile thought this would be a good idea to boast 4x more throttled internet than the rest. Upon hitting your basic internet limit, you will still lose connectivity until your next top up. The rest of the Power Prepaid deal remains unchanged. The starter pack costs RM8.50 with RM5 credit preloaded and it comes with 10 days validity with 200MB of high-speed internet. The call rates are among the lowest at 5 sen/30 sec (10sen/minute), while SMS is charged at 8 sen each to all networks. As the fastest Mobile Network in Malaysia, we genuinely expected better from U Mobile. 2GB of dial-up connectivity is nothing to be proud of.

The long-awaited Mi 5 was said to be launched after Chinese New Year and now they have locked a date for its official announcement in Beijing. According to its official post on Weibo, the Mi 5 will be launched on 24th February at 2:00PM. For the die hard Mi Fans in China, Xiaomi will be opening ticket sales beginning this Friday, 29th January from the Mi Store app. In terms of models, we could be seeing up to 4 different variants of the Mi 5. The base model could start from 2,199CNY (about RM1,435) and it goes all the way up to 3,099 (about RM2,022). As speculated earlier, Xiaomi will be playing around with 2 different back materials for the Mi 5. It is also expected to run on the latest Snapdragon 820 precessor and it will get a fingerprint scanner as well. The purported Mi 5 variants are as follows:It is also worth pointing out that Xiaomis launch is happening while MWC 2016 is taking place at Barcelona. With Xiaomi missing its sales target for 2015, we expect the Chinese brand to expand to more markets with more competitive devices for 2016. While we didnt really get the Mi 4 due to 4G support limitation, hopefully, the new one would be a compelling flagship for 2016.UPDATE: Hugo Barra has tweeted that the Mi 5 will be previewed at MWC 2016. This is Xiaomis first showing at the annual international mobile event.[ SOURCE 2 3 VIA ]"
Rory Lee,OPPO F1 hands-on and first impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/oppo-f1-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"Oppo,OPPO F1,OPPO F1 first impressions,OPPO F1 Hands on,OPPO F1 Hands on Malaysia,OPPO F1 launch,OPPO F1 Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-01-21,"OPPO plans to take over the midrange smartphone market one selfie at a time with their latest smartphone the F1. OPPO are so committed to the selfie abilities of this smartphone that theyve even hired Selfie Ambassador Nora Danish to demonstrate just how powerful this device is at taking selfies.
Lets start with the build. If youve been following our coverage of the OPPO F1, Im sure you would have noticed how similar this device is with the OPPO R7 series. It so happened we had an OPPO R7s on hand so we placed the two devices side by side. Quickly, which device is which?Honestly, besides the size and the back firing speaker grille, these two devices are almost exactly the same from the back. The camera module, the flash, the two toned rear panels (because of the different materials), the feel and the rounded edges were all exactly the same. It was unreal.Since it was exactly the same, it also had the same feel in the hand as the R7s  albeit the smaller footprint  so that part didnt feel so good. Then again, for a midrange device, you cant really complain. Around the front, thats a different story.The front bears enough differences to identify which is which. Opting for capacitive buttons instead of the on-screen ones on the R7s, the F1 lets you use its display to its maximum potential. Not that it had a very impressive display, but well get into that later. What I did like was the rounded front edges.With the 2.5D glass set to curve slightly more and slightly later, the glass and the metal blended seamlessly into each other giving the device a nice rounded edge. It was almost iPhone 6s Plus like, so props to OPPO for acheiving the something like that on a midrange device.Beyond that, the device felt generally nice in the hand  though I would have liked it a little more if it had a slight curve, but thats up to the individual.The OPPO F1 is powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. At the front, the device sports a 5-inch HD (1280720 pixels) IPS panel which isnt all that impressive. The device comes running Android 5.1 Lollipop with OPPOs ColorOS 2.1 running on top. The device draws juice from a 2,500 mAh battery and also has support for dual-SIM (Micro+Nano) although since its a hybrid set up you will have to sacrifice a microSD slot for the second SIM.Performance was pretty decent. It didnt lag when switching between applications (though there werent many applications pre-installed to begin with) and it handled what little multitasking I threw at it. Im not particularly a fan of the ColorOS Android skin, but some of you may like it so thats ultimately down to personal preference. The display was okay-ish and you probably wouldnt notice the 720p-ness unless youre coming from a higher screen resolution.Now we get to the part everyone has been waiting for  the camera. It packs a 13-megapixel ISOCELL rear shooter with Phase Detection AF and a large f/2.2 aperture that was pretty good in the venues sketchy lighting. It took decent shots, but since we could only view it on a 720p screen, we wont make any claims just yet. What everyones curious about is the 8MP front-facing snapper.When you think of a selfie phone, youd think of something like the ASUS ZenFone Selfie which sports a massive 13MP front facing selfie shooter with autofocus and dual LED flash for RM1,049. Next to those beastly specs, the OPPO F1 that costs RM1,198 simply pales in comparison. It doesnt even have a front facing flash  instead it relies on a screen flash, which basically turns your screen white and bright, to illuminate dark subjects. Probably best used in dark conditions, the screen flash did absolutely nothing in the launch venues dodgy lighting, but again we will have to fully test this out before we make any judgements.When you think about this phone, you cant go at it purely from a specs perspective. If you were to do that, perhaps the ZenFone Selfie is the better device with its 5.5 full HD display, but look at it. Its chunky, its fat and it is very plasticky. The OPPO F1 on the other hand, is a slim thing with a great build and a premium feel. Its rounded metal rails and smooth metallic back are awesome to run your hand across. Its the phone for the fashionista, for someone who cares more about style and looks than pure hardware specs. Let me put it this way, could you see Nora Danish using a ZenFone Selfie?Exactly."
Cheryl Bates,Acer Predator 8 Review: Made for fun,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/26/acer-predator-8-review-malaysia/,,,2016-01-26,"One of the first of its kind, the Acer Predator 8 is essentially the one of the world firsts in terms of tablets built for gaming.Sporting a unique shape, build and gaming-centric capabilities, we take a look at Acers gaming tablet.Design and buildAs far as the design and build go, the Predator 8 isnt your bog standard tablet. Coming in at about 8 inches in size, the tablet has a rather unique shape; with four front-facing speakers (called the Predator Quadio) with one situated at each corner of the tablet.The tablet is surprisingly light considering how chunky it looks and how solid it feels; weighing in at a paltry 350g with the battery in.The sides are also shaped in a way that you have adecent place togrip without your hands getting in the way of said speakers if you want to play games in landscape mode. One minor gripe is the placement of its microUSB port at the top of the device asthe charging cable will get in the way if you are playing games while charging.The rear of the device is home toa brushed metal plate with the Predator logo on it and is the only bit of the tablet that is made of solid metal. The rest of the Predator 8 is made of a combination of plastic and rubber that only simulates that metal finish but still looks good regardless. Due to its unique shape you probably wont find many 3rd party cases for it, unfortunately, but a few do exist.Also, we feel we need to mention that this is the first (compact) gaming tablet that has a form of haptic feedback called the Predator TacSense. There are two haptic motors, with one placed on each side. So depending on the games you are playing it might vibrate to your actions, even the startup screen has the tablet buzzing to the logo. We do notice that the tactilefeedback doesnt apply to all games, though, only those which have been tweaked to have the feature in the first place."

The brilliant work of author/comic-writer/kid-trapped-in-an-adults-body Matthew Inman has been passed around the Internet more often than a keg at a frat house party, and for good reason. His comics are brilliant. He takes daily life situations, adds some magic, some ridiculousness, a bear-o-dactyl and boom, youll be on the floor clutching your sides laughing your head off, or trying not to puke from the graphic images. Either way, its a lot of fun.While most of his work was designed to have people cackling like witches on a broomstick, he does have some pretty hard hitting and emotional ones as well. One of his newer works about Gene Roddenberry, for example, was as motivational as it was bulu-roma inducing.Not too long ago, The Oatmeal collaborated with Elan Lee and Shane Small to launch a Kickstarter campaign for their own imaginative card game: Exploding Kittens. It became one of the most funded projects on Kickstarter and quickly won the hearts of many but it suffered from the limitation of being a physical card game. Now, welltheres an app for that.Exploding Kittens is a simple and straightforward game to be played with friends. The objective is simple  dont explode. Each player starts with four cards and a defuse card with a universal draw deck in the middle. Players then take turns to play an action card followed by drawing another card from the deck in the centre. If a player draws a card with an exploding kitten, they will have to defuse the card or get blown up and ejected from the game. It continues until only one player is left.The app version of the game promises to be exactly the same. That means you get to have all the brilliant drawings of The Oatmeal, plus the simple and addictive mechanics of the game. Whats more, the app version will obviously have more attractive graphics for your actions, like this cat paw stealing your cards:If youd like to download this app you can find it at the Apple App Store. If youd like to know more about this game+app, you can head on over to their websiteor watch the following gameplay videos to get a feel of how the game would flow.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Since Malaysia is a key market, we anticipated a local launch would follow soon after and sure enough, OPPO have brought this mid-range device to our shores.Despite the name, the F1 has nothing to do with the popular motorsport Formula 1. It does, however, look like the splitting image of the smartphones from OPPOs R7 line, from white front panel right down to the square rear-mounted camera module and flash. The resemblance is uncanny.The device has a relatively small 5 720p HD display (1280720 pixels) with a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor on the inside paired with 3GB of RAM for a pretty decent spec list. Internal storage is a tiny 16GB but thats expandable via microSD for up to 128GB of extra storage. This smartphone also has support for dual-SIM (one Micro and one Nano) but since its a hybrid SIM set up, you will have to sacrifice one slot if you want to use a microSD card.This smartphone promises a premium photography experience at a reasonable price, so it gets a 13MP ISOCELL f/2.2 aperture rear-facing camera with Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) and a single LED flash. On the front, it packs an 8-megapixel f/2.0 snapper with a 1/4-inch sensor and built-in beautification features.Powering the device will be a modest 2,500 mAh battery which is a touch more than the OPPO R7 Lite and R7 models. It will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop with ColorOS 2.1 running on top.With those specs, this places the OPPO F1 right in the Xiaomi Redmi 3s crosshairs. The F1 should have the edge in terms of performance though as it has 3GB of RAM versus the Redmi 3s 2GB, but that extra performance does come with a higher price tag. The only question is how much lower will the Redmi 3 retail at?The OPPO F1 officially goes on sale online tomorrow, 22 January 2016, at midnight on the OPPOStorefor RM1,198.

After releasing five different versions in Malaysia and spinning-off too many devices under the ZenFone name to count. Their flagship smartphone has been on the market for a year already and these benchmarks imply that were going to see a new generation of ZenFones pretty soon.Labelled ASUS Z010DD and Z012D, it seems like two versions with different specs went through GFXBench recently. Surprisingly, both seem to be carrying Qualcomm chipsets  indicating that the manufacturer may ditch Intel SoCs that they have dearly utilised in the past.In the past, ASUS used the model numbers Z008 and Z00AD on their ZenFone 2s and the current numbers shown arent that far off to assume they represent their upcoming smartphones.Out of the two model numbers, the one that appears to have better specs is the Z012D. The device in question is listed with a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display and a Hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor (clocked to 1.7GHz). Based on the benchmark, itll have Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.For the lower-spec Z010DD, it also runs Android Marshmallow but only has an HD (1280 x 720) screen that oddly is bigger at 5.9-inches. Itll run an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset clocked at 1.5GHz mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.Surprisingly, the listing for Z010DD has camera-specifications. There will be a 12-megapixel shooter on the rear and a 5-megapixel sensor on the front.ASUS is likely to pursue more Qualcomm chipsets due to their battery-life woes. This switch might help and users should welcome this news with open arms.We wont know for sure where these two devices will sit in ASUS lineup and theres a possibility that both of these are the lower end models not a part of the ZenFone 3 series. Only one thing will be for sure, theyll release a dozen phones with the same name.[ SOURCE, 2,VIA ]"

Supposedly, making a hybrid device thatll rival the Microsofts Surface and other PC-makers 2-in-1s.PCs are making a comeback, no not those big towers but ultrabooks and convertibles. But what hopes does Huawei have on entering the market that has been established for so long? And what operating system will they settle for?Earlier rumours detailed that it might be a dual-boot system thatll have both Windows and Android but no one has offered anything like that out of the box. Were not entirely convinced that will happen but its plausible that itll be offered in two OS options like how Xiaomi has just done with the Mi Pad 2.Entering a new market is an ambitious decision and the branching out from networking and telecommunications devices, something that Xiaomi did really early on. Theyve made air purifiers, TVs, routers, and etc. Huawei focuses on the telco side of things, providing network solutions and the works. Of course, to most of the world theyre known for the smartphones they put out but in those markets mentioned earlier, theyre really big too.Were going to see more Mate(s) than we have ever before. If this trademark is anything to go by and April will be the month to watch out for when Huaweis factories will apparently start churning out these computers.The market is already so saturated and unless Huawei makes something that changes it all, they might fail in getting the attention of customers whod rather trust established brands. Not all times have trademarked terms came to something so it could just mean Huawei is setting aside a just-in-case if they were to release a laptop of some sort.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

Now a video has surfaced, claiming to be the First real 4-inch iPhone 2016 video leak, the short 40-second clip  if true  does give at least some information on Apples purported next product.Yeah, it looks exactly like an iPhone 6/6s. In fact, it looks so much like an iPhone 6/6s that many are calling this video a fake and that the reason it looks small-ish is because the guy manning the camera has large hands. Honestly, it does look kind of sketchy and as 9to5Mac pointed out, the speaker grille ratios were pretty similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone so that does add some credence to the big-hands justification.It is said that MIC Gadget has a reasonable history in obtaining devices for a hands-on ahead of time so maybe there is some truth to all of this.But, there is no way of identifying if this is actually the new iPhone 6C or if it is just a regular iPhone 6. Theres tape over many of the important identifier bits, there is no comparison with the iPhone 6/6s, and there is really nothing in the room that can tell us anything about the scale of this device.Considering how good iPhone clones have gotten, it honestly wouldnt be too surprising if the phone in the video is actually a clone made to look like it could be the iPhone 6c. There have been many fakes in the past, some running an iOS skinned version of Android, some just flat out running Android, but it seems that there are plenty of people who cant tell the difference:Clearly many are willing to believe anything people tell them, so perhaps this guy is banking on the gullibility of society? Who knows. What we do know is that you shouldnt believe everything someone tells you. So, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt.What do you think of this device and its hands-on video? Does it look legit? Would you buy one? Why did they make it look exactly the same as the iPhone 6/6s instead of going down the iPhone 5c route? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE, 2]"

The team in Mountain View assures that the vulnerability isnt all that serious after all.Malware attacks have been a monthly problem towards the back-end of last year but, at least, this time, most Android users wont have much to worry about. And for the rest, a patch has been issued.When announced that 66% of Android devices out there could easily be bugged, there was a real frenzy. But no one gave Google a chance to explain its side of things. Google highlights that any device that runs Android 5.0 or later is protected by an added security layer dubbed Android SELinux policy.On the other hand, the older smartphones out there which run Android 4.4, the particular Linux kernel 3.8 code wasnt used at the time. Ahh, we can hear a worldwide sigh of relief from our office. Either way, Google wants to make sure that there are no oversights and are releasing a patch as we speak. You can expect this OTA on your devices very soon.The original discovery found that CVE-2016-0728 allowed third-party apps to access data in the OS keyring and encrypt it afterwards so it cant be accessed by the user. Once exploited, the malicious apps would be allowed to reign terror outside the controlled environment of the sandbox and gain control of the operating systems root functions.A more thorough explanation of the Android coding environment, you can check out our post here.[ SOURCE.

Now on top of all that, it seems like that Windows 10 Mobile release for older phones isnt coming this month.This is based on a twitter exchange between a user and a French telco, Bouygues Telecom. In the conversation, twitter user NotCassim asks if Windows 10 Mobile will be rolling out to old Lumias. The thread continues by another user stepping in and saying that another rep from the same telco told him it will be by late February.Microsoft has been rather mum on the subject but were sure theyre trying to strategise global recalls of the older-generation Surface Pros that have faulty charging bricks that supposedly catch fire in some instances.Microsoft already delayed this release once before, as earlier reports claimed that theyll be releasing the big software update in mid-January. That has passed without a peep. You can expect Redmond to give a crap about the existing Lumias in the market, cause theyre sure to outnumber any sales of the current-generation Lumia 950 and 950 XLs that just hit our shores not too long ago.As peeved as everyone is, were going to recap some of the devices thatll receive the update:Currently, we have the Lumia 950 XL and were going through the stages of the review.

Rory Lee,Weve broken the AppLock -Fingerprint- encryption and it wasnt even that difficult,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/weve-broken-the-applock-fingerprint-encryption-and-it-wasnt-even-that-difficult/,"AppLock,AppLock Fingerprint,Fingerprint decrypted,Fingerprint encryption","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Others",2016-01-21,"Weve touched on how good the Nexus 6Ps fingerprint sensor is in the past with its quick unlock speed and high accuracy despite only needing six taps to register your finger. You can also use it to authenticate Google Play as well as Android Pay purchases, but weve always hoped it could do more especially since Google baked fingerprint support into Android 6.0 Marshmallow itself.Thanks to the open API though,now you can use your fingerprint to lock specific apps in your phone  but theres a catch.App locking is no new concept. It simply allows you to lock specific applications, requiring either a password or pin to access that particular app. Lets say, your friends are the nosy bunch and the moment they get their hands on your device, they like to head into the gallery to look at all your embarrassing failed selfie attempts. Thanks to an app locker, you can stop that by protecting access to that application with an app locker. Some devices even have that natively in their Android skin, while others even allow you to lock entire folders of applications.Entering a password is so last century and developer SurpriseToYou have come up with AppLock -Fingerprint-, an app that lets you (if youre on Android 6.0 Marshmallow) lock individual applications in your phone with your fingerprint. Although we must note the incredibly sketchy developer name. When Im using a security app, I dont really want it to surprise me. To use it, the app requires you to grant it three different levels of access  Apps with usage access, Draw over other apps, and Activate device administrator.Once in, its a simple task of choosing which application you want locked by flicking the toggle next to that specific app. Once you launch the app that youve locked, the AppLock -Fingerprint- overlay will draw over the app and ask for your fingerprint.But, true to the developers name, heres the surprise  when that overlay pops up and locks your app, should you receive a banner notification from WhatsApp, the overlay drops and you have access to said locked app without ever inputting your fingerprint. What kind of security is this?!While the fact that this app runs on ads without a way to disable it is a little annoying, I think the far more pressing issue is the fact that you can break the encryption with a single banner notification. If, however, that doesnt bother you and youre interested in this app, you can get it from the PlayStore. Just, erm I dont know, turn off your banner notifications in the mean time?[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Mainly the load times between sessions and thankfully, Google has been busy baking their new compression algorithm, Brotli since September of last year. What in the world is this Brotli? Thats their new formula thatll make Chrome 26% faster and save more data while browsing on 3G/4G LTE.Taking over existing Zopfli, the yet to be released algorithm is now fresh out the oven and is expected to roll out in an update very soon.Its a lot of jargon to comprehend how Brotlis new data format makes a difference; to simplify the minimising, the compression size makes it easier for your devices to utilise space and speed up load times of pages. This will take place across all platforms from mobile to PCs, so that means using it while connected to your cellular data will be less strenuous on battery life and data limits. Mass adoption has already begun with Mozilla also said to be using Brotli in the future.While most of the times Chrome is bundled into Androids platform, those who love who have limited data caps usually rely on Opera Mini.The team at Opera somehow managed to squeeze the living daylights out of pages with their high and extreme data saving modes that has saved many users from hitting their throttled speeds.Itll be interesting how Chromes new compression matches up.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"
Rory Lee,Heres why we think the Indonesian Iron Man is fake,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/heres-why-we-think-the-indonesian-iron-man-is-fake/,,,2016-01-20,"By now, Im sure most of you have seen a video making its rounds on social media, and even 9gag, about a guy with a robotic arm that he built in a garage to help him overcome the limitations of his paralysed left hand. Sounds amazing right?Yeah, we think this sounds too good to be true. Heres why.// <![CDATA[
(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/all.js#xfbml=1""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));
// ]]&gt;I Wayan Sutawan, affectionately referred to as Tawan, suffered a minor stroke six months ago which paralysed his left arm. Because hes a mechanic of sorts, one can imagine that having a paralysed left hand can be quite a cumbersome thing. So, rather than sit around and whine about it, Tawan set to work and in two months created a robotic arm out of spare parts he had around his workshop.He can control the robot arm via a headband around his forehead that picks up his brain signals and allows him to control the arm movement accordingly. Based on the video, not only can he lift objects and move his arm around, he can also pick up and hold on to rather delicate objects.So why do we think this miraculous feat has more in common with the Boy Who Cried Wolf than it does with Iron Man?That means the body part  the muscles, the nerve cells, the tendons and ligaments  are perfectly functional, there is just nothing telling them to move. So, if its the brain that cant issue the command, how then can his brainwave detector  that looks like a bunch of LEDs strapped around his head with duct tape  detectthe brainwaves issued by a part of the brain that no longer functions?Plus, even if that contraption around his headcould pick up the brainwavesfrom dead/damaged braincells that can no longer issue commands via a humans regular nervous system, where on earth did he store the processor needed to make sense of those brainwaves (or even identify the correct ones) and translate them into mechanical motor functions? How did he develop such sophisticated programming? What kind of supercomputing power is being used to digest all that data?While the motors and the hydraulics for the upper segments of the arm could possibly pass off as motors to facilitate movement, the glove that controls Tawans finer finger movements dont have any actuators at all. So how could this contraption allow him to make the finger movements necessary to pick up and grip the solder in the video?Prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the brain arent exactly new. Take a look at this article by The Guardian on a DARPA-funded research project for robotic arms that can feel. What the scientists at Johns Hopkins university Applied Physics Laboratory did was have the electrodes from the prosthetic hand inserted into his sensory and motor cortexes so that he couldnot only control the hand with thought, he could also feel and sense when his fingers were touched.Once again, this is proof that in order for your brain to control a prosthetic arm, the necessary cortexes would have to be able to send a signal and function properly first. Another thing to note is thatif a project led by the brilliant scientists of Johns Hopkins needed funding from a US military agency like DARPA to succeed, how on earth did Tawan manage to build one himself out of spare parts?What is more likely is that the man simply has a weak arm that needs some motorised help to actually function properly. In fact, if you pay close attention to his left arm when he is inserting it into his mechanical contraption, you can see his wrist flick upwards before it enters the sleeve.Everything about this story seems too sketchy to be true. The fact that a simple mechanic from a rural town could just one day up and build something so advanced from spare parts should have raised at least a few flags. Add brainwave-controlled to that description and you would have a beautiful script to a story designed for the big screen. You would have Iron Man actually. And Tony Stark doesnt exist  no matter how hard Elon Musk tries.[SOURCE, 2]"

Were all dying to know the specs of Samsungs latest flagship. Most of them have one thing in common, they all say that itll be either an Exynos 8890 or Snapdragon 820 processor under their hoods.Benchmark experts AnTuTu have reaffirmed that theyll indeed be an Exynos 8890 in at least one variant of the Galaxy S7 as well as its accompanying specs.In a post on Weibo, the people behind the app have let the cat out of the bag. They posted that the SM-G930F  corresponding to a the non-edge version of the Galaxy S7  will have 4GB of RAM and a rather decent 64GB of internal storage. Imagine having that much storage plus a potential (rumoured) microSD card slot? Malaysians are gonna lap this up.Other internals were also detailed, like a 5.1-inch 2560 x 1440 resolution AMOLED display and a 12-megapixel rear lens. Despite there being fewer pixels on the main camera, its easily suggested that theyll be using larger sensors as detailed during their BRITECELL technology showcase. On the front, it looks like a 5-megapixel sensor, possibly with the same BRITECELL tech.You wont have to wait that long to hear more stuff on the new Samsung flagships, fortunately, MWC 2016 is happening in a month and theres bound to be more leaks till then.In spite of AuTuTu being a benchmarking app, the makers have yet to publish official scores of the device.

When abused, it can cause adverse effects. Thats what Communication and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Salleh Said Keruak believes as the government is mulling for tougher enforcements for online users.According to the minister, social media is often abused for defaming and to incite hatred against leaders and the institutions of government. To put an end to these issues, the government is pushing to amend the MCMC Act in March, which will give it more powers to act on such abusers. The police will work closely with the MCMC in their investigations. To speed up the process, a dedicated deputy public prosecutor has been appointed by the Attorney-Generals Chambers to handle social media cases.  The new amendment could also allow more websites to be blocked, especially those that are seen to be threatening the peace and violating the Sedition Act. One such site is Sarawak Report, which he says has been spreading lies against the government and it creates confusion among the people. The minister has also added that he hopes Malaysians wont view this in a negative light as it was necessary to safeguard the publics interest. This isnt the first time weve seen such warning. In the middle of last year, MCMC had issued a notice advising Malaysians against spreading lies on 1MDB. Once the amendment is passed in 2 months time, you better think twice before making slanderous statements on your Facebook, Twitter and other social channels. That one rant could win you a Go to Jail card. There are a lot of nasty things being posted on social media these days but theres a difference between offensive and defamatory. Will the police and MCMC be able to tell the difference between the two? In the UK, there had been several cases of users being jailed for being offensive. What do you think of this MCMC Act amendment? Will it make Malaysians more responsible online or will it suppress our freedom of speech?[ SOURCE 2, IMAGE CREDIT ]"

Now, weve just received an email indicating that Samsung will be launching these new devices  the Galaxy A3, Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7  next week.Samsung Malaysia has set the official unveiling of the Galaxy A line for 28 January 2016 which is next Thursday. The Galaxy A series willshare the Galaxy S6s good looks with its glass front and back panels held together by a metal frame. The edges are rounded for a better grip and feel in the hand.The devices also get a bump, across the line, up to a 13-megapixel f/1,9 aperture rear shooter and a front-facing 5MP f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates the Galaxy A3s camera from the other two bigger devices is the lack of OIS though we suspect people who are going for a budget device wont mind this too much. The best part? All three devices have a Pink Gold colour option  which we hope they will bring to Malaysia as well.Sitting at the top of the Galaxy As pecking order is the largest of the trio with a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED display. On the inside, the devices will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Thankfully the internal storage is expandable via microSD to up to 128GB of extra internal storage. The Galaxy A7 also gets a large 3,300 mAh battery.Next up we have the Galaxy A5 which is slightly smaller at 5.2 but with the same full-HD (19201080) Super AMOLED display. Powering the device will be a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. However, it gets a smaller 2,900 mAh battery for juice.Rounding out the trio is the smallest sibling, the Galaxy A3. Sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280720) Super AMOLED display with a quad-core 1.5GHz processor running on the inside. It also packs 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. The device will be drawing power from a 2,300 mAh battery.The trio of devices will notlaunch with Android 6.0 Marshmallow though, as theyre set to come with Android 5.1 Lollipop out-of-the-box. That said, we do expect them to get Marshmallow within a reasonable amount of time. The two higher end devices  the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7  also sport a fingerprint scanner.Those are mighty specs for a budget device, but only if these devices are actually priced like a budget device. Based on the Singaporean pricing of the Galaxy A line, that doesnt really look to be the case. In Singapore, the Galaxy A3 is going for SGD398 (around RM1,211), while the Galaxy A5 costs SGD598 (around RM1,820) and the biggest Galaxy A7 will set you back SGD698 (around RM2,125).A pretty hefty price tag then. Then again, Singapores prices have generally been much higher than in Malaysia. If were going off last years Malaysian pricing, the Galaxy A3 went for RM899, Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199 and the Galaxy A7 had an RM1,499 price tag. But, keep in mind that these prices were before GST.Would you consider these devices at those price ranges? Let us know in the comments section below."

The phone will draw power from a fairly large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0.The honor 5X is going for RMB1,099 in China (around RM730) which is only a touch higher than the Redmi Note 3s 16GB version and the same price as the 32GB version. In Malaysia you can get an imported Redmi Note 3 (via DirectD) for under RM1,000, so the question is: How low will honor go?The honor 7 Enhanced isnt all that different than the already good un-enhanced version which we liked a lot. The only enhancement is the fact that this device will now come with 32GB of internal storage and Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.While the bump in storagefrom 16GBmight not be that big of a deal to some, many felt that one of the biggest problems with the honor 7 was the lack of storage space. Now with double that, this device just got a whole lot better.Besides that, this will be the first non-nexus smartphone in Malaysia to be officially sold with Android M out-of-the-box. So, you get to have all those awesome Marshmallow features to yourself.The device features a 5.2 full HD display on the front with an octa-core Kirin 935 processor clocked at 2.2GHz paired with 3GB of RAM. Camera-wise it has a 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash. The front camera is an 8MP unit with its own front-facing flash to help with those low-light selfies.In China, the honor 7 Enhanced is going for RMB 1,999 (around RM1330)  the same price as the honor 7, with the original getting a bump down to RMB1,799 (around RM1,200)  which is quite the steal. In Malaysia, the honor 7 is priced at RM1,399 so we expect the new Enhanced version match the originals price."

Though now, any Maxis/Hotlink customer can easily purchase apps, in-app purchases, Google Movies, E-books and newsstand content through Maxis direct billing  credit/debit card not necessary.Users on the green-loving telco can now pay for any Play Store purchase through their monthly billings. Prepaid lines arent left out either with just two prerequisites youll need to fulfill. Maxis hopes that through the direct billing itll open doors to those with no credit/debit cards to now make purchases on the Play Store.Were seeing this trend from other organisations; Digi being another telco that started this initiative in September last year. The limitations of these plastic cards are something that companies are starting to realise with WhatsApp also doing away with the need to pay for their service because of not many people having a credit/debit card.For postpaid, direct billing will be available to all customers except those using Corporate lines. Any purchases will be billed in the next bill cycle. On the other hand, prepaid users will need to make sure they are subscribed (at least) to a Monthly Data Plan of 1GB to be eligible  obviously, theyll also have to ensure they have sufficient prepaid airtime balance as the billing is instant.These are the steps to set it up:Remember when setting up the first time, youll have to make sure youre connected to a Maxis/Hotlink data network (3G/4G) and youre able to receive SMS. Thats the only way they can detect if youre on their network in the first place. Any purchases/downloads that follow can utilise WiFi networks without hindering your direct billing. After doing so, you wont have to repeat the steps as Maxis direct billing will now be your default payment method for anything on the Play Store.When purchasing itll look something like this:It was a nice touch that they added the SMS notification for any purchase that youve made. There will also be an added e-mail from Google and a purchase history in Google Wallet for extra documentation. Carefully reminding you of all the money thatll be flying away. It wont be that bad, Maxis sets a cap of RM 200/month by default for postpaid users, ensuring that you dont spend too much on the Play Store.In the scenario that you want to increase your limit, you can do so by contacting their customer service for help. Only principal line holders can readjust purchase limits  some useful info for users on supplementary lines.Interestingly, when using Maxis direct billing for Google Play Store purchases, youll be charged an additional 6% GST  added to the amount shown on the Google Play Store. But were not sure how this will work for users on prepaid as GST is supposed to be rebated back to you if youre a Malaysian  you can read about it all here.Since youll have to pay GST while using Maxis direct billing, it makes more sense for users with credit/debit cards to use the regular card billing method, since you wont be hit with the tax.Refunds are the typical as per Play Store policy, giving you a window of two hours to request a refund. Youll be able to do that by going back to the purchased app and select Refund. If you missed the two-hour period, itll change to reflect Uninstall instead. Any late request will have to be directed to app developers, and itll be up to them to decide if your excuse is valid. Users will be notified via SMS if theyve successfully got a refund.[ SOURCE ]"
Rory Lee,Did you damage your device? Soon itll bleed to let you know,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/did-you-damage-your-device-soon-itll-bleed-to-let-you-know/,"bleed,car bleeding,casing bleed,color changing polymer,colour changing polymer,early damage detection,how to see tiny cracks,polymer coating","Cool stuff,Others",2016-01-20,"Sometimes, a tiny crack is all it takes to cause severe damage to an object. Its these tiny cracks that we dont see because theyre often impossible to spot in, for example, your cars windscreen. However, these cracks become the first weaknesses in any object and could potentially lead to something really bad somewhere down the road.Well, a University of Illinois research has led to a polymer coating that could be an important early damage warning system, making it easier to find cracks or damage in particular objects by making them bleed.This polymer coating consists of tiny micro beads that crack open, causing a chemical reaction that will visibly highlight any damage with colour. These beads are pH sensitive so any damage will cause a colour change  from yellow to red  without the need for additional chemicals. The bigger the crack or scratch, the deeper the object will bleed as more capsules are affected.Whats good about this coating is that it works on multiple kinds of polymers that can coat metals, other polymers and even glass. Plus, theyre apparently not too expensive either, but no specific quote of a price was given.Whats more, the coating shows no sign of degradation  meaning the microcapsules will stay intact until actual cracks or damage happens.The application possibilities of this technology are endless. Since only 5% of a polymer needs to be microcapsules to have a strong damage indication ability, you can apply it to a myriad of things. While this can prove useful to big projects like rocket launches into space as well as deep sea exploration, there are also plenty of everyday products that can benefit.Off the top of my head would be your action cam/smartphones waterproof casing. Those things are transparent so its incredible difficult to find small cracks in their seal, but all it takes is a little nick to let the water in and damage your precious device. Planes and vehicles stand to benefit from this polymer too, as important components in these machines can be coated to allow for early damage detection which could potentially save lives. Its kind of nice to think that your car could bleed for you before you have to bleed yourself.[SOURCE, VIA]"

The suit comes from an influential NGO that cares for consumer interests in Netherlands, Consumentenbond aka Dutch Consumers Association.The group claims that Samsung has a horrible software update policy for their Android-based smartphones. They want the South Korean giant to start being more transparent in providing a relative timeline of how long these devices will be supported. Issues pertaining to Stagefright and other critical vulnerabilities were highlighted in their release.Talking about the Stagefright problem before, Samsung did say that they were going to fight software manipulation by pledging to monthly security updates over-the-air (OTA). For a further explanation of what Stagefright is, head on over here.Consumentenbond attempts of out-of-court discussions with Samsung didnt achieve a desired result. Thus, the association thinks that they should be held viable and will face off with the undisputed market leader in Android phones in the chambers of law.A suit comes into picture after the association ran an Update! campaign to promote more consistent software updates from Android OEMs. Their claims arent baseless either, as theyve found that an estimated 82% of Samsung smartphones in Netherlands have not received the latest version of Android in the two years after being introduced.Users have nothing to lose from this case and its no question that a revamp to Samsungs upgrade policy will be greatly appreciated on all consumer fronts. In the consideration of security and privacy breaches, at least if done correctly, Samsung could tackle them swiftly by providing (more) regular updates.If the Dutch Consumers Association manages to put up a good fight, it could pose Samsung to rethink releasing too many devices in a year and their TouchWiz development team are probably gonna get a lot more work on their hands  plus long-term support could make their phones pricier too.These groups are not to be taken for granted and were assuming the EU (European Union) should take notice and demand the same things if things favour Consumentenbond in Dutch courts.Share with us your thoughts if you have a Samsung device.

But based on the Channelnomics Europe report, itll be the three models mentioned above that were sold in Europe before the 15th of July, 2015.Corresponding via e-mail with ZDNet, the Microsoft representative had this to say:While using the Surface Pro 4, we never noticed any issues of this kind and our colleague hasnt faced any either while using the Surface Pro 3. Microsoft wasnt clear on which models but it seems that the Surface Pro 4 wont be involved if Channelnomics Europes report was indeed true  since the timeline doesnt match-up with the latest Surface Pro only hitting markets in Q4 of 2015.For those in the States, it seems the recall will be directed at the same three generation of Surface Pros but will be for those sold before March of 2015  clarification from Microsofts representative.This twisted fate for the older top of the line Surface tablets has just added another pile of worry on the manufacturers lap.

One of which is the Facebook application. It takes up a whopping amount of space in your internal storage versus something like Instagram that only uses a fraction of the amount, but because this is the only and most complete application for browsing Facebook, we begrudgingly use it.Common perception would be that the mobile browser version is always a whole lot worse than the app, but according to Android Central, that isnt the case. Russell Holly wrote an article about how he uninstalled Facebook on his Android device and it turned out to be a better experience than he expected.That got us thinking, is the Facebook app really worth it? Well, for what we believe is the majority of FB users, we doubt it. Here are the five reasons we think Android users should ditch the Facebook application.If youre on it for a moderate amount of time a day, you will notice that it becomes one of the biggest battery drainers on your phone. Plus, it is a performance hog too, something Russell also notes, so it will significantly slow down the performance of lower-end devices.If youve ever installed the Facebook app, Im sure youd notice the ridiculous amount of permissions they require to function properly. It wants access to so much of my information that Im pretty sure the Zuck knows me better than my mom does."

These individuals spend nearly 12 hours in artisanal cobalt mines in the DRC and have been documented in photographs and video recordings. The documentation shows that the kids that are abused in this process essentially work above ground, collecting and cleaning rocks from these sites and nearby waterways.They face abhorrent conditions having to carry well above their weight, constantly abused physically and breathe in all the hazardous gas and chemicals associated with these sites that abandon safety guidelines and dont provide protective gear.

With all the smartphone manufacturers pursuing metal and glass bodied phones as the agreed standard for a premium build and feel, the question becomes: Does that really give the best feel in the hand?

Since this app can basically let you reach as far as there is some semblance of an Internet connection, rural folks were worried that  due to their limited to non-existent access to banking services  they would lose this connection to their loved ones.Besides that, WhatsApp has also ensured their users that they would not be resorting to third-party advertisements on their application to generate income. Instead, theyre testing tools that will allow users to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organisations that they want to talk to. Think of it as a messaging gateway for enterprises.

Huawei isnt bucking this trend as new information has surfaced that theyre launching four different variants of their upcoming P9 handset  one more than last year. Whats more, the fourth device will feature a dual rear camera setup.According to a report on VentureBeat by Evan Blass, otherwise known as @evleaks, Huaweis P9 lineup will include the regular P9, a budget-friendly P9lite, a larger P9max as well as an unnamed feature-enhanced P9. Although Blass noted that his source fell short of dubbing it a premium model, this enhanced P9 is said to feature a larger screen (though not as large as the P9max) more RAM, more internal storage as well as a dual 12-megapixel rear-facing camera.This isnt new for the Chinese smartphone manufacturer however as theyve already tried the dual-camera set up on the 2014-2015 honor 6 Plus. In fact, this new P9s camera is supposed to be a second generation upgrade of that very dual-camera. Therefore, it will likely mean that the P9s dual-camera will offer the same additional features afforded by the honor 6 Plus like post-capture refocus, simulated aperture adjustment and filter application plus what VentureBeat says will be even more unique capabilities as this camera concept has been further refined.Is two better than one? If our earlier leak on the upcoming LG G5 is any indication, it would appear smartphone manufacturers definitely think so, as that device is rumoured to sport not only a dual-screen setup like the LG V10but also a dual rear mounted camera. That said, these are merely rumours as there has been no official confirmation beyond a person with alleged knowledge of Huawei so take this with a grain of salt.One thing is for sure though none of the P9 variants will feature a QHD resolution screen (25601440 pixels). As with all Huawei devices (except the Nexus 6P which we can all argue can be considered more of a Google device), the company feels that the slightly better screen and image quality offered by a QHD screen just isnt worth the shorter battery life. We were pretty impressed with the Mate S battery life, so maybe they do know what theyre doing.As far as specs are concerned, Blass source didnt reveal anything, but we did come across a device that posted a blistering score on Geekbench that we believe could be the Kirin 950-powered Huawei P9. With that kind of horsepower and now a dual-camera, suffice to say were excited.Despite all of this information and anticipation, Blass indicates that Huawei will not launch these smartphones during the Barcelona Mobile World Congress timeframe, choosing instead to give them a dedicated launch several weeks after MWC. However, it is said that Huawei is expected to unveil a Surface Book-like 2-in-1 in Barcelona next month but there are unfortunately no details on this product for the time being.[SOURCE]"

Sony has just laid out its calling card and theyll be vying the attention of tech sites at the same conference as Samsung and LG; sendingout invitations for a special press conference aday after its two competitors intend to release their biggest devices of the year.But what could they release? The flagship Xperia line was just announced at IFA in September. So it couldnt be that. What about a tablet? or the alleged bezeless Xperia C6? Were not quite sure just yet but if they want to enter the ring with Samsung and LG  both of whom are going to release flagship smartphones  they better put something good on the show floor.If it would be a tablet, itll be a follow-up to the Xperia Z4 tablet and that would indeed make a (good) fuss. Sonys tablets are no pushovers and has been a beacon of light in the disarray that is Android tablets. Their Xperia Z2 Tablet being (an early) example of how they can produce great slates and the Xperia Z4 Tablet that followed it.Its also plausible that Sony might announce some new wearable during Mobile World Congress but to hold an event the same day as two competitors that are going to release their biggest devices of the year with a wearable seems even less likely.IFA 2015 was just four months ago and Sony cant be too brash when it comes to refreshing their flagship Xperia Z line  wed prefer to think as such since weve already advised them to use a longer product-cycle to develop something thatll change the smartphone game.Repeating our status quo, Sony has to stop playing safe and take some risks. Change up their looks and look towards starting a new trend. Theyve got to risk it for the biscuit so to say.If they dont, the company may start reconsidering the position of their Mobile division and the ambiguous alternative options cloud that hangs above them isnt something they should play with.The Japanese company better watch out, cause if they fail to shock us positively when trying to steal that thunder from LG and Samsung, theyre going to be an afterthought we wont bother with.For a look at what Samsung might put out, check out this post here.

Some of us have tried it out for ourselves first hand. It seemed like a gigantic design oversight by the South Korean electronics giant, but the solution was a simple one  dont put the pen in backwards.Sometimes, accidents happen and it seems that Samsung has picked up on that as theyve quietly fixed this gigantic flaw with the S Pen via a hardware modification to their newerGalaxy Note5 models.But, as there is no way of telling if your device has the fix, please dont try this with your own device.Based on the image, it looks like Samsung have added a little lever (left) to the original circuit board which looks like it will allow users to eject the S Pen if it were inserted the wrong way. According to Phandroids sources, this new mechanism works beautifully despite the fact that it looks like it is being held together by some tape.We dont think thats how Samsung will actually hold the lever there, but if there is a fix for this issue it is pretty good news. However, since Samsung made the oversight in the first place, were sure many of the early Galaxy Note5 adopters must be pissed that their device doesnt have this hardware fix.Plus, since Samsung seems to have ninja-fixed this, it doesnt look like they want others to find out about it which is kind of a bummer. While wed like to hope that Samsung will offer a hotfix for this problem to existing Galaxy Note5 users, we highly doubt that will be the case.Do you own a Galaxy Note5?

Hes earned billions by making business decisions in his own companies and thinks hes the best man to seek business advice from. In this case, the way Apples manufacturing system operates.Speaking to an audience at Liberty University earlier today, Mr Trump as hes so fondly referred to on the Apprentice, shared some of his insights on how to make Apple more American. Were not talking about Apple Pie here.Imposing his good-sense, he began by suggesting businesses who produce goods out of the country should be hit by a 35% tax for putting their factories overseas. This is the same man who supposedly supports free trade. The front-runner for the Republican Party ended by saying:Were going to get Apple to build their damn computers in this country instead of other countries.Remember, this man has a net worth of an estimated 4.5 billion USD and hes built an empire worthy enough to shout about but what about Apple? Well, the Cupertino-based outfit achieved sales over US$ 200 billion, with a net profit of US$ 45 billion and have assets accumulating to that of US$ 260 billion. So who really has the bigger piggy bank here?To suggest that Apple throws aside deals with Foxconn (full list here) and others is just plain silly. Regardless if Trump were to become President or not, hed have to push for new legislations that allow him to have those fundamental powers in the first place.Its a given that Apple utilises overseas supply partnerships because other parts of the world simply have bigger factories, a larger workforce and overall bigger set up. The makers of the iPhone outsource their labour and manufacturing because it maximises profit.Trump is not shy to make outlandish remarks every typical day while on stage but for him to do this would require a method to penalise these companies. To the extent that hell have to convince them America match Chinas production capabilities  in its own, requires a lot of funding and implementation.Sure, if Apple decided to be more-American (if theres ever such a thing), it would spur the local economy  more jobs will be available, worker conditions would likely be better than that of Foxconns and youll get Made in America on devices.You can watch the whole segment below:Skip over to 1:05:00 when Trump makes his appearance on stageLet us know what you think of the latest remarks made by the potential Presidential candidate in the comments below.[ SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

Google is currently rolling out the new feature to Android users worldwide and itll come in stages.To see if youve got the update head on over to your Google search bar and type in a name of an app.The top result should reflect the app you searched for and under its description, theyll be an option for you to install the app right away.After clicking it, the typical permissions popup should come up and youll choose to accept to install.

We havent got it either.This feature has supposedly gone unnoticed for a month or so but its only now hitting a wider reach. Android Police notes that this option should only work on the Google app, Chrome will, unfortunately, be left out. But knowing Google, they might make this common across both soon enough.Adding this feature seems to echo Googles sentiments of being a mobile company.

LG was even apparently moving their volume and power buttons back to the side of their smartphones.While all of that were just rumours before this, now we have what looks like actual confirmation of what the device will look like as well as some of its hardware features.Android Authority received an exclusive tip from Shai Mizrachi in which they came into possession of several LG G5 diagrams showing exactly what the phone will look like on the outside as well as its dimensions. Based on the diagram, it does indeed look like the phone will have a flat design unlike that of the previous G4 and G Flex models.Besides that the diagram confirms that the G5s volume control buttons will be placed at the side of the smartphone while the power button remains put beneath the camera module (likely where the fingerprint sensor will reside as well). It does seems kind of silly to have a clickable button at the back, but then again weve doubted the back button placement before and that turned out pretty well in the end.Speaking of that camera module, while it does look like a massive module, it seems that there will only be one camera at the back. Judging from the cutout in the middle plus the earlier concepts by CNet Korea, the rest of to module will be home to the dual-tone LED flash and a laser autofocus.It also looks like the G5 will indeed be thinner, taller and wider than the LG G4, measuring in at149.4 x 73.9 x 8.2mm versus the G4s148.9 x 76.1 x 6.3-9.8mm.Unfortunately, while this diagram does confirm a lot about the device, there is no mention of specs or what exactly the body will be made of. If were going off past rumours the G5 should have a 5.7-inch QHD display plus an all metal body with a removable battery that can be slid out by popping off the bottom or top of the device.[SOURCE]"

We already knew the wave of rumours were beginning since were halfway into January with MWC 2016 hot on the heels a month away.Based on numerous reports, its likely that Samsung will announce four devices of the Galaxy S7 series when the mobile related festivities begin in Barcelona. Theyre listed as Galaxy S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge+. Reports have given a rough idea that the Galaxy S7 Plus and Galaxy S7 edge+ does indeed exist.You might have also seen postings on how Spigen accidentally started selling cases for the supposed four devices on amazon. You can read about it here.Evleaks has already shown off the alleged banner that suggest that the Galaxy S7, S7 edge and S7 edge+ will make its grand opening in a months time. And in terms of what processors theyll be running, leaks way back said theyll be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and an Exynos 8890 models  usually region specific. Heres the note that was released months back:Take note of the model numbers and see how they tally up with the Indonesian listings below:Youve got one that uses the code SM-G930FD and another that uses SM-G935FD. So for one you can believe that at least two devices will arrive during MWC 2016. Based on model names, it seems likely these two numbers match up with the next generation of flagship Galaxys/Galaxies.The same deductions can be made based on the number that differentiates the edge variant from the regular Galaxy S# models. With the flat flagship carrying the 0 number at the end while the edged version ends with a number 5.The lettering, on the other hand, represents the interchanging processor options  A for snapdragon and F for the Exynos chipsets. Were referring to listings of the older Dual-SIM Galaxy S6 that used this code: SM-G920FD.So if this listing holds water, it would mean that the Indonesian market will be getting both a Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge  both Dual-SIM and both using an Exynos processor. Malaysians have a high chance of getting the same duo as well if the past is any indication.For further reading on what features and internals could make their way onto the Galaxy S7 series, head on over here.After checking the certification site, it seems that the listing has been removed. Maybe Samsung noticed and got it removed or it never existed in the first place. What were getting at is these are rumours and leaks so alwaystake them with a pinch on salt.In the case that Samsung does release four devices, wed think that would be cannibalising the Note5s market share and thatll definitely be unfavourable if they were to out a Galaxy S7+.

Some timely information, given that last week we talked about how the iPhone 6s Plus destroys every (currently available) smartphone out there on AnTutu  Android is back with a vengeance  or at least when this unknown Huawei device comes to light.Keeping up with current rumours, it seems that the device were talking about is none other than the Huawei P9. Its assumed that itll arrive with a home-grown Octa-core Kirin 950 processor and a Mali T880 MP4 GPU.This processor is built based on a 16nm fabrication process and it utilises 4 high-performance ARM Cortex A72 cores that can be clocked up to 2.3GHz and followed suit by 4x low power Cortex A53 cores clocked at a more efficient 1.8GHz.Itll run the a big.LITTLE configuration, that allows that Octa-core processor to efficiently run to deliver the best performance at the optimal power consumption.Further reading about the Kirin 950 processor can be found here.Based off purported images showing a device by Huawei hitting a home-run in the multi-core test of the famous benchmark test. If the 7313 multi-core is true, you could say that the Kirin 950 processor is going to be a beast. Reports claim that together with the Kirin 950 SoC, the P9 will don the same 5.2-inch screen that its predecessor did, together with 4GB of RAM and Android 6.0 Marshmallow running the operating system show.The Kirin 950 processor beats the current chart-topper in the MediaTek Heli X20 that runs in a Deca-core format  7037. But out of the four big guns of chipsets, the current front-runner is still (supposedly) the Exynos 8890 thats slated to be on the Samsung Galaxy S7 devices thatll be announced come MWC 2016. The breakdown of performance is shown in a graph provided below:Click imageto enlargeWe echo the sentiments that usually when undergoing testing, manufacturers clock these processors lower to prevent complications and gradually ramp the clocked speeds once theyre happy with how the device runs  heat and all. Then again, these leaks could turn out to be fake, so be wary when seeing them.As detailed in our earlier article, the times of unbelievably fast (on paper) processors really have superseded the needs of their users. The differences are often negligible and often people barely notice them.

A reliance of our cars might rise since fuel prices are lower than usual but knowing markets, they could easily balloon again. Despite cheaper petrol, most car manufacturers upped their price-points, toll prices and public transport has raised their prices too and well lets just say its going to be tough getting here and there with our economy being the way it is.Considering all the factors, UberMalaysia has decided to make their uberX rides more affordable.Kuala LumpurBringing some joy to Uber riders, theyve revised the Klang Valley fares to reflect the breakdown above.Previously, those riding on uberX were charged at RM1.50 for base fare followed by RM0.30/minute and RM0.60/KM. So theyve lowered the base fares by RM0.55 and decreased the per minute cost from RM0.30 to RM0.25. Per kilometer pricing has remained at RM0.60.Uber thinks that lowering prices would, in turn, make more people use it  pretty much a given but they hope this will bring better remuneration for the people behind the wheel of Uber cars too.Theyve given a comparison table of the old and the new fares in between points and how much the prices have decreased. For short distances, this translates up to 50% less compared to the previous rate.At the same time, theyve dropped prices for uberX rides in Penang and Johor as well.PenangPreviously, those riding on uberX in Penang were charged at RM1.50 for base fare followed by RM0.30/minute and RM0.60/KM. So theyve lowered the base fares by RM0.60 and decreased the per minute cost from RM0.30 to RM0.25. Per kilometer pricing has also been reduced to RM0.55.Thats roughly a 15% decreasing in overall pricing.Johor BahruPreviously, those riding on uberX in Johor were charged at RM1.50 for base fare followed by RM0.20/minute and RM0.60/KM. So theyve lowered the base fares by RM0.50 and per kilometer pricing has also been reduced to RM0.50. But increased the per minute cost from RM0.20 to RM0.25.The aboveis a comparison table of the old and the new fares in between points and how much the prices have decreased for those in Johor. It works out to about 15% cheaper fares. Relying on data from their case study in New York, they saw a gradual growth of partner driver earnings once they dropped prices every year. In the span of 3 years (2002 to 2015) they make Uber rides cheaper by 30% and following the trend was driver earnings.True enough, once prices dropped, drivers were busier and they spent their hours more efficiently. More trips, less idle times means more money.Hey, after all, the people ferrying us here and there deserve to be earning a good wage too and it doesnt hurt us one bit. Lets hope Uber can maintain standards and keep both riders and drivers happy.You can download your Uber app at these links for iOS and Android.[ SOURCE, 2, 3 ]"

The Japanese manufacturer did a first when they put a fingerprint sensor on the Xperia Z5 series and their decision has now come back to haunt them. Itll go on sale next month in the United States but itll be missing the biometric security component thats available in other markets.And we think we know why.While quite far-fetched, the probably intentional delay of the US release of their Xperia Z5 line could mean that Sony had a chance to see if their new fingerprint sensor would be a hit or otherwise.Following which, they would take note the feedback of their side-placed fingerprint sensor, and decide if its worthy to risk having the power button doubles as the fingerprint scanner. Mainly because, it doesnt work (well).When asked why they decided to pull the scanner, they simply said: it was a business decision.Android Authority has reached out for further clarification but has yet to hear back. Sony already has a lot on their plate and if these issues keep cropping up, they better make sure their next flagship makes the cut.This is their first run at such technology on their devices and while we could argue they shouldve perfected it before putting it out, well cut them some slack. This move could be a good one, provided that they make changes to the prices to reflect the lack of a fingerprint sensor.Maybe Americans are better off not dealing with the annoying fingerprint sensor that we talked about in our review of the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual.

After which, we started seeing the Apple wearable start gaining traction (at least in published sales reports). They were number two, behind Fitbit  if these numbers were indeed true but with sales dwarfing that of other mainstream smartwatch brands (e.g. Samsung and Pebble), would Cupertino allow the Apple Watch to see out a longer product cycle to ensure big advancements across versions? Or will they make small refinements across generations  like weve seen on the iPhones with a distinctive s being all the difference.TechCrunchs latest report believes it could be one or the other.Based on multiple sources, the report suggests that we could see the same Apple Watch (in essence) tieing up with designers and add-on accessory makers but no massive changes in hardware. Contradictory to the fact, other sources claim that there will be one major difference on the latest smartwatch from Apple: a FaceTime camera.An analyst from Creative Strategies, a market research firm says that dormant supply chain checks are key signs that no new Apple Watch is currently being produced.He continues by saying the cuts in component providers supply chains, it just doesnt add up that a new smartwatch would be on the way  if anything, production shouldve started in the tail end of 2015 to be out by the first half of 2016. Mr Bajarin, observes that in light of this information, Apples product patterns might take a big shift in direction.On the software side of things, it seems to be just as quiet and that seems to just add fire to the assumption of the Apple Watch 2.0 announcement being a long way off. But then again WatchOS2 was just announced a while back, so theres that to consider as well.Will Apple have a keynote in March? Definitely. What will unveil during that time? The Apple Watch 2.0 would be unlikely.Changing the product-cycle of the Apple Watch could bring some good after all. With smaller devices, technological advancements happen less often, because well you can only make things so small.

Despite top-of-the-line hardware, it seems the Windows 10 OS just isnt a match for the other established mobile operating systems. But, Microsoftis not done releasing new Lumias as we now have what looks like an official date for the Lumia 650: February 1.However, there is also word that this could be the last Lumia smartphone of this year. So,Surface Phone anyone?Rendered image of the Lumia 650According to Windows Central, multiple sources have confirmed with them that February 1 will be the date that Microsoft reveals details about the device including pricing and availability. This device is said to feature a 5-inch 1280720 pixel HD display with a quad-core Snapdragon 212 (or 200) processor with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD). It is also said to have an 8MP/5MP rear-front camera combo with an LED flash.What is interesting is that they also note that this could very well be the last Lumia device of 2016 as they said both the rumoured Lumia 850 and Lumia 750 have been cancelled in July of 2015. Then again that article also said that the Lumia 550 was cancelled, so, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt.With the abrupt cancellation of both Lumia devices,it is unlikely that Microsoft will sit on their hands and not launch any more mobile devices this year. So if there are no more Lumias what else does Microsoft have in their pipeline? A Surface Phone perhaps?An earlier report by Windows Central indicated that the much-anticipated smartphone developed by Microsofts Surface team  for now dubbed the Surface Phone  could see a release in the second half of 2016. The Surface lineup has always been associated with premium quality devices, so we know that this team knows what theyre doing when it comes to mobile devices. Although, they have received some flak for the Surface Book and Pro 4, but that was mostly down to the buggy software it was shipped with.This then brings us to the persisting problem that is Windows 10. One of the biggest reasons to the lukewarm reception of the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL was the fact that it is running on an operating system that just doesnt seem ready yet. The specs are good, the camera is good, the build iswell, lets not get ahead of ourselves there, but the software is just so unsuited for mobile usage.Unless their software game takes a significant step up where you can actually see people moving from other operating systems to Windows 10 (mobile), all the brilliant hardware in the world wont be able to save you. Things will be even worse if you slap an exorbitant price tag on it.What do you guys think? Are you hyped to see a new Windows 10 powered phone? Or do you share our sentiments?

With this new version, though, 2015s report is the first cross-platform ranking report and my goodness was it an interesting one. While we werent that surprised that the iPhone 6s Plus was #1 on their list, we were shocked at how MUCH further it was from the competition. Let me give you a hint: 132k.According to the popular cross-platform benchmarker, the average score of an iPhone 6s Plus is 132,620 points, the only device to break the 100k mark in 2015.On paper, this gap doesnt seem possible as the iPhone 6s Plus is powered by a dual-core Twister A9 chip that is clocked at a tame 1.84GHz and a PowerVR GT7600 GPU paired with (a frankly depressing) 2GB of RAM. Comparatively, the second placed Huawei Mate 8 packs a monstrous next-gen octa-core Kirin 950 SoC  four Cortex A72 CPU cores clocked at 2.3GHz, four Cortex A53 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz and a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU  plus 4GB of RAM.Yet somehow the iPhone 6s Plus outperforms it by about 30%. It is worth noting that the top 3 performing phones all run on full HD displays so they have less pixels to push compared to their Quad-HD competitors.As we move down the ladder, we find the Samsung Exynos 7420 chipsets occupying places three to five with the Meizu PRO 5 leading the pack. Not surprising since it only runs a 1080p full-HD display opposed to the Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+s Quad-HD display.Just after the Samsung chips comes 2014s iPhone 6 Plus, scoring a respectable 80,554 average score. Not bad for a 2014 phone especially if you take a look at the phones below it. Yup, in case you didnt notice it yet we have not come across a single Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chip yet.Coming in at 7th is the first and best-performing Snapdragon 810 smartphone, the OnePlus 2. A 2016 flagship killer got killed by a phone from 2014. Oops. Scoring an average just shy of 80,000 the OnePlus 2 edges just ahead of the LetvLe 1 Pro, Xiaomi Mi Note Prowhile Googles Nexus 6Prounds out the 10.I guess it REALLY isnt about how much horsepower you have, its about how you use it. However, it is worth noting that these are average scores so the number of benchmarks ran as well as the conditions in which these benchmarks were run should also factor into the results. That said, I dont think anything short of a nuclear war could stop the iPhone 6s Plus from running away with the crown.[SOURCE, VIA]"
Rory Lee,Netflix is sick and tired of your VPN and Proxies,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/15/netflix-is-sick-and-tired-of-your-vpn-and-proxies/,"Netflix,Netflix blocking proxy,Netflix blocking VPN,Netflix Malaysia,Netflix Malaysia proxy,Netflix Malaysia VPN,Netflix Proxy,Netflix VPN,proxy,vpn","Android,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-01-15,"Netflix recently went global and everyone got very excited. Weve all heard good things about this streaming service, from the shows they have to the quality of their stream plus all the Netflix exclusives like Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Its gotten so popular that we see it mentioned in TV shows themselves, that one time in Suits when Mike Ross wanted to piss Edward Darby off for example.But, when we took a hard look at their catalogue from our Malaysian accounts, we were quite bummed out that there were so many shows missing. Even popular comedy series How I Met Your Mother wasnt there. So the craftier of us went ahead and used VPNs (Virtual Private Network) and proxiesto mask our IP addresses and as a result, gain more access to their content.Well, it seems like Netflix has had enough of our scheming ways and has said openly that theyre putting a stop to VPN users once and for all.For those of you who dont know what a VPN or proxy does, it basically masks your IP address, preventing a website  Netflix for example  from finding out where you are connecting from. So, with a VPN or proxy you can set it up to have the site or app detect that youre connecting from an American IP address, for example, then the region locked site wouldgrant you access to their content as if you were coming from the US. If youd like a more detailed explanation you can head on over to Gizmodos article on how VPNs work.In short when it comes to Netflix, this allows you to bypass region restrictions and circumvent the walls Netflix have put up (because of licensing,censorship and other technical reasons) and have access to whatever content you want  something Netflix is clearly upset about.In a blog statement by Netflix Vice President of Content Delivery Architecture David Fullagar, he said that Netflix would continue to enforce content licensing according to geographical location. However, they did say that they were working on making all their content available to all their subscribers  something they anticipate being able to do.For now, though, theyre focusing on blocking proxies and ensuring that you can only access content from your own region. Although they didnt say exactly how or when they would block the proxies aside from a vague as technology continues to evolve and we are evolving with it line.One possible way we could see them doing it is locking your account by credit card. For example, if you wanted to use an American account, you would have to have an American credit card, likewise, if youre using a Malaysian credit card you can only access the Malaysian Netflix content. Although they could also take more drastic measures and force you to use your IC/identification numbers to register. Though we doubt it since it would cause some amount of hindrance to user experience. Either way, it looks like your proxy days are numbered.If you want to know more about Netflix in Malaysia, check out our list of five things you should know about Netflix Malaysia.[SOURCE, VIA]"
Rory Lee,ASUS ZenFone Zoom camera comparison: Does optical zoom really make a difference?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/16/asus-zenfone-zoom-camera-comparison-does-optical-zoom-really-make-a-difference/,,,2016-01-16,"ASUS recently launched the worlds thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphone, the ZenFone Zoom, here in Malaysia and the first question on everyones mind is: Whats the big deal? Now the word optical zoom may not be a term everyone recognises. Some of you might be thinking that your current smartphones can zoom jolly well, so why would you bother about this device?You see, the zoom commonly found on your smartphone camera is what people call digital zoom which essentially crops the image to a smaller frame and enlarges to make it seem like youre bringing the subject closer to you. No lens movement happens within the camera module. On the other hand, conventional DSLRs and their respective lenses use optical zoom which works when the different elements that make up a lens move around to refract light differently, bringing the image closer to you.The biggest difference though is that when you use digital zoom to zoom in on a subject, you lose quality, because you are no longer using the full image  rather youre only using a cropped fraction of it. Optical zoom then is the way to go if you want to zoom (but not with your feet) and you dont want to lose image quality at the same time.If the benefits are so great, why dont more manufacturers equip their smartphones with optical zoom? The biggest reason is size. With more than one element in your lens, the whole camera module tends to get pretty ginormous. Think Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoomor the Galaxy K Zoom. However, with ASUSs 13-megapixel camera on the ZenFone Zoom, they have used a special dual-periscope design to mount the camera horizontally across the back of the smartphone, letting them hide the camera bump with the ZenFones signature curved back.But, to say that this tiny lens array strapped to the back of a smartphone is on par with those on a DSLRs lens might be pushing it. In fact, we werent even that convinced this whole optical zoom smartphone thing would work very well. So, while we were at the launch event, we came up with the brilliant idea of pitting ASUSs camera-centric ZenFone Zoom against some of the best cameras in the market right now. And whaddya know, we conveniently had a Nexus 6P, a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ and an Apple iPhone 6s Plus with us at the time. Heres the camera zoom shootout youve been waiting for."

That was back when the iPad Pro was officially released and has seen many tech sites talk about the typing experience that Logitech offers.If you threw down some serious Ringgit on an iPad Pro, many have suggested this to be the best keyboard option (out of only two keyboards currently available). Its also more affordable than Apples own option which battles us. Apples version has keys that are covered by a nylon fabricwhile Logitechs is more robust (725 grams) and made out of plastic.The CREATE Keyboard case makes use of the dedicated Smart Connector on the iPad Pro for connecting the two together. Using this technology allows the keyboard to be thin and light as it doesnt require inbuilt power, drawing that from the Apple tablet it attaches to. This is similar to the technology on the Surface Pro 4.Typing on this keyboard, in theory, should be a good experience as it uses full-size 19mm keys with a key travel of 1.5mm. Each individual key is backlit ensuring you wont be lost when typing in low-light.Because it is backlit, youll have to keep in mind that itll draw more power and youll have to manually turn the backlighting off when youre using the iPad Pro while the keyboard is attached. However, it does auto wake and auto sleep when you shut the case, saving battery when doing so.On the keyboard itself, youll find an iOS shortcut keys thatll allow easy navigation through iOS 9. Some of the shortcuts include changing volume, play/pause for music and video, home button, search and etc. More special keys meanyoure less likely to touch the screen and thats fit nicely with Tim Cooks suggestion that the iPad Pro will replace a laptop  we dont think it will, not even close but at least, itll help his reasoning.Built in a way that makes it adjustable to two angles, users are allowed to orientate it in a manner that eases their interactions with the tablet: typing and viewing mode, as they refer to it. Logitech puts an MSRP price of RM 699 (w/ GST) and you can expect to find it from Bluelogic Enterprise Sdn Bhd and MCL Bhd.At the same time, Logitech also delivered the Focus a protective case with an integrated keyboard for the iPad Mini 4. A similar typing experience with plastic keys but with fewer keys. This keyboard also has iOS shortcuts and is capable of an adjustable viewing angle within its 50-degree range. You can find it at the same retailers mentioned earlier and go for an MSRP of RM 199 (w/ GST).
Both keyboards will be available in 3 colours: black, red or blue."

You have to juggle between innovating, designing, marketing and setting price points. So far, Sony has been on the short end of the stick but they were once in a very different position.This Japanese company used to be offer different designs and qualities in their smartphones. They once tried different things and were daring enough to explore angles that others didnt. We had the CyberShot and Walkman lines from the Sony Ericsson days. Then on after restructuring to be Sony they came up with their first device, the Xperia S as well as the Xperia Ion, their first 4G LTE smartphone.Change is necessary if they want tobe competitiveMoving with the times, their competitors have shaken up their own brands. Samsung has started to ditch plastic-backed smartphones, now instead making use of more metal and glass panels  as seen on their mid-range Galaxy A series. And as everyone has been noticing, Chinese brands like Xiaomi has begun making metal unibody smartphones. Even using the design on their most affordable device yet  the Redmi 3.Huawei, the other Chinese brandhas refined their methods and designs to great lengths, now putting great specs and better designs to the point of creating the premium Mate S. They also partnered with Google to make the flagshipNexus 6P.So what about Sony? Read on to find out about the Xperia Z5 Dual."

They aimed high with a range of 80 to 100 million devices but they fell slightly short last year. Still thats not too bad as they havent even started to enter Western markets.In a post on social site Weibo, Lin Bin posts how the company managed to sell 70 million devices just last year alone. Xiaomis reasoning for the less than stellar was because the result comes at the time that the Chinese market is rather saturated.Eventually, their domestic smartphone market started to slow and they had to compete against Huawei, who have been ramping up brand awareness internationally with appearances at CES 2016 and launches in Europe. Huawei also took to new heights being the first Chinese manufacturer to take a crack at a Nexus device, giving them an advertising opportunity for those whove never heard of them.Itll be hard for Xiaomi to replicate their own success from 2014, seeing the companys annual smartphone sales catapult by 226% from 2013. Playing with the big boys by starting to utilise metal in their smartphones will be a tough one. The jump from affordable and good to premium and worth the money is a long stretch.But at least, theyve already started by moving towards non-polycarbonate materials, looking at alternative operating systems and occasionally releasing more than one processor variant of a device to reach wider markets. If they maintain competitive prices, the brand could easily plaster themselves all over the world.Now its down to the consumers, who will have to start changing their mentality and accept that Chinese smartphones can be just as good as devices from US, South Korea and Japan. Once Xiaomi manages to find its way around Western markets then we might see their untapped potential start coming alive but theyll have to tweak the brands image slightly.In the light of this, we only have one question for co-founders Lei Jun and Lin Bin.Are you okay?In all honestly, we dont think the company has missed too many steps and hope to see them continue to improve in 2016. The Mi 5 coming in February should bring about greater things for Xiaomi and its only the beginning of the year.We think youre doing (better than) okay.Do share with us your thoughts on how Xiaomi can improve their products in the comments below.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

If youre worried that 13MP isnt enough, ASUS have included a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for up to 52-megapixels per photo.Besides that, the camera boasts a 5cm macro shot distance as well as a pro-style Manual mode. The front camera is a modest 5MP f/2.0-aperture, wide angle 88-degree lens with Pano Selfie.While the device itself has nice metal rails  an improvement over the plasticky ZenFone 2  the back is made of some kind of soft touch leather that ensures the phone is grippy even in one hand. Close to the dedicated shutter and video record button is a slight bump which helps with the ergonomics when youre shooting pictures with this device.This smartphone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUSs ZenUI skin on top.

To help the camera out in low light, the ZenFone Zoom comes with ASUS Pixel Master 2.0 technology which is renown for its low light and long exposure capabilities.If 13-megapixels isnt enough, ASUS have bundled a Super Resolution function into the camera which allows it to take gigantic 52-megapixel photos, by stitching four 13MP shots together for more detail and clarity. While the sample shots on display (taken by Peter Tan) looked rather impressive, we would have to fully test out the functions for ourselves before making a decision.Being a camera-centric phone, the smartphone comes with dedicated camera hardware buttons  a dedicated shutter and video record button  which were awesome and tactile. The device also has equally tactile dedicated zoom keys that can double as volume rockers when not in the camera app.Zooming in and out with the keys was pretty satisfying as the phone gives you a little buzz when it hits the maximum 3x optical zoom. We did notice that launching the camera from the shutter button (which you can do by holding it down) was a little slow (maybe 2-3) seconds. Besides that, the shutter speed and time between shots were not as snappy as something like an iPhone 6s or a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+.However, it does have a complete manual mode with full manual controls that can be easily accessed via a tap of the M button located to the top of the on-screen shutter button.What we were impressed with was the macro capabilities of this device. ASUS boasts a 5cm macro focal distance and from our brief testing, you could get pretty darn close to the subject and still focus with no problems.The front camera is an average 5MP f/2.0 unit with a wide-angle lens and support for Pano Selfie.For a better understanding of this devices cameras and what optical versus digital zoom really means, stay tuned for our camera comparison.Spec wise, the ZenFone Zoom isnt all that different from ASUS previous flagship, the ZenFone 2. It has an updated quad-core Intel Atom Z3590 processor clocked at 2.5GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable (via microSD up to 64GB) storage.The smartphone also comes running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS ZenUI running on top. Its a shame that it isnt a more updated version of Android but we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update. Connectivity wise, the device will have a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot and will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi.From our brief hands-on, though, the device handles itself quite well, not stuttering or lagging when switching between applications, then again with 4GB of RAM and a high-end Intel chip, this isnt really surprising.Being a premium phone, it is definitely built well. The nice rounded metal rails were fabulous to hold in the hand and the back curved nicely to fit in our palms. The camera unit is barely noticeable, letting you believe that it could just be a normal camera. Kudos to ASUS for hiding such a beast of a lens array.ASUS says that the leather on the back of the device is real leather, not some faux nonsense, and we were inclined to believe themuntil we took the rear panel off. But, whenwe held the panel by itself, we started to doubt their claims. That said, the stitching around the ergonomic hump is real as we could move the thread around.It felt flimsy and plasticky so be careful when you rip that baby off. The bump on the back to help ergonomics was interesting, to say the least, and we quite liked it since it helped a little with the ergonomics. But as most of us usually take photos with a certain finger positions (like pictured earlier), we didnt really notice it helping much with grip. What did feel nice were once again the metal rails and those fantastic buttons.ASUS also includes a wrist strap that attaches itself to the back of the device, which is a nice touch. As a whole it was fantastic to hold in the hand and it definitely feels like the premium price youre paying for.However, do note that from the devices on display, there was a difference between the front of the device between the black model and the white model. The black one will remind you of every other ZenFone model with that familiar chin, but the white one seems to have done away with the chin, instead moving the ASUS logo to the bottom of the device.The device is priced at RM2,099 and ASUS says that the device will be available locally at the end of January."

Tech Sina sat down with Lenovos Senior VP, Chen Xudong and the exec shared whats to come for the bat-wing logoed brand.It doesnt surprise us that the bridging of brands means that the Motorola profile will change to reflect the interest of Lenovo and Motorola  two brains in one head if you will  yet Lenovo will be the one wearing the pants in this relationship.He shared four big puzzle pieces and here they are:Those are some big bombs to drop so early in the year and comes during a recent period that has had many questions answered  the future of Motorola especially  which they clarified last week.Now well share Android Authoritys analysis of what 2016 will mean for Moto devices.Biometric securityThe manufacturer has flirted with the idea before  on the Nexus 6  thoughthey scrapped it towards the end. But it was once on the telco specific (AT&T) ATRIX 4G, albeit leaning towards Lenovos slide-type fingerprint sensors. We havent seen anything similar since then but since most smartphone makers are doing so, its time for Moto to do the same  itll even fit nicely in that rear dimple.Going biggerBased on their statement last week about Vibe and Moto devices, we couldve seen this coming. Moto will occupy the higher end and from what weve seen in Motorolas trend of devices getting bigger, its a clear no brainer. No Moto Es will exist once they start marketing the two ranges differently with entry devices be relegated to the Vibe name.Promise of design based on market needsMotorola devices of this generation arent ugly, in fact, they look pretty good. The dimple is a matter of opinion but since Lenovos CEO has positive impressions on how they look, it shouldnt warrant any big changes.Merging UIsWere not too happy about this. These days people usually buy a Motorola because its UI is almost stock and whatever they add turns out to be actually useful. Do you want them to return to the MOTOBLUR days? Google did them a favour after purchasing them, please leave that alone  we beg of you.A bulky skin would mean longer delays for updates and they wouldnt want that  surely irking existing users familiar with the current Moto.Final thoughtsIts likely that more information will be available as weve come to know that they like to contradict their older announcements with new ones. The next card they play will allow us to get a better picture of the whole 2016 master plan, we just hope the disruption is positive.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

Sense is now version 7 too with the ROM version listed as 6.14.707.1. Surely this is great news for One M8 owners and paves the way for more OEMs to get Marshmallow and all the goodies that come along with.The Taiwanese company appears to be one of the first few manufacturers that have managed to get the latest version of Android up and running on their devices. Though were not sure what other models will receive the update as theres no official statement from them yet.We received the tip from h_1_s that the HTC One M8 has received an OTA update earlier today; sharing with us the screenshot youll see after the break.To see whether your HTC has an updating waiting for you simply check manually by going to:Settings > About > SoftwareThe software update sizes in at 1.14GB and according to HTC, itll take an hour for the whole upgrading process to finish.Sense has been skimmed down a lot since its heavier days and the new update should probably further reduce the clutter  as promised by the twitter account of HTC USA  that promised those who bought HTCs A9 would receive Google SW updates within 15 days. Seems like their policy has in some way trickled down to their older devices as well with Marshmallow making its way down.If you need a refresher on what will be on Marshmallow, heres some things you can expect:Do note that images shown below are from a Nexus 6P, used as an example.App permissionsThose using HTC devices can now individually give permissions to certain apps and remove them without rendering these apps useless.Now on TapUsers can now pull information based on contextual data on their screens. E.g. a text message containing a movie title, holding down your home button will allow you to bring up Google cards related to the movie.DozeBattery optimisation is finally here and HTC users will benefit vastly from it. Marshmallow will allow your devices to go into a deep(er) sleep than usual, saving a lot of battery in the process.Dont expect Sense to look like a Vanilla carbon copy because theyll definitely maintain some distinctive qualities. Please share with us if youve managed to update your HTC devices, do let us know what model and be sure to pass along some screenshots too.

Alexander Wong,LG G5 to have a removable battery on a full unibody design?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/14/lg-g5-to-have-a-removable-battery-on-a-full-unibody-design/,"Android,HTC legend,LG,LG G5,LG G5 Battery,LG Mobile,MWC 2016,removable battery,smartphone","Android,LG,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-14,"LG is expected to put on a big show at MWC 2016 as they are likely to enveil their new 2016 flagship. The LG G4 was one of the last remaining flagships to feature a removable battery and an expandable microSD slot. This is a trend that is slowly diminishing as brands are moving towards a fully enclosed design for a better look and feel. The LG G5 is said to be following the same route but new information suggests that they wont be abandoning the needs of power users. The folks at CNet Korea has posted a render of what the new flagship could look like. Instead of a curvy shape as seen on the G Flex and G4 models, the new G5 will have a flatter design with round edges. Another radical change is the volume rocker and power buttons are now purportedly moved towards the sides. Despite having a full unibody design, the source also claims that the battery is still removable. How is this even possible? Apparently their engineers have made a mechanism that allows the bottom portion to be removed, giving you access to its battery. The lower end of the device will get a drawer-like design that helps to keep dust and water away. When we think of a full unibody design with a removable battery, we thought of the old HTC Legend that was released about 6 years ago. It had a sturdy body made from a single block of aluminum and the removable cap at the bottom gives you access to its SIM, microSD and removable battery. This was the time when HTC was at its peak. If the alleged LG G5 design is true, this is something interesting to look forward to next month. However, some LG fans might be disappointed if they are doing away with its signature rear-mounted volume and power buttons. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

We thought that nobody would be able to hold a candle to it, much less challenge it.Well, we were wrong because Lenovo came out of nowhere and swung a left hook right in the Redmi 3s face with their new budget smartphone.Affectionately named the Lemon 3, Lenovos new device sports a 5-inch 1080p full HD display  which is one up over the Redmi3s measly 720p HD panel. On the inside, it is powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon 616 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage.In terms of camera, the Lenovo Lemon 3 packs a 13-megapixel rear sensor and 5MP front camera combo. It also supports 4G LTE and dual-SIM functionality plus a 2,750 mAh battery all encased in a metallic body.Hoping to one-up other budget phones (as if it hasnt already), the smartphone will have a pair of Dolby Atmos speakers. The only unfortunate thing is that theyre rear facing, instead of front facing like their Vibe K4 Note that they announced earlier. Then again, for the price of RMB699 (around RM467) we cant really complain.Also, since its priced at that sweet spot of RMB699, Lenovo couldnt have made it more obvious that this Lemon 3 was designed to slay the Redmi 3. Odd isnt it that weve arrived at a point in time where there is such a thing as a budget flagship killer. All the better for consumers, though!The way we see it, your options are clear. Do you want a better screen plus a better set of speakers for a smaller battery, or do you want a massive battery with compromises in the other two departments. With that laser etched lattice-diamond-design-thing, we will give the Redmi 3 a slight edge for now in terms of build, but well have to hold them both before we make a decision.Currently, there is no information on availabilityoutside of China, but we will keep you posted if there are any updates.

Rory Lee,Soon Google Maps can guess where youre going and tell you how to get there faster,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/13/soon-google-maps-can-guess-where-youre-going-and-tell-you-how-to-get-there-faster/,"Driving Mode,google,Google Maps,Google Maps Driving Mode,Google Maps Driving Mode Malaysia,Google Maps Driving Mode update,Google Maps Malaysia,google maps navigation,Google Maps Update,Google Maps v9.19,navigation","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-13,"Im sure that if youve travelled to work by car for some period of time, you would know most (if not all) of the logical routes to your office. The only reason we switch on navigation apps (like Waze) in the morning is to find out which is the least congested route, but doing so every morning, having to manually set your location each time can be rather cumbersome.So what if you dont want to have to set your location each morning but still want to find out which is the least congested/fastest way to get to work on time? Google Maps has the answer.With the continuous development of Waze, it has become a fantastic navigation app and I personally use it over Google Maps, less because I feel that it is a better navigation app that Maps (which I dont) and more because of its nifty, user-friendly features.Features like knowing where youre going based on your history  for example, if you leave for work at 9 AM a few days in a row the app will suggest work the next time you fire it up at around the same time of day  as well as changing your route on the fly based on the changing traffic.That said, I do feel that the application updates the routes rather slowly (especially when it comes to congestion) and the navigation isnt as crisp and informative as Google Maps. PlusI really hate the way it looks and how slow it is to launch and calculate routes.With Google Maps v9.19 though, it seems that there is an alternative to that. With the acquisition of Waze by the search engine giant, Google has slowly integrated more and more of Wazes features into their own navigation app. Now, along with a whole host of interesting new things, Google Maps has support for Driving Mode  but youll have to activate it first.Driving Mode isnt what you think it means. It doesnt convert your phone into a landscape screen that has gigantic buttons for doing simple tasks to like answering your phone calls so you wont get distracted on the road. Instead, it guesses (based on your history) where youre going and it gives you live updates on the traffic situation as well as the fastest routes to your destination, without the need for you to set a location beforehand.However, thanks to the comments section, users have pointed out that signing out and signing into Maps itself will trigger the feature and unlock the additional options. From there, simply hit Add Driving shortcut and you can access this awesome new feature.Once in you will be greeted with the new interface that shows you multicoloured roads (much like Waze) with different colours indicating different levels of congestion. You can then begin your journey or tap the screen once to bring down the menu and set your destination.Click to enlarge[SOURCE]"

More metal, thats the trend that Samsung looks to impose on their 2016 version(s) of the Galaxy A lineup. Whether youre going to be loving all that metal with their accompanying specs is a whole other story but theyve maintained microSD slots across all three smartphones  we know you wanted to hear that.Click to enlarge imageMainly playing in the low-to-midrange leagues, the darling of Korea have started to look to more precious materials as Chinese brands have managed to out metal devices at the same price range.Since theyre playing catch up in the race of affordable metal smartphones heres what the Galaxy A series is up against in their similar indicative price-points (based on last years Malaysian pricing):Thats a whole lot of competition if you ask us. Regarding specs heres what youll pay for the Galaxy A3  beginning with the entry-level device, youre getting a 4.7-inch HD (1280 x 720) Super AMOLED display. Itll have a 1.5GHz quad-core processor buried inside its metal together with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. This smartphone will also have a MicroSD slot as mentioned earlier, arrive with a 2,300 mAh battery and be equipped with a Dual-SIM 4G LTE (Cat.4) slot. Youll also find 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and charge through microUSB.Moving to the middle child, this smartphone has slightly bigger 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution Super AMOLED screen. Similarly, the processor gets upped to an Octa-core 1.6GHz processor coupled with 2GB of RAM and the same 16GB of internal storage (still expandable). Keeping it powered will be a 2,900 mAh battery that has fast charging abilities.Connectivity options get an upgrade too with Cat 6 LTE capabilities in its Dual-SIM slots. Itll have the same WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC features and the charging port is still microUSB. But at this price point, the home button will act as a fingerprint scanner.On the top of the A series is the Galaxy A7 and deservingly so with its bigger 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution Super AMOLED panel. Oddly, the Octa-core processor is still clocked to 1.6GHz but gets its RAM bumped up to 3GB. Internal storage again stays the same at 16GB but youll have that microSD slot if you want to expand it up to 128GB.This device also has Dual-SIM capabilities and the same connectivity options as the A5. But the battery is a larger 3,300 mAh cell to make up for the larger screen, still with fast charging. The Galaxy A7 also has a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay.Its refreshing to see that a big name like Samsung is starting to adjust itself to markets but in a market that requires you to adapt or perish, that makes a whole lot of sense. Only thing the specs of the three devices dont seem to match up to their competition in respective brackets.In spite of that, could you see yourself owning any of the Galaxy A series devices? Or are you going to splash a more money on the anticipated Galaxy S7(s) that are to arrive after MWC 2016? Do let us know in the comments below!"

In an effort to dispel its cheap image, the Chinese smartphone maker is adding a touch of luxury by switching from plastic to metal in their latest models. The bigger Redmi Note 3 came as a surprise, launching just months after it unveiled the Redmi Note 2. With more competition jumping into the affordable segment, Xiaomi aims to defend its spot with its latest Redmi 3 (not to be confused with the Redmi Note 3). Looking at the spec sheet alone, youll be amazed that this will be their cheapest phone for 2016. The hardware is a class above and the build of the phone is something you wouldnt expect at bargain basement price. Here are 5 reasons why this is the best smartphone to get for less than RM600. The Redmi 3 packs a massive 4,100mAh capacity battery and thats unheard of for an entry-level device. In fact, it is the biggest they have ever fitted on a Xiaomi smartphone. As comparison, its larger brother, the Redmi Note 2 has a 3,060mAh capacity while the latest Redmi Note 3 packs a 4,000mAh unit. On paper, this should give you an all day battery life and you wont need to lug a power bank around for most users."

This is due to blue light emitted from digital screens that can cause eye fatigue. This could even cause eyesight impairment in the long run.With the upcoming iOS 9.3 update for the iPhone and iPad, Apple wants you to sleep better at night with its new Night Shift feature. According to Apple, Night Shift aims to make it easier for you to sleep by making the display more pleasant to your eyes. Using your devices time and GPS, it will know when it is sunset and would gradually change the display to show warmer colours, cutting down on blue light emission. As a result, it would help to increase melatonin production naturally, a vital component to get better sleep at night. Of course, this isnt entirely new. Most smartphones from China including Xiaomi, OPPO, Huawei and BenQ have their own low blue light or reading mode that does the same thing. The only difference is that Apple is making it automatic based on your current time.  Theres no mention if theres an option to turn it off, but we are sure it would be important for those actually working night shifts. Apart from this low blue light mode, the new iOS 9.3 update will also introduce a multi-user feature for the iPad. This would allow several people to share a single device and the experience will be customised based on their individual profiles. Unfortunately, this appears to be catered for schools and we are not sure if they would extend this to end users as well. On top of that, the native Notes app can be secured with your fingerprints.

And since there are many more people who dont own luxury cars versus people who do, car branded accessories are popping up everywhere. Whats worse is that these accessories are usually just overpriced versions of otherwise normal products. Slap a Rolls Royce logo on a microwave and it will probably be worth 10 times more.Bentley has the same idea, and working with luxury phone manufacturer Vertu, theyve smacked a Bentley badge on a USD9,900 (around RM43,600) phone to create the Vertu Signature Touch for Bentley. My bank account isnt ready for this.Vertu is renown for being the manufacturer of ultra-premium phones that usually prioritise form over function. But with their latest device, the Signature Touch, theyve managed to combine the two aspects as it packs an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and 4GB of RAM with 64GB of internalstorage under that pretty stitched exterior.The Signature Touch also has a 5.2 1080p full HD display with sapphire crystal glass. It also sports a 21MP rear shooter with PDAF for their rear camera while the front will have a 2.1MP selfie camera. Powering the device is a 3,100 mAh battery.So whats the difference between this Signature Touch for Bentley versus the regular Signature Touch? Well, it has a 3D Bentley logo; two-tone Beluga and Hotspur Bentley leather with Hotspur stitching. Besides that,the Signature Touch for Bentley also features knurled side keys, a unique pillow rail and sound bar.I know right? Try explaining why this phone is special without sounding pretentious.Other than the potentially absurd price tag, there really is nothing too special about this smartphone that makes it a better phone than a similar flagship. It even runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop. I honestly think it looks really ugly, unnecessarily tacky and frankly quite ah beng(there is really no English word for ah beng)too.Id like to say that this automobile-branded-regular-product-fad has gone on for way too long and things are getting out of control so we should all refrain from buying them. But, I know that somewhere out there, there is a guy sitting in his million ringgit car thinking: Hmm, if only I had a smartphone that costs about the same as a Myvi to match my Bentley.[SOURCE, VIA]"

As teased previously, the OPPO F series is their new mid-range smartphone lineup that promises premium photography  at a reasonable price. In terms of appearance, it looks like an improved version of its OPPO R7 series with some minor tweaks on the unibody metal design. It resembles closely with the R7 Lite and it gets a couple of upgrades in the hardware department.At the front, the OPPO F1 gets a compact-sized 5 display that does a HD 720 resolution of 1280720. Powering the processor is an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 Octa-Core unit, similar to the newly announced Redmi 3, and it gets 3GB of RAM for all your multi-tasking needs. On-board theres 16GB of storage which can be expanded to 128GB extra with microSD. This is a Dual-SIM device that accepts a MicroSIM and Nano-SIM, but you would lose a slot if you need to use a microSD card. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP f/2.2 main camera with PDAF and it is assisted with a single LED flash. Meanwhile, the front gets an 8MP f/2.0 shooter with built-on beautification features for the perfect selfie. Keeping the lights on is a 2,500mAh battery which is slightly more than the OPPO R7 Lite and R7 models. Out of the box, the F1 runs on ColorOS 2.1 thats based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. In Vietnam, the OPPO F1 is priced at 6,490,000 Dong, which is about RM1,270 if converted directly. As an earlybird bonus, the first 1,500 buyers will get a pair of iLike Bluetooth headset thrown in for free. The OPPO F1 is now available in Gold and we expect them to release a Rose Gold version later on. With Malaysia as a key market, they are likely to release the OPPO F1 here very soon.

Similar to Samsungs tradition, LG is avoiding the busy MWC announcement week by holding the event a day earlier on 21st February. Could this be their new LG G5 flagship?The invitation doesnt show much except for a Jack in a box and a caption Play Begins. This suggests that it could be a multimedia or a gaming powerhouse. Perhaps a new smartphone with front facing speakers? We can only hope. Their last flagship device, the LG V10 is quite an impressive smartphone with dual screens and dual front facing cameras.  For the new LG G5, speculations have pointed towards a unibody metal design, which means there probably wont be a removable battery and microSD slot. The screen is purported to be a more compact 5.3 incher with Quad HD resolution and it is likely to run on Qualcomms latest Snapdragon 820 processor with 3GB of RAM. The secondary ticker display could be carried over to this new G5 flagship and the rear might come with a dual camera setup for extra depth of field features. It was also rumoured that LG might introduce a new MagicSlot that allow expansion of additional accessories. You can read up more on what to expect over here.Nevertheless, we expect to see more leaks in the coming weeks leading up to the main event. Can LG beat Samsung in the flagship game this year?

If youre looking for a smartwatch, you might want to wait for whats coming up next.The ASUS ZenWatch 2 was spotted recently on SIRIM. In most cases, if a device gets the certification green light, we can expect it to hit the Malaysian market very soon. Announced middle of last year, the ZenWatch 2 is their 2nd generation smart watch that runs on Android Wear. To suit different wrists, it will come in two display sizes  1.63 and 1.45. The front uses Super AMOLED display pushing a modest 280280 pixels resolution and it is protected by a 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It is also water resistant with IP67 rating and the case is made of durable stainless steel. In terms of design, it looks quite similar to its first ZenWatch but it gets an extra button at the sides thats designed to look like a crown. The ZenWatch 2 comes in an array of case colours and straps of various materials. For a touch of exclusivity, theres even a Swarovski edition strap with studded cyrstals. As it uses Android Wear, you get access of apps, watchfaces and you can customised your own design with the ASUS FaceDesigner app. Charging the ZenWatch 2 is done via a magnetic cable that snaps underneath the watch case.

This is to facilitate the push towards Microsofts new operating system, Windows 10. When we say terminate, we dont mean that your Windows 8 machine will just up and die or stop working straight away, its just that Windows 8 wont receive updates, security fixes and bug fixes it used to get.If you are running on Windows 8 though, dont worry because there is a simple way around this issue.Besides the obvious upgrade to Windows 10 being one of the solutions, Windows 8 users can also upgrade to Windows 8.1, which based on their lifecycle fact sheet, will continue to receive updates for two more years until January 9, 2018. If youve read the horror stories of Windows 10s ominous privacy terms and want to avoid such dangers by staying on an older version of Windows, you can now do so.As you can see, today also marks the end of Windows 7 service Pack 1s mainstream support  but dont worry you will still continue to receive security updates as extended support will go all the way to January 14, 2020. All you lose is the mainstream support which includes free incident support, warranty claims and fixes for non-security and security bugs, plus design changes and feature requests. Based on statistics published by Tech Crunch, 2-3% of PCs (30-40 million devices) are still running on Windows 8, while Windows 7 is said to currently be in use on 56.26% of global PCs.Why is it important to keep your system updated and within Microsofts support lifecycle? Well, the first and most obvious reason is security. As operating systems lose their security updates, they become vulnerable to new malware and potential attacks, which puts your information as well as your system at risk. Microsoft, via updates, patches these new vulnerabilities when they come up so that these exploitable holes are fixed. Once that support ends, you lose all protection against future vulnerabilities.Besides Windows 8, Microsoft is also terminating support for older versions of IE, urging users to upgrade either to IE 11 or Microsofts new Edge browser. Ive personally never been a fan of IE because of how messy the interface is and how clunky it makes browsing feel, so it comes as a surprise to me that 20% of the desktop web browser market still uses the older versions of IE (8, 9, 10) as their daily driver. Unfortunately for those people, they will have to migrate to either the new IE 11, Microsoft Edge, or other third party browsers like Chrome or Firefox, or else they would be facing security vulnerabilities when browsing the web.Microsoft Edge, the built-in browser on Windows 10, promised much in terms of functionality and performance. Things like extensions were supposed to come to Edge to keep it up to par with browsers like Googles Chrome but til this day, there is still no sign of those extensions anywhere. I dont know about you guys but I definitely need my extensions.Killing off old software is nothing new, and Iwelcome it because not only does it allow software developers to focus on their latest and greatest product, it also allows them to free up valuable resources to focus on new projects. Resources that would otherwise go to updating and patching old software can now be redirected towards either new software or the improvement of current software.[SOURCE, 2, IMAGE SOURCE]"

Weve already seen devices that give us psychic abilities, keep us safe, and help us hear better. The future looks great and these wearables will enable us to do things we never thought possible. But what about our feelings? Our mental state and emotional wellbeing? While slaving away trying to create a technologically able world have we forgotten a key aspect of living?Our happiness.A wearable fromSentio Solutions wants to refocus efforts and tackle our feelings. They (and I quote) want you to Own your emotions. Hack happiness. We all deserve to be happy after all.Mood rings were a big fad back in the 70s and it has taken four decades before we this company realised that the 70s werent all about afros and protests; to them, it was about emotional intelligence or EQ. If you havent heard of emotional intelligence, its basically our ability (or lack thereof) to understand and recognise emotions, allowing us to differentiate and label what we feel, before using it to think and behave appropriately.Back to the present, Feel will be todays technological equivalent of the mood-ring. Much like other wearables, itll connect to your smartphone through Bluetooth and via the companion app, youll get real-time stats on your current emotional state.Four sensors inside the wristband allow Feel to measure and track skin temperature, blood volume pulse and galvanic skin response (tracking sweat through your skin). A whole load of gibberish to us but well just nod for the name of science.The wearable looks like an adjustable rubber bracelet with sensors along its sleek surface. Itll collect biometric readings coupled with movement tracking to gauge activity levels; then on, itll gather the data and illustrate it in the form of a cool graph.Looking at the visualisation, youll get to see when your stress levels peaked and what your moods were like throughout the day. Itll all be personalised too, in their wellness programme that (hopefully) will allow you to be happier and constantly stay focused towards your emotional goals.Feel and its app will work hand in hand to give suggestions on how users can mediate stress and improve overall emotions  thatll include breathing and meditation based exercises to bring you back to Earth. The app will also recommend you to laugh more or blow off some steam by exercising.CEO George Eleftheriou shared with Mashable that the wristband will be really helpful while battling traffic; snapping the user out of their rage by vibrating suddenly on their wrist. He claims that vibration will help calm the user  were not sure if this was backed by science.Those interested can expect Feel to go on pre-order in Spring 2016, with an estimated shipping and store availability in December. The wearable will come in four colours: White, Black, Turquoise and fire Red. Once in stores, itll go for US$ 199 (RM 872.44) but during the pre-order period, itll cost US$ 149 (RM 654.27).[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

Sporting a metal unibody and a massive 4,100 mAh battery, the device looks be a strong contender in the budget end of the smartphone market.The device will feature a 5 720p HD display with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 processor coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage running MIUI 7 out of the box. Thats bordering on mid-range territory.It will also have a hybrid SIM setup where users can choose to either run dual SIM or one SIM and a microSD card (up to 128GB) for more storage. One of its strongest selling points is the massive 4,100 mAh battery which Xiaomi says will give you an 80% improvement in talk time duration compared to its predecessor. Despite all that extra battery capacity though, it is thinner than the Redmi 2, coming in at just 8.5mm and weighing only 144g. Besides that the battery also supports 5V/2A fast charging so you can top it up in a jiffy.All of the internals will be housed inside a full-metal body  a first for the Redmi line  that has an all-new lattice design made up of 4,166 stars woven together to reflect an arrangement of diamonds. From the images, it certainly looks pretty good.Camera wise, the device will sport a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear shooter with phase detection autofocus (PDAF) which Xiaomi quotes will give you a fast autofocus time of 0.1 seconds. Selfies, on the other hand, will be taken care of by a 5MP f/2.2 snapper at the front.The Redmi3 will be available in three fashion colours  fashion gold, fashion silver and fashion grey  plus a classic gold colour and will be priced at RMB699 (around RM470), which is the same price in RMB as the Redmi 2 before it. It will go on sale in China tomorrow (12 January 2016) on Mi.com and Tmall. The device is already on display at Mi.coms product page.We do hope that this device will come to Malaysia within the next few months which has been the trend for Xiaomi devices. Perhaps this will come with its bigger brother the Redmi Note 3? What do you think of this all-metal budget device?"

The images gave us a look at the front of the device but we never got to see the back of it.Now, information has surfaced that suggests the new flagship device could feature two different variants sporting different specs and different back panels.Xiaomi is no stranger to bold choices when it comes to their products. Look at their Redmi Note series where the Redmi Note 2 and the Redmi Note 3 were wildly different  one had a full metal body and a fingerprint scanner  yet they were both launched only two months apart.Would it really surprise you then that they would do something as radical as having two different back panel/constructions on their upcoming flagship device?Well if it comes true that will definitely still surprise me.Of the two devices, the first one is purported to have curved 2.5D glass at the front and the back of the device with a metal frame. Think Samsung Galaxy S6 orGalaxy Note5.This variant is also supposed to feature a 1080p full HD resolution display with the possibility of having 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.On the other hand, the supposed second phone is said to feature an all-metal design  that means full-metal rear housing instead of curved 2.5D glass. Additionally, the device is said to have a higher QHD 2K resolution display and it could possibly house the 4GB RAM/64GB internal storage variant.Other than that, both devices should be identical  sporting a Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a suggested screen size that can range from 5 to 5.2-inches. The smartphone is also said to have a 3,600 mAh battery and become official by January 21, though sales are only expected to start on February 8.Of course, this is all just guess work based on rumours at this point and for all we know it could be the other way around. That said, this isnt the first time Xiaomi have done two versions of the same device as the Mi Note and Mi Note Pro are essentially the same device except for the fact that the Pro variant has a more powerful processor plus more RAM and a higher resolution screen.If these rumours of the Mi 5 are true though, it would be the first time that the Chinese company have gone with two completely different back constructions on a phone. So, take this with a grain of salt.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Thus lies the subjectivity of it all but when you have a majority of people who feel that your attempt is a half-hearted one, prepare for the worse  especially when a fan releases a concept and it makes your (in this case Microsoft/Windows) UI look silly.Refining Windows 10 Mobile by tackling its flaws, the concept takes a full swipe at what Microsoft outed. Redesigning the action centre, start screen and Windows 10 Store, designer Jobs Robson makes Windows look nice again.Changing out those bland coloured tiles for a more uniformed frosted glass effect to the operating system, Robson uses familiar elements that were found much earlier on Windows 7 and now seen again on desktop-based Windows systems.Utilising spacing better on Windows 10 Mobile devices, he makes some apps freely transform based on unallocated space on screens.People in the comment sections have gone off on Microsoft, saying that its shameful that their own designers arent capable of putting something like this out. Adding that Jobson should be hired and allowed to actually put this concept to work.While their Surface line has been relatively successful, their mobile division has lacked some gusto. We felt that the latest Lumia950s, were boring and there was a high drop in quality in terms of the polycarbonate case. Apps were slow and the OS was buggy when switching between apps and menus.Our full rundown of the Lumia 950 and 950 XL can be found here.Microsoft has even delayed Windows 10 Mobile on older devices, pointing us to think that theyve dropped the ball on the operating system. This concept could offer a lending hand but only in terms of looks, they still have a lot to do in terms of optimisation and functionality.I for one think that (this) Jobs deserves a cookie. There would be a high possibility that a Windows phone would be in my pocket if the UI looked like this. You can check out his other work here.What looks good is subjective but do you think that the concept looks better than what Microsoft originally put out?

As weve covered stories before about small modular smartphones or modular phone cases, we thought itd be fitting to follow up with a bigger modular device  a TV.Yup, Samsung have come up with a modular TV that can split into several different parts and dance around your wall like something youd find in a bachelor pad from the future. If you cant wrap your head around what Im talking about, take a look at this short clip by Gizmodo:Pretty freaking cool. However, Mashables Pete Pachal does note that while all the moving around is cool and stuff, when the screens do come together, he could see the seams between the displays which we found pretty disappointing. Then again this is relatively new tech so there are plenty of kinks to work out.Another TV that Samsung had on display showcased the ability for the TV to change its aspect ratios with the modular technology. The display could rotate two sides of the screen to switch it from a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 4:3 aspect ratio in seconds. This means you can use up all of those valuable pixels for either of the popular aspect ratios, eliminating those annoying black bars. Its pretty cool but once again Pete noted that the seam was visible.One final modular TV on display, however, showcased what is realistically the closest to a completed product  a massive 170 wall TV that is made up of several smaller panels. Mashable notes that this is perhaps the most practical use of the modular technology, especially since the seams were not visible.Not only does it allow manufacturers to push the TVs size to even more ridiculous proportions, Mashable notes that it also makes these monstrous TVs easier to ship because movers can break down a huge set to smaller screens.Thats cool and all but we can think of one more way to utilise these modular panels. Assuming theyre easy to remove and hot swap, parents could easily remove a section of the TV to prevent their kids from watching it when theyre being grounded or during their study sessions. In fact, you could probably remove one panel and bring it along with you on holiday to discourage thieves from nicking your precious television. Then again theyd have to have a pretty sizable moving truck to be able to ship a 170 television in the first place.Either way, as all modular things usually are, the possibilities are almost endless. What do you guys think of a modular TV? Can you think of any other useful things it can bring to the table that your current TV set cant? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE, 2]"

Then again nothing is truly invented until Apple does it right?Now it seems that Apple is reinventing the smartphone by removing the headphone jack. Whether they actually choose to label it as such remains to be seen, but this bold design choice by the Cupertino company doesnt seem to be going down well with at least 200,000 of their loyal fanbase. Well, to pacify the angry mob, Apples got the AirPods for you  at least we think thats what theyre going to be called.
Motorola HintBased on 9to5Macs article, the AirPods looks to be exactlywhat the name suggests  air versions of Apples EarPods completely wireless earbud headphones. Likely bearing a physical resemblance to the Motorola Hint, these new headphones are co-developed with Beats Electronics (which Apple acquired awhile back) and are designed to be compatible with the new iPhone 7 that is rumoured to be ditching the 3.5mm jack altogether.Thats not to say the EarPods will just die off, no, the wired EarPods are expected to be connected via the Lightning connector, a feature that has been included in iOS since 2014. The AirPods on the other hand, are expected to be sold separately as a premiumupgrade to the wired in-ear headphones.9to5Mac also suspects that these earbud headphones will feature a noise-cancelling microphone system for phone calls and communication with Siri even without Apples in-line microphone and remote. It would make sense, after all, theyre supposed to be built for a phone so it wouldnt make much sense if you couldnt make calls on them.These AirPods are suspected to come with a carrying case that will charge your wireless headphones when youre not using them. Without which 9to5Mac estimates the headphones battery life at just under 4 hours on a single charge. These AirPods could also be port-less requiring you to charge them in that case.Ditching the 3.5mm jack is nothing new in the mobile phone industry, even Oppo has done it with their uber-thin R5. While Apples decision could be driven by the fact that they want to make the iPhone 7 thinner, it could also be because  with all these waterproof iPhone rumours floating about  having a 3.5mm jack would mean another headache when trying to make the device waterproof.When the original iPhone came out right until the iPhone 4s, the headphone jack was located at the top of the device. Since the iPhone 5s inception, however, the 3.5mm jack has transferred to the bottom, a trend that has carried on even to the iPhone 6s of today.Apple isnt a stranger to changing things up with their line of products; removing the optical drives from most of their computer devices was one move, changing the headphone jack placements is another. When they made the first move on the iPhone 5, it was because it apparently made more sense to have all your cables sticking out on one end of the device. People were also more inclined to placing their devices head first into their pockets  something I agree with.With their upcoming iPhone 7, Apple is looking to mix things up even more  design wise  with a waterproof body made out of a new material and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, opting instead to stick with either a Lightning port or a wireless Bluetooth solution. The thing is, wireless devices run on battery, and if youre already charging your smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, tablet and over-ear headphones, do you really want to charge your earbuds too?The worst part? Having to charge your earbuds are just the tip of the iceberg. At first, Apple locks you within their app ecosystem. Then they dont allow you to use third-party ports and connectors. Now, they dont even want you to use third-party headphones, forcing you to stick with their proprietary ones. What about those of us who have bought a solid set of headphones with a 3.5mm jack? Are we forced to use an adapter?Apple has always made some beautiful devices, with gorgeous fit and finishes, but ever since they launched their rendition of a battery case,were a little worried about the new iPhone. Maybe the Smart Battery Case was a dud, the ugly apple pie you hide from your guests when they come over for dinner. A lazy oversight. For Apples sake, we sure hope so.[SOURCE]"

And the only thing stopping it is well you know what. Anyway, while it still hasnt been considered illegal in some states in Malaysia, lets take a look at the one and only hookah-like smartphone.Phubbers who love vaping can now finally put two and two together, making the Vaporcade Jupiter a novelty thats worth trying  the Verge seems to think so at least when they tried it out at CES 2016. This takes the cake in a time that has most smartphone manufacturers adding features likes fingerprint sensors, dual-cameras, and even ticker displays. But you can be sure that they wont even consider adding vape modules to their devices.Vaporcade wants to go against the grain and fit the niche that theyve created  cellular vaping. Their first smartphone is called the Jupiter IO 3: a 3G device goes for US$ 299 (RM 1317.11). The smartphone in question will run Android KitKat 4.4  dated but then again youre buying it to vape not to have the best smartphone.Itll run for 16 hours (smartphone only) with its two batteries  thats shared to power both the phone and vape. Vaporcade intends to release a 4G model as well but thats yet to be announced. Bear in mind the amount stated above doesnt include the Shuttle  a pop on module that attaches on the top of the smartphone  those cost US$ 14.99 (RM 66.07).Vaporcade claims that the device has already passed FCC certification but well have to see what hurdles they have to jump if youre ever expected to find the Jupiter in Malaysia.We dont condone harming your body and the effects of vaping are still up in the air but its crazy to think they managed to put this on a smartphone.

While there were some who liked it, everyone in our office was not impressed with their flagship. It was a little sluggish and for a device rated so highly on DxOMark, we were quite disappointed with the camera.With a device that left much to be desired and a quiet CES 2016 showing, Sony fans must be hungry for something cool to come out of the tech giant. Well, we dont have their new flagship for you, but heres a pretty pink-gold (rose gold? It could just be gold with bad white balance/me being a little colour blind) Sony device.It appears all of Sonys quietness hasnt stopped someone from leaking what looks to be the Xperia C6  sporting a sexy rounded bezel-less design with Sonys trademark camera-shutter-esque power button. If youve been paying attention to futuristic sci-fi movies, youll know that bezel-less is the way to go and we were glad Sony are going one step further from the near bezel-less display that appeared on the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra from last year.That said, this doesnt look like a C6 Ultra simply because it looks relatively small in what were assuming is the leaksters hands. Unless of course he/she has gargantuan hands. Either way, if we look at the devices designs, the good looks weve grown accustomed to in a Sony device are all mostly apparent with that thin body and the familiar shape. The edges are rounded like the Xperia C5 Ultra which should make it nicer to hold than the Xperia Z5though it does seem that the device still has a flat back.There is also a distinct lack of front-facing speakers (aw man) despite all that chin and forehead sony are giving it. Whats a little unnerving is that the back panel of this device seems to be peeling off  which we hope wont be a problem on the finished product. Sony devices have had pretty good build quality after all.The Xperia C6 is rumoured to sport a 5.5 full HD display up front, with a 2.0GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor running on the inside. Besides that, there isnt much information left about the device itself. I guess well have to wait for the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year to (hopefully) find out more.Since its pink though, it could potentially tie in with an upcoming pink Sony device that the company has been endlessly teasing on their Instagram account, With, nine images teased thus far, this devices reveal has been set for 12 January 2016 and the folks over at Xperia Blog reckon it isnt a pink Xperia Z5.Hype?UPDATE: The new Pink smartphone from Sony is a Xperia Z5.

This joins its current colours of Black, White, Gold and Green, and we are glad Sony Mobile isnt calling it Rose Gold. Under the hood, the pink colour Xperia Z5 has the same specs as the existing models. The front gets a 5.2 Full HD screen thats flanked by a pair of stereo speakers. Under the hood, it gets an Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM and it comes with 32GB of on-board storage. It still accepts external expansion via microSD up to 200GB. The home button now is flush with its metal frame and it also doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. For imaging, it packs its newest 23MP f/2.0 camera with PDAF which claims to be the best camera on a smartphone as rated by DXOmark. When we compared its camera to other flagships, it doesnt seem to be the case but it performs spectacularly well in videos despite not having an Optical Image Stabiliser. The Xperia Z5 shoot videos up to 4K with Steadyshot and it is further enhanced by Intelligent Active mode. For selfies it gets a front-facing 5.1MP shooter that supports HDR and Full HD videos. Powering the device is a 2,900mAh capacity battery which is rated to last up to 2 days on a single charge. Like its previous Xperia Z series, it is also water and dust resistant with IP68 even with its new cap-less microUSB design. According to the lead designer, picking a new colour for the Xperia Z5 is a detailed process on its on. Apparently it is a challenge to find the right shade of pink that would work well with its frosted glass and aluminium frame. They researched various sources from Sakura cherry blossom to the colours of the sky during a sunset. As a result, they finally settled on a light dusky pink that complements its current Xperia Z5 colour palette. Is this the pink phone worth waiting for?[ SOURCE ]"

If youre wealthy enough to splurge on multiple Apple Watches, switching from one watch to another can be a pain in the butt.Not too worry as the Cupertino company understands what Apple Watch aficionados have to go through and heres what you can expect with the upcoming watchOS 2.2. With the new software update, users would be able to pair more than one Apple Watch on the same iPhone. This gives you the opportunity to connect an Apple Watch Sport and an Apple Watch Edition to your phone, and you can switch between them without resetting and repairing the watch. This leads to a possibility that Apple is preparing to launch its new Apple Watch 2, and it would help existing Apple Watch owners to keep both timepieces in use. Another speculation is that Apple might introduce a fitness band and it works hand in hand with the Watch.watchOS 2.2 also brings other notable changes as well. The built-in maps will let you run searches and points of information under glance. So in theory if youre wondering what to do at a location, this feature would help to recommend cafes, restaurants and shops near you. For fitness buffs, the watch will display more detailed information on your workout including active energy burned, plus a full summary on time spent on exercising and standing. At the moment, watchOS 2.2 is only rolled out to developers and it shouldnt take too long for them to release this to all Apple Watch users.The Apple Watch is currently priced between RM1,599 to RM80,000 in Malaysia.

Arif Lee,Say hello to the first solar-powered 4K action camera,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/say-hello-to-the-first-solar-powered-4k-action-camera/,"4K action camera,4K camera,Action Camera,Activeon,Activeon camera,Activeon Solar X action camera,Activeon Solar X camera,camera technology,CES 2016,Consumer Electronics Show 2016,solar powered action camera,solar powered camera,solar technology,Solar X","Cool stuff,Technologies",2016-01-08,"Humans (us included) are slowly realising that the finite resources around us are dwindling away but we can expect the sun to outlast our generation. The Sun, a massive star that sits in the center of the solar system; once considered a deity to some, it has always played a huge part in our lives  powering our electronics included.Solar panels have been here, there and everywhere but none of them have been mounted to an action camera. Or rather someone didnt think of it yet. Somewhat bizarre if you consider the main flaw of something so small  battery life  usually running out of juice in a couple of hours. You wont have to worry about that anymore asActiveonhas just announced its solar-powered 4K action camera.Aptly named the Solar X, this is an action camera that uses the sun to power itself. Besides having solar capabilities and being relatively the same size as a GoPro, this action cam comes with a 16-megapixel CMOS sensor at an aperture of f/2.4. If you ever want to take stills with it, itll manage quick snaps up to 6 frames per second.Able to shoot in 4K resolution, this camera has a 2-inch touchscreen for its menu options and checking your content. Itll also support WiFi data transfers to Android and iOS devices; you can choose to use the mini HDMI port instead if you like.Standalone, itll deliver two hours of battery life, numbers that dont amaze us by much but when you strap on its X Station solar panels, youll get an additional four hours of recording time. And by chance youre having a long shooting day, fully recharging the camera using the sun will only take an hour or 80% in just half an hour with its Burst Speed Charging.Wed like to see more companies make use of solar power, even if they arent making action cameras. After all, soon enough our Earth will eventually be too environmentally imbalanced for us to live comfortably with global warming already taking place. Dont bother telling yourself otherwise, this theory is legit as can be. Weve already seen the Paris Agreement take place last year and we can only hope nations of the world can curb CO2 emissions.Before we ramble on any longer, filmmakers will have to wait until March before they can pick up the Solar X that goes for US$ 450 (RM 1,969). Thinking about it, this action camera could probably be used as a car dash cam as well. Malaysia has sunny days year around, so this is a no-brainer; more so when itll technically always be powered.When it arrives itll be compatible with 40 add-on accessories that include mounts, grips, selfie sticks, and straps; underwater goggles and a WiFi remote too. Adding that all up, itll probably cost a fair bit but the future is all about renewable energy; a fair price to save the Earth eh?[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"
Rory Lee,Anyone can crash your WhatsApp with the power of emojis,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/11/anyone-can-crash-your-whatsapp-with-the-power-of-emojis/,"Android,emoji crash whatsapp,smartphone,Whatsapp,whatsapp crash,whatsapp emoji,WhatsApp vulnerability,whatsapp weakeness","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-11,"WhatsApp seems to be full of vulnerabilities these days. At first, it tried to steal your banking information through a malware in WhatsApps update, now it seems that you can crash specific users apps by sending them a whole bunch of emojis.5,000 emojis to be precise.Researcher Indrajeet Bhuyan reveals that people can cause Android versions of the WhatsApp application to crash by sending them at least 5,000 emojis from the web version of WhatsApp. When a user receives the application and tries to open it, the whole app would crash.The only way to recover from that is to delete the entire conversation. Through our experimentation, it does indeed work. When we tried to open the malicious message, sure enough, our application crashed and we had to close and restart it before we could access the app again.However, the other conversations were unaffected by the malicious thread, so as long as you leave that conversation alone it wont crash the application. This also works for group chats.The only way to access that conversation again is to delete the entire thread and start a new conversation with that contact.That said, if you have 4GB of RAMlike we did on our Oppo R7s, you can have varying degrees of success in opening the thread againthough you would have to wait awhile. This vulnerability does not extend to the iOS version of WhatsApp as the emojis only cause the app to lag, unlike a previous iOS vulnerabilitythat relied on a specific message.Although WhatsApp does have a character limit of 6,000  to prevent messages that the application cannot handle  it seems that this still far too many as a mere 5,000 emojis will kill the app.When talking about the potential exploits of having such a vulnerability, Bhuyan says that an attacker could be sending abusive messages to their victim, blackmailing or threatening them, then send them 5,000 emojis to crash that thread and make it so that the victim cant access the thread for evidence again.Lets hope WhatsApp (or Facebook) pushes out a fix for this soon before people with bad intentions catch on and start abusing this.[SOURCE, VIA]"
Rory Lee,Could this be confirmation that Samsung is launching four S7 variants?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/could-this-be-confirmation-that-samsung-is-launching-four-s7-variants/,"Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note5,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Battery,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge plus,Samsung Galaxy S7 plus,Spigen","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2016-01-08,"A few days ago, popular leakster @OnLeaksdropped a 360-degree video render of what should be the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S7. The video, while it gives us some insight into what the regular version of the device should look like, it doesnt have any renders of the variants.Awhile back, there was some discussion on whether the S7 launch in February would see four variants (the S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge Plus) of Samsungs new flagship. We didnt think so, but new information has surfaced recently about the possibility of a Galaxy S7 Plus and a Galaxy S7 edge Plus being launched.Popular case manufacturer Spigen has put their Samsung Galaxy S7 cases on sale on Amazon even before the device has been launched, though the cases are not on Spigens website. The cases are going from USD14.99 (around RM66).Whats interesting isnt that the cases are out  because this isnt the first time Spigen has done this  it is that there is a case for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Plus and Galaxy S7 edge Plus. This could very well be confirmation of an earlier @evleaks post about the 4 S7 variants. While we dont think that Samsung will be launching the S7 Plus and the S7 edge Plus in February, it also doesnt make sense for Spigen to have the preorder for those cases so soon if Samsung werent going to launch their devices until the end of the year.If they do launch four of them at the same time, the devices could either be separated by region, size or even processor. However, if the devices do get separated by region like HTCs One M9 and One M9+, were sure there will be many unhappy Samsung fans.That said, the images look like placeholder/rendered images because if we were to compare them to @OnLeaks (who is quite reputable when it comes to leaks) youtube video, youd notice that Spigens model device is missing the Galaxy Note5-esque rear curves.As a recap of the specs. both the S7 and the S7 edge are said to run either their latest Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 depending on the market paired with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Good news is that that storage is said to be expandable as leaks claim Samsung is bringing back the microSD slot that was missing from their 2015 flagships.Camera wise, the Samsungs are said to have a lower megapixel count, at 12MP for the primary, but feature the Korean manufacturers latest BRITECELL camera technology that is said to improve low light photography and reduce the camera hump. That coupled with a rumoured f/1.7 aperture lens should see the camera do quite well in low light.The S7 should come in a 5.1 form-factor while the S7 edge takes on the 5.5 body. Both devices could also be waterproof, which looks like a trend for the upcoming 2016 flagships.[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"
Rory Lee,This is a 16-lens DSLR killer that can fit in your pocket,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/this-is-a-16-lens-dslr-killer-that-can-fit-in-your-pocket/,"16 lens camera,Android Marshmallow,camera,CES 2016,DSLR,DSLR killer,L16 camera,Light L16,Light L16 camera,Snapdragon 820","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-08,"This has been the hardest story Ive ever written simply because of the way the camera looks. If you have Trypophobia, youve been warned!The problem with getting started on a DSLR is that you have to fork out a tonne of cash to be able to afford a decent body plus a lens. Sure some of you might say that youre OK with the kit lens, but lets face it, we all want a red band around our lens. Unless youre not using a Canon device.A startup called Light is trying to change that with their L16 camera  a camera that has 16 lenses packed into a bodysmall enough to fit in your pocket.Well, sort of.By Mashables estimate, the camera is about the size of three iPhone 6 Pluses stacked together. It probably wont fit in your skinny jeans then. Nevertheless, it is still an impressive feat that they managed to cram that much tech and that many lenses into a body so small. Oh, did we mention its powered by a Snapdragon 820 SoC?On the hardware side of things, this camera has 16 (5x35mm, 5x70mm, 6x150mm) different prime lenses that work together to take an image. The camera sets it up in a way that  depending on your zoom and framing  10 lenses will fire at the same time, taking different quadrants of an image. Note that Mashable says the device has 120mm lenses instead of 150mm lenses, but from the companys video and several other sites, they say that it uses 150mm lenses.The camera then stitches the 10 images together to form a high 52-megapixel image that is should eliminate quality loss normally experienced at the fringes of a lens. These lenses dont use any kind of fancy glass, instead, they all use f/2.4 P5 plastic lenses coupled with smartphone camera sensors. Plus, since it uses so many lenses at so many different focal lengths, Light claims that the camera has a near infinite depth of field  something you can adjust in post processing.Sporting a 5 touchscreen paired with a Snapdragon 820 SoC and an interface based off of Android M, this device looks to bring camera and smartphone imaging technology closer together. Dont be fooled, this doesnt have a cellular modem so you cant make phone calls.A best of both worlds then? We certainly hope so.News of this little guy has been floating around for quite awhile now but recently Mashable got to take a look at one of the prototypes for the device. According to them, the photo stitching on the prototype took a little while to process (it ultimately froze), with the company stating that theyre trying to get the image stitching and processing down to below 1 minute. A pretty ridiculous waiting time for a photo if you ask me.The silver lining is that the processing time is only for the 52-megapixel image, so if you want to post a quick snap on social media, the camera will generate a lower quality image for you. My nose is wrinkling in annoyance.According to Mashable, when Light compared the images between an iPhone, Canon 5D Mark III and the Light L16, they were impressed with how detailed the L16 images were but noted that there was a lot of image noise. Battery life on the other hand, Mashable says that the company ballparks it at about 400 shots.While this is a noble attempt at killing our tried and tested DSLR cameras, it seems like it is still a long way off from actually dealing the final blow. Even if the software is perfected and the device works wonderfully, we (like Mashable) believe that the DSLR will continue to live on and be the primary tool for professional photographers.For events and on-the-go photography though, we can see how this device can be very useful for the professionals thanks to its portability and, hopefully, stellar image quality. We will have to see how it stacks up against other compact monsters like the Sony RX100 series before jumping to a conclusion though.That said, if this device works out, it could be a great (and much cheaper, coming in at USD1,699 which is around RM7452) alternative to the DSLR for hobbyists and prosumers. Exciting stuff then![SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

We need it to function but often dont bother getting enough of it. For humans, at least, thats a proposition that is a paradox in itself. Personally, there has never been an issue getting up from the bed but we can all nod in agreement about some people in our lives that hit that snooze button a handful of times.Often some of them never leave their pillow fort but for those who really have commitments worth getting up for, the Ruggie could be something for you.Ruggie in as the name implies, is a floor mat that doubles as an alarm clock and for it to stop ringing, youll actually have to get out of bed  you cant snooze it either. How do you shut Ruggie off? You place both your feet onto the smart mat for a good three seconds. Were not too sure how perceptive Ruggie is as the video doesnt really show it working as advertised.After it has got to up and at em the alarm will shut off and start playing customisable motivational speeches and humorous phrases to get your day moving with some positivity  more of a novelty feature but its still nice to have  I mean, having Schwarzenegger himself give you a speech every morning to Get to the chopaaaa/showerrrrr would be really cool.Crowdsourcing their effort on Kickstarter, Ruggie has already surpassed its goal of US$ 50,000 in just five days.

The pledge gets you:Before the Ruggie came into the picture, we never thought theyd be so many quirky and innovative alarm clocks. Some require you to bust out 30 bicep curls; Clocky makes snoozers run around their bedroom to locate the wheeled alarm clock; and BanClock requires the sleeper to put actual coins into it, making a point that time is money. You can find a full list here.Whenever backing a Kickstarter project be aware that some projects are never delivered to backers, disappointing we know but its something well have to live with. Make sure you raise any concerns in the comment section and run through the FAQs before you do so.So what do you think? Will this make its way into your bedrooms? Well if the answer is a yes theres gonna be a long wait  Ruggies Kickstarter states that deivery (assuming they meant delivery) will only happen in September of this year.Thats a lot of snoozing till then.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

While this time the details have been all over the place, we all know that Lenovo bought Motorola away from Google in 2013. Today, news broke that Lenovo will bid farewell to the Motorola branding and pushing solely the Moto name. So they are removing a name but the entity will continue to tinker away under a division of Lenovo.One has to have a sense of humour to appreciate the different stances that took place but for once we think Lenovo and Motorola have finally sorts out their branding issues or so we hope.Back in August, this was what Lenovo decided to do as reported by Android Authority. A slight U-turn of decisions by our records but we guess its not easy running acompany as large as Lenovo and theyre bound to make some wrong turns along the way.At least following their statements today we can conclude that brand name-wise, Motorola will cease to exist. Subsequently, any new devices under the umbrella will be sold as Moto by Lenovo or Vibe by Lenovo.So the crux of all this is, any future Moto device will still very much be built, designed and created by Motorola  e.g. Moto X, Moto G and Moto E  the only different being the company name that sells it. Business will go on, as usual, just the technicalities behind the names who sell them will differ.We already saw all of this coming since Q3 of last year but riding the Motorola name is really sad to see. In thelight of this move, were going to take everyone on a trip down memory lane.[ IMAGE SOURCE]Do you remember the powerhouse brand that created the first handheld mobile cell phone (DynaTAC) in 1973? Yupp, Motorola.Then what about the RAZR V3 flip phones that changed the game forever?

Rory Lee,This is the mechanical Apple Watch youve been waiting for,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/this-is-the-mechanical-apple-watch-youve-been-waiting-for/,"apple,apple joke,Apple Watch,H Moser & Cie,joke,Smart Watch,SmartWatch,Swiss Alp Watch,watch","Apple,Industry in General,Mobile Devices",2016-01-08,"Have you ever looked down at your Apple Watch and thought it was simply waaay too digital? Youre not alone! Swiss watchmaker H. Moser & Cie, who are seemingly appalled by the smartwatch fad, have launched what is essentially a mechanical Apple Watch.Remember that one guy saying that the Apple Watch looked like it was designed by students? Well, this Swiss company just took making fun of the Apple Watch to a whole new level.You might have noticed that Apples coveted Watch has finally made its way to our shores. If you havent, what rock have you been living under?! While many see the Apple Watch as a marvelous piece of engineering, these Swiss watchmakers are unimpressed. So much so they told smartwatch users to get a life by upgrading to a mechanical watch.Oops, wed better not show them our smartwatch buyers guide then.Dubbed the Swiss Alp Watch, H. Moser & Cies light-hearted jab at Apple comes complete with an Apple-esqueproduct video, complete with rotating close up shots and cheesy revolutionary one-line product descriptions. Theres even audio of what sounds like someone taking a bite out of an apple. Kind of reminds us of the time Ikea took a jab at Apple, complete with the same type of packaging!.As amusing as this video is, the Swiss Alp Watch is certainly no joke. Besides being a carbon copy of Apples smartwatch, the Swiss Alp Watch comes in 18-carat white gold body that has the same dimensions as the Apple Watch.It also has a screw-in non-digital crown adorned with an M, which will power on the device with a single twist.Besides that, the watch has a see-through sapphire crystal rear case that allows you to see the watch in all its beautifully-crafted mechanical glory.As far as features are concerned, the watch (obviously) doesnt have support for phone calls, heartbeat sensors, text messages or sketching. It does, however, show what H. Moser & Cie calls the most valuable commodity: The time. It will let you reconnect with people by getting out there, meeting your friends and spending time with your loved ones.All that intricate engineering will cost you, as the watch  which is limited to 50 units  costs a whopping USD24,900 (around RM109,000) which is a touch more than the Apple Watch Edition, which will set you back RM80,000. Okay, maybe more of a smack than a touch.Either way, this video shouldnt be taken too seriously, as The Verge points outbecause H. Moser & Cie is by no means a large watchmaker. So its more likely that this was made simply to be a tongue-in-cheek joke than anything else. It supposedly represents the companys resilience and their ferocious desire to fight our values and traditions, embodying everything they believe in.The important thing is that this is compatible with every device.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

The device that aims to reinvent the phone with its 3 in 1 proposition  an iPod, a phone and an Internet communications device. At the same time, Apple had also dropped the word Computer from its company name, to better reflect its growing product portfolio that goes beyond Macs. The move of getting into the phone business was timely. Close to a billion mobile phones was sold in 2006 worldwide. Thats about 5X more than PCs, over 7X the number of MP3 players and 10X more than digital cameras at that time. Steve Jobs was targeting just 1% market share with a goal of selling 10 million iPhones for 2008. The iPhone was revolutionary back then with its full touch-screen capacitive display with its multi-touch technology. Browsing the web was smooth and there were no cluttered keys or buttons that get in the way. Steve Jobs even mocked the use of a stylus as the iPhone was intuitive enough to be used with your bare fingers. Compared to todays iPhones, the original model was very barebones. At a time when smartphone makers are moving towards 3G, the iPhone was only a 2G device supporting up to EDGE. There was no AppStore, meaning youre stuck with its native apps, and the common copy and paste feature was only introduced with iOS 3.0, 2 years later.At the time, many had doubts on the iPhone. The base 4GB model was priced from US$499 (RM1,746 at that time) on a 2-year contract. If you want more storage, the 8GB version was going for US$599 (about RM2096), also on contract. Even Steve Ballmer of Microsoft had a laugh about it and this was a time when Windows Mobile and Nokia Symbian phones reign supreme. When it was eventually released in 2008, Apple sold over 10 million phones, surpassing its original goal and the rest is history. For Malaysia, the first iPhone to reach here officially was the iPhone 3G via Maxis. It was priced at RM2,540 for 8GB and RM2,960 for 16GB models. Until this very day, the iPhone is still considered as the de facto benchmark for the smartphone industry. It changed the way we interact with touch-screen devices and how we consume content and services on a mobile device. However, after Steve Jobs departure, it seems that Apple hasnt been innovating as much as before, with the competition offering compelling choices at a much competitive price point. For Steve Baller, he regretted not moving into the hardware business earlier, which saw themselves overtaken by Apple and Samsung.

Previously leaked press renders hinted that the device would take a rather big turn when it comes to design as it looks to feature a physical button at the front. Now, new images have surfaced on Weibo of the actual device that seems to confirm that suspicion.Besides that, the device also seems to sport metal rails along the side that should lend it a more premium feel in the hand though were not entirely sure if the device will have an all-metal unibody though it does seem likely. The speakers look to be placed at the bottom of the device, flanking a charging port. Whether or not that will be USB Type-C port remains to be seen.Since its a flagship, the device is no slouch, sporting Qualcomms latest quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There are rumours that there will be another model sporting 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It is also said to feature a 5.2-inch 10801920 pixel display, but there are other rumours that it might be a quad HD display (25601440) instead.As far as camera optics are concerned, the device is rumoured to have a 16-megapixel rear sensor with a 13-megapixel front camera to boot. It is also said to feature a 3,600 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0.Those are some interesting specifications and design choices but do note that these are not officially confirmed so take it with a grain of salt. The smartphone isapparently already in the process of being manufactured and is rumoured to come out in February.[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

Razer hopes their second times a charm, releasing their second wearable: the Nabu Watch. And ironically the gaming brand chose a fitness-focused smartwatch, a gamble we never expected.Made to look like a digital Chronograph (errr G-Shock), the Nabu smartwatch has a 5 ATM water resistant rating, while its rugged enough to withstand drops up to 5 meters. Razer adds a regular old illuminated backlit display wed expect on a normal watch, hands it features accustomed to on watches: alarm, stopwatch, world time but all these numbers sync through Bluetooth to ensure theyre as accurate as you can get.Nabu AppFitbit AppCompatibility will be a-okay as far as Android and iOS devices are concerned while the Nabu app looks a lot like Fitbits  imitation is a form of flattery, it seems.Nabu is a dual displayed smartwatch, so the secondary OLED screen will be the sole smart feature screen.

Though it seems an optical heart-rate monitor didnt warrant enough importance for them.Youll also be able to share social media details easily using a shake-to-shake feature, making contact exchanges seamless and more than just a simple introductory while meeting someone for the first time.When considering power sources, the two displays rely on different battery sources:Thus, if youre a simple person that loves G-Shocks that arent G-Shocks, you can opt to leave the secondary display off and simply stick to the main one. But that defeats the purpose of a smartwatch anyway, doesnt it?Razers Nabu might appeal to adventure folk who want something that looks stealthy and can take a beating.

According to OPPO, this is their new mid-range device that focuses on producing premium-quality images. As mentioned earlier, it looks like another OPPO R series thats touched up with rounded edges along the sides. Now we finally have a clearer look thanks to a Vietnamese tech site that managed to get a proper hands-on. The OPPO F1 looks very much like an R7 but with some subtle changes on the specs and design. For starters, the front features a 5 HD 720p display and underneath it gets a 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor thats mated to 3GB of RAM. From the video, it appears to be having just 16GB of storage but theres a hybrid dual-SIM slot that accepts microSD. The rear camera is said to be a 13MP main unit with Phase Detection AF, while the front has an 8MP shooter. This is hardly any difference from its current OPPO R7 range but hopefully it gets a couple of surprises during its official reveal. The OPPO R7 was priced at RM1,598, while its lower spec R7 Lite is priced at RM1,298. If OPPO wished to make this a compelling mid-range smartphone, they would need to price it competitively against the likes of the Lenovo Vibe Shot. The OPPO F1 will be announced next month and it will be heading for Malaysia. [ SOURCE 2 ]"

You would need to keep a sufficient amount in your wallet and if you dont have exact change, youll end up with bulky coins in your pocket. While Touch n Go is gaining momentum in stores, heres another way to pay without cash.Maybank together with Visa has just announced the PayBand, the first payment wearable in Malaysia. According to Visa, Malaysians are moving towards contactless transactions and they are more likely to shop at a place that accepts one. How it works is somewhat similar to the Maybanks Visa payWave Microtag, which is a sticker that you can stick onto your smartphone. Details of Maybanks Visa PayBand isnt available on their site, but if it follows the same mechanism, you can make payments up to RM250 without the need of signatures or pin numbers. Think of it as a Touch n Go in a wristband form and it charges directly to your credit card. In terms of acceptance, it will work with Visa PayWave terminals throughout Malaysia. Just like that PayWave enabled credit card, you would need to wave it in less than 4cm from the terminal to make a payment. This apparently is better than handing over a physical card as theres no chance for merchants to obtain your full card details. You can learn more about its availability here.The PayBand device isnt entirely new as Barclaycard had introduced this in the UK in wristband, keychain fob and sticker format. So if youre going for a jog, you can stop for coffee or breakfast without carrying your wallet. We have yet to see the Payband ourselves and we are curious to know if there are offering customisable band options. With most smartphones and even smartwatches these days supporting NFC, we are still surprised that mobile NFC payments have yet to catch on in Malaysia. There were several attempts by Maxis with FastTap, in collaboration with CIMB and Maybank. Unfortunately, it was short-lived and we havent heard of them since. Carrying an extra band would be quite cumbersome if youre already wearing a smartband or a smartwatch. Having SamsungPay and Apple Pay in Malaysia would be a more elegant solution dont you think?Would you consider getting a Visa PayBand? Let us know in the comments below.[ SOURCE 2 3 ]"

That 5 screen should also be a 720p HD screen and the device will likely run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.For camera optics, the Redmi 3 should have a 13MP primary camera paired with a 5MP front camera combo. On paper, this is a significant boost over the Redmi 2, pushing this into the mid-range category. We can only hope that the price will not follow suit.Popular Youtuber MKBHD once said that good phones are getting cheap while cheap phones are getting good and we share that sentiment. This is definitely something that is catching on because it seems that even Xiaomi realised they cant continue making plasticky budget phones anymore.The only unfortunate thing is that this move to metal will most likely bring a higher price tag, which were sure many would frown upon.

One2Touch have introduced the SlimType  an NFC keyboard smartphone cover designed specifically for the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. Do you want to touch it?Smartphones took the world by storm as people discovered exactly how much they could do on a tiny little device that fit in their pocket. Users began using them for instant messaging, web browsing, social media browsing and media consumption. In fact, people are using them for anything but making a call.However, productivity has been the weakest link in the smartphones chain, due to many reasons. First is the fact that with screen real estate that is only the size of your palm, it is quite difficult to view something like a spreadsheet, for instance. Matters are made worse when users have to type because the virtual keyboard usually takes up half the screen.Plus it isnt very satisfying typing on a virtual keyboard  one reason why BlackBerry kept the keyboard on the PRIV. With SlimType though, it looks like you can use your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge as a productivity device.There is one major problem that weve picked up on, though. Have you seen it yet? Yup, it doesnt have a kickstand.Most tablet keyboard covers either rely on the devices built-in kickstand or they fold in some sort of elaborate manner to form a triangular base. On the SlimType though, none of those options appear to be available. We dont know about you but a kickstand seems mighty useful when youre trying to be productive.The keyboard doesnt look like it has much travelor much of a mechanical feel, which makes sense since its a phone cover. Doesnt mean it will be nice to type on, though.Maybe this keyboard can work in a pinch or if you simply hate virtual keyboards and what it does to the size of your screen. Will it truly turn your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge into much more of a productivity beast than it already is? We doubt it.A cool attempt, but alas it doesnt seem very practical. Although this device, which is on Amazon, currently doesnt ship directly to Malaysia, there are still ways to get such products into your hands. Google it you lazy people!Were the type of people who simply must have the best when it comes to productive typing, so maybe were being overcritical. What do you guys think?

When I look around at my friends, more than half of them have more well-defined abs than I do life goals.To fulfill this desire to track health and fitness, tech companies have launched a myriad of fitness bands, trackers and applications designed to keep you as well informed about your body as possible. But while most of those devices existed as individual elements, none were truly unified.At least, thats what HTC and Under Armour said when they launched theirbrand new fitness system that costs USD400 (around RM1751).You must be thinking, youd get a lot of gear right? Well, that depends on your definition of a lot. What we do know is that with the UA HealthBox, you will be receiving three devices  a fitness band, a smart scale and a heart-rate monitor.Dubbed the UA Band, this fitness band is designed to be worn all-day every day because it tracks daily activities, workout and sleep. Under the bands seamless exterior shell is a display which is discreetly hidden allowing it to disappear when not in use. While we dont know how hidden they wanted the screen to be, from the pictures (even their product shots) it certainly looks like its well hidden enough to be a nightmare to view under sunlight.The UA Band also features an advanced workout mode with a display that stays on during the workout as well as an LED that indicates heart rate zone when paired with the heart rate monitor. Wow, a screen that stays on!Next, we have the UA Heart Rate  a compact heart rate monitor that is designed to be undetectable during workouts. It is also supposed to help individuals monitor intensity and train smarter while providing an accurate calculation of calories burned. How refreshing, a heart rate monitor that actually does all this accurately!Finally, we have the UA Scale. Its a smart scale that is beautifully crafted and WiFi enabled in an iconic circular design. This scale also has a hidden LED display that makes the technology invisible when not in use. It also looks like there is a nifty feature where they show you a bunch of logos, greet you and only after theyve done all that do they show you your weight. Perfect for when youre in a hurry!According to them, these three devices are perfectly synced to provide the user with a customised experience, but they fail to mention exactly what that customised experience is. Based on the video, it looks like its just a personalised profile on your dashboard in the UA Record app.Speaking of the app, UA and HTC have made it available in both the App Store and Google Playas a free download. The application shows you the results of your daily health and fitness tracking plus a How do you feel? scale.That said, there is some benefit to having all of these devices connected. Like they highlighted in their video, there is a lot of potential for growth into an actual ecosystem (via smart shoes, headphones, etc.). Plus there is the benefit of it being simple to use and understand.For now though, this system seems more like your paying a lot for a brand to be plastered onto existing technology and thats not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, look at Beats by Dre, theyre selling like hot cakes.This fitness system will be available on January 22 in the US, retailing for USD400 (around RM1751), with pre-orders beginning today on HTC, UA and at Under Armour Brand House locations. The HealthBox will eventually roll out internationally throughout this year."

Its hybrid autofocus has Sony boasting about a 0.03-second speed; youll be able to take stills and video up to 12800 (Photo) and 3200 (Video).This would probably be a good time to grab a VR headset, you can find some of them here on our Ultimate Gadget Gift Guide. Maneuver and interact with the 360-degree YouTube video and take your time looking around.To take a look at how the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual performs, check out our camera comparison here and our video comparison here. We put it against the iPhone 6s Plus, Nexus 6P and Samsung Galaxy Note5.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Both have the same sapphire glass protecting the watch face (as the manlier option) but the two women models get their diameters increased to 44mm from 42mm and are overall larger.The extra bezels were probably added to make way for those crystals, I mean, they had to go somewhere right?

The newer Snapdragon 820 processor aims to turn things around while bringing its performance up to the mark. At CES 2016, Qualcomm had announced Chinas LeTV Le Max Pro as the first smartphone to use their SoC. Apart from having top end performance, the Le Max Pro is also the first device to feature Qualcomms Sense ID and the first to support multi-gigabit 802.11ad WiFi, which is also known as WiGig.  The LeTV Le Max Pro is a large 6.33 phablet that pushes Quad HD resolution. Under the hood lies a Snapdragon 820 processor with quad Kyro cores at 2.2GHz thats mated to 4GB of RAM. The processor claims to be more efficient with a 16nm process and it is accompanied by a Adreno 530 GPU. The new processor with quad-cores apparently provides 2X the performance of an Octa-Core based Snapdragon 810 unit. The Sense ID is supposedly a more advanced biometric feature as it uses ultrasonic sound waves thats superior than capacitive based scanners commonly used today. Instead of recording an image of your fingertips, Sense ID scans deeper below the skin. As a result, it harder to spoof and it works well even with contaminated fingers. Another advantage is that it works underneath glass, plastics and metal materials, allowing manufacturers to implement the sensor discreetly on smartphones. In terms of design, it looks like a Huawei/honor device with a familiar antenna band stripes from an iPhone. Strangely theres still a visible fingerprint scanner at the back which could have been omitted with Sense ID. The rear camera is said to be a 21MP shooter with Optical Image Stabilisation and powering this phablet is a generous 3,400mAh battery. As seen in the pictures below, it uses USB Type-C for charging and data transfer. Connectivity wise, it also supports Cat 12 4G LTE with download speeds up to 600Mbps and uplink up to 150Mbps. Theres no mention of its availability but you can expect more Snapdragon 820 flagship smartphones to be announced next month during MWC 2016.[ SOURCE 2 3 ]"

He also put the rumour of the Mi 5 having a Snapdragon 820 chipset to bed; confirming that Qualcomms top processor will indeed be inside.This confirmation serves to reignite the flailing rumours that went flying around in early December, even confusing us in the process following the release of the Redmi Note 3  like seriously, the Chinese manufacturer chose to put an all-metal frame and fingerprint sensor on their more affordable smartphone line  were still left in awe but hey, who doesnt love a good deal?Redmi Note 3 picturedIn spite of getting our bets thrown into the drain, wed like to think that Xiaomi will match their strategy and utilise metal and a fingerprint sensor on the Mi 5 as well.

Founded in 2008, Ossia wants to hit the ground running this year by announcing that their transmitter will be in store shelves and homes by Winter of 2016  making REAL wireless charging a thing.This wont stop at phones, itll extend to other household electronics too: remote controls, security systems and even battery operated devices.The wireless charging system is rather complex and really smart at the same time. So youll have to place a Cota base station near the device youd like to charge. Inside the base station is packed with tiny antennas and to get your device charging, itll have to be tweaked to include a built-in RF receiving chip. In other words, Cota transmitter plus RF receiving chip equals mid-air charging.You dont NEED to have the chip installed inside your device and for most people Ossias wireless charging case lets you do the same, despite adding size. Though you should know that Ossia is trying their best to downsize the chip to make it easier for OEMs and manufacturers to place them inside devices.RF signals are sent wirelessly through the Cota chip one hundred times every second while the base stations tiny antennas pick them up. Detecting those signals from different angles, the base station then relays wireless RF power in the same trajectory. When the two signals meet on the same path, theyll match up and wala! Wireless charging.So far Ossia envisions that by year end, theyll get a transmitter working with a range of 10 feet. Theyll continuously work on this and the plan is to eventually release larger base stations that will be able to support charging for larger spaces.Now the tradeoffs:Ossias tech makes a big step but its only the beginning, hence dont expect Quick Charge 3.0 or VOCC-like speeds. Yet itll be really amazing to think that while you cant see it, Cota is beaming power to your devices.We can already hear people making implications about these waves potentially causing health problems for humans and animals. Studies and research on the effects of micro/radio waves are out there and before we start mass producing something thatll likely be everywhere, there should be some sort of testing done.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

While smartphone cameras have gotten better with each iteration, one of their flaws have always been a lack of optical zoom.This was because adding an optical zoom would cause your device to be much thicker than a regular smartphone  a compromise device manufacturers were not willing to make. So, unless one was willing to manually zoom with ones feet, smartphone photographers often had to settle for a grainier picture if they wanted to zoom.With the Zenfone Zoom, however, ASUS is claiming that this is the thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphonein the world. They accomplished this by mounting the smartphone cameras dual periscope horizontally across the back of the device. As a result, it boasts a 5mm ultra-thin edge thanks to an ergonomic curve that looks a lot like ASUSs other Zenfones.The primary camera itself, while only sporting 13-megapixels, comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus, a dual-tone LED flash and a SmartFSI Panasonic sensor.To make up for the lack in resolution, ASUS has implemented a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for greater clarity (up to 52MP). It also has ASUSs PixelMaster 2.0  a feature famed for its low-light performance.To facilitate the impressive camera specifications, the Zenfone Zoom will have not only have a dedicated shutter button, it also has a dedicated video button.Its no slouch when it comes to performance either, sporting a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom CPU paired with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB/128GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). The phone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box with ASUSs ZenUI skin on top.At the front, this camera-centric smartphone features a 5.5 full-HD display tucked under Cornings Gorilla Glass 4. It also has a metal finish along the rails of the phone to give it a more premium feel. Around the back, there seems to be some differences compared to the one launched in Taiwan recently, as that one had some kind of textured back (faux leather perhaps?).However, this could be because the images in the Malaysian site are outdated. If you head on over to the global siteyou can see that the build more closely resembles the one released in Taiwan. Nevertheless, we will find out how it looks like in about a weeks time.The Zenfone Zoom will sport a 3,000 mAh capacity battery, paired with ASUSs BoostMaster technology. It is supposed to give you a 60% charge in 39 minutes. Although the Zenfone Zoom has support for up to 802.11ac WiFi, it only has one micro-SIM slot for mobile connectivity.In the US, the Zenfone Zoom comes in at around USD399, which translates to about RM1,760. Considering the state of the ringgit, an optimistic estimate of the Zenfone Zooms price here in Malaysia would be RM1,799, but realistically we should probably see it closer to RM1,899.While were pretty stoked about the device, we want to know what you guys think. Let us know in the comments below. Stay tuned for our coverage of the official release.[SOURCE]"

Well, there has been a new development in the matter as TM have decided to postpone their defaulting to the e-Bill format by six months.Towards the end of last year, TM broadband subscribers (Streamyx and UniFi) exploded in outrage when they found out that TM was planning to charge them an exorbitant amount for their printed bills. TheISP justified their actions by claiming that it was part of their move to go green  cutting down and eliminating the usage of paper.As a form of motivation to get customers toswitch to e-Billing, the telecommunications company was going to incur a monthly charge of RM2 for those who still want to receive their bill in paper format. Charge Malaysians extra for anything and you know outrage will soon follow.In any case, TM issued an explanation that ended up giving consumers more confusion than confirmation because while they announced that it was an RM2 surcharge on their website, a surcharge of RM5 was mentioned on the printed bills. Now, there is finally a very official document detailing TMs plans.According to the release, TM is postponing the defaulting of billing to the e-billing system to 1 July 2016  seven months after the original intended implementation date of January 2016. This means that customers can still continue to receive their printed bill for now, but are strongly encouraged to make the switch as soon as possible.Customers who fail to make the switch by 1 July 2016 will continue to receive their printed bill but be incurred a surcharge of RM2 per month. TM is calling on all their subscribers to make the switch as soon as possible if they dont want to be forced to pay more.They highlight that there are many benefits to using the e-billing system, from speed (customers can receive theirbills within 4 days) to SMS alerts and even the ability to check your bill online (up to 6 months) from anywhere at any time by simply logging on to this website.To do so, simply update your preferred email address and mobile number by sending an email to help@tm.com.my or visit the nearest TMpoint outlet, or call TM Contact Centre at 100 from your landline. According to TM, over 700,000 out of more than 4.4 million TM residential customers are already on the e-Bill statements. Thats only about 16% of the user base.Do note that this does not affect people who are only subscribed to TMs telephone services (without broadband). These customers will receive the printed bill for free.[SOURCE]"

That said, they added something that was missing on this mouse  RGB lighting; RGB stands for red, green and blue  making the mouse easily camouflage-able in whatever personalised colourway youd desire.On the surface, aside of stripping the teal coloured accents, it remains the same 11-programmable button mouse. The removable weights are still there, allowing you to make your mouses weight configuration to your liking.As far as technology goes, an overhaul usually means a price jump but in this case, itll go for the same US$ 80 (RM 354.44) price tag on its predecessor.

Bridging the gap in the form of this in-between period, the Pre will be prototype Alpha aka the final stage before hitting consumers.Developers out there will be receiving the second-generation development kit that dials in on pushing the envelope and making the least compromises to deliver its experience. Naming it the Pre, HTC hoped that people would understand it literally  Pre as in, pre-production  and it was never supposed to exist.Its makers and partner Valve felt that if they didnt, theyd be letting an opportunity go to waste; passing up the front-facing camera that allows users to see whats really happening outside the VR headset. This prevents you from stubbing your toe on an edge or bumping yourself face first into a nearby wall, saving us from a lot of accidents in our homes or anywhere else for that matter  HTC calls this room-scale technology Chaperone  implementing it properly should allow its users to use it for longer periods without having to remove the headset.Aesthetically it has changed a lot since first being shown off, here are some photos for comparison courtesy of Gizmodo:Vive Pre headset last yearVive Pre headset this yearController last yearController this yearFrom observations around the tech scene, they mention that the headset is now more ergonomic, making it sit easier on your face. They bumped up the foam and rubber around the Pre as well, ensuring a better fit to go along with a reworked strap system.HTC and Valve have also added that front-facing camera we talked about earlier. While the hand-controllers are revamped to make buttons easier to reach, inbuilt haptic feedback and an included rechargeable batteries.The Vive exists in a space that has Oculus, Sony, Samsung, Microsoft, Fove, Avegant and Razer all in one picture, each vying for a slice of the virtual reality pie thatll soon exist for consumers to weigh their differences.But something that holds all of them back would be their pricing  none of them cost below US$ 200  while some (including HTC) have yet to put a number to their products.

Well, the wait is almost up because Apple is set to put two exclusive Apple Watch Sport designs on sale in Malaysia on February 8.To commemorate the Chinese New Year celebrations, Apple looks to be putting these two special models on sale in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This comes after an announcement message appeared briefly on the countries corresponding Apple websites before being removed earlier today.The announcement read:9to5Mac also reports that while the Buy Now and Shop Now links appeared for a short time on Apples website, it looks like the company might have launched the announcement a bit prematurely. It is currently unclear how Apple plans to sell these devices, or if they will be priced at an equally special price from the normal Apple Watch Sport models.While Apple officially launched the Watch way back in 2014, the final release of the product was in April the following year. Since then, the availability of the device has slowly trickled into our neighbouring countries. Now it seems our time may be near, though at this point it is still a rumour because there is no official confirmation.That said, this information was sourced from 9to5Mac and MacRumours, both of whom are usually right when it comes to stuff like these. If this launch date holds true, this would mean that Malaysia is one of the last markets to get the Apple Watch  almost an entire year after it was officially released. To make matters worse, this sale is only available until February 22 while supplies last.

You can use the watch for making voice calls when paired, and the battery is sufficient enough to last a full day. Compared with Singapore and Australia, the Watch is slightly more pricey over here. As a comparison, the base 38mm Apple Watch Sport is priced at S$499 (RM1,579) in Singapore and A$499 (RM1,552) in Australia. Even the straps are cheaper in Singapore at S$78 (about RM238) for the Apple Watch Sport version.If youre interested, you can place your orders now at the Apple Store.

The folks at Samsung has officially confirmed that they are adding iOS support for its current Gear S2 smartwatches.This follows the earlier rumour however it is happening only later this year without specific dates. Similar with Android Wear powered smartwatches, the Gear S2 is expected to lose some functionality when its paired to an iPhone but it should work with your standard day to day notifications.In the past, Samsung has limited its Gear smartwatches exclusively to Galaxy devices but recognising the need to go mass, they have finally opened up the Gear S2 to work with most Android smartphones. The Gear S2 is their first round smartwatch and it stands out with its rotating bezel that we feel is more intuitive to use than the digital crown on the Apple Watch.The Gear S2 is currently priced at RM1,399 while its Classic version is going for RM1,599. As a comparison, the Apple Watch is priced officially from RM1,599 and thats for the base aluminium model with a smaller 38mm size. The straps for the Gear S2 are also replaceable and the Classic version lets you swap with any traditional 20mm watch band. If youre an Apple iPhone user, would you get an Apple Watch or a Gear S2?

Nikons new addition will make the KeyMission 360 an only child (for now) in their new family of action cameras  probably the one and only that is capable of delivering a 360-degree field of view shot.In a market space dominated by the likes of GoPro  as well as other emerging companies entering the party fashionably late, TomTom, Garmin and Sony to name a few  Nikon seems to beriding on the same wave.Being a 4K ready 360-degree capable video camera, the shape it holds is weird, especially when weve come accustomed to the looks of GoPros. The frame is pretty much square but this is definitely no cube; two lenses sit on the front and rear of the KeyMission 360 while the exterior sure screams rugged. It isnt all for show either, Nikon claims its shockproof up to a 2-metre drop and waterproof up to 30 metres.It doesnt surprise us that other influential imaging companies are hot on the heels, as GoPros have been relatively popular since making its inception in the early 2000s. Drones have been hot too, so these two, when used in unison, would probably be one of the biggest leaps for photojournalism and news reporting. Knowing this, GoPro will soon put out the Karma, a drone and 360-degree camera combo but thats still in development; you can read about it here.Nikon enters a new space and despite the forerunners mentioned earlier entering the market much earlier, none of them offer a small (true) 360-degree action camera. With this type of dual-lens 360-degree camera hitting the scene, it might pose a huge question mark for those bulky camera rigs that are used to deliver VR-videos; making these smaller options something you can pocket and go, rather than needing a fully fledged crew to handle a production.The KeyMission 360 along with some nifty dedicated accessories will be out in Spring of this year; no pricing details have been released but more information will be available during Nikons CES exhibit scheduled to take place tomorrow.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"
Rory Lee,The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S is official.

The large 12 Windows 10 tablet from Samsung has finally been unveiled on their website and it will be called the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S. Yes, a Windows 10 device bearing the Galaxy tag and we have all the juicy specs right here.The Galaxy TabPro S will come with a choice of either a Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro operating system, so there is no option for an Android OS of any kind. Up front, the tablet will have a 12-inch FHD+ (21601440 pixels) sAMOLED display  the first Windows 10 tablet to have a Super AMOLED screen.On the inside, this massive tablet will be powered by a dual-core Intel Core M processor, clocked at 2.2GHz. paired with 4GB of RAM and either a 128GB or 256GB SSD. Because the device is powered by a Core M processor, it has a fanless design which eliminates that annoying whirring sound.We initially thought that this device would be competition for the Microsoft Surface 3, but with these specs (of course depending on the price) it looks to be able to take on even the low spec Surface Pro 4 with a Core M3 processor. Do note that Samsung did not mention which Core M processor theyre using, only that it is a 6th-gen one.The device will also support 802.11 a/b/g/n/acMIMO, WiFi Direct, NFC and Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity. For those on the move, theres also a 4G LTE (Cat.6) version alongside a WiFi only version. GPS and GLONASS are also supported.For optics, the Galaxy TabPro S will have a 5MP front and rear camera, which isnt impressive but you dont want to be that guy taking pictures with your 12 tablet do you? For video, the cameras will support recording up to an FHD resolution (19201080).Powering the components will be a 5,200 mAh battery that Samsung says can last up to 10 hours, and because the tablet sports a USB Type-C port, it will also have fast charging allowing you to top the device up in about 2.5 hours.Since 2-in-1 devices are all the rage right now, the Galaxy TabPro S will come with a keyboard (not sold separately) that looks very much like the old Surface Pro 3 Type Cover. Unlike the iPad Pro, this keyboard can actually function as a cover because it adopts a more old-school approach to keyboard attachment. Also, note that it has a touchpad, something that is missing from both Apples Smart Keyboard and Googles Pixel C.For users who want a stylus or more ports, Samsung is offering a Bluetooth Pen and a multi-port adapter (HDMI, USB Type A & C) but are sold separately. Samsung says that the Galaxy TabPro S will be available globally come February 2016though there is no mention of a recommended retail price.[SOURCE, 2]"

With a fast lens, Sony sensor and an interesting design, things are looking pretty good for it.The Reco Smart camera is shaped a lot like a regular camera lens, without the body, which means that it is also quite large, much like Sonys QX Camera. With that extra real estate though, ASUS can fit a large (and fast) f/1.8 aperture lens which should let it perform well in low-light conditions.ASUSs camera also has a Parking monitor mode that lets the camera detect movement in front of your vehicle and automatically start recording until it detects no further movement for one minute. Coupled with a 150-degree wide-angle lens, this Reco Smart cam is shaping up to be a pretty good dash-cam.In the event of a collision, the built-in three-axis G-sensor triggers the emergency record function. It will then save the recording to the ASUS WebStorage cloud and lock it down so it wont be deleted by accident. Besides that, the camera can also be programmed to send out an emergency text message to a designated contact.Although there is no mention of the sensors megapixel count, the camera supports full-HD 1080p video recording as well as real-time previews and downloads on smart devices via the Reco app. Pairing with your smart device should also be a breeze with NFC One Touch Engage. As the device is WiFi capable (802.11 b/g/n), you also get 500GB of ASUS WebStorage cloud storage for free for one year.When ASUS said that the device could also function as a portable camera, they werent kidding because from the looks of things, the Reco Camera is compatible with a wide range of standard camera accessories. Stuff like tripods, monopods and even lens filters (which work with 58mm diameter lenses) should fit with no problems.The only bummer is that the device comes with a tiny 720mAh battery that can only support up to one hour of 1080p video recording with the WiFi turned on. As a comparison, a GoPro Hero4 usually averages 1.5 hours of battery life at 1080p recording.You do get a decent amount of kit in the package though, including a microSD card, car charger, dual USB car charger, GPS mount holder and more. A waterproof housing for the camera is also available for purchase. For now, there is no information onavailability or pricing.[SOURCE, 2]"

And while their devices have never been sleek, fancy or elegant, theyre hoping that the latest Blaze might help more people jump into the whole fitness watch scene.But this is not really a smartwatch, by definition. It doesnt have third-party apps like other smartwatches (Apple Watch and Samsung Gear S2) out there. This niche segment that Fitbit hopes to approach could be for those who want to be fitness focused, yet not jump into a whole new world of complications associated with smartwatches.Itll be interesting to see how the masses react to a more fashion-focused fitness tracker/watch, considering how Swiss (TAG Heuer and Breitling) makers have also decided to join in. Maybe the days of the analogue are over.Fitbits Blaze is going to do what their products do best, tracking fitness. Whether you choose to have it on your wrist 24/7, thats pretty much up to you but you can rest easy if you decide so; itll monitor sleep, count your steps, track your workouts and records your heart rate throughout.If youre unfamiliar with the whole Fitbit ecosystem, you can read about their other devices here.The actual device is modular, so the choices of bands/straps will fit pretty much any occasion  coming in the typical Fitbit elastomer, leather and stainless steel options. The brands devices have always been squarish, straying away from the traditional watch face but the Blaze is octogonal watch face, so its less cube-ish this time.Notably, Fitbits latest fitness tracker will feature an LED colour screen  a first for the company. Adding that makes a big change but for some reason they left out inbuilt GPS on Blaze; a key feature that differentiated their top of the line Surge tracker from its lower models.Though, it does have connected GPS; a fancy way of saying that youll need your smartphone to track distance and map out your route. They probably left this out to keep battery life at a bearable 5-days.Although, we didnt choose to call it a smartwatch, it does have some form of notifications: call, text and calendar alerts to be precise. Youll also be able to control your music playback options while doing all your fitness related activities.Most of the specifications are still up in the air but from what weve been able to gather, itll play nice with iOS, Android and Windows smartphones/tablets, together with PCs too. The elastomer Fitbit Blaze will retail for US$ 199.95 (RM 875.70) and come in three colours: black, blue and plum. If you want to go higher up in the looks department, youll have to fork out more  an additional US$ 99.95 (RM ) for the leather band and US$ 129.95 (RM ) for the stainless steel band.

And Western markets should be paying attention to the Mate 8 now since the Chinese manufacturer has already put its name out there with the Nexus 6P.But the Mate 8 isnt a Nexus, theres not a lot of stock on its EMUI skin, despite running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. The overlaid skin also has a UI thats comparable to iOS.Putting Huawei devices in a tough spot  top of the line hardware but withsoftware that is different  a little too different for some.Looking at what it has under the hood, youre compelled to believe that this is a flagship. Carrying a home-grown Kirin 950 SoC, this was one of the first devices to equip itself with the aforementioned Octa-core processor. Four cores are clocked at 2.3GHz while the other four run at 1.8GHz. Quoting Huawei on its Kirin 950 chipset, theyve said that the i5 coprocessor manages power efficiency better and also makes it capable of speech recognition.Together with its main systems, itll release (internationally) in two variants: 3GB RAM or 4GB RAM. Seemingly, theres no information on what the storage specifications are but based on the China release, itll likely be 32GB and 64GB respectively.The resolution on this 6-inch beast is a letdown, to be honest. For a screen that big, Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution doesnt cut it. And once you notice it has a huge 4,000 mAh, youll be even more peeved; giving them no excuse to up the resolution, as battery life wouldnt be a factor.On the outside, its the same all-metal design that weve (recently) seen Huawei put out. Its front will feature 2.5D curved glass around the display and on the top, an 8-megapixel front camera takes care of all those selfie shots. Moving to the back, theres a 16-megapixel Sony IMX298 lens, as well as a rounded fingerprint sensor. As we talked about earlier, itll have a big battery but even while being rated 4,000 mAh, Huawei claims a 30-minute charge delivers a full-day of use.Albeit a centrepiece of Huaweis conference at CES, there was no word on when itll hit US stores, if at all. But heres the plot twist, itll be arriving in Malaysia during the first wave launch in four colour options, Champagne Gold, Moonlight Silver, Space Grey and Mocha Brown. Huawei failed to give a date to this first wave launch.As per presentation, Huawei was quoted that the Mate 8 will arrive in 30 countries; you can find a full list at Android Headlines.Looking at Chinese prices, the phablet could make an RM 1k price jump to:3,199 RMB (RM 2,118)  3GB/32GB
3,699 RMB (RM 2,474)  4GB/64GBSo theres that to consider if Malaysians were already eager to pick it up.Alternatively, these were the European pricings:599 (RM 2,818)  3GB/32GB

Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S7 will get features you wanted so badly on the S6,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/05/samsung-galaxy-s7-micro-sd-waterproof-larger-battery/,"Android,battery capacity,microSD,microSD Slot,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Battery,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 Specs,Samsung Galaxy S7 Waterproof,Waterproof","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-01-05,"Samsung is expected to launch its new flagship smartphones next month during MWC 2016. As we inch closer towards its launch day, serial leakster, @evleaks has dropped more details on Samsungs next big duo. The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge had opened a new chapter for Samsung with its premium glass and metal design, along with top specs that hold well to this very day. Of course, there are many that frown upon its compromises. It was their first flagship to not have a removable battery and most critical of all, it lacks an expandable microSD slot. If you were disappointed by the Galaxy S6, theres a lot to look forward to on the upcoming model.According to @evleaks, the new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will finally offer a microSD slot. Like the current S6, both models will be offered with either 32GB and 64GB storage options, which in Malaysia we are likely to receive the smallest option of just 32GB. This would be good news for those taking loads of pictures and 4K videos as the device is alleged to support microSD cards up to 200GB. This reaffirms an earlier insider source that Samsung is finally bringing back the microSD slot to its latest flagship. With each new model, the Galaxy S lineup has always seen an increase of battery capacities. However on the Galaxy S6, it was downsized from 2,800mAh on the Galaxy S5 to just 2,550mAh (2,600mAh on the S6 edge). Fortunately, the new processor and energy efficient Universal Flash storage were good at maximising every mAh of power. The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are alleged to receive 3,000mAh and 3,600mAh capacity batteries respectively, which is a huge jump. Thats like fitting a Galaxy Note battery into a smaller device, and hopefully this could translate to more than 24 hours of usage. Wireless Charging will still be the star of the show and Samsung will likely to support fast wireless charging for the new flagship duo as it did with the Galaxy Note5. Charging an S7 is reported to take about 2 hours wirelessly while the S7 edge will take slightly longer at 2.2 hours.  First introduced on the Galaxy S5, the S7 is said to be getting water and dust resistance with an IP67 rating. This is similar with the Galaxy S5 which in theory can be submerged up to 1 metre for up to 30 minutes. Even if you dont go to the pool, having water resistance is a good feature to have especially for those unexpected moments. Even word has it that the folks at Cupertino are working to make its upcoming iPhone waterproof. If Samsung is doing it, it better be a cap-less design without those clumsy flap covers. The Galaxy S7/S7 edge will be running on their latest Exynos 8890 processor but there will be a Qualcomm-powered version for selected markets that runs on a Snapdragon 820 processor. Expect them to come with 4GB of RAM and has support for faster Cat 9 4G LTE. In terms of screen size, the standard S7 is likely to retain the same compact 5.1 Quad HD display while the S7 edge is rumoured to be either a larger 5.5 or 5.7 incher. To have a 5.7 smartphone at this time of the year doesnt make any sense as it would cannibalise its own S6 edge+ that was launched not too long ago.Camera wise, the new flagships will get a smaller pixel count of 12MP instead of its current 16MP shooter. However, it is compensated with faster f/1.7 lens versus f/1.9 for better low-light performance. With a smaller BRITECELL camera module, the new S7 could have a flat and flush back design without the protruding camera hump.  Are you excited now? MWC 2016 is happening on 22nd February 2016 and Samsung would normally announce their latest Galaxy S model a day earlier.[ SOURCE VIA ]"

The display, which the company claims has a 1000:1 contrast ratio with adjustable colour balance, will be tucked under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3.On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC paired with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. For optics, the device will see a 13MP rear shooter with PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) and a fast f/2.2 aperture. Helping the device out with low-light shots is a two-tone LED flash to the right of the camera module. For selfies, the phoneunsurprisingly sports a 5MP front-facing camera.What is surprising is the fact that the device will feature a pair of front-facing stereo Dolby Atmos speakers, something thats missing even on most flagship devices. Whats more, this mid-range device also sports a fingerprint scanner mounted at the back just below the primary camera (my personal favourite location), something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market.Powering everything will be a quick charge enabled 3,300 mAh battery that is supposed to deliver 265 hours of 3G standby time and 22 hours of 3G talk time. The device also comes with dual-SIM support, both of which have support for 4G LTE. The device will run Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovos Vibe UI skin on top, though we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update in the near future.The reason they bundled the smartphone with a VR headset is so that users can take advantage of Lenovos TheaterMax technology which converts regular content into immersive VR content. While we dont know how immersive TheaterMax will end up being, Lenovo seems pretty confident in it, leaving the final judgement to time itself.Lenovos mid-ranger will go on a flash sale on Amazon India on January 19 atINR11,999 (around RM783) for just the device, while the VR bundle will cost INR13,299 (around RM868). Note that for the first few flash sales, the device will only be sold in the VR bundle, but priced at a discounted INR12,499 (around RM816). No information on whether this device will make it to Malaysia is present at the time of this articles writing. It is important to point out that the predecessor, the Note K3, is available on DirectD at RM599.[SOURCE, 2, 3]"

But with doors, windows and grills, one can only do so much to protect their own home. Lets face the facts, break-ins happen all over the world though it doesnt hurt to have some sort of surveillance system around your compound.Meet the Netatmo Presence, a smart outdoor security camera released at CES 2016.Wait, another smart home-monitoring system that has a motion detector? Well yeah but this one can identify the differences between a person, animal and car.The brand isnt a stranger to the home-monitoring scene; before launching Presence, the Welcome indoor camera had this revolutionary facial recognition technology  letting you always put a name to known faces. Presence doesnt go as far but the ability to distinguish a person, animal and car is already a feat in itself.Connecting to your home Wi-Fi network to send you real-time push notifications of what it has been seeing, itll buzz you on your designated device if it notices a person moving around the vicinity, an animal running about or a car pulling up to the driveway  proceeding to show you a video recap of it happening. Able to detect people/animals/cars up to 20 metres, the camera also allows users to pinch-to-zoom to ensure you manage to identify the culprits in your video recording. Itll be interesting to see how capable the software is and if any costumes/hoods or etc can fool it into not recognising a person.Having Presence on your porch will definitely help when youre expecting a valuable package; keep an eye on gardeners and handymen; or when youre too preoccupied to notice the doorbell going off. It makes perfect sense since were always on our smartphones anyways, the push notification should be seen quickly.As a fixed outdoor camera, itll obviously be working during the night-time but once the sun goes down, the camera kicks into infra-red mode  if you want it to  otherwise the floodlight that sits above the lens will be mighty useful.Personalise Presence and its corresponding app by going through its notification settings and allow it to continuously record when a person is detected. The 4-megapixel smart camera shoots in Full HD (1920 x 1080) and has a 100-degree angle field of view. Storage is done internally and that means if you dont get to your recording fast enough, someone could easily destroy the camera before you realised.Sitting inside an aluminium shell thats IP66 certified, youll mount the 50 x 200 x 110mm unit with the included mounting kit. In terms of the floodlight specifications, itll be a dimmable 12W LED unit with IR night vision detection up to 15 metres.

That means you can just toss it in the air and the drone will start flying though it does need a little bit of room to get it climbing.The Disco, with its single propeller and detachable wings, can hit speeds of up to 50mph (around 80kph) and stay flying for about 45 minutes on a single charge. There is also an ultrasound camera mounted at the bottom of the drone that helps it land autonomously.Well, more like crash autonomously if were looking at the teaser footage.Like the Bebop 2, you can control the Disco with Parrots Skycontroller or plot a flight plan and have the drone do the flying itself. The drone also has a return home function that does exactly what the name suggests.Mounted at the front is the same eye-like 14-megapixel fisheye lens camera Parrot mounts on the Bebop 2, so it will likely feature the same digital panning and stability options as well.While ditching the quadcopter design lets you fly more realistically (especially with FPV goggles), there will inevitably be drawbacks. The drone, for example, loses its ability to hover and takeoff vertically, making it less ideal for filming. It will also inevitably be less stable and manoeuvrable than a quadcopter.Upside? Y0u can fly, turn and pitch like an actual plane. COOL.Despite their claims, The Verge points out that Parrot arent the first to introduce aready-to-fly fixed-wing drone as there are already several small fixed-wing drones in the market.Though we do think the Disco is one of the best looking fixed-wing drones out there. Or almost out there, since its still a prototype. Parrot does plan to make this available to consumers within this year so thats something to look forward to.[SOURCE]"

Heck, youre probably reading this article because it popped up on your Facebook feed. Now, what if I told you that your favourite social media platform was secretly experimenting on you?According to a report by The Verge, it appears that Facebook had secretly experimented on its Android mobile users, crashing their apps intentionally, selectively disconnecting them from their Facebook applications for hours on end.Why? Well, apparently it was done to prepare for the possibility of Google removing the Facebook application from their Play Store for competitive reasons. They wanted to prepare for a future where users might have to resort to downloading the Facebook application from a source outside of the Google Play Store.Despite the fact that Facebook is one of the Play Stores biggest application developers, there is a looming threat that the social network could bypass Googles services altogether.The tests were allegedly conducted to see how far they could go to get Android users to abandon their platform altogether. The results? People never stopped coming back.According to a person familiar with the tests, those who were locked out of their application defaulted to the mobile web browser version of Facebook, rather than abandoning the application. Are you surprised?We werent. Right now, there is simply no alternative to Facebook and what the social media platform offers, so it seems only natural that users would find any means possible to access the site. The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this absolute power, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back.The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this absolute power, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back.Although this was supposedly a one-time experiment conductedyears ago, this isnt the first social experiment Facebook undertook. Yes, were talking about the controversy in 2014 where Facebook altered the content on users News Feeds to see if it would change their moods.Information surfaced last year that Facebook bombarded several users News Feeds with sad and depressing content to see if they were less likely to visit the site if it made them sad. The experiment was so controversial that even the editor behind the study was creeped out, questioning if the results of the study were actually worth all the backlash.What most people dont realise  or choose to turn a blind eye on  is that social experimenting on the Internet is nothing new. Pretty much every website has done it to some extent. The question then becomes whether you know youre being experimented on or not.Perhaps what makes what Facebook did so painful was that it felt personal on some level because these were peoples personal feeds.

The TabPRO S though should bear the Ativ badge since it looks very much like it is going to be a Windows 10 machine.A possible explanation for this is that the device could either be a dual boot system or come in two variants, much like the Xiaomi Mi Pad 2. Then again, we dont know if these are official pictures or not, so take them with a grain of salt.The tablet looks to come with a keyboard attachment as well, but since it is supposed to be a massive 12-inches, we do hope that Samsung finds a more elegant solution to fold their keyboard than Apple did with their iPad Pros Smart Keyboard.That said, the keyboard will likely mean that this tablet should be marketed more towards the productivity side, much like their previous Galaxy Tab Pro. This would put it in direct competition with Microsofts Surface Pro 4 and the Apple iPad Pro.As a spec recap, the Samsung Galaxy TabPRO S is said to feature a screen resolution of either 25601600 or 38402400 pixels stretched out over the 12-inch screen. On the inside, the device is said to be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM.Some have also indicated that the tablet may come with an S Pen, which could greatly increase productivity when coupled with a full Windows 10 experience. With Android though it will probably only be as useful as the S Pen on the Galaxy Note5.Unfortunately, @evleaks didnt release any information on when this device might be launched, if at all.[SOURCE]"

This is an issue because the conditions of a disaster are never the same, often needing the rescue team to stay on the move to avoid getting caught up in it themselves.So, the participants are tasked with launching and landing a drone from the bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.Heres the full timeline of the DJI SDK Developer Challenge:In certain parts of the world, drones bring about more fear than anything else, though its amazing to see that there are (obvious) pros in utilising them for aid drop-offs and search-and-rescue missions; lessening the risk of rescuers by putting drones out there instead. And lets not forget the use of these drones by photojournalist worldwide, capturing civil unrest in states observing media lockdowns.Besides holding competitions to save the world, DJI has also updated their existing Phantom and Inspire drone series.

Not only it is super fast with transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, it is also capable of pushing more power and it can even replace your existing HDMI cables as well. As the one connector to rule them all, the new reversible port will be a common sight in upcoming smartphones, tablets and laptops. To be in the forefront of this new standard, Acer has announced at CES 2016, the Worlds first monitors to support USB Type-C. The H7 monitor series lets you connect your smartphone or laptop onto a bigger screen, while allowing you to transfer files and charge the device simultaneously. This basically sounds like a monitor with a built-in Microsoft Display Dock.  The Acer H7 series isnt entirely new and its existing HDMI/DVI/DisplayPort lineup employs the same classy look thats being held up by a premium crafted brushed metal stand. It gets a ZeroFrame design thats wrapped up in aluminium. There are 2 models available  25 and 27, both of which boast WQHD resolution of 25601440 with 100% sRGB colour gamut reproduction. The monitors come with built-in speakers, thats assisted with DTS Sound and Acer TrueHarmony enhancements. To protect your eyes, it also gets a Blue Light Filter to reduce eye fatigue over extended usage. For backward compatibility with older devices, the new H7 monitors also support HDMI 2.0. The Acer H7 series is priced from 499 Euros (about RM2325), and it is expected to go on sale globally in February.Also announced at CES 2016 is the Acer R1  The Worlds Thinnest Monitor under 7mm. It is virtually bezel-less with its ZeroFrame design, allowing seamless viewing when paired with multiple monitors. The Acer R1 monitor series pushes Full HD resolution and it comes in either 21.5, 23, 23.8, 25 and 27 sizes.

It promises impressive specs and eye-catching style with an amazing price. So could we be looking at an affordable Lumia Pureview alternative? At the moment, OPPO has a photography-centric N series that offers a rotating camera module on the OPPO N1 and N3. From the teaser image above, the F series appears to have unibody metal design and it comes with rounded corners and edges as opposed to having squarish looks like its current R series. The side does look like an iPhone 6/6s with its power and SIM tray slot switched places. In terms of specs, dont expect it to be a top notch device like its Find series. The OPPO F series will be a mid-ranger which is unlikely to be powered by Qualcomms newer Snapdragon 810/820 family of processors. The first model would be called the OPPO F1 and it could be launched in Malaysia sometime this month. If they are looking to push photography in a mid-range segment, the phone to beat would be the Lenovo Vibe Shot thats priced at RM1,399.

While there have been rumours going around about a potential Samsung Galaxy S7+, SamMobile believes that this will likely be the S7 edge instead.We highly doubt Samsung would cannibalise their popular recent flagship and risk their consumers getting pissed at them, just so they can be radical. Its very unlikely that they would pull a Xiaomi.Now that weve gotten that out of the way, the picture also reveals another interesting specification: The camera module. According to the picture, the S7 (or S7 edge or S7+) looks to feature a 12.2-megapixel rear camera coupled with a 5-megapixel front shooter.Whats interesting is the drastic drop in megapixel count for the rear camera, down from 16MP, in a 2016 device. This is in-line with an earlier rumour that the device would sport a 12MP large pixel sensor, though it doesnt match Samsungs other camera technology reveal.At their Investors Forum last year, Samsung unveiled the BRITECELL camera technology, which utilises tiny one micron pixels which are the smallest pixel for slim smartphone. If Samsung were to use these small pixels and also drop pixel count, then they would really have to have something up their sleeve to help the sensor cope with low-light photography.The image also reveals that the device will have a Snapdragon 820 processor with an Adreno 530 GPU mated with 4GB of RAM, which is, unsurprising.In any case, these are only rumours and Samsung could just be pulling a fast one, using multiple prototypes to mislead leaksters. Although you should probably take this with a grain of salt, this does give us a lot to be excited about for 2016s smartphones.[SOURCE]"

It is an interesting safety feature as it disconnects if someone tripped over your cable, avoiding the risk of dragging your laptop to the ground. When Apple introduced the new ultra-thin MacBook, it was ditched in favour of the all-new USB Type-C. This is supposedly the future standard of connectivity, allowing you to deliver power, data and even high-resolution video on a single cable. Sadly that means youre stuck with an old-school cable design like other gadgets. If you want to restore that MagSafe feature of old, cable maker Griffin finally has a solution for you.Simply called as BreakSafe, the new magnetic USB cable works essentially like the MagSafe that came as standard with previous MacBook models. It is fairly easy to release and it will automatically disconnect when theres excessive pressure. On one end, you get a fixed USB Type-C connector that goes into your power adapter, while the other end has two pieces, with the small stub that stays permanently in your MacBook port. The cable is 6 feet (1.8 metres) long and the magnetic connector is about 12.8mm deep. On their online store, it is listed as coming soon with the retail price tag of US$39.99 (about RM173). As comparison, the original USB Type-C cable (2 metres) for the MacBook is going for RM139.If youre looking for a sleeker alternative, theres Znaps that debut on KickStarter. This isnt a cable but a two-piece connector head that gives you a MagSafe and a reversible feature for your existing Lightning, Micro-USB and USB Type-C cables. A set for Lightning and Micro-USB costs US$18.00 (about RM78) while USB Type-C costs US$24.00 (about RM104). Individual connectors and adapters are sold separately so you can MagSafe your entire device collection if required. You can pre-order now and they will ship by end of this month.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

How it works is the app will record a 15-second clip of the crying noises, analysis the frequencies of acoustic variation and compare it to an online database. Dr Chen Si-da and Chang Chuan-yu lead the show and theyve managed to get the app to work 92% of the time, telling those using the app that their baby is either hungry, sleepy, in pain or needs a diaper change.That 92% has some caveats though, the accuracy of the app diminishes as the baby gets older:The researchers hypothesise that once the baby reaches six months, itll be almost pointless to rely on the app as he/she will be more receptive of the environment around them. And mainly as humans develop, they get more complicated  we can attest to that.Yet, this could be the app every soon-to-be parents will need when it comes to tending to their babies, especially for first-time parents. Learning as it goes, the Infant Cries Translator, will constantly update its database by taking results from babies around the world and itll allow parents to personalise their results by adding their own feedback to the learning algorithm.Were sure parents reading this now want to know where to get the app:The screenshots of the app being used on the two app stores are shown in Mandarin but the Apple App Store lists support in English and Japanese as well.And dont expect this app to solve all your problems, its just another tool to help identify why your baby is crying.

However, as she was too preoccupied with her device, she didnt notice when she gradually began walking towards the edge of the water.Online surveillance footage shows Wang struggling for over a minute before she disappeared from the surface of the water. Her body was discovered after her husband Yang spotted her shoe floating on the river when he went looking for her the next morning.Although the river was only chest-deep,the sludge at the riverbed can cause people to slip and fall. This incident has served as a wake-up call to the Chinese public as netizens took to the social media, calling for people to exercise caution when using phones.Wed like to say that this is the first tragedy caused by phubbing (snubbing someone in favour of your smartphone), but that just isnt the case.It used to be dont drive and text, now it needs to also be dont walk and use your phone.You might think, ohthats not me, I only use it at the dinner table!. What people dont realise is that everything starts somewhere. Using them initially to avoid socially awkward situations can often lead to a reliance on the device and we all know where that leads.An Ohio State University researcher discovered that the number of pedestrian deaths has dramatically increased over the past few years and many of which were caused by telephone distractions. The figure is expected to double by 2015.Be mindful when using your device. Its perfectly fine if you post that tweet an hour or even a day later.

So, whats going to be the next big thing in 2016?It looks like the sky is the limit for Samsung. In a patent application just released by the US patent office, the Korean manufacturer is going all out with a crazy mobile device concept that combines a foldable body with a flexible display, and a built-in projector that can project hologram images.This is of course only a patent application so its too early to say if well see a similar device being released this year, not all the tech in one device, at least. You might see Samsung expanding its range of flexible display devices, and its not the first time they stuffed a projector into a smartphone (remember the Galaxy Beam?).Released in 2010, the Galaxy Beam is a novel idea that was probably ahead of its time but today with video on demand and mobile content steaming being a big thing, a phone with a built in projector wouldnt be such a bad idea. Imagine whipping out your phone and projecting The Bing Bang Theory. That would be cool. What do you think?[source, via]"

You might want to try this latest app from Microsoft. Yup, the company that brought you productivity apps such as Microsoft Office, OneDrive and OneNote is doing selfies and its called simply as the Microsoft Selfie.With more selfies taken each day, Apple is still reluctant of putting any form of selfie beautification features into its camera ap. Most smartphone these days, especially from China are equipped with selfie enhancing features that automatically smoothes your skin with some fine touches to your eyes. This trend has also caught on with mainstream brands including Samsung, Lenovo and even Sony. The Microsoft Selfie app is pretty straightforward. Just snap a picture or take an existing one, and it will automatically apply the necessary effects to make you look better. The selfie enhancement takes into consideration your age, gender, skin tone and lighting which is close to Xiaomis camera app. If you remembered, Microsoft had experimented with this Machine Learning feature on its How old do I look website. If the selfie pic isnt good enough, you can still tweak the levels and select additional filters like you do on Instagram. You can tap on the compare button to compare the before and after effects. The app is currently only available for iOS users. This isnt the first time Microsoft had made a selfie app as they had developed a Lumia version for Windows Phone.For the extreme narcissists, there are more advanced beautification apps like MeituPic that lets you touch up skin imperfections, enlarge eyes or make your face slimmer.

A tree, nothing, without its roots. A product, nothing, without its consumers. So what happenswhen a smartphone manufacturer gets slapped with a class action lawsuit filed by the very people who used to preach their excellence?Draaaama!More than a hundred infuriated iPhone 4s owners have filed a lawsuit against Apple, claiming USD5 million (around RM21.5 million) in damages, accusing them of significantly slowing down their devices with the new iOS 9 update. The lawsuit was filed with a New York district court, though no hearings have been set at this time.According to plaintiff Chiam Lerman and several others, the new update slowed the device down so much that it interfered with day-to-day usage.It seems that after upgrading, both first and third-party applications exhibited delayed launch times, slow response to touchscreen input and other problems. Overall performance was also affected by freezes and crash events.They also accuse Apple of engaging in deceptive trade practices and false advertising by proclaiming that the update is compatible with legacy smartphones dating back to the iPhone 4s models. The lawsuit also claims that Apple were well aware of iOS 9s negative impacts on the iPhone 4s but went ahead with the marketing campaign anyway.The campaign advertised faster performance, enhanced security, longer battery life among other enticing features. To make matters worse, the companys advertisements, website, and iOS page did not have any warning of potential compatibility issues for older devices.Apparently the complaint went after Apples iOS system itself, because when faced with a sluggish and slow device, it is more likely that the average Apple user would upgrade to a new iOS product instead of branching out. The reason being that transferring information across devices within the same ecosystem is much easier. Plus there is also the familiarity factor.It isnt too surprising that a new iOS update would slow down older devices because each new update is designed to take advantage of the hardware from the recent models. This includes a host of new features and improvements that an older device may not have even dreamt was possible, much less have support for it.Apple has been in this situation before, back in 2011, where plaintiffscomplained that iOS 4 turned their iPhone 3G into iBricks. That case was tossed out a year later and it seems likely that this lawsuit will suffer the same fate.One of the main arguments in the iOS vs Android war was that Apple always pushed new updates, even to old devices such as the iPhone 4s while Android devices have a realistic lifespan of 2 years. After 2 years, it is very unlikely that your Android device would be getting any updates from its manufacturer.Apple fans argued that this was because Android was so fragmented, with so many different manufacturers making so many different versions of the Android OS. iOS isnt the same because everything was unified under one banner.That said, there is an exception to this Android dilemma: The Nexus devices. Nexus smartphones tend to receive OS updates much quicker and for longer than most other devices. But unlike whats happening to these unfortunate iPhone 4s users, each Android update usually improves the performance of older devices due to improved optimisationof the OS.This brings Apple users to what looks like a difficult decision. Do you update your OS to get new features and better security at the risk of sluggish performance? Or do you stick to what already works and brave potential security risks? Let us know in the comments below.If youre as frustrated as these users and think Apple does this on purpose so that people will be forced to buy a new iPhone, dont hesitate to drop your opinion in the comment box too![SOURCE, VIA]"

It even helped save a life. The problem is thatunless youre OK with Google Cardboard or other cardboard-like VR goggles, a standalone mobile phone VR headset  like the Samsung Gear VR  is quite pricey.Thankfully we can always count on China to produce more affordable options and with FiresVR, proper smartphone VR gear could become easily accessible to everyone.Dubbed the Xiaomiof Chinas VR industry, FiresVR is looking to shake up the pricing of quality VR headsets with its new JiDome-1. Although China has produced many cardboard-like VR pieces in the country, the JiDome-1 is the first serious VR product that can be compared to the likes of the Gear VR.The JiDome-1 has a high-precision 9-axis gyroscope and proximity sensor as well as redefined weak interaction buttons. It also has a built-in air-cooling system with a balanced cooling efficiency and working noise. This cooling systemwill hopefully work well to keep your device cool and stave away moisture or fogging.While the Gear VR is only compatible with Samsung devices, this JiDome-1 is compatible with a variety of Android smartphones as long as they meet the design requirements. For now, it is already compatible with 30% of all Android devices but FiresVR wants to push it to exceed 50% compatibility in 2016.As a proverbial cherry on top of the icing, the device is currently being sold at RMB199 (around RM131.60) which is a whole lot cheaper than what the Gear VR goes for. There is a catch, though: When it goes on sale in Q1 of 2016, it will only be available to developers, but it is expected to reach consumers in the second quarter of 2016. Because of that, a consumer price has not yet been released.If you cant wait that long, therere always more options for VR headsets, head on over to our gadget gift guide for more information.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Using a mobile app, Uber lets you request for a clean and reliable ride, which is like a breath of fresh air in cities with failed taxi services. The one billionth trip was taken in London on a Honda Insight Hybrid. To celebrate the occasion, the lucky rider is receiving a years worth of Uber rides, while the driver will be getting a well deserved holiday at a Uber city of his choice. Not bad for a short trip that only costs 5 (about RM32). To top it off, Uber is also making a charitable donation to an organisation at the neighbourhood where ride had started. Despite its political and regulatory hurdles, Uber has been growing quite rapidly covering hundreds of cities in 68 countries worldwide. It is said that they are currently doing 3 million trips a day which is substantially more than its competitor, Lyft. While they are doing well in most markets, Uber is also facing bans and suspension by some local authority such as Spain and Germany. Fortunately, it is still business as usual in Malaysia as it still operates in Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru. Despite protests by taxi drivers, SPAD (Land Transport Authority) has yet to implement new regulation for these new ride-sharing services. For riders, it is a better alternative to taxis without the hassle of haggling. At the same time, driving with Uber is an opportunity to make extra income which is more critical with the rising cost of living. At the current rate, Uber isnt slowing down and eventually it could possibly render car ownership redundant. Of course, this is only possible if it is extensive and affordable enough to do so. Already it is cheaper than most taxis and in some markets, it could be cheaper than taking a bus. Whatever regulation SPAD plans to enforce, we hope it would be beneficial to both consumers and the industry. Would you consider taking Uber daily if it is cheaper than buying a car?[ SOURCE, VIA ]"
Rory Lee,Mobile data in Malaysia is more affordable than you think,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/31/mobile-data-in-malaysia-is-more-affordable-than-you-think/,"internet data price,internet price,Malaysia,Malaysia Broadband Price,malaysia data price,malaysia internet price,malaysia mobile data price,mobile data,mobile data price,mobile data price malaysia","Industry in General,Players on the Field",2015-12-31,"If youre frustrated with how expensive your data plan is, or if you feel cheated by some mobile operators whoclaim to give you more Internet but limits usage to certain times of the day, we understand your pain. If youve been envying our neighbours in Indonesia, who are paying nearly half of what we pay for 1GB of data, we feel you too.But, if youre thinking of creating a blog to hate on our mobile carriers, citing examples of how much cheaper data is in our neighbouring countries, you might want to reconsider. This is because based on data collected by websiteTech In Asia, we actually have more affordable data  on average, per 1GB  than most countries in Southeast Asia.In their study, Tech In Asia compiled data from all the Southeast Asian countries and calculated what the typical price of 1GB (in USD) of data was. Then, they looked up the minimum wage of each country, (picking the typical wage of a low-income worker in Brunei, Singapore and Cambodia because they didnt have an official minimum wage) comparing it with the respective data costs.Finally, they used that data to estimate how many hours a worker would have to work to be able to afford 1GB of data and arranged the countries according to scale in a nifty infographic. The results of their study are as follows:Full infographic at the end of this postFrom the data, Malaysia is actually doing quite well, finishing within the top 5 of all the countries in SEA for the most affordable data, despite the fact that were paying nearly USD1.60 (RM6.88) more than Indonesia and almost USD1 (RM4.30) higher than Vietnam and Myanmar for 1GB of data. Thanks to our higher minimum wage, a Malaysian minimum wage worker would only have to put in 3 hours and 45 minutes of hard work to enjoy 1GB of data.Were still far off from Brunei though, who leads the pack at only 1 hour and 4 minutes of work needed for 1GB of data, despite their data costing USD2.67 (RM11.48) more than Malaysia. The power of a higher income nation eh?Another interesting bit of information is how incredibly low the price of mobile data in Cambodia is, coming in at a cool USD1.50/GB (RM6.45), sliding them into third place right behind Singapore despite their minimum wage being only USD0.66 (RM2.84) per hour.There is only one cause for concern: The accuracy of this data. Lets take Malaysia for example. Based on the infographic, we average USD4.42 per 1GB of data, which is roughly equivalent to RM19/GB. Are our plans that expensive?Lets take a look at the current prepaid data plans being offered by our Telcos:
XPAXHOTLINK FASTDIGITUNETALK DATATATAU MOBILE UMI*these are currently promotion ratesAcross these 18 different plans, the average (mean) cost of 1GB of data in Malaysia is RM18.68, which is pretty close to the average in the data set. Keep in mind the lower average value is likely because of the promotions that are currently active. Hashtag legit information (as far as Malaysia is concerned anyway).Its no secret that weve arrived at an era where everyone is obsessed with staying connected. In the past, only moderately large F&B chains offer free WiFi to their customers, but now even mamakshops have FREE WIFI signs pasted in and around their establishment. Why? Well, smartphones are getting more and more accessible for the masses and we all know that unless we keep our phones connected to the Internet, theyre little more than 180gbricks.But, we cant always rely on WiFi to stay connected. What if were on the train? Or in a cab? I mean, we cant just NOT send that tweet or NOT check if our new Instagram picture broke the 11-like barrier right? That would be absurd. As the citizens flailed about in a chaotic mess, crying out for a saviour, our local telcos came riding in on white stallions offering data plans like food to the hungry.Those who could afford it rejoiced while others griped about how expensive it was compared to our neighbouring countries  some of which could be considered less developed than we are. The problem with that is when you argue affordability based purely on how much a plan costs, youre leaving other crucial factors like income, development, penetration and even freedom of Internet, out of the equation.Thats like arguing whos the bestbadminton player based purely on how fast their smashes are.It seems that the folks over at Tech In Asia have had enough of this nonsense and thanks to them, we now have a better understanding (hopefully) of what affordability really means. That said, this chart doesnt appear to differentiate between connection speeds (4G LTE, 3G, 2G, etc) so that could be another factor affecting cost.Stability and coverage could also be another reason for the difference in cost. Wed much rather pay a little more for a wider and more stable data connection.What do you think of this infographic? Should carriers focus more on reducing cost or improving coverage and stability?

Itll be the Korean makers first ever all-metal smartphone too, according to a source involved in the organisation.The dominos have started to fall since the day before, as an image of a supposed camera setup of LGs latest smartphone was leaked but well hold that for later.LG V10 shownApparently the G5 will take some elements from the V10, as well as the older G-series that it hopes to successfully replace. That wont be all since a new device should come with new features  unless youre HTC and Sony.Now onto what specs we can expect on the LG G5. As mentioned earlier, itll be a metal unibody case and its purported to carry a 5.3-inch display capable of Quad HD (2560 x 1440) resolution. Why did they shave off 0.2-inches? Thats to make way for the secondary ticker display that has been shown on another LG device: the V10. We talked about what the ticker display does here.Besides that, LG will allegedly reduce battery capacity to only 2,800mAh, though the efficiency of the processor underneath the G5 will be the main factor when its comes to battery life; all signs point towards a Snapdragon 820 processor, while the G5 is said to have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.The ticker display might help with battery life too, being the only screen that lights up instead of the main display when notifications come in. This could mean that LGs new device could be thinner than its predecessor but well have to wait and see if thats the case.Evan Blass aka Evleaks and VentureBeat also mentioned that there was no talk of a microSD slot but theyve pointed out that external storage has always been conspicuous with LG devices. So in other words, a no mention doesnt mean it wont be there.In another act to market themselves differently from the pack, the source also claims that LG will include some sort of modular expansion through a feature called Magic Slot. Again, there was no talk of how this would be implemented but there were examples given to show what it could include: camera add-ons, audio amplifier and physical keyboard.We saved the camera leak for last as LGs cameras (of late) have been top notch. Based on an older leak, itll look something like this:Showing a dual-camera module, were forced to remember the pitfall of the Ultrapixel but well hope in earnest that LG doesnt screw this up. The main rear lens has been rumoured to be a 16-megapixel sensor and adding the secondary lens would allow wide-angle shots up to 135-degrees. The cameras will be separated by a module with four internal elements; two of them will be LED flash bulbs, one will be a laser autofocus and the last will be a similar RGB sensor.If all these specs have got you salivating  hold on  no word has got out of when itll be released. VentureBeat only managed to get a first quarter of 2016 range of when itll be out.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA ]"

But in terms of design it got weird, yes, were looking at you, Smart Battery Case.Weird or different, however you look at it, Apple might do it again. Just in a way thats more functional rather than aesthetically appealing. We say this due to new reports that cite Apple will make the iPhone 7 waterproof and it wont be made out of aluminium this time. DigiTimes claims that using this new material (whatever it is) plus sealing all the ports, grills and buttons will allow them fully classify the iPhone 7 as waterproof. Hopefully, theyll find a workaround for the flap enclosure like Sony has, otherwise, itll be quite frustrating having a flap for everything. But having said, they might just drop some ports all together as other rumours have said Apple will merge the lightning cable with the 3.5mm headphone jack.Their report goes on to state that Apple will likely rework the antenna lines that run along the device but they dont provide a how to the statement.

For example E1003 would be better than E1000, thats if a E1003 were to exist.OnePlus X shownWeirdly, it shares the looks more of a One Plus X, rather than the OnePlus 2, being more rounder around the edges and its backing receiving what looks like a glossy glass finish. At the same time, the front also looks to have capacitive keys.Based on the TENAA listing, itll be a 5-inch device, hence the Mini. The screen itself will feature a Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080) and itll have the infamous Snapdragon 810 SoC underneath its chassis. Surprisingly, the 810 processor on the Mini (2GHz) wont be under-clocked, as it was on the bigger One Plus 2 (1.8GHz); leaving us to believe that OnePlus has managed to solve thermal issues that were associated with the chipset in the past.OnePlus 2 shownThe other key internals differ from its big brother but the OnePlus 2 Mini doesnt fall far from its family tree. Itll get 3GB of RAM, instead of 4GB; 16GB of internal memory, instead of 64GB; and feature a microSD slot, unlike the OnePlus 2.Camera-wise, the 13-megapixel remains but its front shutter apparently gets bumped up to 8-megapixels from 5.

One of the sexiest words to come out of tech. The idea that you can swap out any old part on your smartphone for new one, but keep everything else exactly the same, is almost too alluring. Too bad it keeps getting delayed.Well, thank goodness for crowd-funding because now we have the next best thing: Modular smartphone cases.
The thing that makes the idea of a modular device, be it a smartphone, smartwatch, or, in this case, a smartcase, so brilliant is that it is completely customisable. For the first time the users themselves can decide exactly what they want or dont want to have on their device.Fancy a good camera? Get a powerful camera module. Need more juice to last you an entire day? Get a battery module. Want a chainsaw to go jungle trekking? Get aerr well, I dont think theres a module for that yet but Im sure you can see my point.Initially, people thought that a modular smartphone was the way to go, so companies like Google poured their resources into developing a modular smartphone, but it obviously that had its own host of problems too.Then, along came the people who founded nexpaq, a small group of talented individuals who wanted to bring the modular concept into the world on a much smaller scale: a smartphone case.Its something everyone uses, its something almost everyone needs and  perhaps most importantly  something far more accessible to the general public.Despite claiming to be cheaper than the smartphones we know and readily purchase today, purchasing a modular smartphone was always going to be a big investment. However, with a case like nexpaqs, a starter kit that includes a case and four modules would only set you back USD169 (around RM728).The best part? The folks at nexpaq are enlisting the help of the community to develop their modular smartphone case, releasing developer kits for both the modules and its accompanying software.Now, more are following suit, with the latest one coming from a company called i-Blades who have put up their version of the modular smartphone case, the i-Blades Smartcase. The i-BladesSmartcase is currently on Indiegogo looking for funding and the best part about it is that their modules can apparently stack infinitely.Your device would look like it has one of Apples Smart Battery Cases though, but I digress. If youre interested, head on over to their project page and check it out.I really do believe that modular devices are the future. I dont want some guy I dont know in a lab coat in some factory in the middle of China deciding what I should and shouldnt have on my smartphone. I want that power. Its my phone after all.That said, I dont think were quite ready for the modular smartphone just yet, but a modular smartphone case? I wouldnt mind me some of that.Baby steps, right?[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

Rory Lee,This could be the Samsung tablet worth waiting for,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/29/this-could-be-the-samsung-tablet-worth-waiting-for/,"Android,rumour mill,samsung 12 inch tablet,samsung 12 inch windows 10 tablet,samsung 12 inch windows tablet,Samsung Tablet,Samsung Windows 10 tablet,Samsung Windows Tablet,Windows,Windows 10","Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-12-29,"Lets face it. Android isnt the most optimised operating system for tablets. OK, its quite useless actually since you can do practically everything on your Android smartphone anyway.So maybe Windows 10, despite how incomplete and frustrating it is, is the way to go. Samsung certainly thinks so since what looks like their latest 12-inch Windows 10 tablet was just certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG.Rumours that Samsung were working on a 12 Windows 10 tablet have been floating around for quite some time now but this is the first piece of solid confirmation that this device is indeed in the pipeline. According to SamMobile Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG certifications are usually a good indicator that the device is on the way to the shelves soon.The 12-inch unit bearing the model number SM-W700 is said to feature a screen resolution of either 25601600 or 38402400. On the inside, the device will allegedly be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM.Some have said that the tablet may also come with an S Pen which, coupled with the full Windows 10 experience, could certainly improve productivity. If Samsung adds a keyboard accessory then we may have another Surface/iPad Pro challenger on our hands.As Android phones continue to get bigger, the equivalent OS tablet is becoming less and less relevant because people can already do so much on their phone. Front facing speakers plus a 5.7 Smartphone can provide just as much immersion (if not more) as a side/rear speakered7.9-inch tablet.Its just not worth carrying an extra device just so you have a slightly bigger screen. Keep in mind bigger, in this sense, doesnt always mean better as in general smartphones have a better pixel density than tablets and a better pixel density usually equals a better viewing experience.Let me put it this way, spreading a single cup of waffle batter over a baking tray the size of your palm would get you a thicker, fluffier, and more satisfying waffle versus spreading the same amount over a tray the size of a dining table.The same concept applies to screens. If you spread 1080p over a 5.7 display, youre bound to get a better screen than if it was spread over 12-inches of real estate.So if media consumption is not the best, productivity has to be the tablets redeeming factor, and in that Windows 10 beats Android hands down. Considering how wonky Windows 10 is, thats saying quite a lot about how unoptimised Android is for the big screen.The Korean electronics giant isnt the only one launching a Windows 10 tablet though as Xiaomi has just released its Mi Pad 2 in both Android and Windows 10. It has been a while since Samsung has launched a Windows-powered tablet but it seems that theyve recognised that if you want a tablet, Android is no bueno.[SOURCE]"

Both the Lumia 950 and 950 XL were plagued with bugs and poor (particularly plasticky) build quality which irked even the most steadfast of Windows Phone fans.Perhaps Microsoft simply doesnt know how to make good flagship mobile devices, but thats a tough claim to make considering not many are having a go at it.Until now.Early this month, a fancy new Windows Phone dubbed the HP Falcon was spotted on GFXBench. What caught everyones eye was the dragon it had beating at the heart of the device; a Snapdragon 820 to be specific. It was the first Windows Phone device to have been spotted with Qualcomms latest baby in the drivers seat.Whats more, the GFXBench entry also indicated that the device would feature a large 5.8 25601440 pixel panel with a 20-megapixel primary camera and a 12MP front-facing selfie camera.Mmm, yummy specs.There were some oddities, however, as memory was only listed at 1GB of RAM with a peculiar 43GB of internal storage. Then again, it isnt uncommon for manufacturers to configure the device differently when running benchmarks.In any case,it looks like there could be a monstrous Windows Phone (likely running Windows 10 Mobile) set to be released sometime next year.In fact, a new report out of Germanys Dr Windows claims that the device could see an official unveiling at the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona next February.However, the report also notes that HP has yet to give the project the final go-ahead. With specs that exceed even Microsofts own Windows flagship devices (plus it could be cheaper), could this be the Windows Phone messiah fans have been waiting for?We doubt it. Especially if Windows 10 Mobile doesnt receive the updates it needs in time. Though we havent spent time with the Lumia flagships, reports and reviews point to a worrying trend of incomplete (plus buggy) software, similar to that on the Surface line of 2-in-1 devices.Reviewers have noted some minor problems such as 4K video recording not working properly to big problems like the home screen disappearing entirely after an app crashes  something that happens quite often apparently  which shouldnt happen in a completed product. If these problems lie with Windows 10 Mobile, then all the hardware in the world wont be able to save the experience.It is admirable that it seems like HP wants to show Microsoft how to really build a Windows 10 Mobile flagship, but unless Redmond steps up its own game, the new device will likely not amount to anything. What a shame that would be.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

According to a leaked video, a purported S6 edge is shown running on a newer Android 6.0.1 software with TouchWiz. Under the Edge screen settings, the device is seen with more customisable panels covering tools and shortcuts, plus larger content widgets thrown in the mix. This is definitely a significant improvement over its current S6 edge features.

It offers a decent 4.7 HD 720p screen, dual-SIM slots and 4G LTE for under RM400. While the specs are impressive, the build quality is still quite plasticky, which is understandable for its low price tag. Following the release of its metal-clad Redmi Note 3, Xiaomi appears to be taking the same premium route for its upcoming budget device.The phone youre seeing here has just appeared on Chinas TENNA certification and it is believed to be the new Redmi 3. It gets an all metal back like its larger Redmi Note 3 but without a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Being a unibody design, the back cover doesnt seem to be removable, which means you cant replace the battery on your own. According to its purported spec-sheet, there will be a microSD expansion, which is likely to be housed on the SIM tray slot. The Redmi 3 is said to be having a slightly larger 5 HD 720p display and it is expected to run on a higher 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM. On-board storage is listed at 16GB and it also comes with a standard 13MP + 5MP camera combination. This is quite a huge step up, pushing the Redmi into the mid-range category, even if this was an enhanced version. With better specs and premium materials, we are curious if Xiaomi could maintain its affordable 699CNY (RM463) price tag as the Redmi 2. It is likely to priced higher but it shouldnt exceed its bigger Redmi Note 3 that starts from 899 CNY (about RM595). [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Piles upon piles of perfectly good food were thrown it out because they were slightly old, or looked a little less than perfect.The sad thing is that this is the same for most things, including smartphones. If youre a smartphone buyer, odds are you have bought more than one device. The only problem is, what do you do with your old phone when your new one arrives?Do you toss it out? Give it to a niece/nephew/child (lets be real they probably have better phones than your old iPhone anyway)? Try to sell it to on a certain popular local forum filled with lowballers? Well, Vmallnow has a new option for you.Vmall Malaysia is currently conducting a BETA test for their Trade-in & Go Green With Honor! programme, in collaboration with LTG Technologies, where  yep you guessed it  you can trade in your old devices and be compensated for it.You wont be getting money, though. Instead, youll be getting a Vmallcode which you can then use to redeem a Vmall voucher which you can use to purchase any device on the website.To put it in simpler terms:At this moment, the number of devices per manufacturer, with the exception being Apple and Samsung, is rather limited. Hopefully, they will add support for more devices further down the line.If your trade-in value is RM40 or higher, LTG will arrange for a pickup at your specified address free of charge. Once LTG receives your products, they will evaluate and see if your devices are worth the quoted amount. If they sign off on it, you will receive a Vmall voucher code of equal value to that of your devices.If they dont, they will inform you of the new value of your device, allowing you to decide whether or not you want to take the offer. If you dont respond within 3 days, they will automatically assume you accept the revised offer.The best thing about this programme is that you can register any amount of smartphones, from old and functioning to broken phones (yes they accept broken phones if it is within their criteria).However, remember to register all your devices at one go so that you receive a single code for a single voucher. Not only will this help you hit that RM40 free delivery sweet spot, it will also help when you make purchases on Vmall, because you can only use one voucher per purchase.Keep in mind that this programme is only in BETA but it is expected to go live sometime early next year. If youve had your eye on an honor or Huawei device, this seems like a pretty decent incentive to go and get one.[SOURCE]"

Can you tell whats hidden there?Now imagine all of that detail compressed into the body of a baby girl and youve only begun to scrape the surface of how difficult surgeon Dr Redmond Burkes operation was.Teegan Lexcen, a 4-month-old baby was admitted into the Niklaus Childrens Hospital in Miami, Florida because she was born with a misplaced heart. Without surgery, she would be dead by Christmas.The worst part? Doctorscouldnt see a way in to operate.I dont think I need to tell you how delicate heart surgery is, or how difficult it can be. It becomes nigh impossible when you dont have all the information you need.Burke says that surgeons need to be able to visualise the entire procedure before they step into the operating room, which is why many surgical teams passed on Teegans operation because they kept running into walls during this process: It seemed inoperable.Burke had the same problem as he had no way of knowing if a standard incision over the sternum would be enough, but inoperable was not a word he enjoyed using. Exhausting medical solutions, the team began looking for creative solutions and one particularly enterprising member uploaded the scans of Teegans chest to Sketchfab, converting them into 3D stereoscopic imagines, which allowed them to view it in VR.Virtual Reality. That was the answer. Burke said that with Google Cardboard and a smartphone he was able to see the patients entire heart by simply tilting his head. He could turn it and manipulate it as if he was already in the operating room.From there, Burke could see Teegans heart as well as her chest wall and with that information, he knew that a standard incision would indeed be fine.According to Burke, this solution came just in the nick of time; any longer and her kidneys may have suffered too much from her being put under. She would be alive, but on dialysis for the rest of her days.Were floored that a little bit of cardboard and a smartphone actually saved someones life. That and good old fashioned human ingenuity of course.Burke views every operation as possible and it was down to whether the doctor had the confidence to perform it or not. With VR he could visualise the steps in his head and help him come up with a plan of operation for his team which allowed him to save his patient.Seven hours later, little Teegan was all patched up and ready for Christmas and ho, ho, ho-pefullyfor many more Christmases to come.[SOURCE, VIA]"

We put these four heavyweights in the camera department to the 4K video recording test. And while we understand that most people out there wont have the technology to view 4K content, we decided that choosing the highest recording resolution for all four devices would be the fairest gauge.Duking it out will be:A slow but steady advancement of camera technology has us finding that most flagshipsmartphones are now capable of being the only devicewed use to take images and video, rendering point and shoots somewhat obsolete. Easily put  the best camera youll haveis the one in your pocket.How you use that technology will be dictated by the photography skills youve honedthroughout your journey, if theres one to begin with. That said, a professional photographer could definitely take better photos than someone that has little/no knowledge on the matter. Of course, when using a smartphone, you dont necessarily have to be knowledgeable in photography to begin with but have you seen those campaigns dedicated to showing off what these smartphone cameras are capable of?Apple has been running a campaign to show-off what the iPhones can do. Other smartphone makersdidnt bother following suit but you can check out their imaging and video capabilities through a quick search.When 4K video recording hit the scene back in 2013, we thought capturing content at that resolution was crazy; more so, when youre viewing it on screens that hover around 5-inches.But were not here to argue about whether Full HD or Quad HD screens are sufficient when it comesto actually viewing the content on them. Were here to see how 4 smartphones perform when tasked to handle the rough and bumpy Malaysian roads that often surprise you with a new pothole or two with every passing day  obviously, OIS would be important here.The following are a breakdown of the 4 respective specs:All four devices had some form of image/video stabilisation; the Nexus 6P uses software based technology, shared also by the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual which uses its own software-based two-stage SteadyShot stabilisation.On the other hand, Apple is the only one that uses solely hardware based stabilisation. Particularly special out of the bunch, the Galaxy Note5 uses both hardware and software video stabilisation but this combination is only available when shooting up to Full HD (1080p) at 30fps.We thought it was clear which came out on top but feel free to share your opinions."
Alexander Wong,This might be the best alternative to KLIA Express,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/30/here-is-a-cheaper-way-to-go-to-klia/,"Car Sharing,Comos,electric car,KLIA,KLIA Express,KLIA Express Alternative,Renault Zoe,Ride Sharing,Uber,Uber Malaysia","Cool stuff,Others",2015-12-30,"If youre a frequent traveler, KLIA Express (ERL) is the best way to get to Kuala Lumpur International Airport in under 30 minutes. With everything going up, the fares will be increased to RM55/way effective 1st January 2016. Thats a hefty RM110 for two people heading to the airport. Is there a cheaper alternative? What if we tell you theres another way of getting there with zero emission and it costs less than an Uber ride?COMOS, a ride-sharing provider that uses 100% electric vehicles has introduced an Airport Valet Service. For a flat rate of RM70, you can head to KLIA or KLIA2 in an electric-powered Renault Zoe. The service comes with a designated COMOS staff, so you can hop-on and hop-off without worrying about parking. Do note that the Renault Zoe is a compact hatchback, so the boot isnt as spacious as a typical sedan car. The COMOS Airport Valet service would cost you RM70 which is inclusive of GST, toll and delivery charges to your location. So that equates to RM35/person for a trip for two or RM23.34/person for 3 pax. On the downside, it is only available from 9:00AM to 4:00PM, and it covers just the following areas in the Klang Valley. If you havent tried COMOS before, the first step of getting a key card would take a while. You would need to register for a membership which now costs RM50 for 1 year (Normal: RM300). Once thats done, you can collect your COMOS card and start booking as follows:You are advised to request the service at least 2 hours ahead of the intended time and it is subject to actual availability of cars. You may book for the next day but the option is only available after 10:00PM. This is a cashless service and the final amount will be charged to your registered credit card. You can read up more about the service here.COMOS was introduced as an alternative means to car ownership. Being a ride-sharing service, you only pay for membership and usage fees according to your usage. At the moment, the rental costs RM6 for 15 minutes with a minimum booking of 30 minutes (RM12). For an all day usage, it will cost you a flat rate of RM144. With its fleet of electric cars, theres no fuel cost involved so you wont need to return the car with a full tank. There are several COMOS pick up stations located around PJ and KL with more being planned out in the near future. Currently all bookings are done via its website on comos.com.my and soon they will be releasing a mobile app for iOS and Android.Weve tried COMOS a couple of times and it is quite an experience driving a quiet vehicle that hums like a spaceship. Since its new, the number of stations with charging points are quite limited. It isnt really that cost efficient for simple point to point trips since youre required to return the vehicle to its limited pickup/drop off points. If youre making a stop, you would still need to pay for parking, which defeats the purpose of saving time and money. This would probably make more sense once they have more stations around strategic points including shopping malls and office complexes. If COMOS isnt viable due to timing and location, Uber is currently offering a flat rate of RM75 (excluding tolls) to KLIA/KLIA2. Theres no promo code required, and you can request anytime from now until 5th January 2016. Uber is available on Android, iOS and Windows Phone.If youre traveling alone, KLIA Express is still the cheaper option overall. Despite the RM55/way announcement, there are additional discounts if you book return tickets and purchasing them online or using specific credit cards. At the moment, Mastercard holders are entitled to a 20% discount. A return KLIA Express ticket cost RM100 and it will cost you just RM80 which is equivalent to RM40 per way. Thats basically RM5 more than usual RM35/way price. [ SOURCE ]"

Rory Lee,What if your car could see?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/23/what-if-your-car-could-see/,"autonomous cars,SegNet,self-driving cars",Cool stuff,2015-12-23,"Autonomous cars are the next big thing. Well, its actually the current-to-next big thing, but we digress. The point is that people are apparently bored of driving cars and want systems and programs to drive them around everywhere so that they can sit in the back seat and pretend to be Donald Trump.The only problem with self-driving cars is that they arent able to function properly in the real world as you simply cant replace human instinct and reaction when things on the road get challenging. Why? Because cars cant see in real time the way we do, so it makes it very difficult to make split second decisions when that double parked car pulls out suddenly.Apparently, now they can.
Thanks to SegNet, a new system created by the University of Cambridge, your dreams of being driven around by software might just come into fruition. SegNet can read the road in front if it, allowing it to differentiate various elements like the sky, other cars, road markings and even people.SegNet sees the road in an RGB image and then classifies different layers and objects using a Bayesian analysis of the scene. According to the release, the system can take an image of a street scene it hasnt seen before and classify it, sorting objects into 12 different categories in real time. It can also apparently deal with light, shadow and night environments and currently labels more than 90% of pixels correctly.Unlike laser/radar-guided systems that require expensive basesensors which cost more than the car itself, SegNet has been trained by a group of Cambridge undergraduates who manually labelled every pixel in over 5,000 images. Once that was complete, the researchers proceeded to train the system for over 2 days, after which one of the students notes that it is surprisingly good at recognising things in an image.From our testing, we tend to agree. It does a remarkable job at differentiating between the 12 elements though there is quite a lot of polishing to do, especially at night. As this system is trained though, it can only get better over time as it sees more images and learns to recognise more elements.One of the biggest problems about driving around in Malaysia is that the lines are never where they should be. Add that to the fact that people double park like there is no tomorrow and that the roads have potholes the size of Canada, even human beings would have trouble navigating our treacherous streets, what more a software?With this though, there is the potential to train the system to recognise these little nuances that make up our little snowflake of a country. Given the right circumstances, the possibilities are quite endless.

And we mean big feature.As our demands for smartphone performance and portability grows, manufacturers have often skimmed on battery life to ensure that their device stays as lean and mean as possible. But that means they hardly ever last a day, much less two days. Carrying a power bank or a charger has become a norm in our society.Acer has good news for those who want raw, unadulterated battery power, because their Liquid Z630 smartphone comes with an enormous 4,000 mAh replaceable battery. With a battery this size it becomes very unlikely that you will need to carry a powerbank around, much less another battery.In fact, that massive battery supports USB OTG (on-the-go) charging so you can even help a friend out by giving them a quick top-up if their device is running low on battery. Mighty handy in a pinch and for RM659, this is one of the most affordable and good valued devices with a 4,000 mAh battery that supports OTG charging in Malaysia.This is because the device itself does boast pretty decent specs, with a quad-core MediaTek processor clocked at 1.3GHz paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. This should ensure that everyday tasks and light to moderate application multitasking will go on without a hitch. It also has a 5.5-inch HD IPS panel and an 8-megapixel front and rear camera combo.8-megapixels is quite a lot for a front facing camera, especially in this devices price bracket. Even some flagship devices only rock a 5MP sensor. More megapixels mean that your selfies will be much more detailed and less pixelated.If you dont fancy such a big device, or you simply feel that you dont need all that battery power, Acer does offer a smaller device with a 5 HD IPS display, the Acer Liquid Z530. The name suggests that this smartphone would be a downgrade from the the Liquid Z630, but it also shares its bigger brothers internal hardware as well as camera optics. Thats a pretty good deal for RM559.Acer also has an entry level device in the Liquid Z line, the Liquid Z330, priced at RM439. It comes bundled with a 1.1GHz Snapdragon 210 quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM running underneath its 4.5 screen. That should be more than enough for you to get a feel of what the Android experience is all about, making this device the perfect starter smartphone for anyone.All three devices will have blazingly fast dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity and will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Acers Liquid UI running over it. Additionally, these devices will have the Acer Float Apps which essentially allows users to open more than one application and multitask at the same time. Acer also bundles a Float Caller which appears as a mini popup when a call comes in, letting the user decide how to respond without interrupting what theyre doing.Every one of the trio will also have what Acer calls the Quick Mode. The Quick Mode functions to allow users to pick between three customised layout options: Standard Mode (for those familiar with smartphones), Easy Mode (for those just starting out), and Basic Mode (locks down application and usage for kids).There is also a Kids Center application which grants parental control over the device for a safer browsing, viewing and playing environment for your child. These devices also come with Acers Bluelightshield which reduces strain on the eyes by reducing the amount of blue light emissions from the display.For more information, head over to Acers Liquid Smartphone page."

Based on the new diagrams, it seems that Samsung will keep to old habits and maintain a 5.2-inch screen on the Galaxy S7, while the curved Galaxy S7 edge variant will get a larger 5.5-inch display.Then on, things are pretty much the same, as information has shown that the rear of both Galaxy S7 should look very similar. Pointing towards the backings of these smartphones to feature the same metal and glass composition  a real sore of a fingerprint magnet.Taking a thorough look at the diagram, Android Authority spottedthat Samsung looks to have omitted the IR blaster this time around, continuing what theyve done on their larger devices: Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+.At the same time, a Korean tech site has released a different diagram, that reaffirms the two different sizings for the flat Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge.Based on earlier rumours and leaks, many have concluded that these bigger screens will also see Samsung implement pressure sensitive technology for the first time, if their patent filings were to materialise so quickly. Otherwise, there has been whispers of a microSD slot making a return; a feature that would be welcomed openly by those who strayed away from Samsung devices after dropping external storage all-together.Camera-wise, the new BRITECELL sensors that were revealed back in November should make an appearance as well. Touted to enhance low light performance by increasing sensitivity and reduce size too by 17%  leading us to assume the Galaxy S7 series will have a reduced camera bump.Its more than likely that Samsung will announce these devices during MWC 2016 in Barcelona, thats scheduled to begin on the 22nd of February, so be sure to expect more leaks as the date nears. Do let us know in the comments below what you make of this information and ifyoud consider getting a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA ]"
Arif Lee,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review: Best of the breed,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/24/microsoft-surface-pro-4-review-best-of-the-breed/,,,2015-12-24,"When you step in the shoes that were once filled by Bill Gates, you better hope that you fulfill your role. Steve Ballmer unfortunately took upon the intimidating task and his reign lasted a good 13 years. A robust character, Ballmer excelled in his early days but by 2012 stock prices were idling too long and that ensued criticism of dropping everything that he had managed to achieve. Many have speculated that the failure of Surface RT tablet was the last straw for Microsofts overseeing board of directors, with a US$ 900 million write off beinga mistake that couldnt go unnoticed.Two years after Ballmers retirement, Satya Nadella has filled some big shoes and it has been an upward journey so far. Akinto Ballmer,the Surface Pro 4 sits in a precariousposition as it has never been easy living up to your past successes.Microsoft said during their product launch that the Surface Pro 4 is measurable to the MacBook Air but we havent seen a refresh on that sinceMarch 2015. And that wasnt a huge facelift to begin with, so 2016 could really shape up to be a big year for laptops and convertibles; Apple says they wont bother making anything in-between the MacBook Air and iPad Pro but they may rework their formula  ala a Pencil instead of a stylus.Competition outside of Apple has everyone trying to emulate the Surface(s) and what they can do. The first name that comes to mind is the Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700, closely followed by HPs Spectre x2. These two try to do what the Surface Pro 4 does but they dont match up in terms of specs.This time around, more power equates to being more expensive. People might stay away hearing that, though we hope youll give this a read first before making any preconceived notions just based on the price."

Thats usually a buyers biggest criteria when looking for a smartphone. Its also what people look for when determining the value-for-money aspect of a device, as consumers will try their best to squeeze every bit of horsepower for as low of a price as possible.It is these buyers that were ultimately disappointed when HTC launched the One A9 because it had decidedly mediocre specs for a not-low-at-all asking price of USD400. In a world where smartphone manufacturers are churning out devices with incredible specs for an equally incredible low price, this is simply unacceptable. Thankfully, HTCs new hero device seems to rectify this problem, to some extent at least.Rumours have been floating around for awhile now about HTCs new One X9. Early leaks suggested that it could run thelatest top-of-the-line processor from Qualcomm or MediaTek, which reignited the fire within the hearts of many an HTC fan. However, as time progressed, the rumours changed and on paper it looked like the One X9 was going to be another disappointment.Well, the device has finally come out from the shadows and at first glance, it definitely doesnt look like the flagship device everyone was clamouring for. Then again, since this was launched this year, were we realistically expecting it to outperform the One M9 especially since it doesnt even bear the M badge?The One X9 sports a 5.5 1080p panel (though there doesnt seem to be any information on whether it will be an AMOLED or IPS screen) which results in a pixel density of 401 ppithat HTC claims has a 170-degree viewing angle. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 processor and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of internal storage. Thankfully, HTC has included a microSD slot that allows expansion up to 2TB.It will also feature a reasonably large 3,000 mAh battery and support for dual-SIM. Optics-wise, the device sports a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with optical image stabilisation and 4K video recording, plus a 5MP f/2.8 front-facing shooter. It is likely that the device will come pre-loaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, much like the HTC One A9.Although the specs are nothing to shout about, the device does bring back HTCs much-loved BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers, something that is missing from its smaller brother, the One A9. HTC also went further down nostalgia alley, bringing back their backlit capacitive keys, which is placed where the HTC logo usually goes. One aspect that will be missed is the absence of a fingerprint sensor, something that is available on the HTC One A9.Another serving of good news is that the metallic smartphone looks to retail at a lower price than the One A9, coming in at 2,399 Yuan, which translates to around RM1,598. Yes, if you did pick up on it, the retail price is in CNY which means that this device  as of now  has only been launched in China with no information about availability elsewhere. This device, it seems, represents HTCs stab at trying to get a bigger cut of the affordable premium smartphone market by competing with other Chinese manufacturers on their home soil.If you think horsepower is the be all and end all of smartphones, then this HTC One X9 will look like another disappointing HTC hero device that could have been so much more. It isnt the best value-for-money device out there, but is a devices worth measured only by how well it does on benchmarks? Sure, 4GB of RAM looks good on paper, but can you realistically feel the difference between 4GB and 3GB of RAM?Fit and finish has always been one of HTCs strongest selling points. That and their front-facing speakers, both of which can be found on One X9. It honestly doesnt look too bad either  except for that slightly sketchy camera visor  and based on the companys track record, they certainly know how to do metal unibodies. The devices closest competitor would probably be the Sony Xperia M5 Dual, and based on build alone, we definitely prefer a metal finish to the Xperia M5 Duals fingerprint-magnet glass-plastic construction.With proper optimisation, these specs should get you through day-to-day usage without a hitch and for a frankly reasonable price tag, this doesnt seem like that bad a deal for HTC fans. Yeah, sure, you wont be able to brag about it to your friends but then again, there arent that many brag-worthy HTC devices to begin with. With HTCs flagships only managing tostay afloat as well as the Titanic could, perhaps the midrange premium marketis where they can reclaim some of their former glory.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"
Alexander Wong,Heres all you need to know about Prepaid and GST for 2016,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/28/malaysia-prepaid-gst-reload-refunds-2016/,"budget 2016,DiGi,DiGi Prepaid,gst,GST Prepaid,GST Rebate,GST Reload,Hotlink prepaid,Malaysia GST,prepaid,Prepaid GST Refund,Prepaid Reload,Prepaid Reload GST,Prepaid Top Up,Top Up GST,Tune Talk,TuneTalk,Xpax,Xpax Prepaid","Celcom,DiGi,Hotlink,Industry in General,Players on the Field,TuneTalk,U Mobile,XOX",2015-12-28,"Beginning 1st January 2016, all prepaid reloads in Malaysia will be sold without the extra 6% charge. This is in line with the directive to exempt prepaid reloads from GST. It doesnt mean that prepaid is free from GST, as it will be charged upon usage, instead of being paid upfront. Fortunately, the government will be offering GST rebates as announced during Budget 2016. To address concerns, MCMC has published the full details ahead of its implementation on new years day Beginning 1st January, a RM10 prepaid reload will be sold at RM10, while a RM30 prepaid reload is sold at RM30 just like the old days. So youre getting a full ringgit to ringgit value without the extra 6% charge. The official FAQ also states that old top up tickets must be sold at the original price without the extra 6% charge. At the moment, several prepaid brands are offering extra bonus and rewards if you top up by 31st December.However with the new mechanism, the GST charge will kick in when you reload. So after activation of a RM10 top up, youll get RM9.43 airtime with RM0.57 (6%) being deducted for GST. To the regular consumer, it appears to have no difference since eventually youre getting 6% less versus paying 6% more. This will be running from 1st January until 31st December 2016 and theres no mention if it will be extended to the following year. The good news, of course, theres a full GST rebate on prepaid usage. This will be applicable only to Malaysian citizens based on the NRIC or police/army identification number during registration. According to MCMC, the 6% GST will be refunded within 24 hours. So if youve topped up RM10, you should be getting the earlier deducted RM0.57 back to your prepaid account. In a nutshell, Malaysians should be able to enjoy the full reload amount but provided that youre registered. You are advised to check with your telco provider to ensure they have your correct details. The GST rebate is only for prepaid users, so Malaysian postpaid users will still continue to incur the 6% charge in their monthly bills.All domestic use including phone calls, SMS, mobile services and data are GST chargeable. International roaming including data usage overseas are zero rated and non-Malaysian prepaid users are also eligible for a refund.

Effective next year, all prepaid reloads will no longer include the 6% GST, so a RM10 top up will be sold at RM10. Should you hold out on your new reloads until the new year? As the transition is taking place with new reload cards entering the shelves, a couple of telcos are dishing out special offers that will give you more than your moneys worth. Read on to find out what offers are available.For Digi, they are giving an extra 8% bonus on top of your actual airtime. So if you purchased a RM10 topup at RM10.60, youll be getting 80 sen bonus extra. The bonus airtime will be will be given to you within 72 hours and this is only applicable until 31st December 2015. According to the FAQ, this is only applicable to the current reload cards that carry the prefix 10. The newer reloads that are sold without GST (RM10 RRP=RM10 Airtime) or carries the prefix 11 will not be entitled to the 8% bonus. The free airtime will be valid only for 5 days. For Xpax Prepaid by Celcom, they are doing something similar but they are giving only 6% extra. This is basically matching the same value ringgit to ringgit based the retail price. So a RM10.60 top up will grant you an extra RM0.60 airtime, giving a total value of RM10.60. Strangely, the Xpax offer is only valid until 30th December 2015. Like Digi, the extra airtime will be granted within 72 hours, but take note that this is only applicable for domestic use only (not for roaming). TuneTalk probably has the most generous offer of all. With a RM100 top up, they are giving RM20 extra airtime plus 3GB of mobile data. To redeem this, you would need to perform a single RM100 reload using the official TuneTalk app thats available for both Android and iOS. The 3GB data will last for 30 days and any excess usage will be charged at 5 sen/MB if there are no other internet plans active. The promo is valid until 31st of December 2015, so you better hurry."

A few months ago, weve reviewed the Samsung Gear VR Innovator Edition and it offers an immersive experience when paired with a Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Retailing at RM799 back then, it is quite an expensive toy if compared to a Google Cardboard. However you do get a proper hands-free usage and it even comes with hardware control buttons at the sides. Now Samsung Malaysia has brought in a new one that supports more models and most importantly, a lower price tag. Dubbed simply as the Gear VR, the new version is more affordable at RM459 (inclusive of GST). With its new flagship phablets around, the new Gear VR now supports 4 models  Galaxy Note5, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. Compared to the Innovator Edition that weve tried with the S6, the new version uses a softer upper strap without the hard piece, that secures the headset across your head. You do however still get a touchpad on the right which is slightly improved for better feel at the fingertips. The optical components remain unchanged with a 96 degree field of view and a 54-70 IPD coverage. The Gear VR also gets additional controls which include a volume rocker, back button and a manual dial at the top for minor focus adjustments.

Not only were these devices supposed to give the best Android experience of any smartphone, they also shored up what was traditionally every Nexus devices weakness: the camera. Even more excited than others were the fans of Googles old Nexus 5 because they finally had an upgrade to their beloved 4.95-inch phone.Well, that was until it melted in one of their pockets.User AFChimpanse took to the /r/Android forums yesterday and shared a story about how his/her brand new Nexus 5X had a meltdown, literally. According to the OP (original poster), the device was sitting in his/her pocket when suddenly it started heating up. When the OP took it out, it continued to heat up and started producing a low frizzling sound releasing an extremely toxic smell. The smartphone eventually got too hot to hold in the hand and the OP had to put it down.When (were assuming the frizzling had died down) the device was picked up again, the user noticed that a portion of the back cover to the right of the LG logo had melted inwards. User DarcyFitz and GlassHalfFull pointed out that it should be a battery issue judging from the location of the melted bit relative to the devices internals identified by iFixits teardown photo:According to AFChimpanse, the device was only 11 days old and had never been plugged into a third-party charger before. So I guess we can rule out faulty cables as a cause.While there is nothing official to validate the users claims, this isnt the first time a smartphone has exploded, as there have been cases where this OnePlus One and this Samsung Galaxy S3 (though this was because of a counterfeit battery) suffered a similar fate.Most smartphone batteries are filled with chemicals that could potentially be triggered if it endures excessive force or physical trauma, as can be seen in this video by TechRax below:Although you might not be taking a hammer to your device, there is a chance that these devices may come in contact some unfavourable conditions which may cause undesired reactions. Unfortunately, when it comes to phones you stop drop and roll so if your phone is getting a little hotter than usual, our suggestion would be to take it out of your pocket immediately. We dont think this is the type of explosion youd want in your pants.As you know, the Nexus 5X isnt officially available in Malaysia, but you can get it through DirectD. If you own a Nexus 5X yourself, do drop us a comment if youve experienced any overheating issues or if you think your device smells funny.[SOURCE]"

While one could make the argument that previous Nexus devices were geared more towards those with experience rather than the mass market, we feel that the Nexus 6P is the first truly mainstream Nexus device that we would have no problem recommending to anyone.Its got great software, a great camera, a great screen, and a premium build with a premium price to boot. Naturally, more and more people who are not so entrenched, some inexperienced, in the ways of the Android (sorry coming off a Star Wars high here) would be enticed to purchase this device.If you are one of those people and the entire universe of Android customisation seems a little too overwhelming, fret not, weve got you covered.

The Lenovo Vibe S1 with two selfie cameras has officially arrived in Malaysia. This mid-range device allows you to do more than just taking a standard picture of yourself. The unique dual-camera concept is quite similar to HTCs Duo Camera setup and Lenovo is taking it to the front seat for better selfies. It consists of an 8MP main camera and it is assisted by a 2MP secondary unit that helps with depth of field. This allows you to take creative blur shots with refocusing and bokeh effects. It is a shame that it doesnt come with a front facing flashlight. If you need to take better lit selfies, you can always pop-in an optional VIBE Xtension selfie flash that plugs into the headphone jack. For regular photoshoots, the rear of the Vibe S1 has a 13MP ybut with Phase Detection AF, and it is assisted by dual-tone LED flash. As for the phone, it gets a 5 Full HD IPS display and it is powered by a 64-bit MediaTek MT6752 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board, it gets a generous 32GB of storage which is expandable with microSD. Like most smartphones today, it supports 4G LTE and has Dual-SIM slots.

If youre unaware TM is nowofferings 30Mbps / 50Mbps download speeds but at a lower monthly fee  you can read about them here.Looking at average peak connection speeds, we managed slightly better, at the 54th spot but our broadband providers still have room to improve. Our government has allocatedRM 1.2 billion on expanding internet access points for non-urban locations, upping the current 5Mbps speeds to 20Mbps and were likely to see these measures starting to show in the coming year. According to Ooklas speedtest report for Malaysia, it seems thatour 4G LTE enablednetwork operators are capable of delivering speeds faster than fixed broadband. In developed markets, it should be the other way around.The stark reality is that itll be hard to roll-out this basic need (by our standards) to rural areas, especially in East Malaysia  where even the major states have a lack of accessibility for high-speed broadband. An issue that still haunts most Malaysian users on TMs network, is the fact that theyre still on Streamyx broadband, a lower-end network that offers slower speeds at a unappealing price. In retrospect, the most affordable Streamyx plan is offered at RM 116.60 per month for 1Mbps, which means it makes more sense for consumers to jump to UniFi, if its available in their area.Hopefully, we can only move onwards and upwards, hoping that eventually the basic networks infrastructures will be opened up for other competitors, making the internet more affordable for all of us.[ SOURCE ]"

Whats the point of having fast internet if you dont have enough quota? Thats like having a Ferrari with a tiny fuel tank!The folks at Celcom apparently is aware of the increasing needs of its customers and they have just announced what they claim to be the greatest internet plans yet. How about 40GB of internet at just RM100 a month?Not to be confused with the Celcom First Blue and Celcom First Gold plans revealed not too long ago, Celcom has introduced another similar sounding postpaid product thats designed for data-only users. Basically for those needing a data SIM for their tablets and possibly MiFi devices. The star of the show is the Celcom First Gold Internet plan that offers a whopping 40GB of internet. Before you get too excited, mind you that the actual mobile data is only 6GB and it gets an extra 4GB for weekend use (1GB per weekend). The balance 30GB? Thats coming from off-peak (1am-7am) mobile data quota of 12GB and Celcom WiFi quota of 6GB plus additional 12GB WiFi quota for off-peak (1am-7am) use. Seriously who uses Celcom WiFi, let alone being able to access one during off-peak hours? Even the WiFi coverage map gives an impression that its as wide as their mobile network.If youre a light data user, the Celcom First Blue Plan offers an accumulative 6GB of internet for RM45/month. Basically, this is the same perks as the normal Celcom First Blue postpaid plan for smartphones. Both First Blue Internet and First Gold Internet options let you carry forward unused data up to 2GB and 6GB respectively to the following month. Note that these new plans are data-only, so you cant use it for phone calls, but strangely SMS is permitted. According to Celcom, they will be offering bundled iPad contract plans from as low as RM1,268. The latest iPad Pro 128GB will be offered too but so far theres no details from Celcom on its bundled pricing."

The Maxis Zerolution program is a refreshing way of owning a device without the hefty upfront payments that come with traditional postpaid contracts.

Rory Lee,It looks like John Chen isnt done pissing BlackBerry fans off,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/22/it-looks-like-john-chen-isnt-done-pissing-blackberry-fans-off/,"blackberry,BlackBerry PRIV,BlackBerry Priv discount,BlackBerry Priv price cut,John Chen,priv discount,Priv price cut","Android,BlackBerry,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Promotions",2015-12-22,"What do you do when one of your devices fails to meet sales targets? You take drastic measures, thats what. Take a look at action camera maker GoPros dramatic slashing of the GoPro Hero4 Sessions price, effectively halving its original USD400 price tag. It was simply too expensive for what it did and how it stacked up against GoPros own line, what more the competition.BlackBerry CEO John Chen apparently has the same idea because he recently said that the companys latest (and only) Android smartphone, the PRIV, will be receiving a price cut next year. So, early PRIV adoptersoops?When everyone found out that the slider device would see an official launch in Malaysia, everyone began speculating on a price for BlackBerrys flagship device. Simply converting its exorbitant American pricing of USD699 to our frankly depressing Ringgit, yielded a figure close to RM3,000 which caused some distress among the smartphone community.Then we found out that the PRIV would be sold at RM3,559 and everyone went nuts. Why would anyone ever pay that much money for a smartphone?Privilege, BlackBerry says. It was the only BlackBerry device running Androidwhich made it just another Android smartphone, of which we have plenty and plenty that are better. Privacy, they added. It was supposed to be Androids state-of-the-art device in terms of securitybut it doesnt even have a fingerprint sensor. I think we can start to see why this device didnt do as well as they wanted it to.To make matters worse, the smartphone didnt feel like it was RM1,000 more premium than any of the other Android flagships. Performance then? Nope, it is smooth, but so is every other flagship device. Aha! The PRIV brought BlackBerrys physical keyboard over, a big plus point when it comes to BlackBerry phones! Uh, nope. Based on our hands-on with the device at the launch event, the keyboard felt a little too soft and was nowhere near as satisfying to type on as older BlackBerry phones.It seems then that the Hail Mary phone that was supposed to be the saviour for the Waterloo-based company, would instead end up being the final nail in its coffin. Seems like dire straits for John Chen, so he recently made an announcement that the device would receive a price cut around the time of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which will be held from February 22 to 25.Due to the obvious fact that the other smartphone manufacturers would be releasing new devices, John Chen said that the PRIV would receive a mid-life kicker in addition to its price cut to hopefully remain competitive in the free market. He seems optimistic enough though, since he said that if the PRIV performs well, they will launch an affordable mid-range device. John, maybe you should start with that next time.While we dont think that they would halve the price the PRIV, we do hope that it receives a significant enough price cut to remain competitive. The thing is, even if they cut RM1,000 off its price, would you buy the PRIV over, say, a Samsung Galaxy Note5 or a Nexus 6P? Do, let us know in the comments belowbecause we know we wouldnt.[SOURCE]"

Weve just seen a spacecraft do the impossible, the first BIG step for man into space travel and smaller steps towards colonising Mars  Elon Musks long-term mission through SpaceX. Launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the Falcon 9 has just made huge advancements in reusable rockets.Lets now talk about what SpaceX is all about. One of many of Elon Musks brainchilds, Space X is a private space company and theyve done some amazing things  launching the Falcon 1 in 2008 being one of them, leading to NASA handing them a contract worth US$ 1.6 billion. Fast-track through their history, the space capable delivery service (yes, we said it) has delivered 15 deliveries, some for NASA, and some for satellite missions. Though 6 months ago, SpaceX received a rude awakening, after 20 successful stints, the predecessor of the Falcon 9 blew up on the way up.So what did they do today that is such a big deal?They launched a rocket, went into orbit, released 11 satellites, floated sideways (in orbit), re-entered Earths atmosphere and made a successful propulsion based landing. Its a big deal because once someone does (did) this, it translates to a major breakthrough for the aerospace industry. A mode of transportation that can be reused, over multiple occasions for travel but through space! Making future travel into space a whole lot cheaper.
This was the game-plan that the company laid out for the successful launch today:
*click for a bigger image*SpaceX just did something that was never done before by country-backed space programs  NASA, China and Russia included. These programs have spent an unimaginable amount of money to propel the human frontier into space and it has been more about showing who has the biggest package so to speak rather thanbringing people to other planets.Successfully launchingthe Falcon 9 today, the companywillcontinuously innovate their technology, eventually making the overall cost of space travel a lot cheaper in the long-run.Well I guess Musks mission of colonising Mars just got a lot more realistic.Putting this scene in a much smaller scale:Looking forward, SpaceX will hope to allow people to buy a ticket to Mars for only US$ 500,000  an anthill compared to the figure estimated by NASA back in 2004, US$ 10 billion per person. Their next step is making the Mars Colonial Transporter a reality, a spaceship that will hold at least 100 people.Musk hopes that by 2070, a high-tech metropolis will exist. on Mars and we hope that it becomes a reality.Watch the whole spectacle here:[ SOURCE, VIA,2 ]"

Many, ourselves included, felt that Microsoft shipped an unfinished product. From what we gathered, it isnt the hardware that the Surface users are unhappy about, rather it was the software implementation that let the devices down.Whats worse, Microsofts solution to the problem was an apology on their forums which only served to irk more users. Now though, they seem to have actually come up with a solution to at least one of their problems.Besides the issues with the devices power drainage during sleep and random reboots, one other nagging issue was the Surface devices keyboard and touchpad. The much improved Surface Pro 4 Type Cover keyboard was so advanced, it seemed, that it didnt deem the Surface Pro 4 a worthy device and thus refused to pair with it properly. The Surface Pro 4 had issues connecting with its keyboard, especially when removing the Type Cover and reattaching it, bugging out the mouse cursors and other modes for Continuum.For us, the problems were more rudimentary when it came to the Surface Pro 4. We found out that if the keyboard was attached when the device was off, it wouldnt detect the keyboard when we switched it on, forcing us to disengage and reattach the keyboard to the device.This update also affects Surface Book users, where apparently the device had problems with its touchpad and keyboard as well. Here are theSystem hardware update: 12/17/15changelogs:If you were anywhere near as excited as us for the launch of the Surface Pro 4, and dropped a considerable chunk of your savings to get one with the Type Cover keyboard, Im sure you were equally crestfallen when you discovered that Microsoft already knew the device had issues yet still decided to put it in the market.While doing something like this is, frankly, unforgivable, youd think that a company as big as Microsoft would have some kind of fix ready almost immediately after it put an unfinished product on sale. Instead, they said that major fixes would only be coming next year.In any case, these problems seem to be software based, and fixable via updates so if youve bought a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book device, our advice is to hunker down and weather this initial storm in the hopes that your device will eventually live up to its full potential.If youre still on the fence about purchasing one, stay tuned to our upcoming review of the Surface Pro 4 where we will be taking a close look at the device, all of its problems, fixes and more.[SOURCE]"

And if all Indians vote. I think we can make it happen!From the super sweet list below, itll be tough to see anything other than something sweet make the list:Android is widely adopted across the globe and while most of these nicknames have their namesake desserts/sweets originating from western countries, maybe Google will let globalisation do its own thing, allowing international sweetsto be a part of the fun.Heck maybe when the list continues along the alphabet, youll see an Android (O)nde-Onde or Android (P)isang Goreng  okay that probably wont happen but well keep on wishing.Heres the entire Q&A session on video:

Your CEO tells you to come to the office not in office attire but in beach wear, and he tells you to bring your passport and a packed suitcase. What do you do?So this happened at Maxis.CEO Morten Lundal told all his staff to prepare for a beach holiday, which meant dressing up in beach wear, bringing a valid passport and packed suitcase, when they came to work on Thursday (Dec 17).On the day, Morten did an unplanned town hall and randomly picked the names of 13 lucky Maxis employees. All of them won an all-expenses VIP trip for two to Bali. Right after the announcement, the winners were chauffeured to KLIA and were soon on their way to Bali, just like that.Its refreshing to see a company with such a fun and dynamic CEO like Morten. And those who got picked to go on the trip certainly got a huge morale boost. I like companies that do crazy things like this and I guess Morten subscribes to the belief that if you take care of your employees, your employees will take care of your customers. And if your customers are happy, your company should be doing ok.Some may disagree but I think Maxis is one of the better mobile operators in Malaysia. They are not perfect but theyre doing the right things.I hope the positive vibe that Morten is spreading to his employees carries through to the customer experience. And as a Maxis customer, I certainly wouldnt mind getting a phone call from Morten out of the blue telling me that I got chosen to go on an all-expenses paid beach holiday. That would make me happy.What do you guys think?"

Alexander Wong,Soon all Chinese smartphones might look the same,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/21/oppo-coloros-3-0-android-alpha-release/,"Android,ColorOS,ColorOS 3,ColorOS 3.0,MIUI,Oppo,OPPO OS","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2015-12-21,"Android is currently the most popular mobile platform and unlike Apple, it is driven by several device manufacturers. While the underlying operating system is the same, each brand would have their own customised skin to differentiate themselves from the rest. For the regular consumer, the custom interface adds more value and nifty features which doesnt come stock standard. Of course, there are others that will consider pre-installed software as unnecessary bloatware, and proclaim plain vanilla is the way to go. Whichever side you pick, lets take a look at the Chinese manufacturers. With Apple seen as a status symbol, most of these Chinese smartphone UI lacks an App Drawer. Yes, it can be simple for first timers but power users might find it cluttered or annoying when it comes to organising their home screens. Of course, another popularity with Chinese Android UI is the wide availability of themes that you can customise to your preference.So Xiaomi has their MIUI, while Huawei has their very own EMUI. On the current version, EMUI looks awfully similar to Xiaomis own interface from the flat icon design, to the minimalistic approach for its built-in apps such as phone dialer, alarm clock, stopwatch, toggle switches and even the menu page. Even the shutdown menu interface thats displayed after long pressing the power button looks the same as well. Just recently, images of OPPOs new ColorOS 3.0 has surfaced, and it looks awfully familiar with both custom interfaces. The photos youre seeing here is an OPPO R7 Plus that runs on ColorOS 3.0.0_151216_Alpha. At first glance, it looks like another honor device if you didnt notice the ColorOS and OPPO branding. So far theres no word of its release but it is likely to be running out of the box with their upcoming 2016 models. Disappointingly, it still runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop instead of the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow.At the rate these Chinese companies are going, they all might end up looking the same and the only difference is the exterior and the logo plastered at the back. What do you guys think? Do you fancy these app-drawerless interfaces or the mainstream offering from Samsung, HTC, ASUS and Sony?[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

No surprise as the USD to MYR was searched highly too, followed by GST and the Bersih 4.0 rally.For the top 10 most searched individuals list, it seemed that Malaysians looked for information regarding notable people who passed away during the year. That includes, the late: Lee Kuan Yew, Former Prime Minister of Singapore; Paul Walker, the famous actor that passed away during a car crash; and Kevin Morais, the murdered deputy prosecutor.Our current Prime Minister was also on the list, while athlete Farah Ann Abdul Hadi made her way on it as well (for obvious, gymnastic attire reasons). People also kept up with international news, as searches for the missing QZ8501 airplane, the Paris Attacks and ISIS, topped the list for trending news searches.The list of searches really show what were looking for, be it happenings of the worldor an important individual. Given the growth of the Internet and Google being one of the go-to search engines (seriously, who still uses Yahoo or Bing?), well continue to seewhat sort of information our country is keen to look for, hopefully John Cena wont make the list again next year.For a full low-down on what Malaysians looked for on the internet, head on over to the full-list here."
Rory Lee,HTCs One X9 has one interesting camera visor,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/15/htcs-one-x9-has-one-interesting-camera-visor/,"Android,HTC,HTC One M9,HTC One X9,htc one x9 leak,rumour mill,smart phone,smartphone,smartphone leak","Android,HTC,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-15,"HTC is going through a rough patch lately. Not only did their flagship device lose out to high-end flagships from other manufacturers like Samsung and Apple, it was also plagued with controversy as its Snapdragon 810 was running way too hot, all of which led to plummeting sales. Then in hopes of pulling more sales, they launched the One A9 which has been accused of looking like a carbon copy of the iPhone 6/6s, though was rather well received by critics. On paper, the One A9s specs were far from being a world beater, with only a Snapdragon 617 processor mated with 2GB of RAM, so it left many HTC fans who desired a worthy flagship wanting more.Then, the Taiwanese company gave fans another glimmer of hope when the HTC One X9 leaked online with what looked to be promising specifications.Now, more pictures of the device have also been leaked and it looksdifferent to say the least.Based on the pictures, the new addition to the One lineup looks to have a couple of very interesting design choices. The first, and most obvious of which, is that camera visor ala-Nexus 6P that stretches across the top of the device right around the camera module.When images of the Nexus 6P were first leaked and people saw the visor, they were a little apprehensive to it and how it seemed to havetainted what could have been a good looking device. Now though, that visor has become a signature of the latest Nexus device and at a glance, people can easily differentiate it from its less powerful brother the Nexus 5X. The thing is, while Huawei decided to set that visor apart, letting it dominate in its blackness across the top of the phone, HTC seems to have tried to hide their visor by painting it the same colour as the rest of the device.Again, apprehensive is the word we could best use to describe those looks. That said, taste varies between the individual so there obviously will be people who completely dig that look. Around the front of the device, HTC seems to have gone retro with the inclusion of capacitive buttons along the bottom of the device (where their logo usually is) while the HTC logo has moved to the devices forehead. There also seems to be, what looks like, a pair of front facing speakers (which we hope are BoomSound speakers) as well as a front facing camera.The HTC One X9 recently passed through Chinese certification authority TENAA. revealing what looks to be some frankly disappointing specifications. It looks like the device will be running an octa-core 2.2GHz processor (which rules out the Snapdragon 820 and Helios X20 rumoured earlier) mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable via microSD up to 1TB. The smartphone also looks to sport a 5.5 full HD IPS display (19201080 pixels).In terms of optics, the device will get a 13MP primary camera with an LED flash and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter on the front. It is also rumoured to run Android 5.0.1 Lollipop (likely with HTCs Sense UI on top) out of the box. To be fair, we couldnt really expect this to be a full-fledged flagship device, especially since it doesnt bear the M badge. One could hope, right?[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

They flooded the online stores on Lazada and Vmall which resulted in an impressive 1,000 Nexus 6P units sold on launch day itself. However, purchasing anything online can be rather risky because sometimes, mix ups can happen.Local Ian Oz found this out the hard way. He, like many other Nexus 6P fans, ordered the device off Lazadas website, however, when the package arrived, instead of unwrapping a brand spanking new smartphone,Ian unwrapped a pair ofearrings? Oh dear.
(click to enlarge)It turns out Lazada had somehow screwed up the order and sent Ian six pairs of earrings (worth RM58), which were initially meant for someone named Irene Yeow. The worst part was that based on the receipt, Irenes earrings were meant to go Johor, which in case you didnt know, is in another state.As it looks like Lazada had mistakenly stuffed the earrings into the Nexus 6P package, it seems likely that Ians smartphone was stuffed into the earrings package. The good news is that there is a contact number included in the shipping invoice. Ian, obviously outraged, took his irritation onto the social media, posting a picture of his receipt on Huaweis Facebook page. Luckily, Huawei responded fairly quickly and ensured Ian that they had escalated the problem to their core fulfillment team and Lazada.What we dont understand is how a mistake like this could be made in the first place. On the Pos Laju statement, it clearly states that the package should weigh 0.2kg (Nexus 6P weighs around 178g) which reflects the devices weight, but it seems unlikely that six pairs of earrings would weigh the same as Googles latest device.Nevertheless, paying RM58 for a brand new Nexus 6P seems like a phenomenal deal. Where can we sign up for it? In all seriousness though, we wish Ian luck in the retrieval of his device because we know how terrible it must feel to pay over two and a half thousand ringgit only for your shipment to be messed up. If you were thinking about getting the Nexus 6P, perhaps it would be wiser to purchase it from Vmall.my, which is Huaweis official online store.[SOURCE]"

Well, Google has the next best thing. Ahead of the official Malaysian premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Google has thrown together an interesting new Chrome web browser experience that lets you wield a lightsaber to fend off First Order Stormtroopers.The Lightsaber Escape game uses a simple mechanism that lets you wield your phone as if it was a lightsaber and slay Stormtroopers on either your laptop or computer in an attempt to escape a space station. Heres how you play: Simply log on to the Lightsaber Escape websitewith your laptop or computer, then enter the URL displayed on the resulting web page into your phone. Oncethere, your phone should begin calibrating its accelerometer and upon completion, turn into the lightsaber it was always meant to be. You can then either play it on your computers monitor or cast/hook it up to a projector and have some theater level fun like we did.When youre calibrated and past the tutorial mission, thats when the real fun begins. The game takes you on an on-rail action adventure through a space station filled with Stormtroopers who happen to be surprisingly accurate. With your trusty lightsaber equipped, you will engage in ranged combat, where you deflect blaster fire back at your attackers, as well as melee combat. We havent made it far enough into the game where weve encountered a Sith yet, so do let us know in the comments below if you have.It is a fantastic experience we highly recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or otherwise especially since it works on both iOS and Android. We did encounter some input lag in our adventures through the game as well as some drops in framerate but that is kind of expected when playing a browser game. The experience in itself more than makes up for it though, so all is forgiven. Maybe by the next installment of the Star Wars franchise we will be able to play this (or something like this) in virtual reality.[SOURCE]"

All he wanted was to buy an iPhone 6, but instead, he was forced to fork out more than double the price by an unscrupulous seller. Just when you thought nobody will pull the same trick here in Malaysia, think again. A local paper had reported several customers being held against their will until they pay up more than what was agreed upon. A 28-year-old victim was reported to be buying 4 phones at RM200 each at Kota Raya Shopping Complex. However after making the payment of RM800, he was told to enter a secluded room where he was locked up for hours. He was then told to pay an exorbitant RM10,000 fee for his release. Eventually, the victim was set free, but not after he withdrawn RM5,000 from an ATM. To rub salt to the wound, the 4 phones which he got was different from what was shown earlier. Obviously, the next thing to do was to report to the relevant authorities. He was said to have complained to several agencies including the Ministry of trade and Consumer Affairs, but no action has been taken. As a last resort, he seeks help from PPIM (Persatuan Pengguna Islam Malaysia) which proceeded to raid the shop. From the operation, it was found that there are a number of phone shops at Kota Raya that are selling counterfeit products at skyrocketed prices. In total, they had managed to cover as much as RM11,900 on behalf of 7 victims. Apart from locals, these shops tend to target foreigners especially women that would often fall prey to such tactics. As always, it is advisable to shop at reputable retailers and beware of dodgy dealers that offer unbelievable deals. If the deal is too good to be true, then it probably is. This isnt just limited to expensive phone models as weve seen fake Xiaomi devices in the market as well.If youre planning to get a smartphone, it is best to visit an authorised dealer or order directly from the official online store.

It aims to converge its latest operating system across a variety of devices, no matter what screen size youre on. So this means all Windows Phones are simply called a Windows 10 mobile device.It has been a while since weve seen a flagship Lumia and the last one was the Nokia Lumia 930 back in early 2014. After Microsoft took the helm of the mobile business, they are mostly preoccupied with entry to mid-range devices running on Windows Phone 8.1.After almost 2 years of waiting, the Lumia 950 and 950 XLhave officially landed in Malaysia. Not only this is the first flagship Lumia under the Microsoft banner, but most importantly they are the first Windows 10 smartphones in the market.Like most flagships today, Microsoft is going with a two size approach for its flagship. The Lumia 950 with a compact 5.2 display is going for RM2,699 while its larger 5.7 phablet model, the Lumia 950 XL is priced at RM2,999. Thats a significant price jump over its predecessors, and you can partly blame our foreign exchange rates for that.The internals has the best specs you would expect from a flagship, which includes Quad HD displays, Snapdragon 808/810 processors, 3GB of RAM and a minimum of 32GB of storage. Both has an expandable microSD slot and dual-SIM slots with 4G LTE support.Being a flagship Lumia, it comes equipped with their renowned PureView camera. It has a 20MP sensor at the rear with triple LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation, while the front 5MP camera takes care of selfie duties. Keeping up with the times, it also shoots videos in 4K resolution. Theres fast charge that does 0-50% in 30 minutes, USB Type-C connectivity and Qi wireless charging support. The only difference between the 950 and its XL version is the screen size, processors (950  Snapdragon 808, 950 XL  Snapdragon 810) and battery capacity (950  3,000mAh, 950 XL  3,340mah). On concerns of overheating, Microsoft says they have implemented liquid cooling to keep things cool as the going gets tough."

It makes sense though as smartwatches tend to be rather gargantuan to accommodate more screen real estate, resulting in big and bulky devices that dont go well with everyones wrist.Huawei has caught on this trend as well, as there are reports coming in that there will be a for women version of their new Huawei Watch. While it is unlikely that there will be any upgrades on the internals of the smartwatch, there will be aesthetic differences because the new watch will apparently be rounder.Yep, rounder than a round watch.Apparently the new Huawei watch will sport a modified rounder and more elegant watch case to match the supposedly more feminine-looking bands that will be bundled with it. If they plan on following the generic his/her accessories trend then the device will likely be smaller in both their bands as well as the watch case itself. It should probably also come in gold and maybe pin-uh sorry, Rose gold as well.The existing Huawei Watch is no small device as it has a rather thick case to go along with that premium hefty feel. This definitely wont go down well with delicate wrists, so a smaller and especially thinner design language will be much appreciated. This made-for-women Watch could see a launch during CES next year.Talk has been going around that the Chinese manufacturers second-generation smartwatch is already in the works and could see its way into the market by the second half of next year. There are hardly any details on this smartwatch at this point in time, but 9to5Google reports that they could be working on a cellular version of the device. This is unsurprising news though asAndroid Wear now officially supports cellular connectivity. The regular, non-cellular version of the Watch should also see improvements to battery life and performance.Announced during the Mobile World Congress this year, Huaweis first generation Watch was only recently launched in Malaysia, alongside the Nexus 6P.

Youll get the same plan as talked about above, at the same monthly price, but youll have to fork out an additional RM 330 upfront for the smartphone itself; bringing you to an eventual RM 6,042 total cost.Given that spending RM 238 per month doesnt sound as practical for someone who doesnt use all that bundled data, calls/texts and instant messaging, you can bump that price down by choosing other Digi plans that will be announced on the 18th of December; mind you, the two smartphones will cost more, but youll be paying less monthly.During the same announcement, Digi mentioned that this collaboration will bring about a third (more affordable) device, the Microsoft Lumia 550, that will be free on the Digi SmartPlan 98. Itll be available slightly later, at the end of December of this year.Head on over to our announcement post for a full recap of what these Windows 10 devices have to offer, as well as their full specs."

Hold on a minute, the latest Android hasnt even gone mainstream but they want to talk about the future?Representing Google during an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session, the 6-man team chipped in on a slew of topics, including: the direction of Pixel C and the future of Android. If youre asking why theres such a bridging of the two; its mainly due to a merger thats reported to take place come 2017.The report suggests that heads at Google think combining the two makes the most sense, since Android has had an early start as an operating system for quite some time. And were already starting to see small changes that point towards a unification in latest Pixel product.Googles Pixel branding has been have over the place, of late; partly due to the Pixel C choosing Android over Chrome OS. This further points to a crossover of operating systems and that might mean more desktop-like capabilities to ease productivity in the following phase of Android.So while mediating all these unanswered questions regarding the switch, the software team thought it would be a great idea to hold an AMA session. Allowing users to ask whatever they needed to. But it was surprising that the developers choose to share two facts about Android N, given that non-Nexus devices have yet to receive Marshmallow.The first of the two is a proper split-screen/multi-window function that weve already seen on iOS (iPad Pro only) and some Android OEM skins as well. This pretty much only applies to tablets since itll be a tiresome experience navigating multiple windows on your smartphone screen.Another feature that came about was DisplayPort via USB Type-C connector, that a competitor has put to good use  yes, were looking at Windows with their Continuum support. A trend that you could see a mile away, with more people dropping PCs for day to day task and opting convertibles that are slowly catching up in the processor department.These replies below were from the team themselves:Faster processors in smaller packages are already here and theyll only continue to get better. And you can expect us to start using smaller devices on bigger screens real soon. Oh and maybe a Pixel smartphone?Let us know what you make of this announcement and share with us if your technological consumption habits have changed of late, in the comments below.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA, 2 ]"

Well, its a good thing it wasnt soon  because Google has begun the rollout for Maps offline navigation on iOS.Huzzah!As the initial rollout began on Android, many countries were initially left out, including Malaysia and it wasnt until the second-half of last month that availability was extended to our home soil as well.Now, it has finally been made available to iOS users as well with the latest update to the Google Maps app.The downloaded maps will be stored for 30 days withthe option to update it either automatically via WiFi or mobile network/WiFi, or manually. By default, the application will update maps over WiFi automatically. To navigate, simply search for the location in the application (as you normally would) and if it falls within your downloaded area, simply hit the little car icon and then hit the little arrow key and the turn-by-turn navigation will launch and start guiding you.Besides offline navigation, the application also supposedly brings the option to view petrol prices and when local businesses are supposed to be busy, but from our testing, it doesnt appear to work in Malaysia. Then again, the ability to view petrol prices doesnt really matter here since it is standardised across all stations.In any case, this will surely put a smile on iOS users faces (ironic that it would be Google to do so) as they now have another choice for reliable offline navigation in Malaysia.[SOURCE]"
Alexander Wong,Guess who else is about to roll out 4G LTE in Malaysia?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/13/guess-who-else-is-about-to-roll-out-4g-lte-in-malaysia/,"4G LTE,4G LTE Malaysia,4G Malaysia,lte,Malaysia 4G,Malaysia 4G Operators,Malaysian Telco,Yes,yes 4g,Yes 4G LTE,Yes LTE,YTL Communications","LTE,Players on the Field,Technologies,Yes",2015-12-13,"Next year would be exciting with TM finally rolling out its full 4G LTE services. Competition is always good for us consumers and this could be a wake-up call to existing operators to buck up, or risk losing its customers. So in total, youll have Celcom, Digi, Maxis, U Mobile and TM as the 5 key 4G LTE telcos in the country. Is that enough? Well, it appears a new player is about to jump into the ring.5 years ago, the Malaysian government had allocated 2,600MHz LTE spectrums to 9 companies. Only 4 of them had officially rolled out commercial services namely Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. With TMs acquisition of P1, they now have access to the 2600MHz spectrum which they can roll out full LTE based telephony and data services. This is different from TMgo, a wireless broadband service that operates in a lower 850MHz frequency.If you run a manual network search lately, you probably would notice a new network bearing the number 502 152. This was spotted at several locations including Seremban, Shah Alam and Damansara Heights. At some locations, you could detect 502 153. For those who are clueless about the numbers, these are Mobile Network codes. According to MCMC, 502 152 belongs to YTL Communications while 502 153 belongs to Packet One Networks. We havent heard much from YTL Communications in a while and they could be making a big come back next year with 4G LTE. Their Yes 4G WiMAX service is still alive and running with occasional device bundle promotions. So whats the big deal if YTL launches its LTE service? Almost 2 years ago, YTL was reported to be testing TD-LTE on 2.3GHz, which supposedly is more efficient in bandwidth and cost. Utilising Time Division instead of Frequency Division, TD-LTE requires just one channel for download/upload as opposed to having a pair of frequencies for the same purpose. In Malaysia, our existing telcos are running on FDD-LTE, while TD-LTE is commonly used in China and India. Whether TD-LTE is better than FDD-LTE boils down to the telco itself. It is not what you have, but how you manage your network and your customer experience. Seamless transition from WiMAX, is also a factor why YTL favours TD-LTE. In an interview last year, its CEO Wing K Lee says that their WiMAX network is future proof and it wont cost much for them to roll out LTE. Back then, YTL is claiming 85% population coverage with WiMAX and we can confirm it was definitely wider than P1 in our road test conducted exactly 5 years ago. If they could light up LTE nationwide at a flick of a switch, YTL could be a serious rival to Digi and Maxis. What do you guys think?Thanks @ZikriMzd for the tip![ SOURCE ]"

A few months ago, they had unveiled the OnePlus X, a 5 smartphone with mid-range specs. Since the OnePlus 2 would be their flagship killer for 2016, it is safe to say they wont be rushing to replace it anytime soon. Instead, it seems like they are working on a mini flagship smartphone that could go head on with the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact.According to its listing on Geekbench, the new OnePlus device has a compact 4.6 display that pushes full HD (19201080) resolution. It also gets the same Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor as the OnePlus 2, as well as 4GB of RAM for all your multitasking needs. On-board the list shows 64GB of storage which is quite huge for a device of this class.The main camera appears to be a 13MP shooter that supports 4K, while the front gets a 5MP unit. No mentions if it has Laser AF assist like its bigger brother. At the moment, the device is running on Android 5.1.1 and you can expect it to run on their own stock-like OxygenOS when it is out. Like the current OnePlus 2, it also lacks NFC.Would you be interested in a compact 4.6 flagship smartphone? What is your preferred smartphone size?[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

The full HD display remains a Super AMOLED unit and it is purported to be running on a 1.8GHz Snapdragon 620 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM.Accompanying its bigger screen is a larger 4,000mAh capacity battery. It isnt confirmed yet but word has it that it could be used to charge other devices via USB OTG as seen on most recent smartphones with larger batteries. It also gets the same 13MP f/1.9 shooter with OIS as the rest, however the front gets an upgrade to 8MP for higher resolution selfie shots. On-board storage is said to be atleast 32GB with the option to expand further with microSD. The home button also comes with an integrated fingerprint scanner which can be used for Samsung Pay. The Galaxy A9 is expected to be available in China by end of this month or early January next year with an estimated price tag of 3,000CNY (about RM2,000). [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Announced during IFA 2015, the Acer Predator 8 has finally arrived in Malaysia. Sporting a 8 Full HD (19201200) display, this is Acers compact tablet with the gamer in mind. It gets a gaming inspired aluminium frame and has not one, not two but four front-facing speakers with Dolby Audio enhancement. For a more immersive gaming experience, the Android tablet has two haptic motors inside that rumbles on both ends. Powering the device is Intels Atom x7-Z8700 2.4GHz Quad-Core processor thats mated to 2GB of RAM. Onboard, it gets 32GB of storage which you can expand via a microSD up to 128GB. The Predator 8s IPS display claims to have 100% NTSC colour gamut that provides a vibrant and accurate colour reproduction. The included MediaMaster settings let you optimise the display and audio for gaming, movie, photo viewing and standard modes. The main highlight, of course, would be its Predator Quadio (Quad Audio) setup that offers a virtual surround sound. Whether youre holding it in landscape or portrait mode, it is smart enough to switch orientation automatically. Despite its chunky utilitarian appearance, it is 8.7mm thin and weighs 350 grams including its 4,420mAh battery. It does feel solid in the hands while the red coloured speaker grills protrude out from each corner to remind you that this is no ordinary tablet. Theres no 3G/4G mobile connectivity, but it has your usual Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and 802.11n WiFi with 22 MIMO support. Should you need to take pictures, it gets a 2MP shooter at the front while the rear gets a 5MP camera. At time of writing, it runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop.The Acer Predator 8 will go on sale in Malaysia starting next week with the retail price tag of RM1,499. To get your game on, they have also pre-installed Asphalt 8 with 320,000 credits worth US$50."

The new flagship smartphones are expected to be announced during MWC 2016 and they are likely to retain a duo release of a standard and an edge version that comes with a curve screen.Weve seen a couple of speculations for the Galaxy S7 and a new report by WSJ has reaffirmed what we know so far.According to their sources, the Korean maker will be implementing a pressure sensitive display thats very much like Apples iPhone 6s/6s Plus. Based on a patent filed by Samsung, the display allows you to alternate between space/tab, upper/lower-case keys according to the pressure of your touch. Also introduced for the first time in their product line is a high-speed charging/transfer port via USB Type C.Probably a much-welcomed feature is the likely return of a microSD slot. This year Samsung has gotten brickbats from its users for dropping expandable storage for its Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5. The expandable slot is said to be available on specific models, and it wont be included across all flagship models.In terms of cameras, Samsung will be introducing its new BRITECELL sensors that boast better low light performance. If you hate camera bumps. the new shooter is said to be flush with minimal protrusion at the back. As an extra party trick, Samsung might just include a Retina Scanner to unlock your device and weve seen ZTE implementing such feature on the Axon.Design wise, Samsung is expected to stick to its winning formula of using metal and glass. Its choice of using premium materials had helped Samsung to move upmarket and it was a huge leap from its former plasticky smartphones of old. Dont expect a radical change in appearance but perhaps some minor tweaks to differentiate the Galaxy S7 from its existing models.If the Galaxy S7/S7 edge launches in February, we might be able to see them in stores locally as early as end March or early April.[ SOURCE 2 ]"

These issues cropping up are a follow-up to the shambles that was Microsofts style of dealing with its angry OneDrive customers, that showed that their customer service approach has a lot of refining to be done and this time, it seems like deja vu all over again.Josh_F a forum owner took to Microsofts Community site to provide an official statement from the team at Redmond and the reply is rather lackluster. The moderator starts off by thanking those who own the two Surface devices mentioned above, proceeding to dish out the monotonous recording playback-like sentence weve heard your complaints, we value them and are working on a fix  yknow the typical sentiments.Some of these problems were fixed with an update that users received in November but with that said update, devices started to drain battery percentage faster while in sleep mode. A fix to this will only come next year, though Microsoft was already aware of the issue before they shipped the two products  say what? Weve said this time and time again, never fast-track a product if its riddled with bugs; case and point the LG Watch Urbane 2nd gen.This was what another moderator (Joe) had to say: The standby battery life is an issue we are working on and have been working on. We can put the processor into a deeper sleep state than it is currently set to. We couldnt do it at RTM (release to manufacturing) for a variety of reasons, power management is a very hard computer science problem to solve especially with new silicon. Currently it is not in the deepest sleep that it can be so there are wake events that would not otherwise wake it. We will have an update for this issue sometime soon in the new year.These excuses and justifications pose no help to those whove already purchased the versatile Surface products. In earnest, we really do hope that the Surface team solves these issues, otherwise our review isnt going to be rosy.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

As a whole were pretty fascinated by it and the experience it provides so when we finally got the update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, we were pretty stoked.Although it really wasnt a major update, we thought wed give you guys a brief run-down on what you can expect out of this little update.As the name suggests, this isnt a very big update but there are several little tweaks that are fairly interesting. The first of which is the addition of new emojis. Now we finally get access to thehead bandaged emoji, the updated poop emoji and the ever useful eye-roll emoji. If you want more information on these emojis, Ars Technica has a pretty comprehensive list.Besides that, this update acts as a catch-up update for older Nexus devices, bringing the Nexus 6Ps double-tap-on-the-power-button-to-wake-the-camera shortcut to the Nexus 6, Nexus 5 and Googles Nexus tablets.Though unrelated to the Nexus 6P, according to TrustedReviews, 6.0.1 brings more improvements to the Nexus tablet user. Before this update, the back, home and multitask keys were always located in the middle, which made things tricky for tablet users to actually reach the buttons when holding a tab in both hands. Now, the back and home keys have been pushed to the far left corner of the screen while the multitasking key has been shoved to the far right.All of those plus Googles monthly security update pretty much sums up this new patch. We will be keeping a close eye on any future updates so do stay tuned to SoyaCincau.com for all your Nexus 6P needs."

A term, to the layman, that is commonly associated with a certain ugly vehicular abomination that claims to be green and is well loved by Hollywood actors who want to appear environmentally conscious. Cameron Diaz has one yknow.In tech, it is also a term that has been gaining popularity because it usually means you can afford to carry one less device around with you. Yup, were talking about hybrid laptops and tablets. Or the laptop cum tablet. Or the tablet cum laptop. Or a convertible.Well, thats what Google is calling their latest device, the Pixel C, and yup youve guessed it, the C stands for convertible. Its not just a tablet, its a tablet AND a keyboard. Wow.

Ribbing aside, the Pixel C does have an impressive spec sheet. At the front, the device sports a 10.2-inch 25601800 pixel display that achieves a 308ppi pixel density. On the inside, it is running a quad-core Nvidia Tegra X1 chip with 3GB of RAM and a choice of 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The Pixel C will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box, abandoning the Chrome OS normally found in other Chromebooks. This is a strong indication that themerging of Chrome OS and Android is probably well on the way. The device also charges its 9,000 mAh battery via USB Type-C.It also sports an 8-megapixel rear camera that supports 1080p recording and a 2-megapixel front camera, but we do advise against being one of those tablet photographers. The tablet attaches to its keyboard via magnets, but the thing that we found great was the fact that the keyboard has a solid base which means you can use it on your lap. For more information on the tablet and its keyboard, head on over here.Marketing it as a tablet with a keyboard means that the Pixel C was not exactly designed to be a hybrid laptop or tablet. And that kind of shows since it is running Android instead of a dedicated laptop/desktop OS. Clearly it isnt meant to replace your laptop but we do hope that ChromeOS-Android hybrid comes soon so that we can see what this tablet is fully capable of. Of course, this isnt the first tablet to come with its own keyboard. Sony has done it with the Xperia Z4 Tablet, Samsung has Galaxy Tab S, ASUS has the Transformer, and even Google themselves have the Nexus 9 with a keyboard.The Pixel C is currently available in the Google Store with prices starting at USD499 (around RM2,130). The magnetic keyboard is a USD149 (around RM635) optional extra, but it does also come with a folio keyboard, similar to the Nexus 9s and will also be priced at USD149. Based on these figures, the Pixel C looks like its a pretty good bargain, especially if you compare it with the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet which will set you back RM2,699 for the device and another RM799 for the accompanying keyboard.Unfortunately, the Pixel C isnt available in Malaysia. As of this moment there doesnt seem to be any information on availability in our market but we do hope they will bring it over soon so that we can see first hand what Google thinks is the proper way to build a tablet.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

While numbers dont lie, its been a strenuous journey for the operating software; coming to life thanks to a team of four visionaries.The Nexus name came shortly after, allowing devs and those passionate about the cleanest, bloat-free system that they could tinker away with, within their coding laboratories. Notable house-hold OEMs have had their hand in the growing appreciation that is, a Vanilla flavoured Android OS; a list that include two Korean manufacturers (LG and Samsung), one Taiwanese (HTC), one American (Motorola) and the rookie to the bunch, the Chinese-based Huawei with their Nexus 6P.What Huawei brings to the Nexus name?Can Huawei add a new spin to the Nexus name after leaving many hoping for more after the Nexus 6? That often was too expensive or too big for regular folks to palm around. Those who felt betrayed after the Nexus 5, were left hanging, while those wanting something top-of the line without sacrificing quality materials and build were put in the same position.So now we have the Nexus 6P, a smartphone that many have said to be the best pure Android device to date, but can the device and Marshmallow appeal to the mass market? Will it please the average consumer that prefers to purify their experience? Whatever your opinion, the newest Nexus might just surprise you."

The one description, be it on the spec sheet or in the build quality, most people sought after when going for a smartphone. With technology getting more and more advanced, the premium feel has begun to spill down the price pyramid to the point where even midrange phones can give users that premium feel. However, these lower end premium smartphones usually come with some corners cut to keep the price low.I love a great bargain, phones like the OnePlus One or the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, have great specs for their price, but you can clearly see what was left out. Today though, it isnt about the best value for money. Today, its about two phones that sit close to the top of the price point hierarchy, an echelon where there can be no compromises because anything lower than the best would be unacceptable.Today is about the Huawei Mate S and the Samsung Galaxy Note5.As these devices are priced so similarly (RM2,698 for the Mate S and RM2,699 for the Galaxy Note5) the question most people are interested in is which do I buy?. Well, were pitting these two behemoths against each other in a head-to-head comparison to help you answer that question a little better.Let me be clear upfront, I wont go over every detail of each device, rather the devices will be judged on how premium or special they make you feel. If I were going to shell out over two and a half thousand ringgit on a device, I want to make sure that the device is absolutely the best device in every single aspect I could ever purchase with that kind of money. Thats a tall order, but Im sure if you were going to blow your savings on a purchase like this you wouldnt settle for anything less. With that out of the way, onwards into the field of battle!"

You can get it now for under RM1,000",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/10/redmi-note-3-malaysia-on-sale-imported/,"Android,DirectD,Dual Sim,Redmi Note 2,Redmi Note 3,Redmi Note 3 Malaysia,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Redmi Note 3","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-12-10,"Just shortly after the Redmi Note 2 was announced in Malaysia, Xiaomi had introduced a newer yet upmarket successor, the Redmi Note 3. Released after their epic Singles Day sales, the Redmi Note 3 has a more premium unibody metal design, upgraded specs, a fingerprint scanner and also the largest battery for a Xiaomi smartphone. If you cant wait for Xiaomi Malaysia to bring it here officially, the folks at DirectD has started offering imported units under RM1,000. Available in two variants, the 2GB RAM and 16GB storage base model is going for RM859, and they have both Silver and Gold colour in stock. If you need something with more grunt, the higher spec 3GB RAM with 32GB of storage version in Silver only is available at RM999. The rest of the specs are almost identical with the current Redmi Note 2. The front display is a 5.5incher that does Full HD resolution while processing is handled by MediaTeks Octa-Core Helio X10 processor. The cameras appear to be unchanged with a 13MP PDAF camera at the rear while the front gets a 5MP shooter. While the battery isnt removable this time, the Redmi Note 3 gets a huge 4,000mAh capacity battery while still maintaining a slender 8.65mm profile.It also gets 4G LTE support with dual-SIM but sadly theres no microSD expansion slot with the Redmi Note 3. Also new for Xiaomi is a fingerprint scanner at the back which unlocks instantly on a single tap. Out of the box, it runs on MIUI 7 thats based on Android Lollipop. As a reference, the Redmi Note 3 in China is going for 899 CNY (about RM596) for the lower spec unit and 1,099 CNY (about RM728) for the high-spec version. If the extra premium of about RM260-270 for an import set is reasonable to you, you now have the option to get one today. Otherwise, you could settle for the Redmi Note 2 which is now available with special bundles during its Christmas sale.If youre interested, head over to DirectDs Redmi Note 3 page.[ SOURCE ]"

Now in its 7th generation, Google has partnered with Huawei with the all new Nexus 6P. It isnt just another reference device but an upmarket one that could very well compete with the current crop of flagship smartphones.After its announcement in late September, the Nexus 6P is finally here in Malaysia and you can place your orders beginning this Thursday, 10th December.Available in a single 64GB storage variant, the Nexus 6P is priced officially at RM2,698 inclusive of GST. For Malaysia, we are getting two colour options  Aluminium and Graphite. So far theres no news of its other Gold and Frost White versions.In terms of size, the Nexus 6P despite its 6 moniker has a 5.7 screen which makes it more compact than last years Nexus 6 by Motorola. The AMOLED screen pushes a Quad HD resolution of 25601440 that gives a pixel density of 518 pixels per inch. The exterior is where the Nexus 6P stands out. It gets an all-metal unibody design with a helmet visor bump at the back that houses its camera module.Accompanying its high-resolution screen is a pair of stereo speakers which is perfect for gaming and audio playback. For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P also gets a fingerprint scanner at the back thats natively supported by Android Marshmallow. Like most rear-mounted fingerprint scanners, it unlocks instantly in a single touch.Powering the device is a flagship class 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of RAM, which should be more than sufficient to provide a buttery smooth experience. Like all Nexus smartphones (except for the Nexus One by HTC), theres no expandable microSD slot and it comes with a single nano SIM slot supporting 4G LTE.In terms of cameras, the Nexus 6P focuses on larger pixels rather than the usual pixel count. Despite having a 12.3MP sensor from Sony, it boasts a larger 1.55 m pixel size that allows in more light and this apparently is good enough to compensate for the lack of an Optical Image Stabilisation. It gets a dual-tone LED flash, Phase Detection and Laser Auto Focus so that you wont miss a shot. Over at the front, selfies are taken care by its rather large 8MP shooter.Keeping the lights on, the Nexus 6P has a generous 3,450mAh battery and it charges up via a reversible USB Type C port. Out of the box, you get 2 sets of cables  a USB Type-C to Type-C and the standard USB Type-C to full sized USB. The power adapter pushes a higher 3Amp output through a USB Type-C port which should be faster than standard 2Amp chargers in the market. Of course the main reason why anyone would get a Nexus, is for its pure Android experience without the unnecessary fluff thats often preinstalled by OEMs.The Nexus 6P will be available online this Thursday (10th December) through Huaweis vmall.my and Lazada Online store. Those who snap up units quickly, Huawei will be throwing in an introductory offer of a Chromecast (the first version) worth RM 199, totally free of charge to the first 600. The Nexus 6P also comes with a 1 year one-to-one swap program through Huawei Service Centres.

This matrimony of the Android operating system and the security plus convenience of BlackBerrys own operating system comes in a premium body with a curved display that will surely appeal to existing mainstream smartphone users. The PRIV does have a trick up its sleeve though as it features a physical QWERTY keyboard that slides out from under its display.This slide out keyboard also functions as a touchpad for scrolling that makes text selection quicker and more accurate. There is also a text prediction feature that lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard.BlackBerrys PRIV is the largest device the ever manufactured by the Waterloo corporation and comes with a 5.4 quad-HD panel, that is curved every so slightly, similar to Samsungs Galaxy S6 edge and Galaxy S6 edge+. Spec-wise, the device runs an octa-core Snapdragon 808 processor with 3GB of ram and 32GB of internal storage. Storage is expandable via microSD up to 2TB, assuming you ever find cards with that much storage.Powering the device is a relatively large 3,140 mAh battery and it also runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box. The bonus feature is that the PRIV comes with a host of BlackBerry productivity apps including a unified Hub.In terms of optics, the device features an 18-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) and a dual-LED flash. It is also certified by Schneider-Kreuznach. Unfortunately, the PRIV only receives a 2-megapixel selfie-panorama front facing camera for selfies, which were sure may disappoint some. However, cameras arent all about optics, so we will have to see how good this 2MP shooter is.Many expect the PRIV to be a game changer as it is supposed to bring the best of both Android and BlackBerry operating systems together in a premium device. Well, it certainly has to be a game changer because BlackBerry CEO has stated that the company is relying heavily on the PRIV to do well for them to stay afloat.If you want to get your hands on this device, you can preorder the PRIV at a discounted price of RM3,388 for the first 60 customers on 11street.my, or head over to any Celcom Blue Cube outlets to preorder for the same price until the 14th of December.

These are synonymous with Apple. People may disagree with a lot of things but many will agree that when it comes to making something as ubiquitous as a smartphone look like a work of art, Apple does it best.But sometimes, even the best get it wrong.This is the Apple Smart Battery Case. Its the companys first ever battery pack and its decidedly un-Apple. More on that later but first, lets go into the specs.The Smart Battery Case is a battery pack that fits the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. It packs a 1,877mAh battery and Apple says its good for 18 hours of internet browsing time on LTE or 20 hours of video playback time. The battery case has a soft touch silicone exterior with a microfibre inner lining to protect your iPhone. There are two colours to choose from (white and charcoal gray) currently and its the only battery case that comes with a lighting connector.So why is the Smart Battery Case un-Apple?Its the design. Next to the slim, sleek and slender iPhone 6, the Smart Battery Case, with its unsightly bulge, looks like an afterthought, like the designers at Apple didnt even bother to make this thing look good.Its not that great as a battery case either. Theres no separate switch to activate or deactivate the battery case and the lack of an external battery indicator makes it difficult to know how much power you have left without turning on your iPhone.You do however get an integrated battery status built into iOS when the battery case is plugged into your iPhone but that means you will have to turn on your phone every time you want check the power status of the battery case.And for the RM469 asking price, youre not getting a lot. A popular battery case alternative like the Mophie Juice Pack Air with a 2,750mAh battery pack, a dedicated on/off switch and external LED indicators costs about the same.So if youre an iPhone 6 or 6S user thats constantly looking for a power point because your iPhone is out of battery, you might want to stay away from the Apple Battery Pack. Its ugly, its expensive and for something thats designed for the iPhone by the makers of the iPhone itself, its decidedly un-Apple.Maybe Apple took some inspiration from the device below.

With the current generation of smartphone cameras breaking barriers and capable of some amazing photographs, given the right conditions; what does the flagship Nexus have to offer?Utilising Sonys lens on the rear and front, the device in question doesnt boast an amazing pixel count, only at 12.3-megapixel. It also doesnt have optical image stabilisation, which by todays standards could be a big no-noGoogle does however bet on the sensors large pixel size, listed at 1.55 m to compensate the fact that the lens has no Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS). A combination of an aperture of f/2.0 and the larger micrometre would mean that itll absorb a lot more light, at least on paper; making shots in low light scenes easier to manage. Also, PDAF and laser autofocus makes a formidable duo, mediating those poorly dialed in images.How about the front? Well, the 6P gets a much appreciated 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor thatll greet you every time your eyes meet the screen. There are no fancy add-ons on this 1.4 m pixel lens, its just a bare-bones camerabut you will be lucky enough to get HDR+ on the front too."

Malaysian Apple fans have been clamouring for the Apple Watch ever since it was announced, but here we are eight months later and still no Watch in sight. Well, we actually dont know if this is good news or just slightly sad news because apparently Apple is already preparing a March 2016 event to unveil the second generation Apple Watch alongside what could be the 4-inch iPhone 6c.9to5Mac reports that the second-generation wearable could possibly start shipping in April, a full year after the first device was launched. They also report that Apple had long developed the technology needed for future Apple Watch generations even before the original Apple Watch started shipping. Components that allow sleep tracking, wireless, health sensor technologies and even a new camera for the wearable have already been developed.When we last saw the iPhone 6c, it was rumoured to be launched in the first half of 2016 and based on this new report, it looks like it should, at least, get a first half announcement alongside the 2nd gen Apple Watch. Following the success of the iPhone 5c, it doesnt really come as a surprise that Apple wants to continue the c-badge because there are many Apple fans that simply cannot shell out the dough needed for their flagship devices.Whats even better is that the iPhone 6c could be powered by an Apple A8 (iPhone 6/6 Plus)/A9 (iPhone 6S/6S Plus) chip, so performance on iOS should be about as buttery as can be. If it follows in the footsteps of the iPhone 5c then it should come in a plastic body sporting a multitude of funky and bright colours. The smaller size would be a throwback to a time before iPhones became iPhablets which were sure will be welcomed by those with smaller hands.However, with the current abysmal exchange rate of the Ringgit, if this device is launched, would it be affordable enough to appeal to those below the high-end market? Based on the iPhone 5cs launch prices, RM1,999 for the 16GB model and RM2,399 for the 32GB model (keep in mind both of these are without GST), we doubt so.

No, its not the Galaxy Note5 or any of the Galaxy S6 variants. Oddly enough, it looks like theyve begun rolling out Marshmallow updates to their old Note device, the Galaxy Note 4.Regardless, if this is really the beginning of the rollout (again odd that theyd start in Hungary) then this is great news for Galaxy Note 4 owners. A little bit of SoyaCincau.com advice though, dont spend all day staring at your Galaxy Note 4 in the off chance that does end up to be just a blunder from the Korean manufacturer.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Well, we thought so too.This magical ad triggers a pop up in search results and allows users to stream the application (for now its only for games) for up to 60 seconds. The purpose is to allow users to try out the application before deciding whether or not they want to download it. According to Google, one in four applications downloaded is never even used because of the shortening mobile attention span of the average user.Trial Run Ads attempts to curb that by letting users really get a feel of an application before downloading them, thus benefiting both the user and the app developer. This application is only in its beta stage though, but Google has unveiled this to app developers so the ball is in their court now and it is up to them to decide how to best utilise this feature. With proper and effective implementation, this looks like it could be a very interesting feature.Besides this nifty app Harry Potter-y, Google is also starting the beta for Interactive Interstitial ads that utilises HTML5 to create interactive mobile advertisements. It will let advertisers completely customise the advertisement to their liking and give them the freedom they need to use HTML5 instead of standard templates and pull data dynamically. It is truly customisable and can allow advertisers to include the apps value proposition and functionalities to suit advertisers who are looking for higher user engagement.[SOURCE, VIA]"

While this is good news for UniFi subscribers, this collaboration seems to directly impede the growth of TMs own, HyppTVs video on demand (VOD) offers, though TM markets this iflixfree subscriptionas an add-on to the existing IPTV service.Whats peculiar is that this iflixsubscription service doesnt require a login account. Starting mid-December of this year, UniFi subscribers only need to launch iflix on their preferred device while connected to their UniFi connection and the streaming service will tag the device, allowing users access to all its content. iflix will allow you to pair up to 5 devices per connection and will support concurrent streaming on up to 2 devices. If you want to register a sixth device, simply remove a previously registered device in iflixs settings and register the new one. This is is pretty timely especially sinceiflix now also supports offline viewing on both iOS and Android devices.Before all you Streamyx subscribers start protesting, TM has also announced that they are working to bring these same benefits to their 4Mbps and 8Mbps Streamyx subscribers at a later date.

Alexander Wong,Guess which brand is number 1 for wearables?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/05/idc-smart-wearables-smart-watch-q3-2015-report/,,,2015-12-05,"The Apple Watch has definitely shaken the smart watch scene this year. While it isnt the game changer were looking for, the expensive price tag didnt seem to stop it from becoming a hot seller.  According to the latest IDC report, Apple has already sold 7.5 million Watches between April and October. You cant deny thats pretty impressive considering Samsung only sold over a million Gear smart watches for the whole of 2014. Even Android Wear has managed to ship 720,000 units, with Moto 360 leading the pack.Despite the impressive figures for Apple, they are still not number 1 when it comes to wearable devices.  Holding on to its #1 spot is Fitbit with its line of dedicated fitness trackers. In the face of heighten competition from its affordable Chinese rivals, they are continuing to grow from 3.9 million units shipped in Q1 this year to 4.7 million shipped in the last quarter. Driving the sales is their popular Charge and Surge, as they continue to increase its presence worldwide. According to IDC, the increase for Fitbit was also attributed to the rise of corporate wellness programs with large corporations providing Fitbit trackers for their staff. With the entry of Apple Watch, the Cupertino company has managed to catapult itself to 2nd place, putting a dent to the market share of current wearable brands. In Q3, Apple has shipped 3.9 Watches, an increase of 300,000 over Q2 as it increased its availability to more market. Strangely Malaysians are still not getting the Watch, while it is already on sale officially in Singapore, Thailand and most recently Indonesia starting yesterday.At number 3 for Q3 2015 is Xiaomi with its super affordable Mi Band. So far they have shipped out 9.6 million units for 2015 and they are expected to close the year higher after its recent Singles Day sale. To revive its popularity, the Chinese company had also announced an upgraded Mi Band 1S that comes with a heart rate sensor while maintaining a low 99 CNY (about RM68) price tag. Meanwhile, Garmin is still persistent in 4th place with 900,000 wearables shipped, but the real shocker is Samsung as it gets knocked off the Top 5 list for the first time this year. The new entry is a YTC Y01 children watch by BBK with 700,000 sold last quarter. The Chinese based company had sold 100,000 more than Samsung, thus pushing them down to 6th place. With the introduction of its Gear S2, Samsung might just bounce back especially with the current year-end shopping season. In terms of looks, wed say Samsung has finally nailed it with the Gear S2, but they had cut down the number of features compared to its earlier Gear models.   [ SOURCE 2 ]"

What are we talking about? Well, the folks at OnePlus have decided it was a good idea to poke the metaphorical bear that is Apple, with their latest advert for an iPhone 6/6s Sandstone back case.Mmm, we love the smell of napalm in the morning.In their cheeky video  which looks like a parody of what we like to call the swelling-music-advert  OnePlus have painted themselves (or their users at least) as that guy who has got it covered, always ready and willing to help out their friends in need. In this case (ha ha), it would be OnePlus new friends over at Cupertino. As fun as this is, we certainly do hope OnePlus doesnt think ALL its users dress like the guy in the video (that hat, really?).Just yesterday, OnePlus also posted a teaser on their Facebook page about their latest product, which Im sure mustve irked many an iPhone user now that the cats out of the bag.There is yet more evidence of this friendly ribbing on their product page as they strive to give iPhone 6/6s users the Never Settle feel, adding that its sturdy, polycarbonate construction adds both grippiness and protection. Apparently its one of those things you wont understand until you try it.To sweeten the deal, OnePlus is throwing in a physical OnePlus X invite with every purchase of this back case. Thats not all, the invites arent only invitations to buy the regular phone, but there is also a chance that you could get an invite to purchase the OnePlus X Ceramic or better yet, a free device. Now that sounds dandy and all but when we tried to purchase the case from their online store, a pop-up informed us that the case was currently out of stock, despite it being listed as in stock on the page itself.Maybe this is some kind of elaborate April fools prank in December. December Dummies perhaps? Of course, this isnt the first time OnePlus has done something most people deem ridiculous to generate buzz, just a few months back their co-founder applied to be an intern at Samsung.

By making his own smartphone. An engineer by occupation, Andy Rubin has been around; hes graced Car Zeiss, Apple, MSN, Google and of course, Android Inc. Interestingly, a report from The Information has the long lost granddaddy of all things Android calling for a recruitment drive for individuals to join his revisited escapade.A year plus after taking his leave from Google, its apparent that his brainchild Playground Global will finally start giving back to his own causes. The aforementioned start-up by Rubin serves as a tech hatchery of sorts; enabling those wanting to start their own thing but dont have the resources, mentorship and funding to make it happen.The Fund itself, managed to raise roughly US$ 300 million from investments by Google (no duh), Hewlett-Packard aka HP, Seagate and others. Leveraging on his venture capital experiences with Redpoint Ventures (where he is a partner), as for now, his cash flow has been streaming to artificial intelligence and smart home segments. Though the aforementioned report states that Rubin still sees the opportunity to enter the Android smartphone market.Folks at the Verge seems to think that the dynamics of the low to midrange market is too volatileto enter, with manufactures popping up every now and then. Thus, maybe his best bet is to make a premium device thatll hope to take a slice away from the Apple pie.The inhibitors of Mountain View might have something to say about that, since Google themselves have been reported to be working on their own hardware; all the pieces seem to be lining up quite well for the former head of Android Inc. And a possible return to the smartphone scene might amount to a foreseeable re-entry at Google.Jumping at any opportunity to make something great, Rubin has touched the lives of many, even if we fail to realise it.

This is the BlackBerrys first flagship to run on Android and it comes with its BlackBerry Torch-like slider keyboard. Available in retail stores and telcos from 12th December, the PRIV is priced at S$1,098 which converts to RM3,296. Thats slightly more than the Galaxy Note5 which was launched in the island state at S$1,088.Catching up since the BlackBerry Passport, the PRIV aims to stay relevant with updated hardware and a fresh user experience. It gets a 5.4 AMOLED Quad HD screen with double curved edges and it runs on a more current Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. For storage it has 32GB on-board which is expandable with microSD. Running on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with the possibility of being upgraded to Marshmallow early next year, the PRIV eliminates the concern of having limited apps with full access to the Google Play Store. With virtually all Android players adopting a full touch screen display, BlackBerry hopes to fulfill the needs of consumers that desire the tactile feel of a physical keyboard. Given its retail price, the PRIV will face a tough challenge from likes of the Galaxy Note5, Xperia Z5 and even the Nexus 6P. After all, existing Android users will be their key focus group according to their Senior Director for Asia Pacific Product Management. The main deciding factor of course the slider keyboard. With the advancements of virtual keyboards such as SwiftKey and Swype, do you really need a physical keyboard in this day and age? Given a choice between a BlackBerry PRIV and a Galaxy Note5, which smartphone would you get? The PRIV has passed our local SIRIM certification a while back and it shouldnt take too long for BlackBerry to launch it in Malaysia. [ SOURCE 2 ]"

This do or die device will be the brands pivotal move to see if it can still play the mobile game or close down for good.The QWERTY physical keyboard returns, this time on the brand that has (tried) kept it alive. This symbiotic relationship is close to becoming an old script, with users preferring the regularly used touch-based screens.Theyre final market place would be business users that deal with highly classified information: trade secrets, medical related and anything else that falls under the same sun. At one point, even the Secret Services most important asset aka President Barack Obama, once used a BlackBerry smartphone.So whats so appealing about their soon to be released device? Well for one itll boast a 5.4-inch AMOLED display that is capable of QHD (2144 x 1980) resolution. The glass on the device features a tapering dual edged screen, that doubles as a battery level indicator when plugged in (on one side).Multitasking shouldnt be a hitch on the smartphone that carries 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage. Camera-wise, there are two lenses, as expected: an Schneider-Kreuznach 18-megapixel rear shutter with OIS and dual LEDs, while the front gets a lowly 2-megapixel lens.Other than the usual suspects, the PRIV will also have a slew of connectivity options as listed below:Packing a punch, the PRIV hides a 3,410 mAh battery underneath its lower half, as Android 5.1.1 Lollipop will work as its brains. Uniquely to the PRIV, their manufacturer has outed some of its apps on the Google Play Store, adding a little signature touch to the whole experience.Those thinking of picking up the PRIV should take a look at how it handles durability, since it has the security aspect on lock down. Users will have to wait for the device to launch first before knowing the pricing but look for it to be roughly RM 2,966 (converted from US pricing) and our neighbours in Singapore have to fork outS$ 1,098 which converts to RM 3,296.If you havent seen it yet, check out our BlackBerry PRIV First Impressions.[ IMAGE SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,BlackBerry PRIV: Can an Android smartphone with a physical keyboard save the day?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/03/blackberry-priv-first-impressions-malaysia/,"Android,blackberry,BlackBerry Android Smart Phone,BlackBerry PRIV,Blackberry PRIV First impressions,Blackberry PRIV Hands-on,BlackBerry PRIV Malaysia,BlackBerry PRIV Malaysia Launch,first impressions","Android,BlackBerry,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-03,"A BlackBerry running Android? Several years ago, the idea would be laughable, but today an Android smartphone could actually make or break this once dominate mobile brand. As BlackBerry continues to lose ground in smartphone market, they are pinning their hopes on the BlackBerry PRIV. Their first Android device that comes with a slider keyboard. The PRIV will be launched in Malaysia next week and were lucky enough to get a brief hands-on with this new slider device. At 5.4 inches, the PRIV is the largest smartphone BlackBerry has ever produced and the display features a double curve screen thats very much like the S6 edge. Though the phone is not wrapped in metal, it does look premium enough for the business-centric user. The back has a grippy texture to it which gives it an assuring feel in the hands, but it took a little while to get used to.When held in the hands, it does have a nice heft to it and despite having a larger screen plus a sliding keyboard mechanism, it is lighter by a couple of grams than the BlackBerry Passport. The sliding QWERTY keyboard is the main highlight of the PRIV, and the mechanism and the design are much improved from the old BlackBerry Torch. When sliding out, the PRIV feels slightly top heavy but it didnt really bother us while typing. Having used a BlackBerry Bold previously, I found the keyboard to be enjoyable to use. Yes, you do type faster with on-screen keyboards with advance prediction technology but it doesnt give the same tactile satisfaction as the real deal. Another advantage of using a slider keyboard is that youll have an unobstructed display to view your stuff since theres no on-screen keyboard occupying half of the screen.Like the BlackBerry Passport, the keyboard has a couple of neat tricks. It also functions as a touchpad for scrolling and it makes text selection quicker and accurate.  Theres also a text prediction feature that was introduced on BlackBerry 10 and it lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard. In terms of single-handed use, the width of the device is just right and you wont struggle as much as the BlackBerry Passport thats super wide. If youre not using a physical keyboard, the stock BlackBerry keyboard works just fine and you probably could install 3rd party ones like Swype or SwiftKey. I can imagine myself using the virtual keyboard more frequently for quick social updates, replies or while hooked up to a holder while driving. In terms of performance, the PRIV that runs on Android 5.1.1 felt quite smooth and I didnt experience any noticeable lags in the short time using it. The UI is very stock like and they do integrated a couple of native BlackBerry Apps including the unified BlackBerry Hub. If youre using an Android device currently, you should feel quite at home but BB10 users might take a while to get used to it as demonstrated by their CEO John Chen.So is the BlackBerry PRIV the device to get? Probably the one and the only reason to consider is its physical keyboard. I love the feel of it, I really do and it is something that I find myself using regularly for writing stories or replying emails. But for other things when you just need to shoot a quick reply, the on-screen keyboard does the job just fine. Knowing BlackBerry will definitely price this at a premium, we struggle to justify why anyone should get it over the Galaxy Note5. In terms of hardware, the Quad HD display, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is pretty much mainstream. You could get that on the LG G4 thats currently going for about RM2,299. Of course, specs is just one factor to consider and the PRIV is also focused on privacy, which they are claiming to be the most if not one of the most secure Android smartphones in the market. Admittedly, I didnt manage to explore other features such as the 18MP OIS-equipped camera and the DTEK security monitoring tool. Hopefully, we get to do so during the official local launch thats happening on 8th December.Unless youre getting this as a company phone, it is quite hard to justify paying more just the keyboard alone. Is there a genuine need for a physical QWERTY keyboard? Several Android brands have tried with the HTC Desire Z, HTC ChaCha and the Motorola Milestone, but most of them have ceased to exist. The recent attempt is by Samsung with its Keyboard Cover accessory for the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+, but with a less ideal implementation. Could BlackBerry stay relevant in the Android world with the PRIV? Let us know in the comments below."
Rory Lee,The 3x optical zoom ASUS ZenFone Zoom is now on sale in Taiwan,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/02/the-3x-optical-zoom-asus-zenfone-zoom-on-sale-in-taiwan/,"Android,Asus,ASUS Malaysia,ASUS ZenFone,ASUS ZenFone Zoom,asus zenfone zoom launch,camera,lumia 1020,Optical Zoom,smart phone,smart phone camera,smartphone,smartphone camera,smartphone with optical zoom,ZenFone Zoom,zenfone zoom launch,zenfone zoom launch taiwan,zoom lens","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-02,"According to a report published in 2013, over 90% of people who have ever taken a photo in their life have only done so on a phone, not a traditional or standalone camera. That is a staggering number of people if you think about it, especially taking into consideration the keyword in that phrase is ever. Which means that, even two years ago, when smartphone cameras were arguably worse than they are now, people still defaulted to them for that snapshotting needs. This is completely understandable simply because a smartphone is more portable, usually cheaper and are just generally more convenient.Well, ASUS hopes to add to that statistic with their latest ZenFone Zoom, which officially goes on sale in Taiwan today.One of the biggest problems was that most smartphones relied on a digital zoom, which is more like a fancy way to crop your photos if you think about it. The one you want to go for when zooming is the optical zoom, which adjusts the glass positioned in a camera/lens unit to reposition the light hitting the sensor, which brings the image closer but maintains its quality. Most smartphones shy away from using this because having multiple pieces of glass in the camera unit means having more space which in turn translates to a bigger camera hump.The supposedly brilliant thing about the ZenFone Zoom though is that it is the worlds thinnest 3x-optical zoom smartphone. How thin is thin? Well ASUS states that the ZenFone Zoom only has a 5mm edge. Bear in mind, this is the edge, and as the ZenFone line of devices have usually been curved at the back, this looks to be no exception. From the looks of it, the devices camera unit does take up an enormous amount of space on the back panel ala-Lumia 1020, but it doesnt seem to protrude as much as the Lumia.In a device that is designed to take photographs, most of the actual photography will be taken by the primary 13-megapixel rear shooter while selfies and video chats will be handled by the devices 5MP front facing unit. Other primary camera goodies include a dual-LED flash, laser autofocus, optical image stabilisation (OIS) and ASUS PixelMaster 2.0 camera technology that is designed to greatly improve low light photography, granting up to a 400% increase in brightness. For those curious about the PixelMaster 2.0 technology, weve already put it through its paces in our Zenfone 2 Laser review. The ZenFone Zoom will also feature a dedicated shutter button, record button as well as a zoom rocker.Then again, we already expected most of this as the device was announced almost a year ago. What we do know now for sure now is that the device will come in 64GB and 128GB variants. Internal specs include an Intel Atom Z3580 quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz for the 64GB variantwhile the 128GB variant will be powered by a 2.5GHz Intel Atom Z3590 quad-core processor. Based on the website, it appears that the device will also come with 4GB of RAM and be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS BoostMaster quick charging technology. The devices will also come running Android Lollipop out of the box.Display wise, the smartphone will come with a 5.5-inch full HD display with a pixel density of 403 ppitucked away under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The body will also be of an aluminium unibody construction with what looks like a faux leather back to help with grip and texture as well as a ridge at the bottom of the phone to help with one handed photography. But we all know what a unibody means: no removable battery. It does have what looks like a lanyard port and appears to come bundled with a camera strap.The 64GB device retails in Taiwan for TWD13,990 (around RM1,806) while the 128GB will go for TWD15,990 (around RM2,065). While ASUS did not announce when this device will be available in other markets, ASUS Malaysia has hinted at an end-of-2015 release, which means it could be any time now. The odd thing is that this device was announced a long time ago, and between its announcement and today ASUS has launched several devices already.This begs the question, what took them so long? Was there a massive kink in the device that delayed its launch this long? Lets hope theyve worked out whatever problems they had with it (if they had any problems) lest we have a repeat of LGs little disaster.We suspect this device will appeal to some camera enthusiasts who were interested in the Lumia 1020 but not the Windows Mobile platform. While it does seem that this device is a worthy Android equivalent, its sensor is but a measly 13-megapixels versus the Lumia 1020s 41-megapixel monstrosity. Then again, megapixel isnt the be-all and end-all of camera quality, so we will just have to wait and see.[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"
Alexander Wong,Microsoft is throwing a Lumia 950 launch party and heres how you can get an invite,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/02/microsoft-lumia-950-950-xl-malaysia-launch-party/,"Lumia,Microsoft Lumia 950,Microsoft Lumia 950 Malaysia,Microsoft Lumia 950 XL,Microsoft Lumia 950 XL Malaysia,Windows 10,Windows 10 Mobile,windows phone","Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows Phone",2015-12-02,"Offering the best of Windows 10 in a mobile form factor, the flagship Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL are finally making an appearance in Malaysia. The folks at Microsoft Malaysia are throwing a launch party on the 15th of December and you can stand a chance to win passes to the event. There are 20 pairs of passes up for grabs and all youll need to do is to tell them why you love the Lumia 950 by completing the following sentence: I love the Lumia 950 and 950 XL as much as. You can try your luck over at their Facebook post and as usual, dont forget to read the T&Cs.To refresh your memory, the new Lumia 950/950 XL are Microsofts newest high-end smart phones since the launch of the Nokia Lumia 930. Announced back in October, these two smart phones are designed to deliver an integrated experince with its Windows 10 family of products. Apart from having the latest OS, both the Lumia 950 and 950 XL offers a high resolution Quad HD display in 5.2 and 5.7 screen sizes respectively. Under the hood, the larger Lumia 950 XL runs on a 2GHz Snapdragon 810 processor while the compact Lumia 950 gets a respectable 1.8GHz Snapdragon 808 unit. Both models come equipped with 3GB of RAM and has 32GB of storage as standard. If thats not enough, you can easily pop-in a microSD card up to 2TB. Photography should be one of its killer features with a 20MP f/1.9 PureView camera thats assisted with triple-LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation. It shoots videos in 4K with audio being captured by a 4 microphone set up. For selfies, both models get a 5MP f/2.4 wide angle camera upfront that supports Full HD video recording. Keeping up with times, Microsoft is putting a USB Type-C port on both models and it supports Qi Wireless Charging and Fast Charge. The Lumia 950 gets a 3,000mAh battery while the bigger sibling gets a larger 3,340mAh capacity unit. In the connectivity department, it ticks all the essential boxes including 4G LTE, NFC, Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac WiFi. While it may not have a fingerprint scanner like its high-end rivals, the new flagship Lumias support Windows Hello biometric authentication feature, which unlocks at a glance.The biggest feature to look forward to is Windows Continuum. With an optional Display Dock, the Lumia 950/950 XL can be turned into a full PC experience. Just hook up a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and you can check emails and work on MS Office documents like you do on a desktop. We dont have local pricing details yet but the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL are priced in the US at US$549 (RM2,319) and US$649 (RM2,742) respectively. From what weve seen from SIRIM, we should be getting dual-SIM variants for both models.  [ SOURCE ]"

We love them because they do what we dont ever, ever, ever, ever want to do ourselves. We also love them because its fun to watch an extremely premium device get smashed to bits in the most ridiculousfashion ever.If you share our sentiment then good news! UnboxTherapy just dropped a new video where he uses the Samsung Galaxy S6 active (which we know is one tough device) as a hockey puck. If you cant tell, our noses are wrinkled with excitement now.In case you dont already know, the Samsung Galaxy S6 active sports a 5.1 quad-HD Super AMOLED display (14402560 pixels). On the inside, the device is powered by an Exynos 7420 octa-core processorwith four cores clocked at 2.1GHz and four at 1.5GHz paired with a 3GB of RAM and a choice of 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The camera unit is a 16-megapixel/5-megapixel front/rear combo and the entire device is wrapped up in asuper-ruggedshell.Designed to be a super rugged version of the Galaxy S6, the device is IP68 dust and water-resistant up to 1.5 metres and 30 minutes. Its also MIL-STD-810G certified salt, dust, humidity, rain, vibration, solar radiation, transport, and thermal shock resistant. Yup, that means it has a military certification for being able to take a beating.All credit to the device, it really cantake a beating. Unfortunately, the Galaxy S6 active isnt available in Malaysia in case you were thinking of getting one to have a go at it on Sunways ice rink. That said, we would really like it if Samsung Malaysia brings one over for us to have a spot if sepak takraw with. Pretty please?[SOURCE]"

If they keep the pricing in the same bracket as the previous Galaxy A series, we could have a serious contender in the low-to-midrange end of the smartphone market.The Galaxy A series consists of three phones, the Galaxy A3, Galaxy A5, and Galaxy A7 all bearing their new 6 badge that is supposed to represent 2016. We dont know about you, but this peculiar badging just seems like another way to unnecessarily confuse prospective buyers.At first glance, all three devices share Samsungs Galaxy S6 flagships looks with a metal body sandwiched between two panels of glass. They also feature the rounded edges of the Galaxy S6 and pretty much the same layout weve grown to get used to for Samsung devices. All three devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box.One thing that we were quite impressed with was the camera. All devices across the announced Galaxy A range feature a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture rear shooter and a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates them is that on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 both come bundled with optical image stabilisation (OIS) for their primary imaging unit. Thats pretty impressive for what looks to be mid-range devices. The best part? They all come in Pink Gold, so if youve ever wanted that colour but not the price tag it usually comes with, this could be your chance.That aside, the Galaxy A series begins with what looks like the entry-level Galaxy A3 sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280720 pixels) Super AMOLED display. The device would be powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz processor mated with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. This smartphone will also come with a 2,300 mAh battery.The Galaxy A3 will also have dual-SIM support, but it doesnt appear to be a hybrid-SIM set up which means that you can have two SIMs and a microSD card. Other goodies include Cat.4 LTE connectivity support and 802.11 b/g/n WiFi. It also comes with Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, but no support for Samsung Pay.Moving up the pecking order comes the mid-range Galaxy A5. As the name implies, the Galaxy A5 is a step up from the Galaxy A3 and features a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (also expandable via microSD up to 128GB). It is also bigger, with a 5.2 full-HD (19201080 pixels) Super AMOLED display. Powering it all will be a 2,900 mAh battery with fast charging.Connectivity options include Cat.6 LTE support, 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, this time with support for Samsung Pay. Perhaps one of the key features of this device is the fingerprint scanner, which is quite rare beyond the top end of the smartphone spectrum. Much like the Galaxy A3, the Galaxy A5 also has dual-SIM support.Sitting at the top of the range is the Galaxy A7, which is the largest device, featuring a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel. Under the hood, the smartphone will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. It also has dual-SIM capabilities.Connectivity options are the same as the Galaxy A5, but the Galaxy A7 gets a bigger 3,300 mAh battery also with fast charging. Like its smaller brother the Galaxy A5, the Galaxy A7 also comes with a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay.Though the specific type of processor was not revealed, we have a hunch that it is Samsungs Exynos processor. The first range of the Galaxy A smartphones were launched towards the end of 2014 and it was Samsungs first attempt at truly bringing premium build quality to the masses. Before the Galaxy A series was launched, Samsungs low end devices were all very plasticky and felt cheaply made, which felt like a rude reminder to all those who bought them to work harder.Now, with the rise of Chinese OEMs and their seemingly impossible smartphone value-for-money, especially in the lower end of the spectrum, the Korean electronics giant cant afford to be complacent in their budget smartphones and risk giving up this lucrative section in the market.If the refreshed 2016 versions of the Galaxy A lineup are to be priced similarly to the previous Galaxy A lineup, we think that it could definitely be very competitive in that market. However, if Samsung prices these devices higher than their previous lineup, youd be better off with a discounted Galaxy S6 instead.As a reference, when the original Galaxy A lineup was launched, the Galaxy A3 was priced at RM899, while the Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199, and the Galaxy A7 would set you back RM1,499. Bear in mind, these prices were before the implementation of GST and the falling ringgit. Of course, there are other good smartphones at this price bracket as well, such as the OnePlus X, the Sony Xperia M5 Dual and the honor 7. So the question is, do you buy into Samsungs idea of a premium mid-range device?Were pretty keen on these devices, what do you guys think? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE, 2]"

Captivating tech folks since coming into existence, the USB Type-C port is almost an all-in-one cable/head solution  beam pixels your display, transfer your data and charge up your power-hungry devices. So how does Thunderbolt 3 come into play?Well, utilisation of USB Type-C protocols and Thunderbolt 3 technology will in theory allow data transfers up to 40Gbps (giga bits per second), doubling what weve seen on Thunderbolt 2 ports, and quadrupling speeds on USB 3.1. That roughly translates to an uncompressed RAW 4K video (1 hour long) sizing in at 158.2GB transferring around 30 seconds  working out to 5GBps.Talking about driving pixels on screen, itll also be capable of displaying two 4K-resolution screens up to a 60Hz refresh rate at the same time and quicken charging for notebooks up to 100 watts.Setting a platform for other types of protocols like DisplayPort, Super Speed USB and PCIExpress, Intel will bank on Thunderbolt to gain traction, as it hasnt really caught on for most users; except those tech-centric folks out there needing more from their ports.Already realised on smartphones like the OnePlus Two (but dont use their cables, read about that here), Xiaomis Mi 4c, Lumia 950 series, latest Nexuses, PCs and tablets, we hope that USB Type-C catches on quickly.

According to the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), this update was not initiated by the app maker and has been infecting Android devices in Singapore over the past few months.After the update has been downloaded, the malware will prompt the user to enter confidential information, such as credit card details. Then the malware would take over the affected device and intercepts the one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS to the phone for committing fraudulenttransactions.Criminals have been targeting computer users, but now criminals have turned to targeting Android phone users as banks are pushing out more banking apps for user convenience, said ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon. It turns out convenience really is becoming the downfall of humanity as we continuously rely on our devices to carry out daily activities.According to Channel NewsAsia, this vulnerability extends beyond just WhatsApp as they claim the malware is disguising itself as an operating system update as well. They reported that about 50 smartphone users have been hit by malware targeting mobile banking customers in the last three months. Besides disguising itself as a WhatsApp update, it also reportedly masquerades as an operating system update for the battery management module.Channel NewsAsia also reports that ABS estimates the average amounts lost by the victims who are customers of major retail banks in Singapore were a couple of hundred of dollars, although some victims could have lost several thousand dollars through multiple transactions. The source of these fraudulent transactions appear to originate from Eastern Europe and includes purchases of budget airline tickets.Jailbroken iPhones or rooted Android [devices] are vulnerableand in particular Android, because that phone system involves easier download of third-party apps, said Ong-Ang. The silver lining is that ABS states that banks may refund victims on a case-by-case basis depending on whether or not the victim took the necessary precautions to protect themselves from such attacks.Singapore is awfully close to our home soil of Malaysia, so please be warned and double check your updates before installing them. At the time that this article was written, there has been no official announcement on this matter posted on WhatsApps Facebook page, Twitter or Blog. So the moral of the story here is, please make sure that your application updates come directly from the Google Play Store.[SOURCE, 2]"

Making inlays into the higher-end market by imploring classier materials like metal, as seen by Huawei and Xiaomi, Vivo hasnt been left in the dust, releasing the X6 and X6 Plus in light of the current trend. Specs are king though the new duo might have something to say about that, taking a look under their hoods.Lets start with the smaller X6, that carries a 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display. Under that screen, sits a 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6752 Octa-core processor, mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory.

Itll also natively support a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot, that allows you to swap up the second SIM for a microSD card. The two devices are quite similar, only altering by screen size, internal storage and battery size.That said, the larger X6 Plus has a 5.7-inch screen of the same resolution, while its internal memory gets bumped up to 64GBs. The smaller of the two will carry a 2,400 mAh battery and the vivo X6 Plus will don a 3,000 mAh battery.

Postpaid customers, just ensure youre on the U28, P50 or P70, iPlans or UD plans. Lastly, broadband users on the MB Plan will be allocated the same free 1GB of data.The data will be bundled with your existing package, so theres no nonsense about using this quota before getting the additional 1GB, not that it matters in the first place.Bear in mind that this is only a year end promo, so your extra 1GB of free data will only last you untilNew Years Eve aka 31st of December, 2015 only. To check up if youve actually received the data, you can refer to your UMB, SMS and U Mobile app.Its no question that the orange telco learnt a thing or two from Digis offer that required customers to activate their free data, after their network outage  so kudos U Mobile for making it easier for your customers.Please head over to U Mobiles FAQ herefor further clarification.[ SOURCE ]"

DirectD is a household name in our country and despite setting abhorrent prices on some of their inventory.Xiaomis second iteration of a tablet, the Mi Pad 2, meets the list and now has an all metal body  easily comparable to the iPad Mini 4.The model thats available on DirectDs website is the 16GB version, and theyve priced it RM 899 (w/ GST). The colours on offer are Champagne gold and Dark grey. Jogging your memory on this tablet, it has a 7.9-inch screen plastered onto its metal build, the screen itself has a resolution of 2048 x 1536 (326 ppi).Lighter, thinner and overall smaller than its predecessor, it maintains the same screen size but shrinks down the bezels all around the screen. The Mi Pad 2, ditches the plastic yet weighs in at 322grams, when the model it replaces tips in at 360grams.The upgrades continue with an Intel chipset now at the helm, a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 to be precise. Its 16GB internal storage might set off some alarms with the omission of a microSD slot, especially those inclined to have most of their media with them on the go.For photography (if youre seriously going to consider that with a tablet), itll get an 8-megapixel f/2.0 aperture lens on the rear, that will get you up to FHD video recording. As the front has a 5-megapixel lens, in case of those video calling moments or selfies (again, if youre seriously considering doing that with a tablet).Two speaker grills will be found on the bottom rear and underneath its backing, theres a 6190 mAh battery, smaller than before. Xiaomi however, promises itll get you 100 hours of music listening and almost 12 and a half hours of video watching.Charging the aforementioned battery will be the USB Type-C port and connector, while other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi; sadly, no 4G LTE support makes its way on this device.In terms of software, youll find MIUI 7 OS skin, as per usual. Xiaomi has plans on releasing a Windows 10 model soon, but we have no idea when itll be announced.Comparing prices abroad in the brands domestic market (China), the 16GB sells for roughly RM 662, thats a RM 200+ premium, that youre paying for. At the same time, the higher 64GB model retails for about RM 861, so think about that for a second.You pay for what you get it seems and DirectD has the ball in their court, whether or not itll be received well, that depends on you guys.[ SOURCE, VIA, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

Well, they certainly werent kidding when they said it was designed specifically for the 4G LTE user.Hotlink FASTs starter pack is priced at RM15 and it comes with RM5 preloaded airtime, 300MB preloaded high-speed Internet and offers users a choice of three internet passes. The first plan gives users a 2GB quota for 30 days, then the second plan doubles that up to 4GB and finally the third plan is sort of a lite version where it gives users 500MB for 7 days. Call rates are the same across all plans at 6sen/30sec to your ACTIV10 (10 Hotlink/Maxis numbers) and 12sen/30sec to all local networks. SMS is rated at 1sen/SMS to your ACTIV10 contacts and 12sen/SMS to all local networks.Users can also apply for an add-on of either 1GB (RM12), 500MB (RM8), or 300MB (RM5) that will last the duration of your quota cycle. On the website, it states that there will be No credit drain and that the Internet will stop its service once the FAST Internet pass expires. However, Hotlink informs us that one the quota has been finished, you can still surf the Internet, but at a throttled speed of 64kbps.They explained that although the quota was split between 4G LTE and non-4G LTE speeds, once a user depletes their designated 4G quota, they can continue surfing at 4G speeds but this time it will draw from their All Networks quota instead. Unfortunately, theinverse is not true. This means that if you were in a location without 4G LTE coverage, you can only use the All Networks quota, which is half of what you are actually paying for.Now we understand that to create a competitive plan, compromises have to be made, but surely this doesnt make any sense. Why would Hotlink want to segregate quota by network type? This just seems like a major inconvenience to the consumer.Perhaps this is a testament to how confident Maxis is in their 4G LTE coverage, but even that seems like a stretch to try and justify their actions. In any case the plans themselves, if you ignore the split quota, is quite reasonable. So, if you have faith in Maxis network coverage and would like to sign up for this plan, existing Hotlink users can do so via the Hotlink RED app by going to My Account and selecting Change next to Rateplan. Alternatively they can dial *100*6*1# from their mobile devices.Non-Hotlink members can simply proceed to the nearest Hotlink Dealer or Maxis Centre.For more information, head on over to their website."

As a gesture of appreciation to its subscribers, they are giving out 1GB of free data for the month of December.So how fast is the fastest? Speedtest has finally revealed the numbers along with the rank of our current fixed and mobile operators in the country. Full details after the break. Starting with mobile networks that are running on 4G LTE, U Mobile is ranked #1 with an average download speed of 22.58Mbps with uploads of 10.34Mbps. Following in 2nd place is Celcom with 19.46Mbps downloads and Maxis holding on to third place at 18.20Mbps. Meanwhile, Digi takes the last place at 17.49Mbps.  For fixed broadband, TM takes up the Top 3 which is a mixture of various identifiers that lead back to Telekom Malaysia. Looking at the speeds, it is safe to assume that all 3 listings are predominantly Unifi subscribers on the highest 20Mbps Unifi plan. This is then followed by Maxis and YTL Communications, that operates Yes 4G WiMAX. Surprisingly Time Broadband didnt make the list and we feel they could be among the Top 5 if it wasnt for TMs duplicated entries. To recap on the methodology, Speedtest measures the average performance of each telco based on the fastest technology possible which is 4G LTE. So in theory, this wouldnt take into account of speedtests conducted on 3G and on older non-LTE enabled devices. For fixed broadband ISP, the performance is calculated based on the top 10% of each networks speedtest results. This according to Speedtest is to accurate represent customers that subscribe to the highest tier/package offered by the ISP. While 4G telcos are self proclaiming the widest, fastest and best network, Speedtest is probably the best independent indicator for now. Another glaring difference between Malaysia versus other countries is that our mobile telcos are delivering faster speeds than our fixed broadband providers. In most cases, the fixed broadband providers in US, Canada, UK and Australia are clocking around 100Mbps or at least 2-3X faster than their fastest 4G operators. So what do you guys think of the verdict? [ SOURCE ]"

I completely understand this desire to milk every last drop out of your prized cow simply because money is hard to make in this world where piracy is rampant.Generally, many of these spin-offs tend to fall flat and the way I see it, there are two big reasons why this happens. The first is that the show doesnt live up to the hype. Its hard to follow in the footsteps of something as big as, say, Friends for example (were looking at you Joey). Secondly, it doesnt eventually break off from the original and find and identity of its own, or that special niche that makes a show special.In the world of smartphones, it seems, that there exists this same desire to spin off into various other versions of an OEMs flagship or popular device.Some spin-offs are designed to make their flagship devices more accessible with lower price points by omitting one or two key features but keeping the feel the same. Others try to incorporate one new key feature thats absent from the main device.The latter is where ASUSs Zenfone 2 Laser comes in. In case you havent realised it yet, the keyword here is laser, which means that this spin-off devices camera comes with a laser autofocus. And as with spin-offs, the question remains, does it float or does it fall?"

Wed still think that driving an automobile is an experience best felt by being fully in control but theyre obviously perks to being able to have the ability to control your vehicle autonomously or through a remote.
Pushing the boundaries of driving autonomously, the multi-talented UK based research team from Land Rover have been prototyping technology that allows you to move around your huge SUV or off-road beast, through fiddling with on-screen controls on your smartphone.
Usher your Multi-point turn enabled Range Rover in a relatively controlled environment at a max speed of 4mph and manoeuvre your way through tight situations. Handing you controls for steering, breaks and accelerator, youll be able to be outside your car as you carefully move it around challenging terrain or hard to see parking situations  taking bad viewing angles out of the equation.
Land Rover researchers also programmed the Multi-point turn technology to give those manning the virtual wheels the controls to adjust high and low range, anglingthe car in just the right manner to get around.It doesnt stop there, as these in-built sensors on the car will apparently work in all weather conditions and environments, always enabling you to get yourself out of a tight spot, if need be. There are some limitations, such as range, when considering that youll only be able to command the car from a distance of 10 metres, all while your smartphone and smart keys are in close proximity.
The team of researchers have also developed technology that allows you to turn your car a full 180-degrees in a tight spot; basically conducting a three-point turn. A much dreaded manoeuvre for anyones that has been in the driver seat of a large vehicle.Although other carmakers have already started implementing some of these options, itll be interesting to see how the idea of controlling your car from your smartphones will run along. It wont please any motorheads but given the notion, it might be pretty cool.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

KPDNKKs Intellectual Property Enforcement Division head Othman Nawang said that based on the information and intelligence gathered during the KPDNKKs investigation, they had conclusive evidence to carry out the raid on these two locations suspected of selling counterfeit OPPO products.Sure enough the raid was a success as the joint task force uncovered 8 counterfeit devices worth over RM4,200. This may only seem like a fraction of the earlier reported 644 counterfeit devices, but at least these are devices that people havent spent their hard earned money on, so at its a start if nothing else. Among the phones confiscated, were fake versions of the OPPO Find 7 and OPPO N3.Othman said that the ministry had sent out recon teams to investigate the two locations and they found that these counterfeit devices were being sold between RM400 and RM700, which is a stark contrast to their original price range of RM1,000 to RM2,098.According to OPPO Overseas Customer Service manager Boyce Lee, this was the first raid to crack down on counterfeit phones conducted by KPDNKK.Ever since we received reports in early January, we have been in close contact with the Ministry to further strike down these counterfeiting activities, he said. We have brought this to the Ministrys attention that the circulation of counterfeit products are getting worse with each passing day and we seek legal actions to be taken by the authority.Boyce added that to the layman, the counterfeit products design were almost indistinguishable from original OPPO products, but the devices poor design quality and unstable features tainted the OPPO name. He added that there was a possibility that the cheap parts used could have direct harmful or toxic effects on the user.If you have any qualms about whether or not your OPPO device is authentic, OPPO has a program that allows you tocheck the devices IMEI number to determine authenticity. OPPO also encourages users who have any information regarding the sale or misconduct of counterfeit goods to contact KPDNKK on their hotline at 1800-886-800."

When it comes to actual usage, speed is probably more important in our current connected age. So who is the fastest? A popular internet speed testing tool has just named Malaysias fastest mobile network and the winner might surprise you.
U Mobile, Malaysias youngest mobile telco was just awarded the Fastest Mobile Network in the country by Ooklas Speedtest. An impressive feat considering U Mobile is the last among the 4 telcos to roll out 4G LTE. Despite not having extensive 4G coverage, U Mobile is capable of delivering high-speeds up to 42Mbps with its 3G HSPA+ network. Weve mentioned several times that the current 4G coverage race is getting rather silly. Any telco can throw numbers but ultimately what does it mean to the average consumer? For example, when Digi reclaimed the widest 4G LTE title, they mentioned that customers can expect 5Mbps speeds on 4G and more than 15Mbps on 4G LTE-A. Those numbers are low for 4G standards and they are already achievable with current 3G technologies. After all, it is not what you have, but what you do with it. At the moment, Ookla has yet to publish the full Malaysian report on their Speedtest Award page but we assume that they used the same methodology here as other countries. The results are derived from the average performance recorded on the fastest technology possible which is 4G. Each test are aggregated by averaging each users test result at several locations each day. This prevents manipulation of repeated speedtests by a handful of users from affecting the overall result. You can read up how Ookla determine whos the fastest over here. So U Mobile subscribers, do you agree with this verdict?[ SOURCE ]"

Now invitations have gone out setting the date for the Google x Huawei collaborative device and by the looks of it, some gift boxes might include them just in time for Christmas.Early adopters might already have the device in their hands, since DirectDbegan importing the units last week. Theyve been milking eager fans by a pretty margin but all is fair when it comes to grey importers, we suppose.The aforementioned page that went up on vmall.my listed the device will be on sale for RM 2,698 (w/ GST) for the 64GB model; which is equally stacked against another Huawei device, the Mate S (64GB). Easily pointing to the manufacturer not wanting to bite themselves in the butt by selling the Nexus at a lower price, to keep some emphasis on their other smartphones.Playing down the state of our currency, its likely the heighten pricing is to leave some leeway for the Ringgit to continue to fluctuate. Taking into consideration that the 32GB Nexus 6P sells for US$ 499 (RM 2,128) and the 64GB model goes for US$ 549 (RM 2,341) in the US.The collaborative effort will bring about the latest version of Android, with Marshmallow finally coming into the horizon. Sizing in at 5.7-inches, youll get a QHD display (2560 x 1440), with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 under the hood. Internal memory options were listed above, while itll carry 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM for multitasking and app switching.In terms of photography, there will be a 12.3-megapixel sensor on the rear thats equip with 1.55 micron pixels and an aperture of f/2.0 for those low light situations. Accompanying the camera module will be a dual-tone LED and laser auto focus as well. Taking a look at the front, an 8-megapixel f2.4 shutter will greet you near the top; this sensor will carry a 1.4-micron pixel size.For audio, itll boast dual front facing stereo speakers on the top and bottom, while Huawei also deploys USB Type-C for data and charging utilisation. The port itself, will help charge up the 3,450mAh battery thats inside, while quick charge 2.0the future-proof port will help bring it up to speed, just a little quicker  only on particular chargersthough; nope those Quick Charge 2.0 charging heads wont be of any use.The last bell and whistle would be the Nexus Imprint finger print sensor, that sits below the rear camera lens. A feature that pretty much lined up with Googles vision to make native fingerprint scanning a thing on Android M.The announcement couldnt come any sooner, since theyve been consumers who are itching to get their own units after DirectD started offering the smartphone. Local warranty and a cheaper price seems like a no-brainer but we hope you waited."

Its going to take a lot more than product placement in a Bond film to revive the Japanese giant, or at least their mobile division, if they want to continue the Xperia brand.Adopting a two-time refresh every trading year, Sony dares to do something other smartphone makers would never even suggest in boardrooms, though have they kept up a timely trend? Or have these attempts been sloppy?What changed, other than the name?The changes are not for show, not on the outside anyway, so dont expect to have friends ask you about your upgrade from the Xperia M4 Aqua, you wont be getting that. It will however, get you a speedier and more fluid experience, since internally it gets upped in all aspects. Were talking about the same 5-inch footprint but a higher resolution screen, faster processor, more RAM, a better camera, and everything else, which well delve deeper into on the following pages."

Its recently introduced Piston V3 in-ear headphones is pretty decent for a mere RM69 and if youre looking for on-ear headphones, the more premium Mi Headphone is currently going for RM369.Now a newer Mi In-Ear headphones Pro version is coming and you can stand a chance to own one in Malaysia this coming weekend.  The new In-Ear Headphones Pro claims to be a hybrid unit with a dynamic driver accompanied by a two-way balanced-armature (BA) driver. This apparently is one of the smallest three-way headphones in the market that offers true reference quality audio. For a better audio experience, they have gotten help of Sound Engineer and Grammy/Latin Grammy Awards winner Luca Bignardi to tune the latest headphones. In terms of build, it gets a diamond cut metal body with fine textures like its former Piston series. Designed for smart phone use, theres also a built-in microphone with 3 dedicated buttons for volume and audio playback controls. For better durability, the Mi In-ear Headphones Pro uses kevlar for its cables for better durability in the long run. In terms of specs, the new Pro headphones has a speaker impedance of 32, similar to the V3 Pistons, but it is more sensitive at 101dB (V3 Pistons: 98dB). It weighs 14grams, which is the same as the current V3 but slightly heavier than the former V2.1 Pistons (12g). In China, the pair is going for 99 CNY (about RM66) but do expect a slight markup to buffer for potential currency fluctuation. This coming Sunday (6th December), Xiaomi is organising an experiential event with 1 Mores Director of Product Marketing as their key speaker. To take part in this closed door event, you can register your interest over here. If selected, you could get a unit for free, but only if you agree to submit a review on their MIUI forum.

Next is now.By the turn of the new year, gift-giving season is ripe as day and everyone is out and about getting their loved ones something special. If youre in the market for a large screened smartphone, youd probably have the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ on your wish-list, so why bother searching any further?

Jostling between your work and play is already tough to begin with but with a premium pocket companion like the Galaxy S6 edge+, itll get easier. Designed with high-end aluminium and glass, the combo makes the 5.7-inch device a pleasure to hold in your hands.Captivate friends and family with its QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED screen, as you browse through shopping lists, and let them notice the nimbleness of the package. Youll notice the dual-edged display immediately and it offers some great functionality too, making sure your loved ones are just a tap away. Measuring at 154 x 75.8 x 6.9mm, it has a small footprint for a device with such a large screen, while only weighing 153grams. Light but still sturdy in its make, with materials that are now more durable than its predecessor.
Multi-tasking wont be a hitch either, with its class-leading Exynos 7420 64-bit Octa-core processor and 4GB RAM that goes along with. Aimed at giving you a stutter free experience as you switch between all your online shopping applications, browsers and entertainment options.With those specs, youd expect the Galaxy S6 edges camera to flaunt the same resume, and it does. Testing the same sensor found on the Korean companys other flagship, the Galaxy Note5; our readers voted for it to be the best of the flagships  across all the other major players.Pleasing you with the 16-megapixel main camera, it wont show any compromises while your capturing and sharing photos during the holiday season. Feel free to take images of the things youd purchase and ask for opinions on gift ideas, the camera wont disappoint.The front sensor will hold its ground too with selfies abundant during the festive period, though some might not be as lucky; having to spend this season apart, due to unforeseen circumstances  fret not, the 5-megapixel lens allows 4K video recording, so no pixelated videos during sharing. All that moving around while recording or taking photos during parties wont hamper the main camera either, since it comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS); theres also HDR (high dynamic range) on board the two cameras, so the objects and backgrounds of your pictures will have just the right mix of exposure, giving you the best photo.Share all the splendour with its wide array of connectivity options; youll find 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0 and the works on board, never leaving you in a spot with cellular reception (unless its your telco coverage). The device will charge up quickly too, with Samsungs own fast charge technology on the 3000 mAh battery. You can ditch cables too, if you have the supported Qi Wireless charging dock.TouchWiz is also less cluttered and more refined, since Samsung streamlining their signature skin based on Androids operating system. Theres much to love about the Galaxy S6 edge+, a bigger screen, the same great flagship specs, and at a fair price of RM 3,099 (w/ GST), your loved ones would probably love it too."
Rory Lee,"HTC hopes to still be brilliant, but a little less quiet this time",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/htc-hopes-to-still-be-brilliant-but-a-little-less-quiet-this-time/,"Android,HTC,HTC Malaysia,HTC Preview,htc preview malaysia,HTC Preview Program,htc preview program malaysia,htc reddit,reddit,smart phone,smartphone","Android,HTC,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-26,"Theres no denying it, HTC is in trouble. 2015 sales figures are less than stellar as their monthly revenue has been on a steady decline since April. Many owe this bad performance to the OEMs disappointing 2015 flagship the One M9 and how HTC didnt go back to the drawing board when developing it.Perhaps it was because they were stubborn, or perhaps it was because of a lack of communication between the company and their customers that put them in this predicament.Well, HTC mustve figured it was the latter because thesmartphone manufacturer just announced that they are opening up the HTC Preview Program to all in the hope that it would help them better understand what exactly their customers want.In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on social, news and entertainment aggregation website Reddit, HTCs USA Preview Team announced their intention to find a new way to connect back to the Android community, as well as answer any questions the community might have about this program. In a nutshell, this program will allow HTC fans to get their hands on the companys latest software and hardware before it is released, in exchange for daily use and feedback.Yes, hardware too. In the FAQ hosted on the Preview website, it is stated that while those selected to participate in this program will occasionally require participants to use their own devices, depending on the specific HTC Preview projects, the OEM may also provide loaner devices too. It seemslike a good opportunityto get your hands on some unreleased HTC hardware.Of course, as the primary purpose of this program is to identify daily user habits, user information and feedback has to be collected by the company. However, HTC has clarified that while there will be logs running in the background to collect data on network/signal strength, battery information, usage times and apps used, they will not collect any sensitive personal data or tell what you are looking at on your screen unless you explicitly take a screenshot to share with them.They also clarified that one of the reasons they have opened up the HTC Preview program is to have actual hard facts and feedback on what their users want. This is so that they have actual data backing them when they tell executives what their customers want, which in turn makes it easier to have an impact on change within the company.HTC also reassured the community that they will take the feedback from this program very seriously and will tweak their upcoming devices to improve based on that information. They also added that if feedback for a device is overwhelmingly negative, they would even use that information to evaluate a products release.This is a very bold move by HTC, bringing what looks like, on the surface at least, more transparency to their product development. It should also ignite a warm fire in the hearts of HTC fans who have been clamouring for their voices to be heard and who are passionate about helping the company grow past these hard times.However, as this has only just been launched, the actual effectiveness of this program remains to be seen. They could just be all talk and have no action. For whatever its worth, lets hope this does help them get back on its feet because it would be such a shame if the company, which had brought us one of the most beautiful metal unibody designs, fell out of the race.For those of you who are interested, you can also participate in the HTC Preview program, just head on over to their website and follow the instructions there.[SOURCE, VIA]"
Rory Lee,A new challenger approaches: TM to enter mobile race next year,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/27/a-new-challenger-approaches-tm-to-enter-mobile-race-next-year/,"4G LTE Malaysia,lte,LTE Malaysia,P1,P1 malaysia,packet one,Telekom Malaysia,TM,TM 4G LTE,TM mobile,TMGo","Industry in General,Mobile Apps,P1,P1,Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-11-27,"The mobile industry is a booming one, with more and more industryplayers want to get a slice of it, be it manufacturers or telco providers. Set to be the latest horse to enter the race, TMis setting its sights on a 2016 entry into the mobile telco industry in Malaysia.This will complicate things, to say the least, for the existing four players Maxis, Celcom, Digi and U Mobile.With the acquisition of Packet One Networks (P1)inOctober of 2014, TM set out to develop them into their mobile arm and mobility centre, eyeing an end of 2015 launch of their mobile services. However, clearly pushing into the mobile sector proved difficult even for the telco giant, so TM have instead decided to take baby steps and only start user trials and network readiness tests come December.However, according to TM group chief executive officer Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, development of Telekom Malaysias overall LTE network rollout is on track, with the core LTE network being managed and planned for future growth by P1.We are now building on that core to roll out nationwide, starting with urban areas and adjacent to existing base stations, said Zamzamzairani.This isnt TMs first foray into the LTEtechnology as they had launched their very own LTE-based 4G broadband service, TMgo back in August of last year. TMgo was launched while the TM-P1 partnership was still pending approval, so it ran at a lower 850MHz frequency instead of the usual 1800MHz/2600MHz bands used by mainstream 4G operators.Now, with the full support of P1 at their backs, TM can really flex its muscles and push their way into the four-horse race. As with any industry, having more competition will only be beneficial for the consumer. With more competition, telcos have to tread carefully to keep their services relevant and avoid being run over by competition.With a major telecommunications player like TM entering the mobile services scene, you can expect the existing players who are currently locked in a four-way-free-for-all for LTE supremacy, to scramble and make sure the upstart new challenger doesnt take their crown away from them.In any case, if TM successfully makes their way into the mobile sector, it can only mean good things for us consumers. We can realistically expect more competitive pricing, more improvements in terms of coverage and probably a whole lot more drama.[SOURCE, 2]"
Rory Lee,6 Tips to stay connected during floods,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/6-tips-to-stay-connected-during-floods/,"banjir,CFM,flood,Flooding,Malaysia Flood,MCMC,mobile tips during floods,poor signal during floods,tips during flood",Industry in General,2015-11-26,"The rainy season is in full effect now with many parts of the country experiencing constant downpour each day. And with the tide phenomenon that is expected to occur in the Straits of Tebrau from the 24th to 30th of November is likely to mean more trouble for affected locals.Malaysia has had its fair share of flood woes in the past and since its the rainy season again, the folks at Communications and Multimedia Consumer Forum of Malaysia (CFM) have decided to take a more proactive role to ensure effective communication during these potentially trying times remains strong.CFM have sent us a long list of tips that are designed to help the public better manage as well as communicate more effectively during times of emergency. We at SoyaCincau.com value your time and as a result have condensed their tips for your convenience.Here are the 6 communication tips during floods:CFM strongly urges the public to be patient when communicating. If your call or msg is unable to get through to the other person, wait awhile before trying again. The communication infrastructure is put under a lot of stress during times of emergency and can get congested due to the high volume of messages. So, if everyone incessantly tries to communicate, it becomes less likely that any messages will get through at all.Its sort of like traffic congestion, really. If everyone leaves their office at 6pm, then nobody would be getting anywhere anytime soon.We know some of you have completely abandoned the SMS service, because frankly who needs it when you have free messaging applications like Whatsapp? But, CFM advises users to use this retro form of communication during emergencies because they take up less bandwidth and will put a lighter load on the communication system.If we were to build on our traffic jam analogy, a call would be that large BMW 750Li, while a text message would only be a little Vespa zipping along between traffic.Needless to say, without power, that flagship smartphone you paid thousands of ringgit for is about as useful as a brick. Probably less useful since its so light and thin, so CFM encourages its consumers to charge up your devices and power banks when there is power. That way, if and when the power goes down, you will still have enough juice to keep your phones running.Of course, saving power also means using your devices less often. Save them for emergencies and only use them when you absolutely have to, not to post a selfie on Instagram. If your device has power saving mode, it is recommended to enable it to extend its battery life. Speaking of Instagram, CFM implores everyone to limit their online activity to avoid coverage congestion. Actions like uploading photos, videos or sharing voice clips on social media consumes a lot of bandwidth and by now were sure you all know what that means. Yep, you guessed it, congestion.10 points to Gryffindor!Weve all seen disaster movies. Weve all seen the scene where the protagonists are trapped in a danger zone and are waiting by the radio with bated breath for information that could very well save them. Well, it turns out there is some truth in those scenes as CFM says that it becomes an important source of news during an emergency. However, they have stated that consumers should ensure that they have an adequate battery supply before doing so.You can also get the latest updates from local emergency response services or RELA members so its a good idea to keep their contact handy.Well, keep calm. There really isno use in panicking during an emergency.CFM informs us that they arent sitting on their hands at their end either. The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (KKMM) and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)are workingwith all Telecommunications Service Providers (SPs) to provide temporary base communication station towers at several affected areas as a support to enhance the coverage during floods or natural disasters.However, they did add that priority will be given to places that are in need of it the most. They also ask for your understanding that natural disasters can cause unavoidable damage to infrastructure in affected areas which would result in less than stellar coverage.Teamwork is key in these situations so do be considerate and work together to overcome times of emergency.[IMAGE SOURCE]"
Rory Lee,Waze and Google Maps could expose Malaysia to external threats says UMNO MP,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/waze-and-google-maps-could-expose-malaysia-to-external-threats-says-umno-mp/,"external threats,Google Maps,Google Maps Malaysia,navigation,parliament,Raime Unggi,TPP,trans-pacific partnership,umno,Waze","Industry in General,Mobile Apps",2015-11-26,"When we announced that Google Maps offline navigation had finally rolled out in Malaysia, many rejoiced, but apparently not everyone is happy with being able to rely on navigation applications just a little more. UMNO lawmaker Datuk Raime Unggi said in Parliament today that Malaysian dependency on navigation apps to find their way around the maze-like labyrinth of Kuala Lumpurs bustling city centre, was possibly exposing our country to external threats from foreign countries.The Tenom MP proceeded to elaborate that this was because when users use these applications for location searching, it indirectly provides information about Malaysia to external quarters such as the United States and Israel. The reason he cited these two countries, we assume, is because Google is headquartered in the US while Google owned Waze was developed in Israel.Kuala Selangor MP Datuk Irmohizam Ibrahim said that our nation cannot compromise when it comes to national security. He also brings up the issue about the extent to which our laws could protect such information leaks.How far do we have laws that prevent information leaks in the usage of Google Map(s) and Waze? he asks the Parliament. Are there laws to make sure national security protected in the usage of such apps?Communications and Multimedia Deputy Minister Datuk Jailani Johari reassured the concerned MPs that it was up to the users to decide how much personal information they wished to share and that they could choose to stop using the apps if they disagreed with the privacy policies.Jailani adds that the apps function based on privacy policies that are agreed upon by the individual and the application provider, be it Waze or Google Maps. If the userdecides that they do not want to continue using the service, they can terminate the agreement and the provider will no longer hold on to their data.We have yet to receive any report on any apps used for spying purposes.The real issue is that our users are fond of over-sharing private information on the Internet. This results in the information being misused. As a smart internet user, we should have our own controls, said Jailani, who is also the MP for Hulu Terengganu.Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed also downplayed the danger claimed to be posed by the navigation applications, saying that these applications have helped citizens navigate more than it helps terrorists. He did however say that he acknowledges the security concerns, but he feels that the pros outweigh the cons.Kuala Krai MP Dr MohdHatta Ramli raised another concern that if the government decides to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) it could give foreign countries access to Malaysian personal data collected by the aforementioned navigation applications.Our personal data used to be kept within the borders of the country, he said. Now with TPP, we must not allow it to be taken out of the county. We have a lot personal data that we would not like to share with other people.. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a 12-nation free trade agreement backed by the United States which is set to be debated in Malaysia in January next year.Opposition MP for Kelana Jaya Wong Chen said that the free trade treaty required Malaysia to allow transfer of electronic information to foreign countries. TPP prohibition on data localisation laws (Article 14.13) essentially means personal info that is hosted abroad would be subject to different laws on privacy, he said. Wong further explained that under this, your personal data could be subjected to US surveillance laws such as the US Patriot Act, instead ofour own privacy laws.[SOURCE, 2, 3, 4]"

Rory Lee,OnePlus offering refunds for their problematic USB Type-C cables,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/27/oneplus-offering-refunds-for-their-problematic-usb-type-c-cables/,,,2015-11-27,"Awhile back, OnePlus came under fire from critics and the tech community in general when it was discovered that their USB Type-C cables were not spec compliant. This could possibly lead to damage if used with any device other than the OnePlus 2. Leading the charge was Google employee Benson Leung who had embarked on a crusade to purge the world of non-compliant USB Type-C cables.His method involved ordering cables off Amazon then testing them to see if they met the USB standards. When he arrived at the OnePlus cable, he found that even a cable manufactured by a proper smartphone manufacturer did not meet proper USB Type-C standards. Needless to say, the Caped Cable Crusader rained sweet justice down on the Chinese manufacturer, bringing them to their knees (metaphorically speaking, of course).Yesterday, OnePlus finally caved and admitted that their cables were indeed non-compliant, but it seems the USB Vigilante still isnt entirely satisfied.OnePlus graciously accepted Benson and the communitys criticism, openly admitting on their official forum that their USB Type-C cables and adapters were using a 10k resistor instead of the 56k resistor detailed in version 1.1 of the USB Type-C port standard. This message came straight from the top, no less. According to the post, the issue with resistors was that the cables and adapter were only designed for a maximum of 2 amps of power, which is how much the OnePlus 2s charger supports.However, when used on other devices that allowfast-charging, the resistor will let the devices try to draw more power than a power source mayallow. Ultimately, this could result in damage to said power source (such as 3rd-party cables, USB ports, etc.) if they do not have an internal mechanism to self-regulate the amount of power flowing to or from them. OnePlus added thattypically, if a charger has the CE, UL, or CCC markings, it should be certified and safe to use.The OEM also compiled their findings into a simple and easy-to-understand table detailed below:Unfortunately for OnePlus though, it appears that they didnt get everything right.(ps. Click the read more button in the widget for the full post)Ah Benson, do keep up the good work!In any case, OnePlus is offering a refund on the affected products purchased through the OnePlus website. Do note though that the cables that came bundled in the box with your OnePlus 2 will not be eligible for a refund.This is simply because OnePlus remains firm in saying that the cables and adaptors are entirely safe to use with the OnePlus 2 and that the problem was compatibility with other devices.Based on the post, the refund appears to only be available for customers in North America, Europe, India and China, and will only be offered by OnePlus until the end of December this year. For those of you thinking of cashing in to get some cables at discounted Black Fridaypricesand then getting a full priced refund for them, tough luck, because it appears that both the cable and the adapter are out-of-stock on the OnePlus website.[SOURCE, 2]"
Alexander Wong,Samsung says the Galaxy View is neither a TV nor a tablet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/27/samsung-says-the-galaxy-view-is-neither-a-tv-nor-a-tablet/,"Android,Galaxy View,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy View,Samsung Galaxy View Ad,Samsung Galaxy View Design,Samsung Galaxy View Specs,Smart TV,Tablet,TV","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-11-27,"Samsung has a knack for making devices of various screen sizes. The Galaxy View is their biggest yet with a gigantic 18.4 screen and it runs on Android. In their latest ad, Samsung isnt calling it a TV or a Tablet, but simply entertainment reimagined.Since both TV and tablets are generally media consumption devices, Samsung attempts to blur the line between the two, offering a larger screen experience in a somewhat portable form factor. Weighing at about 2.65kg, it is heavier than your average mobile device. With a handle at the back of the kickstand, Samsung wants it to be as easy to carry as a shopping bag.According to Samsung, the Galaxy View is designed to be used from an arms reach, hence they have created a new UI with larger icons and text for a more intuitive experience. Furthermore, the way people watch TV is much different now, with more opting to look for content when they want it, rather than to follow broadcast programs. For gaming, the Galaxy View has an S Console game app, where you can project your mobile games onto a bigger screen. It turns your smart phone into a controller for a console gaming-like experience. While the hardware could potentially replace a TV, it is a pity that Samsung hasnt included the essential TV ports such as HDMI. This could have opened up the Galaxy View as a portable TV for console gaming or to connect to other AV equipment. In the US, it is currently priced at US$499 which is about RM2,110. It gets a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM and theres a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of storage thats expandable with microSD. With an on-board 5,700mAh battery, the Galaxy View can be used unplugged up to 8 hours. If it ever comes here, would you be interested to get one?[ SOURCE 2 ]"

The internet is full of vulnerabilities and even our smart phones isnt spared from exploits. Having your data stolen is not funny but you can take action now with Zipit Chat.Using a globally recognised encryption system, it gives you a peace of mind when communicating with your peers. So how does Zipit Chat work? Read on to find out.Zipit Chat is currently available for Android devices and you can download it directly from the Google Play Store. For new users, activation is as easy as entering your mobile number and enter the verification code thats sent to you. Youll receive a unique Zipit ChatID that looks like a BlackBerry PIN and you can set your password between 6-16 digits. Once thats out of the way, you can start inviting your family and friends from your contact list.There are plenty of instant messaging apps out there but nobody does security better than Zipit Chat. Encrypted with AES 256 technology, your messages are impossible for anyone to intercept which gives you a true end to end encryption. When transmitting sensitive information such as password, pins or confidential information, you can set a Self-Destruct Timer from 30 seconds up to 10 minutes. For an extra layer of security, Zipit Chat even disables your phone screenshot function, so that nobody could snap a copy of it. Emails are still relevant these days and for business users, there are messages that are highly P&C. Weve heard stories of email accounts being hacked and if it does happen to you, Zipit Chat can keep your email threads secured with the same military grade encryption. The content will be scrambled including its attachments and only the intended sender and recipient can view it fully via Zipit Chat. If youre unconvinced, Celcom had earlier issued a challenge for anyone to decrypt 3 messages that are encrypted by Zipit Chat and nobody has managed to crack it so far. So even if some snooping agency or hackers have gain access to your inbox, it would take probably years to figure it out by brute force. Most people would have different logins and passwords for various accounts including online banking. If you find it hard to keep track of all of them, you jot them down safely under Zipit Chats Secure Notes. Similar to its email feature, it scrambles your note into a bunch of unreadable text, thus ensuring only you are able to read it. While it is not recommended to store passwords on your phone, at least you know theres a safer way to keep from prying eyes. Having your phone stolen is bad enough and the last thing you want is to have your personal data stolen. With Zipit Chat, your messages, notes and emails are always password protected at all times. When left inactive, it will constantly require your pin number to launch the app.For another layer of secrecy, theres a rather clever Stealth Mode which removes the Zipit Chat icon completely from your smart phone. To access the app again, just dial #*# followed by your pin number and then hit the call button.   Are you still putting your communication at risk? Just head over the PlayStore to download Zipit Chat. It costs RM10/month to subscribe but you can give it a try for free."

Rory Lee,Q Founder: Fossils first foray into Android Wear,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/q-founder-fossils-first-foray-into-android-wear/,"Android,Android Wear,Connected,fossil,Fossil Q Founder,Q Founder,Smart Watch,SmartWatch,TAG Heuer,TAG Heuer Connected","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Smart Watch",2015-11-26,"When the idea of a smartwatch started gaining traction, many suspected that the watchmaking industry would eventually try to take it over. It seemed like a logical thing to do to keep up with the times.Fossil thought so too and while initial models of their Q line hardly looked high-tech, their latest smartwatch, the Q Founder, does.The Q Founder is Fossils first ever smartwatch to be powered by Android Wear and its the watchmakers attempt at mating modern functionality and classic good looks. With this watch, Fossil hoped to give smartwatches the high-end-yet-mass-appeal design Fossils known for.Previous devices in the Q line, namely the Q Reveler and Q Dreamer bracelets, and the Q Grant watch were made to be jewelry first, technology second and it showed. To the untrained eye, it is nearly impossible to know that they were high tech smart wearables.PostFossils new Q Founder though, is entirely different. This device sports a full touch screen interface on its round watch face similar to that of the Moto 360. Unfortunately, it also has the Moto 360s flat tire design, instead of a fully round display.If classic watch looks were what Fossil was going for then the Q Founder does pull that off quite well. It certainly doesnt look like it was designed by a student in their first trimester or one that could be easily passed off as a generic Swatch watch.It is rather large though, coming in with a 46mm-diameter face and a 13mm-thick case which is the same as the expensive TAG Heuer Connected. Feature-wise, the smartwatch has a built in activity tracker that will help you track your steps, count calories and all the other good stuff. Its also IP67 water and dust resistant so itll at least give you some peace of mind. Fossil estimates that the device will last one day on a single charge of the devices 400 mAh battery.In terms of what actually powers the device, no information is available aside from the fact that it is likely an Intel processor due to their partnership. The device will also have 4GB of internal storage, an accelerometer and a gyroscope.Traditional watchmakers often downplay the current smartwatches developed by tech companies as more of a plaything that wouldnt stand the test of time. However, with TAG Heuers Connected and Fossils Q line, it appears that takeover has begun.Fossils Q Founder is officially on sale at their website for USD295 (around RM1,243) but unfortunately, they dont ship to Malaysia. Shipping to Singapore, however, is listed as an option on the website, albeit at a higher price of SGD665.50(around RM1,991). When we tried to place an order though, there was an alert from the product page informing us that shipping to Singapore was currently unavailable.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Theyve experimented many things from cameras, infrared blaster, heart rate sensor and even the ability to make phone calls over 3G.

The Gear S2 has a simple and modern look while the Gear S2 Classic features a ridged bezel, mimicking the looks of an timeless watch piece. To personalise the look, the Gear S2 uses its own proprietary straps which is easily replaced without tools. Howeveryoure limited to what Samsung has to offer in each respective market.

To make matters worse, LG had only offered a vague explanation as to why the device was taken off the shelves late last week.This week, LG have finally decided to open up a little more and reveals that the device was pulled because of an issue with its display.When LG initially axed the Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, the company told Android Police that there was a problem with the smartwatchs hardware and it affected day-to-day functionality of the device. Because of the complicated nature of the issue LG told Android Police that they would be cancelling the rollout of the device indefinitely. They added that future device availability would be decided at a later time as their top priority was quality assurance.Now, an LG representative told English daily The Telegraph that there was an issue with a new advanced component that had never been used in an LG wearable device before.Not wanting to point fingers or burn bridges with suppliers, LG simply said that after hours of stress testing, the advanced component failed to meet their quality standards and would have affected the smartwatchs image quality.With that out in the open, critics can safely guess that the advanced component is the watchs P-OLED display. The devicewas the first smartwatch to achieve a 480480 pixel resolution, rating the devices 1.3 screen at a stunning 490 ppi. For more information on the device, head on over here.OLED displays, though widely shipped in smartphones, is notorious for the amount of problems they come with such as image burn in and rotting pixels, something manufacturers have to work to mitigate.Since LG stated that the problem would only occur over the life of the device, Ars Technica suspects that it is due to significant image burn in or subpixel death. When pixels rot and die, the blue pixels are usually the first to go, resulting in a loss of brightness and inacurate colours, something we doubt any Watch Urbane 2 users would want.Besides its hyped screen, the LGs follow up to the Watch Urbane was also set to be the first Android Wear device to have a built-in LTE modem. Being forced to drop such a high profile device after only six days due to an oversight in quality assurance must be incredibly painful for the electronics giant, something we doubt they will ever want to repeat.Large manufacturers often have large departments whose primary task is to ensure that their products meet the companys quality standards, so it does seem a little odd that such a fundamental error was made by LG.

The first is to bolster online navigation with the app, when connectivity is spotty at best, allowing Maps to freely switch between offline and online mode ensuring that you dont lose crucial navigation information just because you entered an area with bad coverage.The second method is where users can opt to switch off connectivity completely and rely on the app to navigate with the pre-downloaded offline areas. To download an area, simply key in the location (or tap and hold apoint on the map) and swipe up on the card that appears at the bottom. Then, select download on the resulting screen, specify your desired region and tap the download button once more.Downloaded maps are stored on your device, so remember to free up some space before you decide to give this feature a spin. As an estimate, the amount of space required to download the greater area of Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur is about 300MB, whereas if you want offline navigation for Peninsular Malaysia, you will need to free up at least 1.5GB of space.Offline maps can be kept on your device for a total of 30 days. By default, stored locations will be updated via WiFi but that can be changed in the offline areas settings to allow for updates to be downloaded over a mobile network or to not be updated at all.This is definitely a bold move by Google, stepping into the world of offline navigation, but whether this move will pay off remains to be seen. Do give this feature a try the next time you need to navigate in unfamiliar territory, then let us know what you think of it in the comment section below. Does it stack up to already established offline navigation applications like Here Maps?Many thanks toNightFelixfor the tip."

Details after the break.Huawei is expected the launch the Nexus 6P in Malaysia sometime next month. If you cant stomach the imported Nexus 6P price of RM2,899, it is recommended to wait for the official units that come with local Malaysian warranty.Now it looks like we finally get a glimpse of its pricing through a slip up made on vmall.my.The folks at Amanz had spotted a Nexus 6P page which shouldnt be live at this point of time. It lists the 5.7 Nexus phablet at RM2,698 including GST and the spec sheet has indicated 64GB of on-board storage that comes in either Aluminium and Graphite colour options. At RM2,698, it is priced the same as their current premium Huawei Mate S that also comes with 64GB of storage.The page is no longer accessible but it is still viewable through Google Cache. At the moment, we cant really confirm if this is the actual price but it looks quite legit considering the Nexus 6P is priced at $499 (about RM2,127) for 32GB and $549 (about RM2,340) for 64GB in the US.To recap, the Nexus 6P has a 5.7 Quad HD display and it runs on a Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM.

Rory Lee,UE BOOM review: The singing soda can,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/24/logitech-ue-boom-review-the-singing-soda-can/,,,2015-11-24,"I never understood the need for a portable wireless speaker. Dont get me wrong, I love my unnecessary gadgets. In fact I have an entire argument laid out about how I absolutely need a tablet/laptop hybrid even though I already have a laptop. desktop and phablet. That said, I just never saw the point of the Bluetooth speaker.Ill admit, Im no audiophile. Nor was I born in the time frame where Say Anything was a thing. So the notion of carrying around an extra, rather heavy and rather expensive device just to play my music out loud something I personally detest  seemed incredibly perplexing.Now that weve established my comic-book-esque origin story, we arrive atUltimate Ears BOOM (UE BOOM). Bought over by Logitech in 2008, Ultimate Ears have been making audio equipment since 1995. Their latest device, the UE BOOM, is an RM799 Bluetooth speaker the size of a can of ping pong balls, designed to be rugged as a rock and perfect for when you need to play your music out loudfor everyone to hear. I think you can see where this is going.I thought so too when I started this review, but now, now Im not so sure."

Especially when consumers in China are so spoiled for choice when it comes to mobile electronics. Xiaomi lead the pack during the momentous day, raking in a cool RM 856 million but was that enough reason for them to release the Redmi Note 3 so early? Well they did it anyway, and for the first time it features an all-metal design, biometric security and a huge battery.
The Chinese manufacturer places high hopes on their most premium (if that word is fair) Redmi Note to date. Lets talk about how it has changed, taking over the Redmi Note 2 in the most casual way possible; the biggest change would be the utilisation of a smooth metal finish  made by sandblasting the metallic layer.Surrounding the smartphone with the element and curving at the edges. Apparently, these curves will make the device more ergonomic when held, itll also just weigh 164grams, 4g heavier than the smartphone it replaces. Even with its massive 4000 mAh battery, the Redmi Note 3 will only be 8.65mm thick. Theyve managed to do this by using a 690Wh/L high density battery, that saves space underneath frame.Something really different this time around, the Redmi Note 3 will include a rear fingerprint sensor  a feature that has never been seen on older Xiaomi devices. They promise that youll be able to get into your device in less than 0.3seconds with the touch of your fingerprint. As far as recognition goes, the Redmi Note 3 will store up to 5 fingerprints, if youd want to give other prying individuals the ability to unlock your pocket companion. Itll also give you access to make secure payments through the aforementioned sensor.Otherwise it says relatively the same  which wasnt awful to begin with. Heres a recap on those specs: A MediaTek Helio X10 processor underneath the 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen. Itll have2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory, while there will be a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear. Moving your way up front, youll be greeted by a 5-megaxpiel sensor.A power-packed package with near flagship like specs, since theyve added a 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal memory option. Oh and did we mention; itll sell from RMB 899 (RM 596) and be available in 3 colours  Silver, Dark Grey and Gold. The higher end 3GB RAM + 32GB ROM will go for RMB 1,099 ( RM 728)Going full mental (oops metal), Xiaomi has a lot going for it with its new smartphone and we expected the device to sell for at least RM 800 in Malaysia, but well only know for sure when/if it arriveshere.Do let us know your thoughts on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 in the comments below.[ SOURCE ]"

Offering the same compact 7.9 size, the new tablet gets an all metal body which is a huge leap over the plasticky predecessor.Compared to the previous version, the new Mi Pad 2 is 18% thinner at 6.95mm (Mi Pad: 8.5mm) and it is 11% lighter at 322g (Mi Pad: 360g). The Mi Pad 2 is also narrower and shorter as well, thanks to its reduced bezel design. The front 7.9 display is pretty much retained with a 20481536 resolution that pushes a pixel density of 326 ppi. This is the same resolution as the current iPad mini 4. Some of the new improvements include a Reading Mode which cuts down on harmful blue light and a button lock feature which deactivates the capacitive home, menu and back buttons when the tablet is held in landscape. While the old Mi Pad runs on Nvidias Tegra K1 chipset, the Mi Pad 2 is Xiaomis first Intel-powered device with a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 processor with 2GB of RAM. Storage wise it receives the same options of either 16GB or 64GB of storage. This time round, it appears that it lacks a microSD expansion slot, which isnt good news for those wanting to store loads of TV shows on their tablet. The cameras combination appears unchanged with a 8MP f/2.0 camera capable of shooting full HD videos at the rear while the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter. The twin speaker grilles are still placed at the back, which could have been better placed at the front or at least on the sides.Powering the tablet is a smaller 6,190mAh battery that claims to push 100 hours of music playback or 12.5 hours of video streaming. It uses the new USB Type C connector to charge and it supports a typical 5V/2A fast charging standard. In terms of connectivity, it supports Bluetooth 4.1 and high speed 802.11ac WiFi. Like the predecessor, theres no cellular 4G LTE version available. Out of the box, the Mi Pad 2 runs on MIUI 7 OS thats based on Android. The 16GB Mi Pad 2 goes for 999 CNY (about RM662) while the 64GB version is priced at 1,299 CNY (about RM861), which is pretty decently priced for the hardware and build quality it offers. If youre looking for something different, Xiaomi is also releasing a Windows 10 64GB edition as well for the same price of 1,299 CNY. It offers a full Windows experience, supporting your popular Microsoft office apps for greater productivity in a compact form factor.For more info, head over to the Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 product page."

As they often say, better late than never. This late arrival isnt unprecedented since the same smartwatch had issues launching in China but that was mainly due to Android Wearcompatibility and Google services restrictions in the country.Going for the rather traditional approach, the watch itself is a circular watch face that sports a sapphire crystal screen. Taking a second look at the device for those who arent too familiar with its specs; it carries a 1.4 inch AMOLED screen with a 400 x 400 resolution. While running the show underneath its stainless steel body is a Snapdragon 400 SoC mated to 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage.Syncing and connectivity will go through Bluetooth 4.1 and youll find the typical fitness centric sensors inside, allowing you to track your heart rate, steps and calories too. The Huawei Watch has a 42mm footprint and on the top right youll notice a 18mm lug to go along with it. Powering everything will be a 300 mAh battery and at the same time its compatible with Android and iOS devices that run at least 4.3 or iOS 8.2, respectively.Shown on Huaweis Facebook page, no other details were revealed, just stating that itll arrive real soon.

However, in terms of raw air cleaning power, the new modelappears to fall short of the previous version, but not by a lot.Probably due to its size, the second-gen purifieroutputsclean air in two modes, measuring a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) of 330 m3/h of clean air in standard mode and 388 m3/h of clean air in active mode, both of which are lower than the original Mi Air Purifiers 406 m3/h. Cleaning range is also lower at up to 46.6 m2 of cleaning range, compared to the first-gens 48 m2 of effective coverage.It can also be attributed to the devices single-motor, dual-fan setup versus its predecessors dual-motor, 4-air-duct engine. Despite that though, itboasts the ability to remove 99.7% of PM2.5 particles in just one hour, thanks to its triple filter setup.This isnt to say that this new kid on the blockis worse than its predecessor, because in every other aspect the sequelis an improvement. First off it is much smaller and lighter, measuring 240x240x520 mm versus the old air purifiers 260x260x735 mm. It is also 58% more energy efficient and 11% quieter, weighing in at only 30db in Night mode.With the price of the Mi Air Purifier 2 set at RMB699 (around RM463), itis also much cheaper than the RMB899 (around RM596) Mi Air Purifer.Isthe reduction in clean air output and coverage a trade-off youre willing to make for a lighter, smaller, cheaper, quieter and more energy efficient air purifier?

Soft drink mega-corporation Pepsi has taken its first step into the mobile industry by launching its own crowdfunding campaign on JD Finance to fund its very first smartphone, the Pepsi Phone P1.Back in October,a source in Pepsi leaked the news that the soft-drink manufacturer would be releasing their own line of mobile accessories and even their own smartphone based in China. While preliminary specs were leaked, the information train stopped there and interest in the device screeched to a halt.Now that the worlds 29th most valuable brand has pulled back the covers of its pet project, we finally get to see some cold, hard specs.The device will come sporting a 5.5 1080p display housed under 2.5D glass, with an octa-core 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6792 processor and 2GB of RAM at its heart. It only has 16GB of internal storage but thats expandable via a hybrid dual-SIM tray up to 64GB. Out of the box, the device is said to run on Android 5.1 Lollipop with dido OS 6.1 plastered on top.For imaging, the device runs a 13-megapixel (f/2.0, 1/3.06 CMOS sensor) back snapper and 5-megapixel front camera combo. Interestingly, the Phone P1 also mounts a fingerprint scanner on the back of the device, right below the camera. To bring all of these parts to life, the phone will draw power from a 3,000 mAh battery.Since its a crowdfunding project, the device will be available through several layers of perks and support. The early bird option allowed interested parties to get the phone for CNY499 (around RM335), but that was only limited to the first 1,000 supporters. You can still opt for the limited CNY699 (around RM468) option which is still a good deal. Backers can also opt to get the phone at its full price of CNY1,299 (around RM870) instead.With only two weeks remaining, the Pepsi Phone P1 is still a long, long way from being funded so there is a chance that this whole thing could just fizzle out. If it does succeed though, it would be interesting to see if Pepsis nemesis Coca-Cola would take a gander at a mobile device.Specs wise, the phone looks like a fairly ordinary midrange device, but with its metal body we suspect that people will buy this purely as a novelty item rather than to use as a daily driver. All wed like to see is for the device come in a phone sized Pepsi can instead of a boring old smartphone box.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

If youre familiar with Samsungs line of clamshell smartphones running Android, then it should come as no surprise that many thought this latest flip phone was going to be the successor to the Galaxy Golden 2.This new flip phone is no underpowered feature phone though. Sporting two 3.9 AMOLED displays pushing 1280768 pixels, an Exynos 7420chip, 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, this flip phone is essentially a Galaxy S6 in a forgotten form factor. The primary camera is no slouch either as it likely the same high end 16-megapixel rear snapper as that in Samsungs early 2015 flagship, with a 5-megapixel front camera to boot.Samsungs W2016 will run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with TouchWiz out of the box and the Korean manufacturer has also included modern elements like fast wired and wireless charging. Powering the device is a 2,000 mAh battery, which should be more than enough for the relatively small 3.9 screens to stay lit for a respectable amount of time.To many, the clamshell form factor is a thing of the past and it seems weird that Samsung would put so much into reviving it. But to some niche markets in Asia and nostalgic fans of this once glorious design, this is a welcomed move and we can see why.Aesthetically, the W2016 looks exquisite. The body is a sculpted aluminium frame that kind of emulates the Galaxy S6s design, with a curved metal back and metallic accents. The screen sits flush into the front panel and the gentle slope towards the bottom of the phone gives it a much sleeker look. It looks like the kind of sophisticated device meant for the 0.01%, and not some playboys new gadget.Availability of the device at this point seems to be limited to China, without any news on whether or not it will make it to the rest of the world. While we do not have information on the pricing of the device, we wouldnt be too surprised if it will eventually be sold elsewhere.On paper, the W2016 looks like a great way to bring the clamshell into todays standards.

Rory Lee,Hands-on with the Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/21/hands-on-with-the-lenovo-vibe-p1-and-vibe-p1m/,"5000 mAh battery,Android,big battery phone,lenovo launch malaysia,Lenovo Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1,Lenovo Vibe P1 Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1m,Lenovo Vibe P1m Malaysia,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-21,"Launched recently, the Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m are designed to last as long as you can with its enormous battery capacities of 5,000 mAh and 4,000 mAh respectively. These smartphones from Lenovo can also, in a pinch, double as powerbanks and charge your other devices via USB OTG (On-The-Go). As you can tell by the battery capacities, the Vibe P1 is designed to be the flag bearer of the Power Player line, while the Vibe P1m comes in as the runner-up.On paper that is very much the case as the Vibe P1 sports a 5.5 full-HD IPS display and a brushed aluminium frame. The devicesunibody construction gives it a premium feel with a gentle curve at the back allowing the phone to fit nicely in the hand. In front you will find the front camera at the top and two capacitive buttons at the bottom, flanking the rectangular physical home button. Underneath the clicky, well-built button lies the Vibe P1s fingerprint scanner which is a first for Lenovo.Around the back, the smartphone looks a lot like the flagships from HTCs Oneseries. The maincamera can be found at the top of the phone with the dual-LED flash right below it. The power button and volume keys are placed on the right side of the phone while the Vibe P1s dedicated power saver toggle is located on the left. To differentiate the buttons, the power saver toggle has rough texture versus the smooth power and volume buttons. Either way, all the keys have a satisfying click without much wobble.The speaker grille and micro-USB port is located at the bottom opposite the phones headphone jack at the top. The top comes off revealing a tray that holds two nano-SIM cards and a microSD slot. As a whole, the device feels good in the hand. Even with that massive battery, the weight isnt unbearable although it is rather thick and that adds to the bulk. The brushed aluminium helps the phone stay in the hand while staving off fingerprints.Much of the Vibe P1s physical features are identical on its little brother, with the exception of the micro-USB port being on the top and the absence of a physical home button and fingerprint scanner on the Vibe P1m. Around the back, the primary camera is in the same place as the Vibe P1 but there is a brushed metal finish around the lens LED flash. The front is occupied by the Vibe P1ms 5-inch 720p display, three capacitive buttons and the 5-megapixel camera at the top. The device is coated with a splash-proof nano coating.While the P1m does not have a brushed aluminium back, the textured removable rear cover feels very nice and sturdy, giving the phone even more grip. The smaller size also fits better in the hand, making up for its rather thick profile.Withinthe Vibe P1 beats the heart of an octa-core Snapdragon 615 clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and, 32GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). On the other hand, the lower endVibe P1m is powered by a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor and 2GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but it is also expandable via microSD up to 32GB.Performance is good as both devices run smoothly on Android 5.1 Lollipop with almost no stuttering or noticeable lag when launching, exiting or switching between applications. It looks like Lenovo spent some time making sure that the software and hardware for both devices were well optimised. Then again, the Vibe P1ms smooth performance can also be credited to the fact that it has less pixels to push on that smaller 720p display.Primary imaging on the Vibe P1 is taken care of by its 13-megapixel PDAF rear shooter while selfies can be delegated to the 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera. Our limited timewith the Vibe P1s camera reveals that it is snappy to launch and take pictures, but the venues poor lighting made it difficult to give a solid verdict on the cameras performance. The same can also be said for the Vibe P1ms 8-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo.Sitting under the back plate, powering all those hardware bits,lies the devices defining feature: their massive batteries. The Vibe P1 sports a 5,000 mAh battery that Lenovo claims gives the device 30 days of standby time and 45 hours of talk time. The phone also comes with Quick Charge 2.0 for when it eventually runs out of juice. Lenovo said that it would take 2 hours to charge up the P1 from empty using the devices bundled charger.The Vibe P1m features a smaller, but still massive by conventional standards, 4,000 mAh battery. Besides the massive batteries, Lenovo took power saving to the next level with their included power saver toggle, available on both devices.With the power saver toggle flicked on, the phone enters power saver mode where the usual home screen is replaced by a simple black and white interface, showing you the clock, the battery level, a choice of six apps and how much time you have left before the phone runs out of juice. Very Jack Bauer. The six apps can be set by the user but by default three of the app slots are taken up by phone, contacts, and messaging.The Lenovo Vibe P1 which retails for RM1,199, will come in Platinum and Graphite Grey colour options. This device will be available in authorised retail stores and online at Lazada starting 19 November. On the other hand, the Vibe P1m, costing RM649, will sold exclusively at Lazada from19 November onwards, only hitting the shelves at authorised local retail outlets in December. As a bonus though, if you do choose to purchase the Vibe P1m from Lazada, theyre currently offering an RM50 discount and are throwing in a Lenovo Limited Edition Jersey and an 8GB SanDisk microSD card for free.Lenovo Vibe P1Lenovo Vibe P1m"

Word had gotten out of TENAA that a smartphone had passed its certification; after which details of the Mi Pad 2 were spotted on Geekbench.Then on it got a whole lot for confusing, as invitations of the event went out and Xiaomis President leaked photos of the two devices. Were going to try and make it easier for everyone to understand, at the same time giving out two cents on the whole situation.Metal isnt one of the materials youd usually find on a Xiaomi product, except for their higher-end range flagships  though the Mi Note and Mi 4 only explore using the element in minimal amounts, seen around the edges. The brand however, hasnt started even considering finger print sensors on their flagships, hence the peculiarity of placing the aforementioned feature on the Redmi Note 2 Pro.Itll be a totally new take, for the Redmi name if they decide to pursue the two features. Otherwise, itll havethe same internals as its predecessorunderneath. Moving to the other device thats slated to launch, the Mi Pad 2; a device that didnt confuse us as much as the former. Details on Geekbench made this short and sweet, stating what processoritll carry; an Intel Atom processor clocked to 2.24GHz and other accompanying specs.Speculators being speculators, word went about that Xiaomi might release their anticipated Mi 5, but so far, nothing seems to corroborate this. Shared by company President, Lin Bin, an invitation for tomorrows event went out with the headline The Best is Yet to Come; making this all the more confusing.Xiaomis President didnt stop there either, shortly after a few days, he decided to release photos of the smartphone and tablet. Leading us to finally cave in and actually believe that the company will release a follow up to the Redmi Note 2 before the same fiscal quarter comes to a close.Since then, more images go to contradict the existence of the Redmi Note 2 Pro, mentioning that itll instead be dubbed the Redmi Note 3. So far we know that itll be thin, light, have a fingerprint sensor and metal body. It isnt farfetched to assume that Xiaomi wants to appeal to the higher-end market but adding two features on a non-flagship could either be a weird strategy or an opening of doors to more premium products in the future from the Chinese tech giant; yes, the Mi 5 too.Interestingly,new (rumoured) details have highlighted that the Redmi Note 3 will have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Itll also supposedly be available with a 4000 mAh battery, making a huge jump from the existing device that only has a 3060 mAh battery.Maybe this long-shot might work for Xiaomi but were sure Redmi Note 2 customers wont be too happy with this new information. Well wait for tomorrow to see what actually happens, who knows they might pull a by the way move and surprise everyone with more than two devices.[ SOURCE, 2,VIA ]"

Now, it seems thatGoogles premium Nexus phone has encountered a new problem: spotty voice quality.Several threads on the Google Product Forum and XDA-Developers have spawned with users complaining that people on the other end of their phone conversations couldnt hear them very well. The problem appears to extend to the speakerphone as well.Based on unofficial experimentation by Nexus 6P users, it appears to be a problem with the phones noise cancellation setup. Some users say that covering the rear microphone solves this issue while others discovered that this actually causes the problem.For those who are unaware, most new smartphones use multiple microphones to supplement the main microphone to filter out surrounding noise, like wind, to improve the vocal clarity of phone calls. The root of the problem does seem to be related to this setup on the Nexus 6P as one of the users who posted on the Google forum indicated that a root-level build.prop modification solved the issue for him.On the plus side, Google representatives have responded to the posts on the official forum, letting users know that they are looking into it though as of this moment there is no official statement on the cause of these problems.Lets hope that Google can fix this issue with a software update and not have to resort to recalling users shiny new Nexus 6P devices.[SOURCE, 2,VIA, 2]"

Highlighted in our older articles, it didnt seem to make sense to deploy something totally new to the brand, on a smartphone that could easily be mistaken to be a mid-range device  guess we were wrong, since Lin Bin, the President of the Chinese manufacturer teased two of their upcoming releases, that includethe Redmi Note 2 Pro and the Mi Pad 2 on his Weibo social media account.Making rounds earlier on, being shown passing TENAAs certification process, the Redmi Note 2 Pro is a really an odd device. We say so because it seems to include a finger-print sensor and metal-backed built  never seen before on any Xiaomi device. Plastering the aforementioned circular sensor on the back, underneath the LED module for the rear camera, they seem to have adopted the stylings of other Chinese smartphone makers.Since its the Pro version of the Redmi Note 2, it wont have any other distinctive qualities, aside from mentioned above. Having said, itll carry a 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) resolution screen and underneath its glass panel youll likely find an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 clocked to 2GHz. Chances are youll find 2GB of RAM inside but rumours have discussed the possibilities of a 3GB RAM option as well; while itll have 16GB of native memory on board too.As far as camera optics goes, the same 13-megapixel rear shooter and 5-megapixel front sensor combo will apparently return. Powering the Redmi Note 2 Pro will be a 3060 mAh battery and itll run a backdated version of Android, likely 5.0.2 under its MIUI 7 skin.The bigger device revealed by Lin Bin was the Mi Pad 2 and by the looks of it, itll be really thin and have an uncanny resemblance to Apples iPads. Without giving away too much, the tablet looks to be fashioned entirely out of metal and feature a very sleek silhouette. Its thought to carry a quad-core Intel chipset clocked to 2.24GHz.Interestingly, you wont have to wait much longer since these two devices are slated to make an appearance during a Xiaomi event in China on the 24th of November. Still rolling on the excitement of getting our hands on the Redmi Note 2 domestically, were hoping that the smartphone maker will release the much-anticipated Mi 5 as well.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

Doubling up on functionality as a regular watch and now enabling you to use it as a clock will be much appreciated for those who purchased the smartwatch that starts from SG$ 518 (RM 1,590).Resembling a hockey puck, just a little flatter and tapered at the edges, techcrunch assumes that the dock is fashioned out of plastic, while the usual circular magnetic unit sits inside. Charging can be done in two orientations, the Nightstand mode, which allows the wearable to sit upright and the flat mode, setting your Apple Watch onto the coaster.While other after-market options still utilise the charging puck that comes with Apple Watch, the Magnetic Charging Dock has its very own puck built-in. So at least for the price, the dock, onlyneeds a lightning cable plugged into the back to power up.Apple hasnt trailed away from their own proprietary cables and ports, but Microsoft has jumped on the same bandwagon, so the blame should be equally shared. Ridding consumers the convenience of universal plugs and ports, itll be harder to find a supported cable while at home or work (other than the one you already have).If you have an Apple Watch, or are thinking of purchasing one, youll have to get it in Singapore, the nearest option for Malaysians. Permitted that youre willing to make the trip, you can purchase it here.

Rumours that have been floating around recently indicates that theGalaxy S7 couldhave a 12-megapixel camera with a large 1/2-inch sensor.About a week ago, a trademark application from Samsung was spotted for BRITECELL, which then sparked another set of rumours about the Galaxy S7s camera. Well, Samsung has finally revealed the BRITECELL camera technology, though they did not provide any confirmation on whether or not it would be the one in the Galaxy S7.Revealed by Samsung LSI marketing head Kyushik Hong, BRITECELL promises enhanced light sensitivity in low-light conditions with less colour artifact. BRITECELL was not the rumoured Galaxy S7 1/2-inch sensor with large pixels though as it actually has smaller one micron pixels. Samsung says that these smaller pixels will help reduce the module height by 17% while maintaining low-light sensitivity at 1.12m.The sensor also utilises Samsungs Smart WDR technology which will help provide a more detailed image by using multi-exposure for better spatial resolution and Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF) for faster, more accurate photos.Although the electronics giant did not confirm whether this BRITECELL technology would be used in their smartphones, if they do, the Galaxy S7 could very well be the first one to receive it. With the BRITECELLs focus on improving low-light performance, the next-generation Samsung phones could be significantly better than its predecessors. To get a gauge of what one of Samsungs current phones camera can do, have a look at the smartphone camera comparison we did back in October.[SOURCE]"

Arif Lee,Maxis talks about what makes its 4G network great,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/19/maxis-talks-about-what-makes-its-4g-network-great/,,,2015-11-19,"Population coverage for 4G LTE has been a hotly debated topic of recent times; at least for two telcos  Digi and Maxis. This overdrawn rally between the two has managed to do one thing, get both their customers rattled up. Were seeing more negative comments from our readers of late, regarding their own experiences on the two networks. When push comes to shove, what we need are clear outlines on how each cellular provider measures themselves, and this is essentially what Maxis talked about earlier today.The parameters set by our telcos determine if theyve set the bar(s) (figuratively) for their network, high enough to be considered acceptable by consumers. Quoting Maxis reps, 4G LTE is currently growing at an alarming rate and to keep up with that upward trend is a tough task but the green telco believes that the standards it has set is more than adequate enough to live up to their claims.Mentioning briefly that their 4G LTE population coverage is at 62%, placed in 144 locations including state capitals and secondary towns. If you kept track of the current developments, that betters Digis numbers by 2%; though there have different levels of signal strength, one being more stringent in their definitions of measurement.Backed by a desire to provide the most consistent experience across 2G, 3G, 4G and beyond, theyve established standards that maintain their reputation and position as the best telco to provide a high performing internet experience. If youre new to the whole debate and the jargon that goes along with it, feel free to read the following:How do telcos do about measuring this reading? Well they head to the very edges and see what they can maintain within an area before dropping to a lower speed aka 4G LTE to 3G. So now that weve got that out of the way, Maxis has issued (earlier on) that they measure their signal strength at -98dBm, which on scale, is better than Digis -110dBm base of measurement. The former goes on to add that if they followed Digis standards, it would easily hit 70% of population coverage."

These devices are designed for the busy user who needs a phone that wont run out of juice before they do.The Vibe P1 is the higher end of the duoandwill come with a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display, powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor and 2GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 32GB but thats expandable up to 128GB with a microSD card. The phone also has dual-SIM capabilities and supports 4G LTE.Beneath the Vibe P1s aluminium body lies its party piece, the enormous 5,000 mAh battery with quick charge support. Security is also beefed up with a fingerprint scanner located underneath the physical home button. Camera wise, the Vibe P1 sports a 13-megapixel rear shooter with PDAF and a dual-LED flash alongside a 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera that is enhanced with a host of beauty features.On the other hand, the lower end Vibe P1m will instead be packaged with a 5-inch 720p HD display with a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage running under the hood. The P1m also supports expandable memory in the form of a microSD card up to 32GB.As a little cherry on top, the Vibe P1m will also get a splash-proof nano coating that will protect itself from accidental spills.In the optics department, the Vibe P1m gets a watered down 8-megapixel back + 5-megapixel front camera combo.

Xiaomi will be selling off 500 of them for just US$ 31, as they usually do for domestic launches; this is due to offsetting cost of the door gift that every ticket holder will receive.Translating the message, it says The Best is Yet to Come, so it doesnt entirely give away a lot to begin with.

The Mate 8 apparently carries the Kirin 950 SoC, which could pose a threat to Samsung and Qualcomms top performing chips.Embracing the need for higher processing needs, the 950 Kirin processor will boast some highly clocked ARM Cortex cores; the four A72s will run at 2.3GHz, while the more efficient A53 cores are listed at 1.8GHz. This is based on the big.LITTLE system, that allows an optimised Octa-Core set up, balancing between raw power and power consumption.Along with the aforementioned CPU, itll have a Mali-T880MP4 GPU to help out the graphics department. Rumours state that we should expect two models of the smartphone, taking note of two screen resolutions  1920 x 1080 (FHD) and 2560 x 1440 (QHD) on the same 6-inch screen.Other sources speculate there will be differing internals on differing models. As such, one will supposedly offer 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage  youd be expected to purchase this device for roughly US$ 517 (RM 2,266).

The high spec Vibe X3 will come with a 5.5-inch 10801920 pixel display tucked behind the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3.It sports a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 processor clocked at 1.5GHz coupled with 3GB of RAM and a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The Vibe X3 also features a big 3,600 mAh battery, which is bigger than the 3,500 mAh that we originally thought. Camera wise, the Vibe X3 features a 21-megapixel Sony rear shooter paired with an 8-megapixel selfie cam.The Vibe X3 Youth, while maintaining the 5.5-inch screen, has considerably watered down specs in a bid to lower cost, featuring an octa-core 1.3GHz MediaTek processor, 2GB of RAM and only 16GB of internal storage. The camera optics have also taken a hit as the Vibe X3 Youth only has a 13-megapixel rear shooter and a 5-megapixel front camera. It also has a smaller battery, rated at 3,400 mAh.Both phones however do share Lenovos much teased audio system, which features not only two front-facing stereo speakers, but also Hi-fi 3.0 with a total of three Texas Instruments OPA1612 amplifiers, a Cirrus Logic WM8281 codec for noise and echo cancellation to handle the input from the three mics, and a high-end Sabre 9018C2M DAC.Other similarities include a hybrid dual-SIM slot, where users can opt to run two SIM cards or a single SIM card with a microSD card. Both phones also have a fingerprint scanner on rear panel just below the camera, and will support 4G LTE connectivity.Prices start at CNY 1,899 (around RM1,303) for the Vibe X3 Youth, CNY 2,499 (around RM1,714) and CNY 2,999 (around RM2,057) for the 32GB and 64GB variants respectively.

Weve addressed the prospect of the two chipset option returning before here, so this further improves the chances of happening.Seen in a leaked list provided, these were the models along with their corresponding cellular carriers (US telcos):Notably, youll be able to spot that the Qualcomm processor is destined for only CDMA networks and carriers, while the Exynos 8890 will make an appearance for GSM and internationally unlocked models (Malaysia included, probably).A reminder to all, given the unofficial mannerism of these leaks, dont take everything as face value. If Samsung follows their numbering system seen on older models, and this list tallies, well then it could hold water.

Retailing at RM1,499 (inclusive of GST), the premium unibody mid-ranger smart phone is offered with its Zerolution program from as low as RM48/month over 24 months period.To recap, Zerolution is an easy device ownership program that lets you upgrade to a new phone after 12 months hassle free. However in terms of the actual postpaid plans, you would need to sign up with their MaxisONE Plan that starts from RM98/month.If you wish to keep the device, all youll need to pay is RM48 monthly for 24 months for the device, on top of your monthly subscription. To have the freedom to swap phones after 12 months, you can go for the Zerolution upgrade option at RM44/month extra, which is surprisingly higher than the usual RM30/month upgrade fee quoted for its previous offering. To upgrade without any further cost, the older device must be returned in pristine order and it is recommended to take up their device protection offering at RM15/month. This covers various damages including screen cracks, water damage and theft. The Huawei G8 is a 5.5 Android device with a Full HD screen and it runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board it has 32GB of storage which is expandable via microSD.

Cmon, the movies have told us at least that much.True enough, Apple came up with their revolutionary 3D Touch technology that they claimed required countless hours of research to produce, but ended up being not much more than a gimmick, at least for now with the low amount of apps that actually make use of it. Well, if you want something more revolutionary, the boffins at Qeexo might just have what you need.Carnegie Mellon spin-off Qeexo have come up with a new algorithm that allows smartphones to recognise the angular position of a finger, and are hoping to change the way we interact with our devices.Dubbed the FingerAngle, this algorithm attempts to improve movements and interactions with a touch screen  like pinching or rotating  which require an extra finger to carry out properly. While on most modern smartphones, requiring an extra finger may not seem like that much of an inconvenience as screen real estate is ample. But when you need to perform those same actions on smaller screened devices like wearables, it becomes a little more tricky.FingerAngle though, changes this as it allows those devices to determine if you are rotating your finger, if your finger is tiltedupwards, downwards or even swiveled side to side. This software estimates a fingers 3D angle relative to a screens surface by measuring the fingers pitch and yaw.This then opens up a whole new avenue of possibility for interacting with your device beyond just making it easier for wearables. One prominent possibility is in mobile gaming controls, where currently we have to use on-screen controls or rely on a devices accelerometer. With FingerAngle, the control possibilities have now completely opened up.FingerAngles promotional video clearly shows that there are some kinks to work out, the latency for example, but as this isnt the final product yet, things are certainly looking good.Of course, this technology is still new and there is no definite timeline to when this software willgo live. But as this is purely software, who knows, a manufacturer might pick it up and it could come sooner than you think.[SOURCE]"

The exterior continues the One M9s beautiful premium all-metal unibody and design scheme. The One M9s also keeps HTCs excellent BoomSound front facing speakers, something that will certainly delight those who like to consume media on their smartphones.The phone measures 144.6 x 69.7 x 9.6mm and weighs a touch more than the original One M9 at 158g versus the base models 157g.On the inside, HTC swapped out the problematic Snapdragon 810, for an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 chip, but RAM and internal storage were bumped down to 2GB of RAM and only a tiny 16GB of internal storage. Fortunately, the One M9s will have the option to expand its storage up to 2TB via a microSD card. The device is reported to come running Android 5.0 Lollipop with HTCs Sense on top.The rear camera has been downgraded in terms of megapixels though, dropping from a 20-megapixel affair to a 13-megapixel one.

Unfortunately, no word on worldwide availability has been given. Although the HTC One M9 was not officially launched in Malaysia, you can get an imported one from DirectD for RM2,699.As a whole, the One M9s seems to be a light version of its older One M9 brother, with less RAM and internal storage, but, on paper at least, the camera should be better than the One M9 despite the drop in megapixels, because it comes with OIS.Is that a trade-off you are willing to make?

It is also said to feature an improved FaceTimeHD camera, Bluetooth 4.1, and Wi-Fi 802.11ac.This new information was gleaned from Japanese blog Mac Otakara, which has a good track record when it comes to all things Apple. The blog alleges that the new iPhone is apparently already in production and is set to launch in the first half of 2016, which contradicts earlier rumours placing it in the second half, so take it with a grain of salt.This phone looks to be a significant upgrade to the previous iPhone bearing the c badge, the iPhone 5c. No information on the iPhone 6cs build was found, but if it will continue the trend set by the iPhone 5c, then the body will likely be made out of plastic with an array of colourful options.Earlier, alleged photos of the iPhone 5c were leaked, showing a plastic build and an oval camera LED flash thats likely a dual-tone colour unit.It wouldnt be too surprising if Apple decides to continue the c badge as sales for the iPhone 5c were actually higher than expected.

OnePlus have announced that they will be updating all three of their devices to Android 6.0 Marshmallow, although no specific dates were promised.OnePlus announced in an official post on their forum that they would be rolling out Android Marshmallow updates to the OnePlus One in the first quarter of 2016. Or more specifically, Cyanogen OS will be updating the One as OnePlus would not be rolling out OxygenOS Marshmallow updates for their first phone because it isnt what the product officially ships with.However, they did mention that they would update the community build of OxygenOS for the One when time allows.The OnePlus 2 will also receive its Marshmallow update in Q1 of 2016 and will include the new standard Marshmallow API for the fingerprint sensor. OnePlus have decided against creating their own API despite feedback from its users as they were planning to switch over to the standard Android M implementation soon.No estimated time frame was given on when the Marshmallow updates would reach the OnePlus X though, but the Chinese smartphone manufacturer said that they would provide an update on a time frame at a later date. OnePlus also said that they would continue rolling out OxygenOS updates in the meantime.The OnePlus One is currently running on CyanogenMod 12.1 while the OnePlus 2 and X just received OxygenOS 2.1.2 via an OTA update[SOURCE, VIA]"

To add to their woes, their USB Type-C cables are now coming under fire for not being spec compliant.Who, you might ask, is attacking OnePlus? Well, some call him the Caped Cable Crusader, others call him the USB Vigilante, but his almost 7,000 followers on Google+ should know him better as Benson Leung.Google employee by day, Amazon cable critic by night, Benson cautioned users who purchased the OnePlus USB Type-C cable against using it with their Chromebook Pixel or the new Nexus devices. This was because Benson found that OnePlus cable used a 3A identifier resistor instead of the Default USB Power resistor, and as a result could cause damage to those devices.He also found that OnePlus USB Type-C adapter was also using the wrong identifier resistor, raising concern regarding the actual quality of OnePlus accessories.Benson wasnt deliberately picking on OnePlus though as he had already launched a campaign to test USB Type-C cables off Amazon to see if they met the minimum standards or if they were merely rip-offs.His process consisted of ordering USB Type-C cables from various manufacturers on the site and then testing them, subsequently posting reviews on their respective product pages on Amazon. While some did not follow the Release 1.1 USB Type-C specifications, the more common problem it seemed was that many of the cables were using incorrect resistors.While many of the problematic cables were from third party manufacturers, OnePlus failure was certainly not expected since their motto was to Never Settle. Perhaps they were trying to create cables that only rewarded the faithful. In any case, OnePlus owners dont have to worry as long as they dont stick their cables into a device that doesnt bear the OnePlus logo.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Camera, LED flash, and speaker grille position on the Galaxy A5 looks to be unchanged from previous leaked photos.Under the bonnet, the Galaxy A5 sports Samsungs octa-core Exynos 7 processor clocked at 1.6GHz paired with an ARM Mali-T720 GPU, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of internal storage running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Camera specs are slightly less clear though with some sources indicating that it could be a 12-megapixel back/4.7-megapixel front affair, while others put it at the usual 13-megapixel front/5-megapixel back combo. It is believed that the Galaxy A5 will also come with a 5.2-inch full HD display.Finally, moving to theGalaxy A7, it seems to just be a blown up version of the Galaxy A5 with a 5.5-inch display and the same metal frame, glass panels, camera, LED flash, and speaker grille placement.

Arif Lee,Digi reclaims its widest 4G LTE population coverage title but when it comes to speed,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/16/digi-reclaims-its-widest-4g-lte-coverage-population-but-when-it-comes-to-speed/,"4G LTE,4G LTE coverage,4G LTE coverage map,4G LTE speed,coverage map,DiGi,LTE-A,Malaysia,Maxis,network,population coverage,speeds,telco,telecommunications,VoLTE,VoWiFi,widest,widest 4G LTE,widest 4G lte coverage,widest 4G LTE network,widest 4G LTE population coverage Malaysia,Widest network","DiGi,Industry in General,LTE,Players on the Field,Technologies",2015-11-16,"Expanding as a telco is what you should be doing year around, thus Digi has managed to up its game by hitting more than half of nationwide population for its 4G LTE network  on paper this translates to 80 major cities and secondary towns at 60% of nationwide population coverage. Though their definition of what 4G LTE speeds are, could baffle many.Beginning the discussion of the whos the widest 4G LTE provider in October, they had earlier listed the 4G LTE coverage to be 50%; but is a 10% jump a realistic in such a short span? (were asking the same question) Anyway, by Digis valuation, their 4G LTE network will deliver more than 5Mbps 80% of the time  petty by industry LTE standards.Theyve also ramped up the number of network sites in Malaysia, adding 52 additional cell towers in the process. Furthermore, the telco provider mentions that of their 2 specified signal spectrums  1,800Mhz and 2,600Mhz, there is now a 30% overlap. Simply going to say that a highly dense area wont suffer asthese dual-band offerings will come into play.Clearing up some technicalities, the network provider has verified that they measure their claimed signal strength minimumat -110dBm for 4G LTE; -60dBm is said to be the best (so higher the number is better). In comparison, Maxis uses a -98dBm gauge for their minimum signal strength.In these zones, Kesavan Sivabalan, Digis Chief Network Office says you will have an uninterrupted 4G LTE experience on their network, for 99.99% of the time.Furthering the conversation, the company has announced LTE-Advanced, leveling at more than 10Mbps 80% of the time; theyve managed to hit a 22% population coverage so far with this new technology. Again these speedsdont meet up to standards of the world, as that speed should be easilyachievable on a 3G network. Remember that by definition, 4G LTE (alone) is supposed to reach 100Mbps for downloads, while on the move. Digi and other local telcos have a lot to do before being able to talk about 4G LTE as a whole, if they want to be taken seriously.Using their time wisely, Digi has added that theyve begun plans to roll-out VoWiFi in 2016, adding on to their earlier announcement about beginning VoLTE next year, as well. Tying it all together, the telco has begun a campaign on Twitter for their users to voice where they want new 4G LTE towers; once it wraps up within a month, the top 10 locations will get a cell tower put up  nope, they arent kidding.Its sad to see the yellow coloured network provider list such low levels for 4G LTE (same goes for their supposed LTE-A). Taking a look at Maxis, who promise that their 4G LTE speeds exceed 15Mbps, at all hours, both indoor and outdoor. It isnt even a competition,when the latterdoesnt maintain this either but they can manage 5Mbps easily. Of course, the tell of the tale today is about coverage but how we see it is a company just plucking numbers from the air, actions that only earn them bragging rights  without third party verification.Wed like to hear all your thoughts on the subject, as weve addressed earlier all this coverage talk should hold no value for customers who suffer coverage outages, even in the Klang Valley. Please wake up telcos, your customers are sick of all this. Coverage should be a right, it should be based in all towns, there shouldnt be a online contest that dictates whether you get a consistent customer experience."

But these issues usually come along with newly released products anyway  still, should you be worried?The affected users complained that the iPad Pro refuses to boot up after leaving them to charge. After resolving the issue with the force reset method, the battery levels were listed at 100%. More comments pour in sharing the same sentiments but at least Apple is aware of the issue, or at least their Support Communities site is.Their response isnt much help though, as they suggest to perform a simple factory reset, wiping your device on iTunes. While the other was to try the aforementioned force reset by holding the sleep/wake and home buttons in tandem, till you see the device force resetting.This issue isnt distinctive to the iPad Pro, as other users are reporting this same problem with other iDevices  iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Could this be a batch issue? Well we hope it can be mediated just by a software update, with iOS 9 being relatively new with on going fixes being released every now and then.Keep in mind that this could be isolated incidents and user error could be involved.  Since Apple hasnt issued an official statement on the matter, were just gonna consider these reportsto be rare cases.Head honcho, Tim Cook has already dismissed the prospect of Apple venturing into convergence devices, so maybe for the time being, the iPad Pro will be the only tablet-like pursuit in for the foreseeable future. Will the Surface series from Microsoft continue in gaining new market shares as Apple falls behind in the tablet segment? You tell us.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA ]"

Rory Lee,TM attempts to clear the air regarding the printed bill surcharge,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/16/tm-attempts-to-clear-the-air-regarding-the-printed-bill-surcharge/,"Berita Harian,billing,bills,streamyx,TM,TM Bill,TM e-Bill,TM e-Billing,TM Streamyx,TM Unifi,Unifi","Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-11-16,"Everyone hates ninja charges. So imagine the public outcry on November 2 when local daily Berita Harian published an expos on how Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TM) was going to incur a surcharge of RM5 to each customer who chooses to receive their monthly bills through the post instead of through TMs e-billing, come January 2016.The first stage of complaints were about how this was incredibly unfair to those who were subscribed to TMs telephone services but not their broadband services. Concerns were also raised about those in rural areas who had little or no access to the Internet being forced to pay an extra RM5 just to receive their bill. The elderly who were not tech-savvy enough were also painted as victims in this apparent scheme by TM.The second stage addressed the actual charge incurred by TM as well as the lack of communication of this plan from TM to their customers. RM5 for a piece of paper to be sent by post seems a little too much even if you take everything into consideration. This places a big burden on low income households as well, as RM5 a month amounts to RM60 a year in surcharges that have to be paid to TM. Many called this blatant profiteering on the part of TM, something that only TM could have the audacity to do because of their monopoly over the market.Upon realising that this could escalate into aPR disaster, TM published a notice of clarification on their website, attempting to give the people an explanation on their situation. In the notice, TM cleared up many of the points touched on above including the actual charge that would be incurred on those who chose to receive their bill by snail mail.According to TM, this was an initiative by the company to move towards a greener and more environmentally friendly billing system where the primary method of billing would be through their e-billing; which could be accessed from their website. TM clarified that the charges would only apply to those who were subscribed to TMs broadband services, that is, Streamyx and UniFi. Those who were only subscribed to the telephone service would not be affected and will continue to receive their bill every month, free of charge.However, TM said that they do encourage their customers who were not subscribed to TMs broadband services to make the digital switch, a choice they claim has been adopted by over 180,000 TM phone customers already.On the other hand, those who were subscribed to the aforementioned broadband services but would prefer to have a physical copy of their bill, along with the e-Bill, could sign-up either by sending an email to help@tm.com.my, visiting their nearest TMpoint, or calling them at 100. Upon signing up, the telecommunications service provider would incur a surcharge of RM2, not the purported RM5.TM also added that they have begun communicating to their customers since August 2015 through their printed TM bills and have been calling their broadband customers, reminding them to update their preferred email address and telephone number via the abovementioned channels.With the TM e-Bill, customers would be notified of their monthly bill via email within 4 days and by SMS alert within 7 days after their respective bill dates.[SOURCE, 2, 3]"

Now though, rumour has it that LG have finally decided to go with the flow and follow other major manufacturers with ametal unibody for their upcoming LG G5, and we all know what a metal unibody probably means: no removable battery.While initially seeming adamant to stay away from metal bodies, LG finally caved with the LG V10, which features a DuraGuard stainless steel frame, designed to better protect the phones internals on impact. It seems that the success of its competitors and the demand for premium metal builds was too tempting to give up and so recent rumours suggest that we could see a premium feeling metal LG G5 coming next year.However, switching over to a metal unibody would probably mean that LG are ditching the removable back and battery that have been present in most of their recent smartphones, including the LG G3, G4, and even the extra-premium LG V10. Many of the big players in the smartphone industry have moved away from phones with removable backs and removable batteries, leaving LG as the only relatively well-known smartphone manufacturer to have this feature.Ditching one of their, frankly key, features could cause users who prioritise this feature to now have to look elsewhere, which is something LG would ratheravoid, considering their already smallmarket share.Rumours also indicate that we could see it as early as Q1 of 2016, around the same time as Samsungs Galaxy S7. Reports suggest that availability of the G5 should come not long after its announcement.Since were on the topic of rumours, the G5 was also rumoured to feature a brand new 20-megapixel Sony camera sensor designed specifically for LG, touting a half inch diagonal sensor. It is also rumoured to come powered by Qualcomms latest and greatest processor, likely the Snapdragon 820.Although the G5s build material is based off of one report and at this point could still be up in the air, it doesnt seem too implausible or unreasonable considering the success of other smartphone giants and their premium flagships.[SOURCE,VIA, 2]"

On to more pressing matters, a Xiaomi device dubbed Gemini logged some stats on Geekbench  this time it isnt a mid-range device, because it packs a Snapdragon 820 processor, under the hood.Images of a metalbacked device had made rounds earlier in the October, it was reported to be a higher-end Redmi Note 2 Pro but we think it might be the Mi 5 in disguise after all. Leading many to predict that this will be Xiaomis first attempt at such a high-end device; in terms of the metal design and beastly specs. Weve seen Chinese manufacturers, Huawei, take it a step further recently, so maybe Xiaomi is ready to join the party.Were not implying that the Mi 4, Mi 4c and Mi Note arent worthy but this is really a step in the right direction for the Beijing based corporation. Posted with the MSM8996 model number (aka the Snapdragon 820), this Gemini will also take advantage of the Adreno 530 GPU on the same processor board.Giving you a brief introduction of the Snapdragon 820 chipsets credentials; Qualcomm promises that itll draw 30% less power than the 820, while graphics will get a 40% bump up, thanks to the Adreno 530 GPU. You can read on about the latest Qualcomm processor here.Nailing the benchmarks with a single-core score of 2140 and multi-core score of 4762, how does it compare to the rest? Looking at single-core performance, the head of the pack is the iPhone 6s Plus with a 2,500 mark. While for the multi-core the Galaxy S6 sits high with a 5,000 score.Some have dutifully pointed out that the clocked speeds are under-clocked, only at 1.6GHz so the full potential of the device is still in the wind. This is also just a prototype, not a working model, so were sure itll perform better once its official revealed. Another user TyrionLannister, mentions that Geekbench always prints the lower clock speed. Even the 7420 posts 1.5GHz while the big cores are 2.1GHz.Good scores or bad scores, at least this listing shows that Xiaomi is working on a smartphone with the Snapdragon 820 inside. Theyre no longer relying on lesser worthy chips and skipping the Snapdragon 810 all-together could finally pay off for them.We assure everyone that once more information comes to light, well keep you posted, as were just as excited as you guys to hear this news.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

In the face of this security breach, many tech organisations used their own means to help out by offering their services. The people behind AirBnB, Facebook, Google, Skype, Twitter all jumped into disaster relief mode. Can they along with other organisations continue in the light of similar tragic events around the world? We hope they do.Stemming from Twitters Porte Ouverte hashtag, that loosely translates to Open Door, Parisians used it to offer a temporary safe house, while those in public spaces could also look for those places and stay up to date on the happenings around the city.Facebook launched their Safety Check function, allowing those in the city a way to notifytheir loved ones that they were safe, albeit not doing so for other recent disasters that happened in other parts of the world. Users accused the social media site of being desensitised to the daily onslaught in the Middle East (e.g. Ankara and Beirut bombings); as such, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded by saying Facebook will enable this feature across the globe for future.This pivot in the industry could see more tech companies come to the aid of those affected, as their reach is truly global, and are limited only to the gadgets people carry around. Providing shelter, updates on loved ones and means of communication all for the human kind was a kind gesture that should be replicated given the circumstances.Consequently, the more connected the world becomes, the higher likeliness it will bring about an impending threat of terror organisations that camouflage themselves in the same social media networks as regular citizens  as Belgian minister Jan Jambon highlighted; ISIS agents have been driven to utilise the Play Station 4 network to communicate.Following the tragedy, how will nations react? Technology will be an actor regardless of what they do  meaning that states could possibly adopt new bills and acts that cover surveillance of its citizens.We at SoyaCincau offer our condolences to whoever lost their loved ones during this act of mindless violence and our hearts go out to anyone affected by this tragedy.[ SOURCE, 2, 3, IMAGE SOURCE]"

Even children have switched ambitions from wanting to be chefs or doctors to becoming famous YouTubers. Yes, apparently its a noun now.Well, if your ambition was to be Malaysias very own PewDiePie or follow in the footsteps of the boys at Wong Fu Productions, theres good news. The Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC) has roped in international search engine and verb, Google, to empower local content creators on the web.Made for YouTube is a programme that has been running for the past year designed to nurture and highlight Malaysian YouTube content creators. Over 20 participants handpicked from from a pool of MSC Malaysia status companies and local YouTubers by Google and MDeC, with the main criteria being that they have to possess their own original Intellectual Property (IP). The participants were then groomed and provided with coaching sessions, funding development, growth and strategic advice, dedicated manpower via direct contact with the YouTube Account Manager, and production facilities such as the Malaysia Animation Creative Content Centre (MAC3).If managed and executed properly, this could be an enormous opportunity for local content creators to tap into YouTubes considerable user base and share their content with a global audience. The video-sharing websites growth cant be denied in Malaysia as it sees an annual Malaysian watch-time growth of 60%, the bulk of which come from users mobile devices.With a market growth of this size, many locals have of course jumped on the YouTubing bandwagon where the number of videos uploaded to YouTube by Malaysians are increasing by 40% each year. Unfortunately, despite the creative content industrys estimated value to be worth RM7 billion, only 15% of content is local.Over a billion people visit YouTube every month, globally, for news, information and of course entertainment, said Google Malaysia, Vietnam Philippines and New Emerging Markets managing director Sajith Sivanandan.That is a huge audience waiting to be tapped into and we hope that Malaysian content creators will be in the thick of it.Consumer friendly platforms like YouTube as well as an entire open web are places where Malaysians can and should fully explore their creative expression and perhaps  and this is very critical to us  even turn their passions into businesses, he added.Addressing concerns that there are very few successful content creators in Malaysia despite this programmes efforts, Sivanandan said that this was simply not the case. He reasons that YouTube is incredibly targeted and so conventional means of popularity should not be used to determine success. He adds that just because something is not relevant to one individual, it does not mean it is not relevant to everyone else.Although this programme empowers content creators through providing them with the necessary tools they need, it is the knowledge aspect of this programme that insurmountably valuable. The programme teaches these aspiring content creators how to best use the tools and resources they have such as Google Analytics as well as the new Malaysia Content Pitching Centre.Through this programme, local YouTubers such as The Grim Film and DiDi & Friends: Children Songs have achieved much success with their most viewed videos reaching over 2 million views and 5.8 million views respectively.Our collaboration with Google aims to increase the reach, capability and competency of Malaysias creative industry by helping home-grown content creators produce, monetise and commercialise world-class content on the YouTube platform, said MDeC CEO Dato Yasmin Mahmood.This partnership is very much aligned with our aim of positioning Malaysia as a regional hub for creative content, she added.The Grim Films Jared Lee, who was present at a Made for YouTube gathering organised by Google and MDeC in the Google Malaysia headquarters this afternoon, highlights another important benefit of success in YouTubing, and that is digital agency. I think these days brands start to treat YouTubers as a creative agency as well. So they will call us and say, so, you have views, what do you think you can do for our brand?, he said, adding that the YouTubers would then come up with content for the brand.One of the scariest things that they say to us though is make me a viral video, he laughs.In any case, on the surface, this initiative looks like a good move to groom local YouTube talents and as a whole, improve the quality of Malaysias creative content. Although the first phase of this programme was only open to content creators that were hand picked by Google and MDeC, there is no telling what possibilities could come up in the future if this programme gets more traction."

Whether youre on the go with your device needing a quick fix or simply forgetting to charge it the day before. Hence the existence of quick-charge, the wonderful piece of innovation that gets your smartphones recharged at a fast-pace; though it isnt without some detrimental effects to the lifespan of your battery.Huawei hopes to take it a step further by lacing these lithium ion batteries with graphite, around the anodes  shown in a video below, itll blow any derivative of fast-charging by a mile at no expense of your batterys lifespan.Lets put this in perspective, Qualcomm claims that its Quick Charge 3.0 can get a smartphone from 0 to 80% in just 35 minutes  Huaweis? Itll get a 3,000 mAh battery from 0 to 48% in just 5 minutes. Imagine plugging your phone in and hitting the showers, coming back and getting at least half of your battery life back.During the same Battery Symposium in Japan, they also showed a 600 mAh battery hit 68% after being dead in just 120 seconds, yes guys in 2 minutes. In its early stages, the charging block is comparable to the size of an actual brick, so it wont be too pleasant to lug around but this shows some great promise, if they manage to minimise the size.Theres no timeline as to when itll hit mass consumers, but since its their own brainchild, they might only reserve it for their own devices. Inlays into battery advancements have been slow, at least in terms of breakthroughs, but its nice to see all the research is being put to good use. At least now, we have more glimmers of hope for our constant thirst for power (literally).[ VIA, 2 ]"

Moments of joy, sadness, heartbreak and the new experiences that capture the intricacies of what makes life worth living. Who could forget their first visit to a foreign place, the joy of that breathtaking sunset after a hard days climb or that first bite into the best burger youve ever had?The thing about moments though, is that they are like any other memory, they slip through the fragile grasp of our minds to the powerful tug of time. Moments end up hazy, becoming distant, unable to evoke the same emotions we felt on that day and thats kind of a bummer because when were old and grey, memories of those moments are kind of all we have.Samsung plans to change that though, with the all new Galaxy Note5, sporting its amazing 16-megapixel rear shooter, voted best camera by our readers, and the all new S Pen.Capturing moments in real life can be challenging as they are fleeting, often disappearing as quickly as they come. Couple that with lighting that is uncertain at best and you will be in for a hard time making sure that the image will properly reflect what you are seeing.This though, is where the Galaxy Note5s fast f/1.9 lens comes in. The wide aperture allows a lot of light into the sensor, making sure that your stills stay well exposed even in the dark confines of KL Live. Combine that with Samsungs auto real-time HDR and you are almost guaranteed a great image no matter how dodgy the lighting.The Galaxy Note5s camera is also ideal for quick snaps with its quick launch feature where a simple double tap on the home button will get you into the dedicated camera app letting you style-snap that fashionista walking down the sidewalk.When you have time to set up that perfect shot, head on into Pro Mode where you will have full access to exposure value (EV), shutter speed, ISO, white balance, and focal distance levels for optimal image capturing.
With that amazing rear shooter, Samsung also upgraded its front facing camera to a 5-megapixel one that maintains the rears HDR feature, bringing selfies to a whole new level. Join your precious moments and never have to worry about poor lighting again.Want to record a video instead? No problem. The Galaxy Note5s small form factor coupled with the cameras optical image stabilisation makes it ideal for handheld video recording. The bundled auto-eject S Pen makes video editing a breeze with its pressure sensitive point designed to give precision during editing.With live streaming being all the rage now, the Galaxy Note5s camera gives users a Live Broadcast option, streaming video from either camera directly to live stream sites like YouTube. As the app is native, it eliminates potential sign-in problems giving the user instant recording.
Sometimes simply capturing images arent enough to capture a moment, so the S Pen lets users personalise their photos and edit on the fly with Screen Write and Photo Editor. Add that little context to an image to make it stand out and just be that little more special. Scribble a memory or even directions on images of popular landmarks so that you will never forget that awesome moment.
Once thats done and dusted, share your amazing, personalised photos with the world through social media. Make sure that everyone can experience that moment with you because lets face it, moments are like a good meal, best enjoyed in great company.In the case that youd like to take a look at what the creative individuals can do with the Note5, heres an amazing example:To encourage the capturing of moments and budding creative individuals, Samsung Malaysia will be running their Moment of Note campaign from the 7th of November to the 13th of December where two lucky participants will walk away with a brand new Galaxy Note5.

But as more images surface, were still doubting if this particular smartphone will actually be the Redmi Note 2 Pro. Anyhow consumers still have nothing to lose, were still getting fresh glimpsesof a Xiaomi device from Chinas regulatory agency, TENAA.As you can tell, itll have a fingerprint sensor on the rear and some metal to go along with it, a first for any Xiaomi device out there (Mi 4 and Mi Note were only metal edged). We would think that Xiaomi wouldnt kick themselves in the butt, as it seems far-fetched for them to try out something so different on a Redmi  placing it on a flagship device would likely bring more promise and also the Redmi name has attached itself to a moniker so distinct that this would be a 180-degree turn around.Another thing we had noticed was, if this were to be a Redmi device, then why did they remove the red coloured capacitive buttons? Doesnt make much sense, unless they want to move away from the Redmi platform and make the Xiaomi brand more uniform.Believe what you may, these are all leaks; so theres no actual word from Xiaomi. Bar none, if it is truly the Redmi Note 2 Pro, itll carry the same specs as its predecessor. Translating to a MediaTek Helio X10 processor underneath the 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen. Its purported to have 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory, while there will be a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear.Moving your way up front, youll be greeted by a 5-megaxpiel sensor. Once a realisation comes about, youll see that handing the smartphone a metal build means that there wont be any chances of removing the 3060 mAh battery inside. If it stands as it is, the phone will have a selling price of US$ 172 (RM 753)  thats if it really is another Redmi product.We apologise for the cynicism but things arent adding up on our end. More so since Xiaomi just brought the Redmi Note 2 to Malaysia (and other emerging markets). Rumours, maintain their bad rep; at least for this moment of time.Well have to wait to see what Xiaomi has to say about all this, which they likely wont, since it fuels interest in the brand. One has to hand it to them, now everyone is merely guessing what their next move is and this witch-hunt is getting quite fun.Feel free to add to the rumours with your own analysis of all this and at the same time, check out the post about how the Xiaomi Gemini was spotted with a Snapdragon 820 processor here.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

Shots of the phones About device screen has also been shown, indicating that the new phones would be named the Galaxy A3 (2016) and the Galaxy A5 (2016).The introduction of the Galaxy Aduoreally signaled the South Korean manufacturers intention to bring a more premium construction to its midrange lineup. From what we can tell, the new phones seem to have a design similar to Samsungs flagships, the Galaxy Note5 and the Galaxy S6.Both models sport a glass like material for the front and back panels with a metal frame running between them around the phone. The speaker grilles are located at the bottom of the phone along with a headphone jack, Micro-USB port and a microphone. Around the back, both phones sport a rear camera in the top middle section of the back panel along with an LED flash right beside it.Although phone specifications were not revealed at this point in time, previous performance leaks indicate that the Galaxy A3 (2016) will feature a 4.7-inch HD (7201280 pixels) display, a slight bump up from the existing model, and will have an Exynos 7580 quad-core processor, clocked at 1.5GHz, paired with 1.5GB of RAM under the hood.In a separate leak, NDTV Gadgets 360 reports that the Galaxy A5 (2016) is rumoured to feature a 5.2-inch full-HD display, which is also a slight increase in size compared to the existing model. Internals include Samsungs octa-core Exynos 7 processor clocked at 1.6GHz paired with an ARM Mali-T720 GPU and 2GB of RAM.Both phones share a 16GB internal storage and are rumoured to run on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, but we do hope that by the time the phones are launchedthey would be running on Android M instead.Whats peculiar here though is that the leaked specifications for the Galaxy A3 (2016)s camera puts it at 13 megapixels for the rear shooter and 5 megapixels for the front facing camera, which is better than the Galaxy A5 (2016)s purported 12-megapixel rear camera and 4.7-megapixel front camera. That said, the Galaxy A5s camera could have a newer sensor with a larger pixel size which can result inbetter photos.The current Galaxy A3 is equipped with an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front facing camera versus the Galaxy A5s 13-megapixel primary and 5-megapixel secondary shooter.What do you think of these leaks?

With these two out and about, they can finally refocus efforts (as if they werent already) on the 7th generation flagships. What could this mean for the official release(s) of the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 edge? Trusting leaked information on their firmware codenames, it might mean a release earlier than usual.Looking at industry trends, Samsung has recently fast-tracked their products by a month or so  e.g. the release of Samsungs Galaxy Note5, in contrast to its predecessor. Accordingly, the unreleased device(s) should lead to better processors, though will it be the Exynos 8890, the Snapdragon 820 or both?Weve seen these Korean devices be outfitted with two different chipsets before; mainly specific to regions but they skipped it for two generations, when the two options were last seen on the Galaxy Note4. A revival would be in order, as Qualcomm has stepped their game back to norm with the Snapdragon 820 (that was released today).Ridingother waves, Samsung might also consider lodging a bigger screen, enticing folks whod prefer more screen real-estate. There are also some (crazy) reports going around stating that the company will launch two differentscreen variants of the Galaxy S7 edge at the same time  at this time, it doesnt make sense for Samsung to release the larger version, once you consider the S6 edge+ has only been around for a while.Weve also discussed the potential for the latest Samsung offerings to be equip with the class-leading USB Type-C, a 3D Touch/Pressure Sensitive display and a 20-megapixel ISOCELL sensor as well. You can revisit our post about the assumed spec-sheet here.Spotted as G930FXXU0AOK6 and G935FXXU0AOK6, these are the latest leaks that support the theory that there will be two different versions of the Galaxy S7 (one regular, and the other a dual edged display). It is purported that they will begin the developmental stages for the software, from this month onwards.In the past the current line-up used SM-G920 and SM-G925 as internal codenames, so the G930 and G935 wouldnt surprise anyone to be anything other than their successors. Phonearena has highlighted that 12 months ago, the Galaxy S6s final firmware didnt begin till December, so implications can be made that the Galaxy S7 line should be out just in time for MWC 2016, in February. What do you think? Should Samsung maintain their delivery times of their 4 main flagships?And are you excited by hearing this news? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

For the next Galaxy, will Samsung make a grand showing at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona?According to tipster, nothing has changed for the upcoming Galaxy S7. The Korean smart phone maker isnt going to bring its launch earlier and theres no reason for them to rush since the Galaxy Note5 is still a worthy flag bearer for now. So if youre anticipating for their compact flagship, you should look out for 21st February  a day before MWC 2016 commences.

BlackBerrys standard four button combo adorns the chamfered sides of the Vienna and if they are anything like the Privs then the buttons would be a volume up, volume down, and a quick mute button.A front and rear camera combo can also be seen in the photos. The rear camera does not appear to have any visible hump but there what looks like a single LED flash nestled right next to it. Its design bears some resemblance to the BlackBerry Passport, albeit with a longer screen. Should this end up being the rumoured Android-powered Passport, it could then indicate that overall sales of the Priv are going well since BlackBerry said that they would only release the Passport 2 if the Priv performed well. On Amazon at least, sales are indeed very positive as the Priv was sold out within hours of its United States official release.The BlackBerry Priv marked the Waterloo-based companys big move away from its proprietary OS into Googles sandbox. Many called this move a Hail Mary attempt though CEO John Chen said that a Hail Mary was not quite the right term as the Priv had been in the works for some time already.BlackBerry was always known for its emphasis on safety and productivity, which was something that was built into the BlackBerry OS, and something that its users appreciated. However, the company simply could not keep up with the number of apps present on systems such as Android and iOS. As a result, BlackBerrys market share dwindled to about 0.3% in Q2 of 2015.Another Android device so soon would indicate that the company could be abandoning BlackBerry 10 entirely, at least for the time being. But this doesnt come as too much of a surprise as CEO John Chen had said before that their choice of OS would be dictated by business choices.With the Privs arrival in Malaysia rumoured to be just around the corner, the Vienna could be just the sequel it needs, especially if it was more affordable. Is this enough to regain BlackBerrys lost user base though?[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"
Rory Lee,Your iPad Pro accessory buying just got a little more complicated with the Logitech CREATE Keyboard,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/12/your-ipad-pro-accessory-buying-just-got-a-little-more-complicated-with-the-logitech-create-keyboard/,"accessories,accessory,apple,apple ipad pro,iOS,iPad,iPad Pro,Logi CREATE Backlit Keyboard Case with Smart Connector,Logitech,Logitech CREATE Keyboard,MacBook,Smart Keyboard","Apple,iOS,iPad,Mobile Accessories",2015-11-12,"Ifyou were on the fence about purchasing Apples new Smart Keyboard for your iPad Pro, then perhapsLogitech can help you with that. Designed in collaboration with Apple under Logitechs CREATE banner, comes the Logi CREATE Backlit Keyboard Case with Smart Connector.Another little perk is that it makes your iPad Pro look like a MacBook.As the name suggests, theLogitech CREATE Keyboard utilises the iPad Pros Smart Connector, like Apples own Smart Keyboard, to connect to the iPad Pro, hence removing all the fuss associated with pairing accessories. It also draws power from the iPad Pro so there will be no need to charge the keyboard.The outer shell of the Logitech CREATE Keyboard is made of a woven fabric while the inside is constructed out of aluminium, which keeps it in the same design theme as Apples other products. The keyboard features a fairly standard layout, similar to that of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, only it has an array of iPad Pro specific shortcut keys.Apples Smart Keyboard utilises a seamless key system where there is no gap between the keys, preventing dust and other small particles from falling between them. The keys on the Smart Keyboard also do not have any conventional mechanisms in them, opting instead to use the keyboard fabrics natural spring-like tension. On the other hand, Logitech employs a much more traditional keyboard layout with individual chiclet keys similar to those on the MacBook Pro and Macbook Air. The most painfully obvious difference is that unlike Apples Smart Keyboard, Logitechs keyboard is fully backlit, which may end up being the deciding factor for many.Available in three different colours, the Logitech CREATE Keyboard has a colour to match each one that the iPad Pro is available in, blue for the silver version, black for Space Grey and red for the gold iPad Pro.The Verge reports that Logitechs alternative is a little bulkier when compared with Apples own keyboard but has added functionality with an entire row of iPad shortcut keys while also being able to double as a full case. A trade off they were willing to make.Coming in at US$149 (around RM 649) the Logitech CREATE Keyboard is also cheaper than the Smart Keyboard which is priced at RM799. However, both of them are still pricier than Microsofts Surface Pro 4 Type Cover which is priced at RM529. To learn more about the pricing options for the iPad Pro and its accessories, head on over here.Providing more functionality for a lower price, the Logitech CREATE Keyboard does seem to be a good deal, assuming you are comfortable dealing with the extra bulk. Unfortunately, the Logitech CREATE Keyboard is currently not available for purchase in the Apple Malaysia store for the time being, but we will keep you updated if it does become available.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Windows 10 Mobile will be on it out of the box but will this device be capable of putting the Windows OS back in the hearts and minds of smartphone users?It hasnt even hit stores in the States, so lets not be too impatient; the Redmond-based company already mentions a 20th of November release, in their native US market. But if the Surface Pro 4 were to arrive in Malaysia on the 19th, we dont think theyll have one amazing gala, rather theyd build up anticipation of their devices gradually.Skimming through SIRIM, if youd search for the model number RM-1116, the following information would be available to you:Saving you the trouble of digging through the spec-sheet, heres what to expect from the Lumia 950 XL; for starters, itll carry a QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED 5.7-inch ClearBlack display, while on top youll find Gorilla Glass 4 to protect it from abrasions.Running all processes, is a 2.0GHzQualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, together with 3GB of RAM and 32GBs of on-board memory. If that doesnt sit well with you, theres a microSD slot for expandability up to 200GB  but believe us, if youre going to be shooting 4K content, itll be a life saver.The PureView camera is back and this time its a 20-megapixel f/1.9 lens on the rear, equip with triple-LED RGB flash for less harsh illumination of your photos. Youll find optical image stabilisation on board as well, that will come in handy taking quick shots with the dedicated camera button.When recording those 4K videos, youll be able to shoot up to 30fps and for audio quality, itll be supported by the 4 microphones using Lumias Rich Recording technology. Selfies on the other hand, will be taken with a 5-megapixel wide angle f/2.4 shooter, which allows Full HD video recording for video calls.To top it all off, it comes with a 3,340mAh battery and will give you Qi Wireless charging, if you prefer the no cable route. Wed like to think that you might stick with the old-school method since itll get you 0% to 50%in half an hour, through the USB Type-C port. It also ticks all the boxes for internal connectivity options  802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE.From our perspective, Malaysians should expect our local Microsoft to release the two Lumia devices concurrently, after the Surface Pro 4 launch. Based on currency conversions you should expect the Lumia 950 XL to cost roughly RM 2,813 but obviously, no official prices have been announced.Well keep you updated once we get official news from the manufacturer, regarding the Lumia devices. Till then, feel free to let us know your thoughts about how the Windows mobile platform is progressing/digressing in the comments below.A big thank you to Twitter user @Syazx83 for the tip."

Luckily Koreas finest have smartened up this time and the Gear S2hasthe ability to communicate with other Android smartphones. They left iOS out, at least until September, when they suggested that they might consider opening it up.Since the beginning of Autumn, no follow-up came from Samsung but today, as reported by a Vietnamese blog, the Gear S2 will allow pairing and working functionality with iOS by the end of the year. They go to say that the first Gear S2 app will also be made available on the App Store; so setting up and customising your Gear S2, will be a breeze.No restrictions will be made for iOS users, exceptthey wont be able to access Samsung Pay  since, well, they arent using a Samsung. Those still harping on about whether to get the Apple Watch or the Gear S2 might have more reasons to think about switching up their device options slightly, if they were to already have an iPhone.This obviously is a mere rumour, so lets wait for Samsung to release official information first, before going out and buying your Gear S2. Well, for the most part, we hope Apple doesnt pull a Pebble, and remove the app from their App Store, once it goes live.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Users can expect to see this feature in the latest version of the Google Maps app which will allow users to save locations, search, and access the apps turn-by-turn navigation offline.As good as all of this sounds, there is a slight catch though.This new feature will only be available now on Android devices with availability on iOS devices listed as coming soon though no definite date was provided. Although relatively unsurprising, this feature will make owning an Android device versus an iOS one that much sweeter, at least for the time being.Previously, saved offline maps could only be viewed, the new Google Maps app will allow you to get turn-by-turn driving instructions, search for specific locations, and find information about places like operating hours, contact information or ratings. Offline navigation is simple enough to access as users only need search for a city, country or location and then tell the app to save the selected area. Areas can be saved by tapping Download on the resulting place sheet or by going to Offline Areas in the Google Maps menu and then tapping the + button.According to Google, the offline feature will not only benefit users navigating in areas without connectivity but also for users navigating between locations with spotty service, like in underground carparks or country roads. The app will automatically detect these areas and switch between online and offline mode to compensate for the lack of connectivity.Googles product manager told the BBC that they have been working on all of these features for two to three years already as Google Maps happened to be really slow or completely unusable in many scenarios due to limited connectivity.She added that with this, users will not have to resort to all that screenshot jujitsu before they leave on a journey for fear of loss of access during their journey.Saved offline maps will update automatically once every 15 days as long as the device is plugged into a charger and connected to WiFi unless the user overrides these settings.Despite the ability to access information, like ratings, about specific locations being listed as one of the new features capabilities, the BBC reports that reviews people have posted about restaurants and other businesses are not shown, and neither are user-generated photos.There is a silver lining to this limitation though as Google promises that they will be introducing even more offline features over time. While availability in Malaysia was not specifically mentioned, Forbes has indicated that this feature will be work with any area in the world. Should this new feature arrive on our shores, it could really give existing popular navigation apps a run for their money.[SOURCE]"

Following the notion that bigger is better, the iPad Pro is the largest iPad yet spanning 12.9 inches with a display that does 27322048 resolution at 264 ppi. The iPad Pro is designed to be a mobile powerhouse with a A9X chip under the hood thats accompanied by a M9 co-processor. Also thrown in is a 8MP iSight camera and a front facing 1.2MP camera. It gets dual-mics and 4 speakers with one placed in each corner. With a larger screen, it is heavier at 713g for WiFi and 723g for the Cellular version. However they have managed to keep the bulk down to a mere 6.9mm, which is thinner than the earlier iPad Air (7.5mm). Apple claims that the iPad Pro display is the most advanced Retina display ever built. Apart from pushing an ultra high resolution display, it is able to track the Pencils input at 240 times per second, giving it a lag free response. On top of that, the display not only detects Pencil movement and pressure, but also the amount of tilt for a more realistic stroke effect thats critical for illustrators. To maintain the same 10 hour of battery life, the iPad Pro display is smart enough to switch between 60Hz and 30Hz to conserve on power.The full iPad Pro and accessory pricing for Malaysia are priced as follows:If you have the money to splurge, you can place your orders now with shipping estimated to reach you by next week, 17th November. The iPad Pro comes in Gold, Silver and Space Grey colours. In terms of accessories, it will cost you quite a bit at RM799 for the Smart Keyboard and RM429 for the stylus Pencil. So at the bare minimum, thats RM4,398 for an iPad Pro 32GB WiFi with a keyboard. If you plan on doing serious work, a MacBook Air 11 can be yours from RM4,099, while the bigger 13 version starts from RM4,549. Alternatively if prefer the tablet form factor, why not spend RM4,528 on a Microsoft Surface Pro 4  Core M3 version with 4GB RAM, 128GB Storage along with the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover.

On the other hand ,toa timepiece aficionado the brand is usually the butt of jokes but its heritage is world-renown. Same goes for their ability to innovate; streamlining the chronograph just one illustration. Somewheredown the line, theyve lost their footing and aretryingonce again appeal to the wider consumer base. How can they turn it around with the TAG Heuer Connected?Jan-Claude Biver the CEO has officially announced how much this luxury watch will go for  setting you back a coolUS$ 1,500 (RM 6,581), this wearable better be worth the money. If you ask us personally, knowing that your buying a TAG at that price (even if it doesnt have the Swiss-made seal of approval) is a good deal; a quick run through some of their most affordable models and youll see that the starting price hover around the US$ 1k mark.Obviously geared for a posher market, Mr Biver was quoted to say that itll be similar to the Apple Watch, in terms of what it can do, though you shouldnt in any way compare the two together. I forbid my colleagues to say Apple is our competitor  as said by the CEO.The titanium built Carrera inspired Connected will run pretty much like other smartwatches by wirelessly connecting to your smartphone for a wide array of features. On your wrist this 46mm beast will be relatively large when compared to the biggest Apple Watch at 42mm. It might even be larger than the 46mm Moto 360, as far as we can tell from photos.Ladies, if youre into the whole smart wearable luxury segment (if that existed prior to this  no we arent gonna bother comparing tothe US$ 17,000 Apple Watch), the Swiss makers have plans to fashion a smaller version in the future. Admittedly, TAG Heuer have mentioned for the time being, their main market base are for males.Those on the edge of heritage, craftsmanship and tradition whod want to try out a named smartwatch can give this wearable a go for 2 years; after which, if you decide its not for you, a US$ 1,500 top up will get you a trade-up/in to a traditional mechanical Carrera. Keep in mind that Carreras retail way over US$ 3,000, a worthy bargain if you have the cash to splash.Running on the Android Wear platform, youll have access to some special watch faces and some dedicated apps to help you with dining options and golf tracking. Its has a 1.5-inch LCD sapphire glass screen at 360 x 360 resolution and come with 4GB of internal storage. Paying a pretty penny for this smartwatch, it leaves out an important piece that youd expect to get for its price; an optical heart-rate sensor.Considering you arent too bummed out, it does however house a gyroscope, tilt detection sensor, microphone, haptic engine and a 410 mAh battery (that TAG Heuer promises will get you 30 hours of battery-life). With Intel-inside, itll run a 1.6GHz dual-core Atom processor mated to 1GB of RAM. For connectivity, theres Wi-Fi (B/G/N) and Bluetooth 4.0 to pair with your iOS 8 (or higher) device or at least an Android running version 4.3 (and up).Big tech giants Intel and Google both had some part in creating the smartwatch, proving that it could be a formidable time piece. Itll hit New York first, available in 6 watch strap options, with only 1,000 units for sale, while Europe will see it in similar fashion 3 days after.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2, 3]"

Following the onslaught of whos the best, widest and fastest 4G LTE network, Maxis aims to put this issue to bed by releasing company data on how they classify their 4G LTE network. Moreover, the green coloured telco has also proposed to have a forum with two of its competitors to talk about the state of 4G LTE in Malaysia.Getting the ball rolling on a pressing issue that has left Malaysian baffled by both telcos claims (Digi and Maxis), this could mean that consumers will at the end gain more out of this. The initiator of all this has issued an open invitation to any member of the public to prove them wrong on their widest 4G LTE network; they also hope Digi and Celcom follow suit.Setting the date for the 23rd of November, Maxis hopes that this platform will allow all three networks to have their own telecommunications engineers to talk about how they gauge their coverage. And at the end of the day, Maxis claims that they want to do this for consumers; evidently to let us have a fair basis for choosing.Strangely, Maxis has left out the 4th major player in the market, U Mobile. Possibly since the company isnt publicly listed, otherwise wed best not speculate further. While everyone claims to provide the widest 4G LTE, were still questioning if theyve diverted their attention to problems that their customers are facing everyday  even in the heart of the Klang Valley.Our readers have been very open about their experiences on their networks, with some stating that there are service blind spots in popular landmarks and areas around the major cities. Silly if you think of it really, the fact that their customers in their key market areas are facing issues and they want to go on record being the widest, fastest, and best network.Previously, we talked about what all these bold titles mean to consumers, you can check it out here. But if youre really into these figures that Maxis has published, they are listed below:*Do note that aside from the first three lines, no 3rd party testing has been conducted to verify the statements by Maxis above*Its easy to talk numbers and standards but do they really reflect in real-life situations? Weve tried testing Maxis network at KLCC, on a weekday night and from the photo below, you can see we only managed 7Mbps download speeds, so what gives?We now throw it back to the telcos, step up your game, stop all the bickering and maintain your network coverage (and speed) across all your services  no matter 2G, 3G or 4G. We want a consistent experience, it doesnt matter to us if youre the widest if you cant deliver in reality.There has been no official statement from either Digi and Celcom yet (but be fair to them, its a public holiday today). Once theyve replied well keep everyone updated. Itll be a great thing to see our cellular providers meet in a neutral setting, we hope that all three will decide to have an unbiased moderator and that the public will be allowed to grill them on their gripes.

Building a long list of prophetic calls over his time at KGI Securities, he is a force to be reckoned with  the Nostradamus of Apple, minus the ambiguity. Apparently, when concerning the likeliness of iPhones carrying AMOLED screens, hes calling it a bluff, at least until 2019 comes around.Casually shooting down speculation that the manufacturer would tie up with their (competitor) Samsung (yet again), for AMOLED screens; he says that theyll stick to LCDs for the time being. Basing his analysis on Foxconns recent deal to build LTPS TFT-LCDs in Zhengzhou and a companys insights that LCDs will still be around for 3 years at minimum, it seems like a bad idea for Apple to forgo such investments.Itll be clearly nonsensical to pursue OLEDs, if Apples deal means that Foxconn were to partner to the government of Henan for the aforementioned project. Kuos reputation exceeds his name but if the companywere to consider OLEDs, theyd see a great improvement in battery life, while theyve mediated that issue quite well with how efficient iOS runs; while still having lower capacity batteries compared to their competitors.Theres a chance that you wouldve noticed AMOLEDs on their other product, the Apple Watch. Talking about OLEDs and its ability to deliver deeper trueblack pixels, the Chief Design Officer, Jony Ive discussed that in its current state, iPhones screen technology is an old-tune. It must mean something, if the guy designing all the products in your company were to say that, so maybe, just maybe, Apple might budge, given the right factors.Heres the transcript of Jonathans conversation in the interview:You can explore the whole LCD/LED vs OLED issue here.

When analysing which platform is safer, two security firms have looked at how secure the Android and iOS platforms are. The results may surprise you, but how worried should we be? And what cautionary steps should be taken?Users that dabble in third-party app stores (should) know what theyre doing, especially when it concerns workarounds and an unauthorised market place for apps. Bountiful in choices in countries like China and Russia, some of these apps are obviously laden with hidden malware and thats where the official sources,Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, vets them.Conventional thought has always made Apple the king when it comes to supplying the most secure operating system (OS X or iOS). Nevertheless, a new study provides some surprising insights that iOS is 4% more prone to vulnerable attackscompared to Android. The breakdown of the numbers is as listed below:Partly due to the amazing growth of the mobile ecosystem that sees nearly 1.5 million apps between the two platforms and multiple billions of downloads, this screams to be the best place for hackers to have some fun  at our expense. Extending way beyond instant messaging and social media, apps have evolved to include these sectors; banking and medicine, just to name a few.Dedicated detection in-built into apps would be one of the most promising course of action for smartphone vendors. It doesnt help either that mobile OS run in a sandbox environment. To simplify what that means, youre letting an application do what it needs to, in a secure setting. There are restrictions, so for example if you were to use an anti-spyware/malware app on your device, it can only do so much  now restricted by the operating system instead of the other way around. For a more thorough explanation head on over here.Always ensure that the apps you download are from reputable developers, especially if youre on an Android device. In a sense, iOS is more tightly overseenwhen giving power to developers, so thats a smaller sandbox and vetting them before goinglive on theApp Store.While Google also has its own process, it isnt as stringent as Apple  case and point, no validity for Play Store apps. Its understandable that with a fairly open-sourced platform, Android will have its trade-offs when it concerns pushing out security updates but hopefully Android M solves this. OEMs have jumped on the idea of providing monthly security updates, as far as Samsung, LG and HTC is concerned.The full report from Checkmarx can be found here.Till another malware attack arrives, keep your personal data safe everyone!For further reading, check out these articles below:Ghost Push Trojan hits the Google Play Store; theres a fix, dont worry

Priced from RM3,599. The iPad Pro is the largest and the most expensive iOS device that Apple has ever built. At 12.9 inches and the option to add on a keyboard and a Pencil stylus, it is obvious that Apple is jumping on the convergence bandwagon.This coming Wednesday, 11th November, Apple will be making the iPad Pro available across 40 countries including Malaysia through the online store. If you prefer to feel it before parting ways with your money, Apple says you can get it from their stores and authorised resellers by the end of this week. In terms of price, the iPad Pro cost nearly as much as a MacBook Air. The base 32GB WiFi model is going for US$799 (about RM3,505) while the 128GB version goes for US$949 (about RM4,164). For complete connectivity, the extra cellular (3G/4G) support with 128GB storage carries a hefty US$1079 (about RM4,734) price tag. As comparison, the 11 MacBook Air is going for US$899 or RM4,099 in our Malaysian online Apple Store (after recent price revision). To complete your iPad Pro experience, the matching keyboard cover and pencil are sold separately. The Pencil stylus that lasts 12 hours on a single charge is sold at US$99 (about RM434), while the Smart keyboard will set you back by US$169 (about RM741). The overall iPad Pro full package is really expensive and it makes the already pricey Microsoft Surface Pro 4 seem like a bargain. The biggest difference of course is that the iPad Pro is still running on iOS while the Surface gives you a full fledged Windows 10 experience. You can read the full specs and features of the iPad Pro in our earlier announcement post. Would you get the iPad Pro, and will it replace your day to day MacBook?

It has the same 5 size but gets notable upgrades to qualify as a decent mid-range smart phone. Instead of a Snapdragon 410 processor, the Moto G Turbo Edition gets bumped up with a Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core unit with 2GB of RAM. While the display size remains unchanged, it pushes a higher Full HD resolution, giving a flagship class screen clarity. On-board it still gets 16GB of storage which is also expandable.

With more devices relying on USB power, Xiaomi has announced its largest power bank yet, with a gigantic 20,000mAh capacity. The current 16,000mAh power bank which retails for RM89 is quite a heft at 350 grams and Xiaomi has managed to make the new 20,000mAh version lighter at only 338 grams. Thats even lighter than two of the latest 10,000mAh power bank that weighs 207 gram each.The design is different from its current models as it uses polycarbonate materials instead of the usual metal, contributing to its massive weight reduction. To provide better grip, the power bank has a perforated texture on top which Xiaomi claims to be scratch resistant. Like the 16,000mAh version, there are two USB outputs, that pushes a maximum of 5.1V/3.6A combined. It is even capable of charging a USB Type-C enabled MacBook up to 1.2X. A 4-LED battery level indicator is retained at the top, while the power/status button has been shifted to the side.Knowing that 20,000mAh will take almost eternity to charge up to full, it supports quick charge supporting 5V/2A, 9V/1.2A and 12V/1.5A. In just 3 hours, you would have gotten 11,000mAh charged, compared to its 10,000mAh power bank that does 5,000mAh in the same duration. Like all Mi Power Banks, it gets 9 layers of protection using Texas Instrument chips for safety and charging efficiency. The 20,000mAh Mi Power Bank goes on sale in China for 149 CNY (about RM101.40) and it will be available on Singles Day on 11th November. Thats bang for your buck considering the 10,000mAh Power Bank is going for 79CNY / RM59 (Mi Store Malaysia).

Arif Lee,Huaweis Nexus 6P has some build-quality issues.

Most recently, Nexus 6P owners have taken to reddit to voice their concerns and experiences with the device. As we all know, the latest Nexus has glass on the back (a very small part) for its rear camera and other sensors. But what you wouldnt expect is the rear glass panel suddenly cracking for no reason.First encountered by a reddit user by the name jonny_rat, the owner recalls his experience, thus raising some huge concerns about how Huaweiwent into making these panels. The way jonny pictures it, the device was on a table, unattended and suddenly for no reason the glass just cracked. He isnt alone as other users have also reported the panel splitting unexpectedly without fault or impact.Here are morephotos below for you to take a look:A lot of science goes into the making of these intricate components, especially when you have a manufacturer like Corning involved. Though itll be tough to verify if these claims are true, and most importantly if no user error was involved. Until more reports surface or Google/Huawei makes an official statement, well just have to rest on our laurels.These problems highlight a key complication with metal unibody devices, since metal as an element is more reactive to temperatures, humidity and air pressure compared to polycarbonate and other plastics. Huaweis graceful entry into metal devices (honor 7, Mate S and P8) and eventual Nexus 6P was bound to bump into some issues along the road, so this wasnt entirely unexpected.Bend-gate has been a thing since the iPhones and stress testing devices with this forceful (literal) methodology could now be seen as a standard for tech enthusiast. By now, mostly everyone interested wouldve seenthe two bend tests by JerryRigEverything. The YouTuber in question took the Nexus 6P to its limits, halving the phablet in the process.Some individuals doubted the authenticity of the video and the way he went upon testing but after releasing a second video, more people have started to consider that maybe Huaweis device isnt as tough as its assumed. The news is definitelyworrying for potential buyers to know,however a quick search on YouTube will show you people trying the same thing but failing to bend the phones  adding more drama to the whole situation.As users ourselves, its painful to watch anyone destroy a piece of tech but its nice to know that these people do it so we dont have to. Lets hope Huawei and Google explain themselves soon enough (like Apple did) since Malaysians might get the latest Nexus line by year end. The smartphone industry has to brace themselves as consumers find out new ways to point out design flaws in their products, theyll either have to toughen up their products or substitute it with a material that can hold up to these tests.Feel free to drop a comment down below regarding any weird experiences with your devices.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Since its introduction, the metal clad smart phone is constantly accused of being a copy of the iPhone 6/6s. Besides, it gets a mid-range spec and it loses the front facing BoomSound stereo speakers.If youre hoping for something better, HTC is rumoured to be working on a new One X9that looks promising.From the purported leaked image shown above, the One X9 looks like an evolution of its HTC Butterfly series. The top and bottom grill indicates the presence of its Boom Sound speakers and surprisingly it appears to have capacitive buttons in front. Thats rather odd sinceHTC smart phone these days have optedfor on-screen buttons.It is alleged that it will carry a 5 display that pushes a Quad HD (25601440) resolution with either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or Helio X20 processor running on -board. The rumour continues with a massive 4GB of RAM, a 23MP main + 4MP Ultrapixel camera bombo and a generous on-board storage of 64GB to 128GB. Breaking its tradition of using smaller than average batteries, the One X9 is said to be fitted with a larger 3,500mAh capacity unit.Looking at the timing, it isstrangethat HTC is releasing a high-end device at this time of the year, especially when the new One M series is due for replacement during MWC 2016.

A totally new venture for the Chinese company (since the Mi Note and Mi 4 only have metal edges), the metal body could possibly not be the only new feature; rear-mounted fingerprint sensor included. New photos have arrived showing the outer shell and it pretty much corroborates older images but still leave us unsure if Xiaomi would pack all this in amid-range device.Since the Redmi Note 2 will be available (in Malaysia) for pre-order in 2 days, this timely news might deter buyers whod prefer a metal-clad phablet. That said, ifthe rumours are true, the Redmi Note 2 Pro could carry a 5.5-inch display but no information states whether itll maintain the 1080p resolution like the regular variant.Once you find your way inside, there will be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor coupled with either of these memory configurations:2GB RAM + 16GB internal storage  1099 yuan (RM 756)
3GB RAM + 32GB internal storage  1299 yuan (RM 893)
4GB RAM + 64GB internal storage  1499 yuan (RM 1030)Something definitely doesnt tally with this information but from photos we can say that a device does indeed exist. Whether itll actually be a Redmi Note 2 Pro is a whole other story. Firstly, it doesnt make sense to pack a fingerprint sensor and premium build, in a mid-range product  if you were to do it, it would definitely be in your flagship.Another problem would be, why release a higher-end Redmi Note 2 if you just released it in August. But then again, we feel it wont be anything else since the Mi 4C was supposed to be a respectable replacement to the Mi 4. If Xiaomi truly decides to release a device with the aforementioned price points, this could be the most expensive Redmi to date.Were as confused as you are but do keep in mind that these are all rumours, the only thing that is considered to be factual would be Xiaomi will release a smartphone on 11.11. Let us know your thoughts below and help us come up with some reasoning as to what Xiaomi might be planning.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

The flip phone will also feature an octa-core 2.1GHz CPU with 3GB of RAM along with 64GB of non-expandable storage under the hood. The Galaxy Golden 3 will come pre-loaded with Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.This latest leak raises some questions regarding the actual size of the Galaxy Golden 3s screen as GFXBench had listed the screen size to be 4.6 inches. Regardless, the flip phone will come with a 16-megapixel rear shooter and a 5-megapixel front facing camera for selfies and video chats. While no information on the chipset type was revealed by TENAA, GFXBench alleges that the Galaxy Golden 3 will get a high-end Exynos 7 SoC with a Mali-T760MP8 GPU.The Galaxy Golden 3 will weigh 204 grams, up 24 grams from the original models 179 grams and will be 15.1mm thick. This thickness comes as no surprise because flip phones have always had the tendency to be thicker than its unhinged counterpart.While the phone itself has not been announced by Samsung, the previous Galaxy Golden and Galaxy Golden 2 have been given the model number SM-W2014 and SM-W2015 respectively. Logic then dictates that the SM-W2016 would be the Galaxy Golden 3. Unfortunately TENAA did not publish any photographs of the phone, however, now that it has received its certification, we could likely see the flip phone revealed by Samsung soon.Although clamshell phones are no longer popular, a big part due to the inconvenience of actually having to flip the phone open as well some instances of wonky phone displays due to the hinge, it seems that Samsung still believes in this relatively niche market as this would be the third installment of the Galaxy Golden phone series.[SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE,VIA]"

According to Anandtech, new information on the Snapdragon 820s CPU best describes it as an HMP solution with two high performance cores clocked at 2.2 GHz and two low-power cores clocked at 1.6 or 1.7 GHz.The company also claims that the new Adreno 530 GPU boasts a significant boost in graphics performance, compute capabilities and power usage, recording a 40% improvement over the Adreno 430. Engadget reports that the 3D environments Qualcomm had running on the Snapdragon 820 reference tablets looked much more crisp and far more impressive than those running on the Snapdragon 810 last year, bordering on game console quality.Keeping up with their attempt at making the most advanced mobile processor ever created, the Snapdragon 820 comes with support for 802.11ad WiFi and 802.11ac 22 MU-MIMO. This allows WiFi speeds to be up to two or three times faster than existing 802.11ac without MU-MIMO. Qualcomm adds that consumers can expect 802.11ad routers to start appearing next year.The chips model also sports improvements with support of LTE Category 12 download speeds of up to 600 Mbps and LTE Category 13 upload speeds of up to 150 Mbps. Qualcomms latest chip also supports LTE-U, which allows the chip to access LTE connections in both licensed spectrum and unlicensed spectrum  boosting connection speeds and mobile broadband access in normally congested areas.Qualcomms new child also sports the companys ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, Sense ID. For more information on Sense ID and how it works, we talked about it here.Engadget got a chance to witness this ultrasonic technology in action and remarked that it worked just as fast as Apples Touch ID implementation, adding that a little dirt on the Qualcomms reps fingers didnt slow it down at all.On paper, this new Snapdragon looks to be a significant improvement over its predecessor but whether it will become another hot topic like its predecessor remains to be seen.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Alexander Wong,DirectD brings the OnePlus X to Malaysia and it is available today,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/05/directd-brings-the-oneplus-x-to-malaysia-and-it-is-available-today/,"Android,DirectD,Dual Sim,OnePlus,OnePlus Malaysia,OnePlus X,OnePlus X Malaysia,OnePlus X Price","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-11-05,"Last week OnePlus had announced the X, a 5 mid-ranger that sits right below its existing OnePlus One and OnePlus 2 in terms of specs. Instead of a top spec flagship killing machine, the OnePlus X focuses more on design aesthetics. If you cant wait for the official sales that come with its annoying invitation system, you can get it now in Malaysia thanks to our local grey importer, DirectD. Likely to be the Onyx version, DirectD is offering the OnePlus X for RM1,299 inclusive of GST. Thats not too shabby considering it retails for US$249 (RM1,069) in the US and 269 Euro (about RM1,255) in Europe. To recap on the specs, the internals are quite similar with the first OnePlus One model except for its smaller screen. The front gets a 5 Full HD AMOLED display giving a 440 ppi pixel density and it runs on a Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM. Storage wise it packs just 16GB but this time it is expandable with microSD. Like the OnePlus 2, it gets a hybrid dual-SIM slot supporting two SIM cards or alternative 1 SIM plus 1 microSD card. For imaging, the OnePlus X gets a 13MP f/2.2 camera with a single LED flash, while the front gets a 8MP selfie camera. Keeping the lights on is a 2,525mAh battery and it also gets a 3-step alert slider on the sides like the bigger OnePlus 2 sibling. Out of the box, it runs on OxygenOS thats based on Android 5.1.1. For the price and the specs it offers, it is pretty close to the OnePlus One thats priced at RM1,399 with GST. You get the exact same specs inside plus a larger 5.5 Full HD screen. However do note that it only comes with a Single SIM slot and it lacks a microSD expansion slot and the new alert slider. If youre interested, you can order the OnePlus X online. Alternatively you can drop by their showroom at Subang Jaya or at their Gadget Mega Store along Federal Highway. According to DirectD, stocks will be available starting today 5th November after 7PM.[ SOURCE ]"

The Kirin processor lineup by its own HiSilicon subsidiary has finally risen to the occasion and the folks at Qualcomm should really start to worry especially with it its overheating issues. For instance, the Kirin 920 on the Honor 6 performs almost on par with their high-end Snapdragon 800 series processor.With Samsung currently enjoying the limelight with its epic Exynos 7420 processor, Huawei is attempting to knock them off with its brand new Kirin 950 processor. This new powerhouse is likely to debut on their upcoming Mate 8. Announced at Beijing today, the Kirin 950 is set to be a game changer. It is manufactured based on a 16nm fab process and it uses 4x high performance ARM Cortex A72 cores that are clocked up to 2.3GHz thats accompanied by 4x low power Cortex A53 cores at 1.8GHz. Running in a big.LITTLE set up, this helps to optimise the Octa-Core processor to balance between performance and power consumption. As comparison, Samsungs Exynos 7420 is based on a 14nm process, with 4x Cortex A57 and 4x Cortex A53 while the current Snapdragon 810 is based on 20nm. For graphics, it relies on a Mali-T880 GPU and theres also a little i5 co-processor as well. In terms of performance it does look promising as the preliminary Antutu benchmark scored over 80,000 points, surpassing the likes of the Galaxy Note 5 and the Meizu Pro 5. Likely to be featured on their upcoming Mate 8, a new device was spotted on Geekbench scoring over 6200 for Multi-Core tests, which is much higher than what the Galaxy Note 5 and iPhone 6s Plus have recorded. To cater for your future flagship needs, it will support VoLTE and 4G LTE-A connectivity as well. Overall it does look very promising and out of nowhere, HiSilicon is looking like a compelling rival to Samsungs high-end Exynos processors. Of course the Korean semiconductor division wont be standing still and they are expected to reveal a newer processor ahead of its upcoming Galaxy S7. [ SOURCE 2 3 ]"

Since 2011 their stock price has plummeted 90%, leading them to be pulled off the main Taiwan stock exchange market; TWSE 50. Is it pompous ignorance, bad marketing or just market strategies? A sharp fall from grace that has seen them at one time, account for 24% of all smartphone shipments when their stocks were valued at the highest.Meant to be the (slightly) larger affordable alternative to its flagship, HTC One M9+, the One E9+ occupies the under 2k category by being priced at RM 1,899  RM 700 less than its more premium sibling. Other than that large screen what do you notice almost immediately? The lack of the fingerprint sensor on the front and the dual-camera set up on the back.In short, yes but has the HTC name suffered too much to revitalise itself? Many questions that require many answers. Hopefully well address each and every one of them in our review.At its price point it faces competition Samsung Galaxy A8, the OnePlus 2(if you can get your hands on it), Mi Note, and Oppo R7 Plus. Has the HTC One E9+ have what it takes?"

Alexander Wong,Tizen overtakes BlackBerry as the 4th biggest smart phone OS,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/05/tizen-overtakes-blackberry-as-the-4th-biggest-smart-phone-os/,"blackberry,BlackBerry OS,Largest Smart Phone OS,Mobile OS,smart phone,Smart Phone OS,Tizen","Blackberry OS,Mobile OS,Tizen",2015-11-05,"BlackBerry is struggling no doubt, but to be overtaken by an underdog platform is definitely surprising. Tizen, a Linux based mobile OS that supersedes Samsungs Bada OS has finally overtaken BlackBerry as the 4th biggest smart phone platform. While we hardly see any Tizen smart phones in our market, Samsung has found significant success in the Indian market.According to IDCs Q2 2015 smart phone OS market share report, Android dominates the top spot at 82.8%, followed by iOS at 13.9% and Windows Phone nabbing 3rd place at 2.6%. BlackBerry has been declining by the years from 4.9% market share (at #3 spot) back in 2012, to a new low of just 0.3% at 4th place in Q2 2015. IDC has yet to update its Q3 figures, but Strategy Analytics has just reported that Tizen has shown tangible growth, propelling itself to overtake the once popular platform known for security. The biggest growth comes from Samsungs Tizen Z series thats hugely popular in India. Despite Microsoft inching its way into the affordable segment, the Tizen platform has managed to claim the #2 spot in the local budget segment. Similar to Android, Tizen is an open-source platform. In order to entice more app development, Samsung is giving 100% app revenue back to its developers. It was surprising that Tizen had a fighting chance, considering there are ample of cheap Android smart phones in their market. The Samsung Z1 came with very low specs for INR 5,700 (about RM373). It gets a basic 4 WVGA display, an entry level dual-core processor, 768MB of RAM and paltry 3.1MP + VGA cameras. The latest addition is the Samsung Z3 which offers a 5 HD display, a Quad-Core 1.3GHz processor, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage for a mere INR 8,399 (about RM550). As for BlackBerry, they are hoping to turn their fortunes around as they are making the switch to Android. Being a business focused device, the upcoming BlackBerry PRIV is more expensive than their current BlackBerry Passport, which gives it very little appeal for the masses. In their current predicament, BlackBerry hopes to sell 5 million smart phones or they might consider leaving the mobile business altogether. [ SOURCE 2 ]"

In essence, Trivoly attaches itself underneath your regular watch, so nothing odd happens to your original timepiece  it does however, pack some great features in its small body.It secures itself on to the underside of your watch via Gecko-tape, a derivative of a suction cup mechanism. Measuring just 3mm thin, youre likely to notice a bump but not by much. Once placed, itll sync up to your smartphone and provide notifications by vibrating or lighting up itsLEDs to correspond to your settings. Trivolys UI lives inside an app, allowing you to do some great things when you tap aroundyour watch face (actually the side of the disc but its all the same).The app lets you personalise your notifications by setting different colours and vibration patterns. Theres also a discreet function to avoid certain interruptions by prioritising the contacts youve managed. Inside the disc lives an optical heart rate sensor and accelerometerto supportyour fitness lifestyle by enabling advanced tracking for exercise on the dedicated app.Other features included are multimedia controls for apps like SONOS, iTunes and Spotify by taping from the top, bottom, left and right  each functioning differently and acting as a remote control of sorts. Lastly, itll also act as a wireless picture taking controller; up to 25 feet away, a simple tap will start a countdown timer and after 3 seconds a photo is taken.Hypo allergenic in nature and water resistant, the manufacturer promises the device will give you up to 4 days of battery life. Currently, it supports iPhone 5s (and up) on iOS 8 or later, as well as Android smartphones that run at least 4.2 (and up).There will be two versions of the Trivoly, as the low end variant doesnt have the fitness tracker component. At this current time, Trivoly 1 costs US$ 99 (RM 427), while the higher-end Trivoly 2 goes for US$ 129 (RM 556). The makers promise to have the device shipped to you in February 2016.Trivolys invention should be compared to the Mi Band  that offers almost the same thing (minus the camera, music controloption and smaller form factor) and that only costs RM 69 (thats nearly 6 times less), so choose wisely if youre interested in pledging.Head on over here to find out more about the Trivoly Kickstarter project.[ VIA ]"

But now, theyve added full support for Cardboard on all videos listed on their streaming site  even if they werent filmed using a 360-degree camera.No matter the occasion or location, the new YouTube app hands you two useful features; the first (isnt all that new) lets you select the Cardboard icon once in full-screen mode in existing content that has 360-degree views. While the camera equipment to get a shot like this running will cost a bomb, so there isnt much readily available videos just yet.The second add-on is where things get a little more interesting. So if youve noticed on your Android device that theres a symbol in the settings that youve never seen before, give it a go. Itll theoretically allow you to view any video in Cardboard view  no, it wont magically make viewable in 360-degree but if you want a cinematic experience, why not?If you arent familiar with the Cardboard UI, it halves the screen, shrinks the video and mirrors it on the two sides. The screen stays in place in the virtual world, so itll depend on your smartphones gyroscope to centre your viewing.In any case that you cant find this option on your Android device, check if your YouTube is up-to-date and if it still doesnt work, look up the Cardboard app on the Play Store; if it says your device isnt compatible (apparently it doesnt run on our Sony Xperia M5 Dual).Heres some content for folks with a VR headset:Hunger Games Experience,TOMS Shoes Giving Trip, Performance by Violinist Tim Fain and an Icelandic glacier expedition.Check out our review of the Samsung Gear VR here to check out a higher-end experience.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

As seen above, Huawei has posted a teaser image of a new Mate device with a prominent number 8 which strongly hints the Mate 8. In terms of specs, Huawei is keeping most of the details well under wraps but it is speculated that they would be fitting its latest Kirin 950 processor thats going to be unveiled this Thursday.

Indifferent, Xiaomi has always been affordable but have stepped up their game with their recent releases, though they havent forgotten their loyal customers  priced almost at a reasonable mid-range, Malaysians can now get their hands on the Redmi Note 2.A phablet that carries a 5.5-inch Full HD screen (1920 x 1080), a vast improvement from its predecessor that only had a 720p display. Itll run a MediaTek Octa-core Helio X10 processor and be mated to 2GB of RAM. Malaysians will get the smaller 16GB model but regardless, the smartphone has a microSD expansion slot for extra storage space. Its internals prove that this mid-range is no push over, since releasing with the same processor found in some higher-priced devices such as the HTC One M9+ and the Sony Xperia M5.The Redmi Note 2 will arrive with a 13-megapixel camera with phase detection auto focus and LED flash, while the front gets a 5-megapixel lens. The design of Xiaomis latest device has understated similarities with its smaller Mi 4i flagship, in terms of look and feel. However, internally there are many differences  no unibody design, a dual-SIM 4G LTE slot and also a removable battery (just to name a few).Unlike its old-guard, itll receive the greatest 802.11ac Wi-Fi support and have an IR Blaster, that allows you to use it as a remote control for your household devices. Even while being lighter, thinner and smaller than the model it replaces, the phablet has a 3060 mAh battery underneath its matte back cover. The charging port will maintain a traditional micro-USB slot.Pre-orders will be availablefrom the 11th of November, the 160gram phablet will retail for RM 649 and run the latest MIUI 7 on top of Android 5.0 out of the box.

Arif Lee,Does having the widest 4G LTE coverage matter to Malaysians?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/03/does-having-the-widest-4g-lte-coverage-matter-to-malaysians/,"4g,4G LTE coverage,4G LTE network coverage,Celcom,Celcom 4G,coverage,DiGi,DiGi 4G,lte,Mais 4G,Malaysia,Maxis,Maxis 4G,Maxis 4G LTE,network coverage,U Mobile,U Mobile 4G,widest 4g,widest 4G LTE,widest 4G lte coverage,widest coverage","Celcom,Cool stuff,DiGi,HSPA+,Industry in General,LTE,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Players on the Field,Technologies,U Mobile",2015-11-03,"Last month, two telcos made bold claims to have managed to hit at least 50% population coverage for 4G LTE  Digi (50%) and Maxis (55%). Issuing the whos betterstatements within a short period, the two have been bitten by a bug to prove who has the true widest 4G LTE network. Question is, when telcos claim to have the widest coverage would you gauge it based on population percentile or percentage of coverage areas? Who sets the standards? And most important of all, does it matter?To get to the bottom of this, well have to set some key definitions first about what 4G LTE is. In a data-driven generation, we all emphasis speed and with that speed comes the necessary technology to support our thirst for it. Malaysians have gotten a taste of 4G LTE in2013 and were offered by Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile.Referring to the specifications set by the United Nations official oversight commission (ITU-R) that monitors information and communication technologies; 4G LTE at its truest (meaning) would translate to 100 Mbps on the move, and roughly 1 Gbps when considered locally wireless. At least, in theory that is. Looking around the globe at some of the fastest speeds, none of them break the 40 Mbps mark.Referring to Open Signals State of LTE September 2015 report, these are the top 5 countries with the fastest (average) LTE speeds: New Zealand is the chart topper, posting 36Mbps; Singpore gets runner-up with 33Mbps; Romania surprisingly gets 30Mbps; South Korea gets the 4th spot with 29Mbps; Denmark rounds offthe 5th spot with 26Mbps.Since the report refers to data from September, the info is backdated. Interestingly, Open Signal only has a sample size of approx. 300 thousand users  yes, a size quite small when youre talking global proportions.In retrospect, Malaysian usually see a range of 15Mbps to 30Mbps but there have been instances where youll see a spike that actually meets the aforementioned standards. Surpassing and reaching LTE-Advance levels, which puts Maxis at the forefront (for the time being).Both sides will have a valid say, for example, what use would there be if you traveled to adesolated area in some deep jungle in the peninsular or eastwards? Itd be pointless (in a sense) to erect a cell tower in that area, because there wouldnt be anyone to serve. But at the same time, if anyone were to be placed in that situation, arent they supposed to be covered, if their mobile operator is indeed the widest?Taking a look at the playing field, both telcos above (actually the major 4) run on the even platform  two spectrums: 1800GHz and 2600GHz. Ironically when 4G LTE was first rolled out, the iPhone 5 wasnt able to run on LTE,as all networks were solely running on2600GHz at the time. Lower bands get you better signal penetration (indoors and outdoors) but higher bands give you faster data speeds.In a race to the top, are telco providers forgetting that unless there is a way to quantify and verify their 4G LTE population coverage, it just simply an unrecognised title to hold? Do they deliver as promised? From our comments on Digis and Maxis coverage articles, many users are still facing service related issues. Theyve attached photos for reference, testing their speeds in claimed areas and disputing them accordingly.For customer experience to be considered, our local telco players tend to knock about the notion of providingthe best but are they really delivering? Nationwide, many users have voiced out about drops in cellular quality but wed rather hear your thoughts; many factors go into objectively testing networks around Malaysia but with our readers coming from all over, we hope to get some feedback and your concerns to your providers and let them address them.Should Malaysian cellular providers bother in claiming the top coverage(s) title? They should first mediate issues that are faced by their users on a day-to-day basis  delivering what users need, consistently giving them the value they paid for in the first place.If we were to take part in a full-blown test that manages to encapsulate the varying telcos and their corresponding ability to cover areas, there would be many puzzles pieces and putting them together would include:Taking a respective number of locations  e.g. over 100 locations nationwide (East Malaysia and West Malaysia)
Using the same device, test the four telcos cellular data coverage
Establish if there is 4G LTE in the area through corresponding symbols on these devices
Test their speeds, take multiple tests on each network and get an average
Find out if these 4G speeds are better than 3G HSPA+ or even lower bands (cause if it isnt, whats the point of having the widest 4G coverage?)2G, 3G, 4G and whatever else that goes along with your user experience, it should be maintained across all their offerings, not being better here or coming short on the other. U Mobile has proven that while they were the new player, theyve established a foothold in their 3G HSPA+ network with 4G-like speeds. Were sure that users have had moments where nothing can be done on 3G (even with good coverage in that category).We have to start questioning thereasons why our providers are busy worrying about widest and fastest? Users would much prefer something tangible, and at the end of the day if their telcos work for them in their corresponding areas. Throwing marketing fluff here and there does nothing for their consumers.All we want is for our local players to show us why we should be on your network  through user experience, not some coverage map. Beside the fact, being the widest network shouldnt be an issue, everyone should offer a wide network. Cellular datahas become a necessity and our consumers deserve that, at the very least."

That extends to any messaging service, be it Whatsapp, Facebook chat and the like, you dont know if the data flow is secure.Thats where Celcoms Zipit Chat comes in, being the most secure communications app youll ever lay your eyes on. The reason? Its because it uses Military-Grade AES256 Encryption.How does it work?
Like we mentioned earlier, Zipit Chat utilises Military-Grade AES256 Encryption, which keeps your chats very private by encrypting your messages to the point that even snooping security agencies wont be able to break the code.Even your emails can be encrypted in a similar manner, with attachments of up to 10MB for videos and emails. So if someone manages to intercept it, all theyll see is piles of gibberish. Your phonebook information will also be secure, and with this app screen capture is disabled for extra measure.Is it effective?
Celcom ran a contest a little over a month ago that got people to attempt to decrypt three messages that have been encrypted by Zipit Chat and the results were pretty off the mark. While the text isnt completely vulnerable to brute-forcing but it can only be decrypted with a secret key thats specific to that text alone. It could take years for someone to figure it out otherwise!So if youre looking for something that even the government wont be able to get into, Zipit Chat is right for you.Zipit Chat is available from the Google Play Store for free till 30 November 2015."

Maybe that was why the company has just hired a former Apple director. A steady rise of the hardware quality has already begun, crafting devices like the Ascend Mate 7, the P8 and of late the Mate S and co-creation of the Nexus 6P. This news naturally means that EMUI should get some much needed refinement and rid themselves of gimmicky features like Knuckle Sense.Abigail Brody is Huaweis new hire and she served as Apples creative director, as chief user experience designer. Filling the role should come naturally, considering she worked for the software/hardware giants for nearly a decade. Quoted to have defined the way Apples applications look and feel from 2001 till 2011, her expertise in R&D will benefit Chinas largest smartphone makers many times over.Brodys vibes have also been felt in another top tier organisation  eBay, where she was the VP of Global Design. As one of the key designers of iOS 1, Aperture and Final Cut Pro, her repertoire could be a good fit for Huawei.Success isnt easily repeated but you should expect EMUIs interface to get a whole lot better once the manufacturers US design studio has been established.

There will be something for everyone, like the industrial processional with the Jabra STEEL; the avid traveller with the Halo Fusion; the business-savvy with the Eclipse, and the sport enthusiast with the Sports Pace Wireless.
Well take a look at all four devices, starting with the Jabra STEEL. Designed as a rugged Bluetooth headset to withstand the conditions of the work associated with some of the occupations featured on Mike Rowes Dirty Jobs; the sturdy audio earpiece is made to handle vigorous environments and has been thoroughly stressed in a series of tests that are faced by people in the line of work.Ideal for high decibel environments with its high definition voice/audiothrough a dual-microphone that makes use of active noise cancellation technology and isolates the users voice. The large button allows you to interact with Siri or Google Now with long presses and offers an option for voice activated pick-ups of calls; you can also use message readout if youre using an Android device.Its ergonomic design also comes with a custom ear-hook that will mould to your ear to provide a secure fit, while on the job. The in-built battery will get you 6 hours of talk time, at the same time allowing a power nap feature to prevent it from zapping battery. The STEEL promises 10 days of standby time and roughly 2 hours will give it a full charge. It weighs only 10grams.The next wireless audio accessory is the Halo Fusion, a two-in-one (music and calls) option for those always on-the-go that need their music fix. Part of the Halo Fusions functionality is to bridge the gap between music listening and actual voice calls. Utilising the control button on the neck band will allow you to connect to your call through Bluetooth.A package that weighs 21grams, in the neckband and earbuds combo, itll keep on going for 6.5 hours before needing a recharge. Jabra lists the standby time at 19 days and allows you to pair up to 8 devices, while simultaneously being connected to 2 devices at any one time  e.g. Bluetooth-equip audio player and your work phone.Fashioned for the go-getter that settles for nothing, the Eclipse is the lightest of the bunch and despite its nimbleness, it doesnt compromise on sound quality, design or comfort. This smaller earbud uses EarGels to keep the device snug in your earlobes but being so light, there will be times that youve forgotten you have them in.Fitting the same HD sound quality and active noise cancelling in the Eclipse, sacrifices some space and subsequently, Jabra has omitted any buttons on the sleek alternative. Interactions instead come by double tapping the headset, allowing you to make a call  further functionality options can be sought on the Jabra Assist app, allowing you to see the full options of settings there.Carrying around the Eclipse wont be a burden either, as the carrying case doesnt just serve to store it; doubling as a portable charger as well. Itll give you 7 hours of charge but keep in mind youll probably keep it with you since the headset only gives you 3 hours of talk-time.Saving the most active earbuds for last, the Sport Pace Wireless was envisioned for the pace setters who enjoy having their tunes with them while hitting a sweat-filled route. Once youve gotten your set, youll find a booklet inside that will give you access to the Jabra Sport Life app, a fitness coach of sorts, spurring you on while you exercise. Embracing your workouts will be easier and the app will provide training statistics to keep you motivated.Studies have proven that our moods are heightened or lowered depending on whats playing in our ears, thus a good playlist paired with these wireless earphones should set you on the right track. Rapid charge is enabled and within 15 minutes, youll get back 5 hours of music playback.Deckedout with an IP54 rating (the same on the STEEL) and passing US military standards, it will stand up against harsh winds, rain, sweat or impacts. Managing a 21.6gram weight, this is the heaviest of the four but with all its internals, thats pretty much expected.These are the retail prices of the four devices:You can find all these devices at ALL IT, Harvey Norman, Machines and Viewnet Computer Systems."

The Samsung Galaxy View which was teased earlier on is a gigantic 18.4 tablet that runs on Android. This isnt your typical Android tablet and it even comes a kickstand at the back. According to Samsung, this opens up new ways of consuming mobile video and entertainment. And possibly they are trying to create a cross product between a TV and a tablet. The display does Full HD resolution in 16:9 aspect ratio, which gives it a rather low 119ppi (pixels per inch). Since it is focused as a video consumption device, it also gets a pair of stereo speakers and underneath it runs on a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM. On-board it gets either 32GB or 64GB of storage with the option to add more via a microSD slot.For video conference purposes, it has a 2.1MP front facing camera and if you need to use it while on the go, it has a 5,700mAh battery thats rated to last 8 hours of video playback. Theres also Bluetooth 4.1, WiFi 802.11ac and a NanoSIM slot (LTE Version) for your connectivity needs. While it is considered a portable Android device, the Galaxy View is quite a heft at 2.65kg and overall it is 11.9mm thick. The kickstand doesnt seem to be foldable but Samsung still claims that it is versatile for either a stand mode or typing mode, when placed lying down. The Galaxy View runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop but the interface is said to be a video-centric one that primarily showcases video content. If we can sum this up, this is basically a tablet+TV hybrid. This isnt the first time were seeing such products as Acer too has a similar device with the Aspire Z3-700. That was basically an all-in-one computer that can could be used as a tablet.

But will this trio be enough to revitalise the ailing Japanese mobile division of this multinational conglomerate?Struggling to find their footing domestically and internationally, the brand has lacked some ingenuity in its design portfolio for quite some time  both in hardware and software.

The former is capable of a 0.3 second autofocus time and has an f/2.0 aperture G lens.Dont forget this is the same sensor found on all three and includes (claimed) advancements in low-light situations, 5x clear image (digital) zoom and Sonys advanced processing software. If youre into the pixel game, theres also 4K video recording on board.The Compact also is the only one to have a single SIM set up, andit gets a smaller 2700 mAh battery. But like its siblings, it will run the same Android 5.1 Lollipop OS out of the box.Sonys Xperia Z5 Dual fits the middle-child stereotype but it isnt easily forgotten. Boasting a 5.2-inch FHD display (1920 x 1080), were kind of surprised thatSony didnt up the ante by making it a QHD screen, but oh well. Similarly, itll get the same Snapdragon 810 SoC, 32GBs of internal storage and the same glorified camera modules, but is equipped with 3GB of RAM and a larger 2,900 mAh battery instead. The smartphone gets a dual-SIM LTE slot, bettering the single slot on its little brother as well.The most premium, coincidentally dubbed the Xperia Z5 Premium Dual is the first smartphone to carry a 4K (3840 x 2160) 5.5-inch screen; that accounts for 806 pixels per inch. Naturally, since it is able to display 4K, the aforementioned 23-megapixel camera will do it justice by allowing 4K video recording for you to test out the crazy screen.Its not too differentinternally to the Xperia Z5 Dual, with the only difference being the larger 3,430 mAh battery, theres nothing much else that sets it apart. Notably, all three devices have an in-built fingerprint sensor, placed neatly out of the way on the side of the device  brushing your finger pass the sensor instantly unlocks your device, giving you bio-metric security as an option.The three devices will be available for purchase in these colour options:Xperia Z5 Compact  Graphite Black, White, Yellow and Coral (RM 2,299)
Xperia Z5 Dual  Graphite Black, White, Gold and Green (RM 2,699)
Xperia Z5 Premium Dual  Chrome, Black and Gold (Pricing will only be announced in November)For the time being and in limited quantities, Sony will be throwing some freebies together with the 3 devices today from the 31st of October till 22nd of November:Spectre official t-shirt (RM 109)
Spectre bottle opener (RM 59)
Landscape lay flat hardcover photobook (RM 259)Youll be able to pick up any memberthe two smaller devicesof the Xperia Z5 line at authorised Sony retailers nationwide from today the 31st of October, while the Xperia Z5 Premium Dual will only be available November onwards (no specification as to what date).

In spite of setting itself differently when aesthetics are concerned, itll receive some much needed performance upgrades as well.At 5-inches, it rocks a 960 x 540 resolution screen, and runs a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor. Carrying (just) 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, itll probably be the most expensive smartphone with that lowly amount of RAM. If your internal storage runs out, there will be a microSD slot to save the day.Also available on the Neo 7 is LTE support, as both SIM slots give you up to 4G speeds. Anyone who loves photos but doesnt have the matching cash to dish out will be relatively satisfied with the 8-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera and LED flash module. Once you move over to the front, youll see the 5-megapixel shutter that it uses  the screen doubles as a flash-like light source, similar to the iPhone 6s.The Neo 7 weighs just 141grams and has a 2420 mAh battery underneath its exterior, while its operating system is a self-made ColorOS (version 2.1) that is laid over Android 5.1 Lollipop. Running you back RM 798, itll hit store shelves on the 3rd of November and come in two colours  White or Black.[ SOURCE ]"

Oddly, the OnePlus X looks to be a OnePlus One on the inside, just taking a hit in battery and screen size, while adding some notable features and aesthetics. Unfortunately, Shenzhens finest have decided to deploy the same notorious invite system but theres an improvement.The X runs their home-grown Oxygen OS based on Android 5.1.1 and there are two materials that differentiate the pair; Onyx and Ceramic. Making the device smaller, this time 5-inches, it carries an AMOLED display with a FHD resolution and has Gorilla Glass 3 plastered on top for protection.Repeating the usage of the Snapdragon 801 on their latest device, itll see only 32-bit processing, something that was acceptable on the OnePlus One but causes some concern looking at the latest crop of devices popping up. Continuing the trend, it has the same amount of RAM too, 3GB; which in this day and age, still holds up fine, though theres only 16GB of expandable internal storage. In the past none of their models had a microSD slot, so this might mean that OnePlus could include expandability in the future devices.Changing it up this time around, theyve added a hybrid dual-SIM functionality, that gives you networks up to 4G LTE but keep in mind youll have to do without one SIM slot for your expandable storage. Its rear camera lens is a 13-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 aperture sensor, while the front gets an 8-megapixel selfie shooter. All the power is provided by a 2,525 mAh battery and theres the same three tier alert slider found on the higher-end OnePlus Two.The Onyx version retails for US$ 250 (RM 1,076) and the Ceramic version goes for around US$ 400 (RM 1,721). Only the former is sold in the States but otherwise they retail in the same countries worldwide. Sales will start in India on November 5th using the invite system but only for a month, after which itll be available for purchase without strings attached  this strategy will be mimicked across all continents. No word when the device will hit Malaysian shores but it has already been spotted on SIRIM, so you can anticipate it to arrive by years end.We dont think the Flagship Killer 2016 was a killer at all, the company which at first was painstakingly trying to keep up with demands of some 2 million reservations, may have left customers waiting too long; they probably opted for other devices by now, seeing a sudden surge of flash sales and our own Maxis selling the device outright without an invitation needed. Can OnePlus last long enough to put out their version of the 2017 Flagship Killer?[ SOURCE, 2 ]"
Alexander Wong,Paying too much for broadband? A new disruptor wants to offer 100Mbps below RM70/month,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/30/can-myrepublic-offer-cheaper-100mbps-broadband-in-malaysia/,"100Mbps Broadband,Broadband,FTTH,High Speed Broadband,HSBB,michael lai,MyRepublic,MyRepublic Malaysia,Unifi","Industry in General,Players on the Field",2015-10-30,"The cost of broadband has always been a hot topic among Malaysians. Even with TMs new Unifi plans that offer faster speeds for less, many had frown upon the removal of its cheaper 5Mbps option at RM149/month. For those with the need for speed, it can get ridiculously expensive. Maxis offers 100Mbps broadband for a colossal RM398/month. Alternatively, TIME is also offering 100Mbps at a cheaper RM179/month but it comes with a 100GB cap. Is there a way for Malaysians to get faster speeds at lower prices? A Singaporean broadband company wants to make it possible when it comes to Malaysia. MyRepublic thats based in Singapore has caused quite a stir by offering 1Gbps of fibre internet for as low as S$49/month (about RM150) during its debut. It was a deal you cant refuse as the other players were charging as high as S$395/month (about RM1215) for the same speed. It didnt take too long before the existing incumbents started slashing prices to match MyRepublics offering. Even today, MyRepublic is offering 2x 1Gbps connections for home users at only S$59.99 (about RM185) per month. On top of that, they are also coming up as the 4th mobile telco in Singapore, with unlimited high speed quota. Apart from Singapore, they are also in New Zealand offering as high as 1Gbps at NZ$89.99/month (about RM261). As reported by DigitalNewsAsia, MyRepublic is planning to enter Malaysia with the ambition to offer 100Mbps connectivity for around RM60-RM70 a month. Its CEO Malcolm Rodrigues wants to be very disruptive in the market and they are eager to take up the disruptor role in our local scene. The timing however depends on our regulatory environment, and they are looking forward for TM to open up its network access by 2016. At the moment, other fibre broadband players such as Maxis and P1 are tapping onto the same HSBB network as TM but they are basically wholesale deals which isnt ideal for MyRepublic. In their expansion into Malaysia and other markets, they had hired Michael Lai, who is the former CEO of P1 and TM Net. Can MyRepublic disrupt our local broadband scene? 100Mbps at RM60/month sounds insane especially when TM charges double for a mere 1Mbps ADSL service. If Maxis could deliver 10Mbps from as low as RM118/month, undercutting TMs UniFi service on the same network, it wont be surprising. Like most new ventures, they could offer broadband below cost just to rake the numbers in. For example When telco 3 entered Australia, they had offered loads of free calls, heavily subsidised device offers and lower barrier to entry even for foreign subscribers in order to pull the masses onto their fold. Can MyRepublic make a difference in Malaysia? Let us know what do you think in the comments below.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Though, the lesser-known manufacturer has its own niche which it occupies; large battery capacities  at least evident on their P5000 (5350 mAh) and P8000 (4,200 mAh) models. But what does the Vowney bring to the table? If the title didnt catch your attention, the rest just might.TheVowney (an odd name choice) has a 5.5-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) display, while a 64-bit 2.2GHz MediaTek Helio X10 is behind the smartphones brains.

Among their successful launches, the latest would be the honor 7, in London and the Nexus 6P in a partnership with Google. Can they break the stigma associated with Chinese manufacturers? Backed bythe Huawei Mate S, they just might.Targeting a new market, as compared to its predecessor, it was launched at IFA 2015with Force Touch, we wont be getting that 128GB model but nonetheless, the Mate S is no one trick pony. It boasts a 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) AMOLED display and a familiar combination makes its way underneath the metal-only outer layer of the device; a Kirin 935 Octa-core processor, mated to 3GB of RAM. There will also be 64GB of internal memory, while its expandable through the hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slots (up-to 128GB).Its photographs are taken by a 13-megapixel RGBW rear camera equip with OIS and dual-LED flash; the front however gets an 8-megapixel shutter with an f/2.4 aperture and a single LED flash. Huaweis signature rear fingerprint scanner is included here too for an alternative option for biometric security.In terms of software, Knuckle Sense gets an update, now version 2.0 and as per usual, allows you to interact differently through your knuckles in the form of double-tapping or drawing symbols. Youll also notice EMUI 3.1 skinned over Android 5.1 Lollipop on the device.A 2,700 mAh battery fits inside the 156gram smartphone and will be available in two colour options, Prestige Gold and Coral Pink. The Mate S makes a big price jump as the newest edition to the Mate lineup; retracing back tothe launch price of the Ascend Mate 7, it went for RM 1,999 during its launch. But, for the price you pay, Huawei wants to make it worth your money by adding these perks:And depending how early you decide to buy the device, the more youll get in return.Lestwe forget, youll have to fork out RM 2,698 (w/ GST) for the Mate S, so be warned and make sure you have enough money in the bank. Having felt the device in our first impressions, we can say that the chamfered edges with 2.5D glass and metal build might be just enough make you favour the Mate S.Utilising the classic, oh by the way we have another (two) product(s)to show you technique, Huawei also launched the G8 today, a good-looking mid-ranger that just supplements the theory of the manufacturer playing the premium game; along with their new flagship tablet, the MediaPad M2 8.0.The former is a also a 5.5-incher with a FHD display (1920 x 1080) and has the same 2.5D glass edged glass but has a slightly less metal make at 90% composition. Fittingly as a mid-ranger, it has a 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, coupled with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage (expandable).For imaging, the G8 gets a 28mm wide-angle 13-megapixel sensor on the rear and a 5-megapixel lens on the front. Akin to the Mate S, the more affordableG8 also has ahybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot but has a larger 3,000 mAh battery. Mirroring its big brother, it also has EMUI 3.1 on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop for its operating system.Onto the largest of the trio, the Huawei MediaPad M2 8.0, that as the name suggests, has an 8-inch screen with the same FHD resolution (1920 x 1080). Under the hood, it houses a 64-bit Octa-core 2GHz Kirin 930 chipsetand for multitasking and app switching, theres 2GB of RAM.As a tablet, the readily available 32GB might be a stretch but at least theres a microSD slot for expandability. An 8-inch device being used to take photos might be a sight for sore eyes but if you really need to, theres an 8-megapixel rear camera; used more practically for video calling a 2-megapixel sensor will be on the front.Touted to amplify your excitement the tablet will offer a seamless audio experience, thanks to its side-facing dual speaker set-up. Utilising Clari-Fi technology and Super Wide Sound 2.0 by Harman Kardon, the brand promises to immerse you with 180-degree surround sound.Wrapping up, the tablet will have 4,800 mAh of battery to keep the 310gram device running and itll also have a single 4G LTE slot for cellular connectivity. The G8 and MediaPad M2 8.0 both retail for RM 1,499 (w/ GST) and are available in these colour options: Grey or Silver  G8 and Gold  MediaPad M2 8.0.The two smartphones willbe available from today onwards, and be sold across all Huawei stores nationwide but youll have to wait till late November to get your hands on the tablet.

Alexander Wong,Huawei Mate S: Can Huawei play the premium game?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/27/huawei-mate-s-malaysia-hands-on-first-impressions/,"Android,Dual Sim,first impressions,huawei,Huawei Mate S,Huawei Mate S First Impressions,Huawei Mate S Hands-on,Huawei Mate S Malaysia","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-27,"Huawei is certainly a brand to watch out for as they are rising to the occasion with some compelling smart phones these days. On the Huawei P8, they had elevated their build quality perceptions with a premium unibody metal design, but it isnt as refined as its mainstream rivals. Perception isnt built overnight but more consumers are beginning to accept the new wave of alternatives coming from China.To show the world what they are capable of, Huawei had recently announced the Mate S, a premium device that eyes for the likes of the Galaxy Note 5 and the iPhone 6S Plus. Can they deliver? Read on to find out.At first glance, it looks like a bigger honor 7 with a full metal back that comes with a subtle curve. Upon picking it up, youll notice the finer details and the silky smooth surfaces that are nice to touch. Their previous P8 flagship was solid in the hands but the Mate S adds more refinement to the mix. At 7.2mm thin, it is slightly thicker than an iPhone 6s at the thickest point, but the sloping back gives a thinner feeling device at your fingertips. Looking towards the bottom, it shares the similar design as the Huawei P8 and the honor 7, with twin speaker/mic grills on each side of the micro USB port. On the left, youll find a dual-SIM tray slot, which is a hybrid one that accepts microSD.The volume buttons and power button are neatly placed on the right for easy reach but we felt that the power button could be larger for the perfect feel. The 5.5 Full HD screen dominates the front with minimal clutter as it uses on-screen buttons for navigation. During its global launch, the Mate S was Huaweis first smart phone to feature a Force Touch display thats pressure sensitive but it isnt present in our current unit. That apparently it reserved for its higher-spec model that comes with 128GB of storage.Underneath, the Huawei Mate S shares a lot of similarities with the honor 7. It runs on a high-end Kirin 935 Octa-Core 64-bit processor (2.2GHz x4, 1.5GHz x4) thats mated to 3GB of RAM. On-board the mate S comes with 64GB of storage for Malaysia and it is expandable up to 128GB using microSD. With EMUI 3.1 that runs on top of Android 5.1.1, it runs rather smoothly without any hesitation so far.For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP camera with a 4-colour RGBW sensor thats assisted by dual-LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation. Similar to the P8, it gets a variety of modes including Light Painting features. The Mate S gets a new Professional Mode that offers full manual settings for extra tweaks on ISO, Manual Focus, Exposure and AWB.For taking selfies, the front gets a 8MP camera that even comes with a soft flash light for brighter looking selfies. Despite being a 2015 flagship, the main camera doesnt support 4K videos, shooting a maximum of up to Full HD 1080p.The single down facing speaker is quite loud but the biggest feature for audio has got to be its recording capabilities. The Mate S has 3 mics in total which can be used simultaneously to record a meeting conversation with individual attendee tagging, similar to the Galaxy Note 4. In the battery department, it packs a 2,700mAh capacity unit which is slightly more than the P8 by a slight margin.Unlocking the Mate S is rather quick with its rear mounted fingerprint scanner. It unlocks instantly with a touch and it does more than just securing the device. Similar to the honor 7, you can swipe downwards to view notification. On top of that, it performs double duty as a touch pad scroller in the image gallery as well as a remote trigger when taking pictures using both main and selfie cameras.Despite not having a pressure sensitive display, the Mate S still gets a decent amount of gesture features. Apart from the usual tap to wake, it has an improve Knuckle Sense technology that lets you screen capture or crop using your knuckles. Huawei has improved it further with a quick app launch feature where you can draw a c using your knuckle to launch the camera or e to open a browser.At RM2,698, the Huawei Mate S is also the most expensive smart phone and it goes neck to neck with the Galaxy Note5 thats priced at RM2,699. For a quick comparison, the Mate S has the upper hand with double the storage at 64GB along with the option to add more with a microSD slot. However the Note5 offers more in specs including a faster processor, more RAM, faster camera and also a productive S Pen. If performance and productivity is what youre looking for, it is tough to recommend the Mate S over the Galaxy Note5. The decision is even tougher considering the similar speced albeit the smaller screen honor 7 can be have for just RM1,399. However if youre looking for a stylish and premium alternative that isnt a Samsung or an Apple, the Mate S could be something worth checking out."

Doc Brown for one would surelyreserve a Great Scott! for moments like these. The makers said that in light of the increasing demands in the mid-range segments, HTC is bringing on its renowned One series. Does it make the cut, a full 4 quarters later?Its been 10 months since we saw the One M8 EYE on SIRIMs listing, leading us to believe it wouldve been launched in timely fashion but we guess 10 months was short enough for the smartphone manufacturer. Essentially, the same metal-clad flagship (One M8) but receiving some changes in the camera department on the rear. So that removes the infamous Ultrapixel Duo Camera on the back, replacing the mediocre main camera with a 13-megapixel lens. The front is maintained at a 5-megapixel lens.Everything else about the device is the same. To recap, the device is a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display, it runs a 2.3GHz Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, and is coupled with 2GB of RAM. There is also just 16GB of internal storage but thats easily mediated with the available microSD slot. Offering one of the most distinctive audio experiences, the typical HTC BoomSound speakers are present here too.Although a latecomer, it still has 4G LTE available in the form of a nano SIM slot and runs Sense 6 on top of Android 5.0. It also comes with a 2,600 mAh battery to keep it running. Priced at RM 1,399 (w/ GST) it could possibly still give other devices a run for the money; but then again, its a year old. If youd like to pick it up, head over to a major retailer to take a closer look at the Gunmetal Grey version.Would you bother?"

According to the official invite, the launch event will announce the product availability for four markets namely Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. To recap on the specs, the Redmi Note 2 is an affordable phablet that could be priced below its mainstream competitors. It features a 5.5 Full HD display, a MediaTek Octa-Core Helio X10 processor, 2GB of RAM and likely 16GB of storage for our local market. The Redmi Note 2 also comes with an expandable microSD slot, 13MP f/2.2 main camera with PDAF and a front facing 5MP selfie camera. On top of that, it supports faster 802.11ac WiFi and comes with an IR Blaster which can be a nifty remote control. Keeping the lights on is a removable 3,060mAh battery that supports quick charge. Out of the box, it runs on its latest MIUI 7 thats based on Android 5.0. Like most new devices today, it supports dual-SIM with 4G LTE. Dimension wise, it is 8.25mm thick and weighs 160g, which is more compact than the original Redmi Note. In China, the 16GB storage version with dual 4G LTE is priced at 899 CNY, which is about RM602. With the fluctuating currency exchange, Xiaomi might be pricing this higher but we have a hunch that it should be below RM700."

The Korean manufacturer hasbeen at the forefront of commercial OLED technology, incorporating them into their TVs, as of recently. Subsequently, Apple may lean towards another supplier/competitor (Samsung) if theyre considering to bring the same screens totheir bigger devices.Facing a tough pickle in the form of relying on one another, Apple and Samsung have never been too cosy; if you remember the tennis match of lawsuitsgoing across the two. But realistically, Apple needs Samsung (and vice versa) to produce their great devices. Hardware from one end gets used on the other, a win-win situation for both parties and the chip-gate issue might not cause a rift after all, if this source is true.Whats so great about OLEDs, compared to the rest? Well for one, LEDs and OLEDs both work by transmitting light but the latter is more efficient by operating as the sole lighting source, as well as providing the colour; LEDs only provide the white back light (if youve come across screen bleeding, this is why).Other than screen bleeding it gives other perks as well:There are always trade offs with innovation and you can read about the shortcomings of OLEDs here.OLEDs / AMOLEDs have seen a higher adaptation rate in todays market, and its clear that they provide a superior viewing experience. Apple could be easily testing their on devices with the better displays behind the curtain but dont think that theyd let the cat out of the bag so easily.
Would you hope on Apple hopping on OLEDs so soon? Let us know in the comments below.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA ]"

This cuts out Digis widest claim by 5% and will bring great news to all smartphone users on the Maxis network.In Q3 alone, Maxis allocated RM 359 million to increase its LTE coverage nationwide. Exceeding 55% of the current population of Malaysia, now allows them to hold the widest 4G LTE network title in the country. That accounts for 95% of coverage across key market centres and 60% in all state capitals.Serving their 9 million internet users, the telco is aware that as more people get on their data network, a higher need will surface to provide a faster and wider network for all. Adding 1.5 million 4G LTE customers in only a year, itll be a challenging task for them to keep up with the average 2.3GBs of data used per user.The telco is anticipating to spend roughly RM 1.2 billion to RM 1.3 billion on CAPEX for 2015, ensuring that they can mediate any high data traffic that will arrive with more customers.

In last weeks 2016 Budget announcement, all Malaysian prepaid users will be entitled for a rebate on GST. This will take effect starting 1st January until 31st December 2016. With this new development, all reloads will still be sold with the extra 6% until 31st of December. The new directive of charging GST upon usage, instead of reloads will only take effect starting 1st January 2016. As for the GST rebate for prepaid users, the mechanism isnt clear at this point. Were guessing each telco would issue a monthly statement which you can use to redeem your GST rebate. Hopefully the rebate back to your account balance would be an automated process. Just to refresh your memory, all local prepaid usage including calls, SMS and data are eligible for GST while offshore usage such as data roaming and international roaming calls are exempted from the 6% charge.

Theyve butt heads withSamsungbefore, in a long-drawn-out battle of ping pong, each taking turns to sueeach other. When the first leaks of the HTC One A9 came around, we too thought it was an iPhone clone but lets take a look closer at how Apple innovates; methods that havent settled well with their Taiwanese counterparts, causing one of HTCs regional chiefs to sharehis two cents on the subject.Jack Tong, President of the North Asia had this to say, after the One A9 press event:A worthy case made by Tong; youll see what we mean when you compare the backs of the HTC One M7 and the iPhone 6, which the former came into existence first. At the time of its instillation, the M7 was a device veered for its use of a metal unibody, to the extent that HTC keptthe design language three times over  M8 and M9.Similarities between the iPhone 6/6s (since they look the same) and the HTC One A9 may be uncanny but if you take a look at the (earlier released) HTC One M7 and M8 compared to the Apple iPhone 6, yeah its the same thing.iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus
HTC One M7 pictured on far leftHe then adds that:All this finger pointing as said earlier, isnt Apples first rodeo when considering the presence it has associated with pioneering in the tech industry  heck theyre even rumoured to be entering the automotive business. When you take a look at the how the Cupertino brand markets themselves, youll know that people tend to think that the iDevices were the first smartphone and tablet.What of the tablets that ran Windows XP, or near field communication (NFC) tech distinctive and finger print sensors native to Japan? Both of which lead the pack way before Apple decided to hitch a ride on the same train. We could go on about what came first but do they get the credit? We feel that limelight stealing in general will continue forever.A leaked photo has given HTC executives some powerful ammunition to hand down to their underlings:Whether the market reacts positively or otherwise, well have to wait but HTC is surely embracing all the free advertisement its getting. One thing we can be sure of is that the Taiwanese manufacturer will continue to stick to the design on the One A9; as quoted by Tong, itll eventually spill over to their top of the line M and Desire models.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA, IMAGE SOURCE, 2 ]"

Its secondary front-facing camera is a 5-megapixel shutter with beautification software built into the camera app.Providing the juice to all these components is a 3060mAh battery and it runs on MIUI 6 that is upgradable to MIUI 7, when they start the Global roll-out.

Some luxury cars readily include these digitals augmented reality displaysbut the cars themselves, cost a bomb. HUDWAY on the other hand, costs only US$ 49 (RM 211). To date, their Kickstarter has managed to collect US$ 230,000 pledges, exceeding their goal of US$ 100k and they still have 17 days of funding to go.In a convenient easy to use package, the accessory comes in 3 parts:In the first place, ideally wed prefer if youd stay away from your smartphones while driving but the accessorywould be a great deterrent to the whole situation. Placing your phone on the cradle, and usage of the HUDWAY app (iOS & Android), will enable you to see whats on your screen, merely flipped to mirror that actual image on the special reflective display.Currently, the makers have used the iPhone 6 Plus, as a benchmark for the size of phones, so anything bigger than that might have an issue fitting  bigger than 158 x 77mm, length and width respectively. The team plans to add these functionalities to the HUD display if they manage to hit their stretch goals:In Malaysia, our always sunny days might impair the clarity of the display (or rather your phones display reflected). So driving during the daytime while having the HUDWAY on your dashboard, you might not see everything clearly, but larger objects shouldnt be an issue. Another problematic issue would be your phone overheating due to direct sunlight from being on the dashboard; theyve put out frankly that this might be a problem and their accessory is passive, so there wont be any temperature sensors or cooling elements.Let us know what you think of the HUDWAY dashboard car accessory, is it worth it?[ SOURCE ]"

The gradual OTA roll-out will see it serve part of the 150 million users who own the same Mi devices that are currently supported on their open beta.The exact models that are capable of handling the OS will be announced only nearing to the launch but if you own any of the following, you should be safe:We say so because they were the devices that were allowed to beta test MIUI 7. The aforementioned skin will include new UI Themes, performance improvements, sleep wake-ups and even child mode. For an extensive look at the new operating system, head on over here for more.This custom ROM may awkwardly leave some models unchanged of their main Android version, so if you were running KitKat, your model might stay that way but some within the line-up might upgrade to Lollipop. An odd proposition for users whod prefer to upgrade the normal way but it seems that core MIUI features should reflect the MIUI 7 upgrade.Eager owners who cant wait a week can take their chances by trying this Chinese port of the MIUI 7 ROM, thats available to test on non-Xiaomi smartphones as well (proceed at caution, this is a port not an official release). Those whore on the list said previously, can still decide to test the waters on the official beta variant of the Global ROM here.Once the official release is out, youll be able to find the file here, thats if you cant wait for the OTA.[ SOURCE, VIA]"

It basically takes a moving picture which include seconds before and after a shot is being taken. Problem is, most of the time it capture moments of you lowering your iPhone which is natural for anyone to do when taking a normal picture. This minor annoyance has been fixed with the new iOS 9.1 which is rolling out now to current iOS 9 devices. From the changelog, the updated Live Photos should intelligently detect when the iPhone is being lifted or lowered, so it knows when to start/stop recording at the right time. It also brings a fresh batch of 150 Emojis for all your social and messaging needs. The iOS 9.1 update weighs about 313MB and you can download it over the air (OTA) via Settings > General > Software Update. It is recommended that you do this over WiFi to save on mobile data. Apart from the Live Photos fix and additional Emojis, the update also improves a couple of bug fixes that cover Music, Photos, Safari, Search, Calendar, Contacts and Mail. It also improves the performance for Multitasking and some issues of viewing zoomed content apparently has been sorted out. Going back to Live Photos, while it is interesting at first, it is quite gimmicky as you cant share those videos moving pictures to your friends. Furthermore it consumes double the storage space as it creates another MOV file weighing about 3MB each. Fortunately you can disable this at anytime by tapping the icon next to the HDR button, and we recommend you to do so especially if youre having a paltry 16GB version."
Arif Lee,Expect clearer voice calls on Digis upcoming VoLTE service,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/23/expect-clearer-voice-calls-on-digis-upcoming-volte-service/,"4g,DiGi,Digi 4G VoLTE,Long Term Evolution,lte,Malaysia,network,telecommunications,Voice over LTE,VoLTE","DiGi,Industry in General,LTE,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,Technologies",2015-10-23,"Paving the way to bigger things once theyve got their widest LTE network coverage news out of the way, Digi is again attempting to run away from the pack. Their latest venture in question is field-testing Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) on their 4G LTE network.
Boldly claiming to provide the widest 4G LTE coverage, capable of connecting every 1 in 2 Malaysians, Digi seeks to add more value to their services by adding VoLTE to their repertoire. Data speeds have forever been a topic of discussion amongst Malaysians, especially those who rely on their smartphones.But have we forgotten that phones were made for us to actually talk to each other? Well having said, there hasnt been a large emphasis on call quality, since the whole experience has been fairly satisfactory, albeit some drop calls every now and then. With VoLTEthese issues might soon be a thing of the past, resolving it by delivering voice calls over the 4G data network.Currently sedentary to be made over 2G and 3G networks, imagine having voice calls through 4G networks  will there be a difference, you ask? Ever been in an LRT and your coach is screaming away and you cant hear the person on the other end? Well in theory, VoLTE will transmit high fidelity audio and add noise cancellation features to your calls. That means a lot more talking/listening and a lot less shouting/closing one ear to hear clearly.VoLTE will also allow users to bridge the gap of internet use while active in a voice call; giving you 4G LTE speeds whilst in both uses. Presently, youd notice that your network switches from 4G to 2G/3G when making a call? Yup, thats the clear example. Another benefit would be faster connection to the other end, possibly 2-3 times faster to get you connected to the person youre calling.Digi implementation of testing is already happening behind the scenes and their subscribers can expect to make use of the better call quality on their 4G LTE enabled-smartphones next year. 2G and 3G voice calls are still enabled after the launch of VoLTE for whoever has a non-4G LTE device.Head on over here to take a look at how call quality is improved using different voice-over technologies.Drop us a comment below to tell us what youve experience while talking on your device, especially when it concerns call quality and dropped calls."

Associated mainly with affordability and decent specs, theyve steadily moved towards manufacturing premium handsets  seen on the Ascend Mate 7 and P8. Ahead of the official launch scheduled next week, Lowyat.NET has gotten an insight at how much and which model well be getting. So what makes the Huawei Mate S worth RM 2,698 (w/ GST)?The Mate S was marketedduring its launch to feature Force Touch on its 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display, but sadlywe arent getting that model locally (yet?). So what gives? Why the premium price tag that could almost have anyone easily pick up TWO 16GB honor 7s? More so when it looks almost identical despite some contrasting characteristics.Under all that premium metal sits a Kirin 935 Octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM and if those words ring a bell, youre right if you said that its the exact same combo found on the honor 7. The full line includes a 32GB and 128GB version but here well get the gap between, a 64GB model that supports a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE/microSD slot up to 128GB.Flipping the phone over, youll see a 13-megapixel RGBW rear camera with OIS and a dual-LED flash module. Move over on to the front and there will be an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor greeting you for all your selfie needs.Unique to only the P8 previously, Knuckle Sense makes a return, now updated to a 2.0 version. A feature that is able to tell the difference between your finger tips and your knuckles; handing you extra gestures by double-tapping or drawing letters to give access to app functionality.Juicing its engine is a 2,700 mAh battery that has quick charge on board. The Mate S also has a fingerprint scanner under the rear camera module if you prefer biometric security to the usual PIN/password settings. All packaged in an overall weight of 156g that runs Huaweis own EMUI 3.1 skin over Android 5.1 Lollipop. The device will be available in two colour options  Prestige Gold and Coral PinkTo be fair to Huawei, Apples crme de la crme iPhone 6s has also seen a huge price difference that increases every model, so maybe you cant put all the blame on the Chinese smartphone maker. Maybe its just the fact that once a brand is recognised for something, its hard to shake off and Huawei has always been relatively affordable.Moving with the times isnt a bad thing but theyve thrown in some extras to get you on the Mate S team. The list below details what youll get together with your new phone:If you jump onboard before the 3,000 mark, theyll even hand you a bespoke Pewter Membership Card from Royal Selangor; allowing you to be worry free and skip any line at any Huawei Exclusive Service Centres. Too busy to head over? You can also arrange for a delivery and pick-up option for your devices servicing. Those who want to join the party earlier, or first 1,000 to be precise, will get a complimentary Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) earphones by Huawei.Rounding up, the brand has added some great perks if you purchase the device early but is that enough to convince you? The Huawei Mate S at RM 2,698 makes the Galaxy Note5 a value-buy or does it? Let us know in the comments below.[ SOURCE ]"

It also states that there will be 3GB of RAM, together with 32GBs of internal memory; expandable up to 2TB (when the card exists) through microSD.Do note that the price has been changed to US$ 699On the rear theres an 18-megapixel Schneider-Kreuznach sensor with Phase Detection Auto Focus, dual-flash LEDs and also OIS. Theres apparently a 2-megapixel shutter up front as well but there was no mention on the website when it was live.A 3,410 mAh battery will power up the Android BlackBerry PRIV (sorry, it was so weird saying that) and they promise 22.5 hours of mixed usage but if you run out quickly theres fast charging features to save you. The PRIV, which stands for privacy/privilege will weigh in at 192grams and be 9.4mm thick.At RM 3,2002,966 (converted from USD), this could be one of the most expensive consumer Android devices out there  even surpassing the launch price of the BlackBerry Passport in Malaysia (RM 2,399). Will this redeem the Waterloo based company? Or will it make them continually struggle to hit revenue targets? Well, if they dont sell 5 millionunits of the PRIVs, John Chen might pull the plug on the ailing brand.[SOURCE,VIA  ]"

This came to light as Facebook Engineer Ari Grant has admitted a couple of battery related issues but he assures that a fix is on its way.There are 2 reasons why this is happening. The first issues is what he calls as a CPU Spin within their network code. Basically it is a repeated process in the background which uses more power than usual. The second problem is how the Facebook app handles audio playback. If you leave Facebook after watching a video, the audio is muted but the session is still active in the background. While it appears that nothing is happening, it continues to consume power in the background.Ari Grant had also assured that the battery issue is not caused by their optional Location history feature. For those who didnt enable this feature, Facebook isnt accessing your location in the background without your consent. The good news is that a new Facebook App update addressing these problems will be released later today. [ SOURCE ]"

This is a larger vehicle option that supports up to 6 passengers instead of the usual 4.In terms of pricing, it is cheaper than requesting two UberX rides. The base fare for UberXL is RM2.50 and youre charged both RM0.40/minute and RM0.75/KM for each trip. As comparison, the standard UberX charges RM1.50 for base fare, followed by RM0.30/minute and RM0.60/KM. Theres no mention of what vehicles are being used but it will definitely fit 6 passengers. UPDATE: UberXL vehicles include the Toyota Wish, Nissan Grand Livina and Perodua Alza.Using the fare estimator, it would cost around RM18-23 for a trip from MidValley to KLCC while a trip from Sunway Pyramid to KL Sentral costs approximately MYR23-30. For long distance trips, Uber charges a flat rate of RM110 to KLIA and RM160 to Genting Highlands. At time of writing, the option hasnt appeared on our app and it could be rolled out in stages. This is good for lunch with your colleagues or weekend family trips to the mall. Uber is available to download for Android, iOS and Windows Phone.

For starters, the Galaxy S7 is expected to use USB Type C, a reversible cable connector thats supposedly a future standard. Not only it allows faster rapid charge, it also provides faster data transfers even when compared to USB 3.0. New flagships like the OnePlus 2, Lumia 950/950XL and Nexus 5X/6P have already adopted this connector standard and we should be seeing more of these in 2016. The Huawei Mate S has it and so does the latest iPhone 6s. It was recently revealed that Samsung has patented a display tech thats similar to 3D Touch. This allows it to differentiate the amount of force being applied onto the screen, based on corresponding voltage. From the illustrations above, the feature allows multi purpose input such as alternating between space/tab and apply upper case when a key is pressed with extra force. It is possible that Samsung might introduce this on their future flagships, and it may or may not be the Galaxy S7. The Exynos 7420 processor on the Galaxy S6/Note5 is a proven workhorse, churning out insane benchmark figures yet maintaining frugal battery consumption. For next year, Samsung is rumoured to release the Galaxy S7 with up to 3 processor variants. The Exynos 7422 which was earlier rumoured for the Galaxy Note5 will is expected to power India based units while a newer Exynos 8890 (also known as the Exynos M1) will find its way to Korea, Japan and European markets. Given a pass for Samsungs 2015 flagships, Qualcomm appears to be making a come back with a Snapdragon 820 processor. The Snapdragon 820 variant is said to be fitted for China and US bound units. So far theres no mention of what were getting in the South East Asian region. For imaging, the 16MP shooter on the Galaxy Note5/S6 remains unchanged since the Galaxy Note 4. To bring its photography capabilities to the next level, Samsung could be upgrading to a higher 20MP camera that utilises Samsungs own ISOCELL sensor. Word also has it that it could carry a dual-camera set up, similar to the HTC One M9+.With the Apple iPhone 6s/6s Plus being announced in September, Samsung had brought forward its Galaxy Note5 launch to August, ahead of its traditional September IFA launch. This gave Samsung an early head start to build up its sales momentum before the iDevices go to market. For 2016, it appears that Samsung might announce the Galaxy S7 as early as January instead of its usual February/March timeline in conjunction with Mobile World Congress. Similar to its current Galaxy S6, there would be two models  SM-G930 and SM-G935 which carry a standard and a dual-curved display. January is just 3 months away. So if youre planning to get a new flagship smart phone, would you just grab the Galaxy Note5 or wait for the next big thing?[ SOURCE, 2, 3 ]"

Alexander Wong,HTC wants to beat the iPhone with a phone that looks like one,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/21/htc-one-a9-official-looks-like-an-iphone/,"Android,HTC,HTC One A9,HTC One A9 Launch,HTC One A9 Official,iPhone,Marshmallow,smart phone","Android,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-21,"HTC is in dire need of turning its fortunes around. With the HTC One M9 not living up to its expectations, their next device has got to be something incredible to make up for lost ground. Confirming our worst fears, the recently announced HTC One A9 isnt exactly the flagship that were looking for.Couple of days back, its CEO Cher Wang has mentioned that the One A9 is a good alternative to Apples new iPhone 6s. They have probably taken that too literally, as the design is almost identical especially from the back. Of course there are some design changes to avoid being too blatant like the Lenovo S90 Sisley. Meanwhile at the front, it has a hint of a Samsung Galaxy with smooth edges and a home button which also doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. In terms of specs, the front gets a 5 Full HD AMOLED display thats toughen with Gorilla Glass 4. The front looks cleaner and disappointingly it lacks HTCs trademark BoomSound front stereo speakers that we liked a lot. Instead it opts for a single down firing speaker thats similar to the iPhone 6s/Galaxy S6. Under the hood, it runs on Qualcomms newer 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 617 processor, with a choice of either 2GB RAM with 16GB storage, or a higher-spec 3GB RAM and 32GB storage version. If you need more, storage is still expandable with microSD up to 2TB. For imaging, the back camera is a 13MP f/2.0 unit thats assisted by Optical Image Stabilisation. It supports RAW shooting with one touch enhancement and theres also a hyperlapse feature to speed up or slow down your action videos. At the front, it still retains HTCs 4MP f/2.0 Ultrapixel unit for brighter selfies in low light conditions.Despite its shortfall on external speakers, the One A9 compensates by having a HiFi DAC built-in. This delivers 24-bit/192KHz Hi-Res Audio with Dolby Audio Surround technology for better enjoyment with some quality headphones plugged-in. On top of that, the One A9 runs on the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box and HTC pledges to update the software within 15 days after the Nexus lineup gets them. In typical HTC fashion, it gets a smaller than average battery at 2,150mAh that supports Quick Charge 2.0. On the spec sheet, it mentions that Quick Charge 3.0 will be compatible once it is available officially. Overall it weighs 143 grams and has a thickness of 7.26mm. Thats the same weight as the iPhone 6s but the iPhone is thinner at 7.1mm.The HTC One A9 will be available globally beginning 1st week of November and it is expected to be priced at US$400, which is about RM1,718 with our current exchange rates. Overall, this isnt a flagship to challenge the likes of the Galaxy S6 or the Xperia Z5. With a premium metal build and a mid-range hardware, the HTC One A9 is looking like Samsungs Galaxy A series that offers a premium build quality at a more affordable price range. Even the One A9 naming convention does seem to mimic the likes of the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A8. HTC is pushing this as a design centric smart phone and the One A9 gets a range of colourful options including Carbon Gray, Opal Silver, Deep Garnet and Topaz Gold.For half the asking price of the iPhone 6s, HTC might be up to something but you probably can get better devices like the Galaxy S6 that isnt much more expensive than its purported RM1,718 price range. Does the HTC One A9 appeal to you? Let us know in the comments below."

Nigel Newby-House, their head of product, talks about how the company intends to scale back on their custom UI, HTC Sense; bases that have been covered by Samsung on their TouchWiz skin, which now is a lot lighter than before.Itll be a nice change to see HTC change their inclination to focus more on their truly meaningful experiences on Sense  BlinkFeed, Zoe, and themes. Engineers will spend less time tinkering with menus and icons and instead be involved in ensuring that Googles Android updates are pushed out earlier than its competitors. Soon youll probably say goodbye to that repetitive email app that they put on their devices, everyone is hopeful that HTCs mission to make phones less frustrating actually comes to life.Not specific to just HTC, users who own OEM smartphones tend to be flustered by the same problem, since they know that the manufacturers will take longer than other makers to get an update out. Weve already seen some improvement from HTC, with their promise to deliver every Google software update within 15 days of the Nexus line, at least on the HTC One A9. U-turning on the Head of Americas tweet, who said it was an unrealistic for any smartphone maker to commit to.Obviously contextual, were not sure how vague every means and as pointed out by GSM Arena, theres bound to be a cut-off moment for support, as always.

A worthy companion for anyone that might need to rid their devices of incriminating data in a jiffy.Created by the researcher known as Dark Purple, this USB stick comes in the form of a regular USB thumb drive but in no way does it store bytes. This cyber weapon sends 220 volts through its USB interface to your plugged device shorting your whole circuit before you can say destroyed.The interface of the USB Killer can be switched to act as a malware stick but that removes the spy element from it, self-destructing would have more appeal for sure. Info from a blog post by the man himself, claimed that his creation could permanently impair almost any equipment as long as it had a USB slot  crippling newer TVs, routers, modems and the works.Little to no details have cropped up except for the aforementioned amount of voltage it sends through the USB circuit, or discharges the capacitor quickly. Fresh news crops up after its initial time of fame in March but theres now a video showing the device being used on the researchers own laptop.The Russian ends by saying that although it seems like the laptop he was using is now dead itll be brought back to life once a simple motherboard switch is made. So the likeliness of the hard drive being affected is slim at best; why bother then if it only disables the motherboard and not wiping data in the process?Nonetheless, itll still keep users cautious not to simply plug in randomUSB thumb drives lying around.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

A week ago, wed already seen the Moto X Play make its way onto our local electronic certification board; now its bigger brother, the Moto X Style does the same.Initially announced back during the end of July, these two hopefuls could attempt to disrupt the local market providing two sizes to appeal to different users. The two will be joined by the existing Moto G, that fills the most affordable range among the three.The flagship of the Moto line, is why were here today and by chance that you havent heard of its specifications, the Moto X Style/Pure is the largest at 5.7-inches. Its screen is a QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution IPS display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top. Under the hood, youll get a 1.8GHz Hexa-core Snapdragon 808, coupled with 3GB of RAM for all your processing needs. The manufacturers decision to stray away from the top of the line Qualcomm chipset would point to not wanting to have the burden of dealing with the heating issues that have plagued other smartphone makers.Although it has an option for a MicroSD card (up to 128GB), the base model has 16GB on board, while theres a 32GB and 64GB variant as well; no word on which well be receiving here. Its sad to see that manufacturers are still not realising that 16GB just doesnt cut it anymore on smartphones, a trend that has seen Apple stick with the base 16GB for its own iDevices.For your photo-taking needs, itll sport a wide-angle 21-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture thats capable of shooting in 4K resolution. Flip over to the front, youll see a 5-megapixel shutter with its own flash module. A worthy mention when considering its camera optics, which earned it a top 4 (based on points), sharing the spot with the LG G4  at least by DxOMarks standards.Connectivity-wise, theres Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, NFC and 4G LTE Cat6 for speeds up to 300Mbps. Those who want to have dual-SIM functionality might have to give the Style/Pure a pass, since it only supports a single nano SIM. The device is also rated at a certified IP52, meaning itll be water repellent.All of its internals will be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery that has Turbo Charging, which claims to get you 10 hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charging and itll run a Motorola enriched version of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.As a rough indication, the device retails for US$ 400 (RM 1,684)  16GB, US$ 450 (RM 1,895) 32GB and US$ 500 (RM 2,105) 64GB in the States. Brightstar will be the ones bringing this over, but noword on availability and pricing has come to light yet. Well keep you updated if theres any news on these devices.Thanks toEphemeral for pointing this out."

No longer will you have those last second moments to switch from the opposite end of lanes just to make it to where youre heading to.Accessing the lane guidance is similar to just using the turn-by-turn Navigation already present on the application. Type in your location and tap on the Navigation icon to get voice assisted directions with lane guidance. Do note that Google mentioned that itll cover MOST public roads but be prepared that it might not support wherever youre heading to, at least not yet.

The iPhone 6s will be available in Malaysia officially this Friday, 16th October at 12:00AM. If youre looking to buy one on contract, it is available from all 4 telcos namely Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. This is the fastest iPhone 6s roll out yet for Malaysia and it is also the most extensive in terms of contract options.With U Mobile coming into the picture, they have shaken things up a little with its lower commitment plans and an interesting Microcredit financing option. For Maxis, it still retains the same iValue Plan offering that comes with bundled calls, text and SMS. However for those who make lots of phone calls, they are also making its MaxisONE Plan available as well. Celcom on the other hand has the simplest approach with just 3 FIRST plan options that come with its OPTIMISER feature. Last but not least is Digi where they are bundling the iPhone 6s with their new SmartPlan that can be have with either more data or more voice and SMS. In terms of contract duration, majority of the plans are on 24 months with exception for Maxis and Digi where they do have 12 months option for selected plans. So which telco should you go for? Weve gathered the plans and device pricing from all 4 telcos for your easy reference. Check them out after the break.For consistency, we compared the permanent non-promo bundles from each plan with its pricing without the 6% GST. Do note that the above minimum cost of ownership is just a guide and it is based on the assumption that you dont incur additional usage on top of what has been included with the plan. On Maxis, they are giving 1GB extra for 6 months on its highest MaxisOne 188 plan. On top of that, they are also giving 4 months of additional 1GB for 4G LTE use only for the MaxisONE Plan as well. Digi on the other hand is giving 2GB of extra data for 12 months in conjunction with its current Smart Plan promo. Following closely behind is Celcom where they are giving 1GB extra of free data for 12 months. During sign up, most of these telcos would require an upfront payment, which is basically like a deposit that would be used to offset your upcoming bills. For U Mobile, they do offer a waiver for the advance payment but youll need to pay the device by credit card and sign up for their auto-debit billing feature. Before committing to a plan on contract, it is always recommended to pick one that suits your needs. The iPhone 6s is obviously cheaper on the highest plan and you might end up paying more than what you actually need. Apart from the calls, SMS and data offering, there are other things to consider such as network quality, customer service and other value added services including international roaming. For those who cant afford to pay so much upfront, U Mobile offers the flexibility with Microcredit which you can determine its duration and amount. However do note that this works like a personal loan and theres an interest of approximately 1.2%. As usual, if you spot any errors in the table above, do let us know in the comments above.Considering the iPhone is more expensive than before, getting one with a telco contract would garner more savings provided that you get the right plan. However for those who prefer to get it outright, an iPhone 6s is priced officially from RM3,199 for the base 16GB model. Below is the full iPhone pricelist in Malaysia right now:"

Although, not officially on the Play Store yet, the APK is from WhatsApp devs themselves, so there shouldnt be any issues with the update.So what do you need to do to get it running? Its not rocket science and anyone who wants to have this on their Android devices can just follow these steps.Step 1
Ensure that your device is set to allow installations from unknown sources
Head on over to your Settings > Security > turn on unknown sourcesStep 2
Head on to WhatsApps officialwebsite and download the APK file
Install the fileStep 3
Now you have the feature available but youve got to enable it manually
To do that, open your WhatsApp > the three vertical dots on your top right > Settings > Chat and calls > Chat backup > Back UpHere youll be able to choose whether you want to include your videos with that backup and how often youd like the backups to be done.A great feature for all Android users who have multiple smartphones, it gets the nod thanks to Google Drives APIs that gives permissions to developers, hence offering the ability to users for this backup option.If youre not too keen on getting the APK, youll have to wait until the official update comes to the Play Store, which quoting Google, will only roll out soon. Its about time this came to the Android half of things, considering iOS has had their iCloud backup for quite some time.[ SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,TM refreshes its broadband offering with new Unifi ADVANCE PLAN,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/15/tm-refreshes-its-broadband-offering-with-new-unifi-advance-plan/,"All new Unifi,HSBB,TM HSBB,TM Unifi,Unifi,UniFi ADVANCE PLAN,Unifi BIZ ADVANCE PLAN","Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-10-15,"Today marks a change at TM with a new website and refresh of its high speed broadband offering. Branding wise, the Unifi logo remains unchanged since its inception but its online presence has been revamped with a store-like design for easier online application. With calls for faster and cheaper broadband, TM has revised its broadband offering with its new Unifi ADVANCE PLAN which claims to pack the best value in the industry.For starters, the new Unifi home plans come in just 2 options  30Mbps and 50Mbps. This essentially is the same new plans weve seen before but with reduced subscription fees. The TM Unifi ADVANCE PLAN with 30Mbps is offered at RM179/month instead of RM199/month, and if you need 50Mbps, it can be yours for RM229/month (before GST).By default, you get HyppTV as standard which comes with HyppTV Aneka or HyppTV Varnam Pack for free. You also get a DECT Phone bundled in but calls are now charged separately at 20 sen/min to all local numbers including mobile. For those needing unlimited calls to fixed lines like its former VIP plans, you can opt for the Voice Pack that costs RM20/month. In terms of speed, the 30Mbps plan gives you 30Mbps download while uploads are at 5Mbps. For RM50/month extra, you get 50Mbps download with a faster uplink of 10Mbps. So if youre an existing VIP 10 customer enjoying 10Mbps for both download and upload, your next upgrade should be the ADVANCE PLAN with 50Mbps download and 10Mbps. Essentially youre getting 5x the download speed while the upload speed remains unchanged. TM insists that its Unifi packages are competitively priced against its competitors. With Maxis jumping onto the fibre broadband business, it had caused a stir with its cheaper 10Mbps offering from as low as RM128/month. When compared on the same speed of 30Mbps, Unifi appears to pack more value considering it includes HyppTV and you get a fixed line with the option for unlimited calls at RM20/month.For enterprise users, they have a similar offering with its Unifi BIZ ADVANCE PLAN. The base 30Mbps plan with Dynamic IP starts at RM259/month (Normal: RM299/month) and you have the option to upgrade to 50Mbps at RM50/month extra. Theres also Simple Voice Plus Plan for free fixed line calls at RM30/month and there are more add-ons for MS Office, POS systems and surveillance services. Like the Home plans, the 30Mbps offering comes with 5Mbps upload while the 50Mbps option gets 10Mbps upload. Strangely TM has removed its lower 5Mbps, 10Mbps and 20Mbps Unifi packages of old. While the new Unifi ADVANCE PLANS might offer higher speeds for less, it doesnt really address the concerns of affordable broadband. When we did a quick search, it seems that the 30Mbps/50Mbps plans have limited coverage areas and if youre not covered, it suggests that you take up Streamyx instead. Perhaps they should consider introducing a cheaper 5Mbps option without the extra bells and whistles instead.For more information, head over to the new Unifi page."

The waiting game has struck Malaysia ever since the first crazylinefor the iPhone 4. Madness ensued across all telcos whove never braved such mammoth crowds when they first started. But now Malaysians are utilising different means to get their hands on their much beloved Apple smartphones, and it doesnt always involve queuing up from daybreak.Its safe to say that all thetelcos have gradually firmed up their skills to handle the looming army that waits passionately for their iDevices. So what do these buyers brave when waiting in line? Well that all depends on where they are:Celcom has their Blue Cube setup at Sunway Pyramid, an outdoor area that could spell rain for those who choose that location. Foreseeing a rather wet occasion, Celcom has again raised some canopies to battle the chance of torrential downfall and to generally keep their customers comfy. Food and drinks were served here for those who wanted to get their hands on a Celcom iPhone.Frankly, we think it looks like a carnival.The kicker for Celcom, if youre lucky enough, one of the celebs present will pass you your device, theyll even deliver some of the sets to your houses themselves. The star studded list includes: Scha Alyahya, Amber Chia, Ella, Awal Ashari, Hani, Soo Wincci & Shaheizy Sam.Digi on the other hand choseto hold their launch at their SS2 branch, which means rain is likely to damper hopes of the people in queue as well. This year theyve enlisted help from some food trucks (for free meals) and gave out numbers (for those who queued), so they can linger around till 11:45 pm before heading back to the line. Thenight in SS2 is quite bustling so theres no shortage of things to keep you entertained while you wait.U Mobile takes advantage of their HQ in Berjaya Times Square, which makes it indoors (well kind of, under the huge cover of Time Squares front lobby) and safe from any weather conditions that might take place in ourunpredictable climate. Those who have a sweet tooth would certainly enjoythe Krispy Kreme doughnuts and coffee provided by the telco.Maxis always has theirs at KLCC, this time around the line starts outside the actual selling floor but drinks and finger food was provided to those in line, while there were more options once you headed inside. The (pre-order only) line here hasnt quite built up yet, possibly meaning that most of their customers opted for the delivery/pick up option.Heres a break down of all the telco plans compared for those who arent already in line.Now that were talked about how the wait for the devices were across all four telcos, lets talk about what Malaysians could be preferring to do instead. Scalpers get excited at the opportunity to jack prices up, if theres demand.Are Malaysians choosing to buy from these individuals instead? Or have they decided to head on over to Singapore to get their hands on an SG set? It boils down to if youre going to be disciplined enough to travel back to our neighbours down south for your warranty, if anything were to happen to your Apple product. For scalpers, its mainly down to luck, or if you purchase from places like Lazada, well hope that they fulfill their end of providing warranty coverage.Then you have those whod rather wait for the storm to end and get their devices hand-delivered to them while in their comforts of their homes. Youll get to choose from Maxis, Digi and U Mobile, so quite a wide array to choose from.So you tell us, have you ever been in these types of lines in the past?

Yet, information still seems to be up in the air, from anearlier rumour of a MediaTek chipset, to it apparently featuresa Snapdragon 801. In timely fashion, three certification organisations have given OnePlus the go-ahead; SIRIM, TENAA and the FCC.Aesthetically, were not quite sure how to feel about this design, as it looks a lot like the iPhones of old and the OPPO R1x. Rumours aside, the two sets of photos from TENAA and FCC lessen some doubts about what the device will look like.This report however states that the device will carry a 2,450 mAh battery instead of the 3,000 it was earlier thought to house, fueling speculation that this indeed is just a mid-range device. For its dimensions, itll apparently come in 140 x 69 x 6.9 mm form factor  at least based on TENAAs findings.Do note that the model listed is is labeled as the ONE E1001, compared to Malaysias listing of E1003; higher ending number probably means a higher spec model. So theres a chance that its internals might be different from our local set. Otherwise, youll find the same notification slider that theyve added on the OnePlus 2.Will this mid-ranger help OnePlus recoup some of their fans, who feel that the company hasnt kept up with demands? Well have to wait and see.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

What is a broadband company like TM doing ahead of probably the most anticipated phone launches of the year?Without saying much, the Apple-like tweet continues with The smartphone unlike any other needs a broadband unlike any other. Could it be a new mobile service? Although there are plans to roll out full fledged mobile 4G LTE service in the near future, its probably not since it mentions broadband.What we do know is that TM has been experimenting with new broadband packages as of late and that could be a start for something bigger.

Dubbed the X from the Shenzhen based manufacturer, Carl Pei stated that this new smartphone would be the companys take on a beautifully designed device, rather than its usual Flagship Killer tune. But from the photos weve seen, its safe to say that Mr Pei is slowly veering into the realm of delusion.Those who love/hate the brand have come accustomed to the co-founders antics  e.g. Samsung internship. Sharing his thoughts on the holiday-season ready OnePlus X during an interview with USA Today, Pei said that it was tough choosing between the OnePlus 2 and this new device. Seems like he liked how the old iPhones used to look.Rounded on the top and bottom, the OnePlus X looks almost identical to an iPhone 5 or an OPPO R1x. Supporting documents to the FCC show that the unreleased smartphone will run a 1.9GHz processor, at least on the E1005 variant. It also adds to SIRIMs details that itll have LTE on board and the photos imply that itll use a USB Type-C connector.Rumoured reports have gone to state that itll retail for only US$ 250 (RM 1,035) and have a MediaTek Helio X10 processor under the hood, along with 2GB of LD-DDR3 RAM for performance related-task. Considered a mid-ranger of sorts, itll apparently sport a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and feature 32GB of internal storage that is expandable through a microSD card.Its purported to house at least 3,000 mAh of battery and have NFC capabilities. Otherwise, its camera is rumoured to be a 13-megapixel f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor that can get you up to 4K video recording and a 5-megapixel shutter rounds off the front.Has OnePlus run out of ideas?

Given their recent troubles, this will be amakeor break device(s) for Japanese company; with theZ5 line has the potential of being their saving grace. The three devices are slated to make an official appearance in Malaysia on the 29th October during this special invite-only event (you can sign up here). Ifyoure lucky enough to score yourself these exclusive invites, youll be in store for some lucky draws, giveaways and door gifts.Seen on SIRIM (Xperia Z5 Compact) earlier last week, itll be great to see how 4K will be illustrated in the form of the Xperia Z5 Premium. Also, all three will make use of Sonys latest 23-megapixel sensor that won it the best smartphone camera by DxOMark, hopefully giving the other camera-ready flagships a run for their money in real-life situations.Sony smartphone camera sensors have always been top class, as seen on other notable flagships but the Japanese company seems to lag behind in the image processing department. The smallest of the Xperia bunch, the Z5 Compact will only command 4.6-inches of screen-estate in the form of a 720p (1280 x 720) resolution. While its internals utilise the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor found on its bigger brothers, it only has 2GB of RAM.For your storage theres 32GB internally but youll get a microSD slot to expand up to 200GB if you want to. As mentioned earlier, itll comeequipped with the same camera sensors as its bigger siblings; 23-megapixels on the rear and 5-megapixels on the front. As the smallest of the three, it shows itself in fourplayful colours; Graphite Black, White, Yellow and Coral.The middle-child, the Xperia Z5 sports a larger and denser 5.2-inch FHD display (1920 x 1080). Similarly, itll have the 810 SoC, 32GB of internal storage and feature the same camera setup but come with 3GB of RAM and a 2,900 mAh battery instead.Saving the best for last, the Xperia Z5 Premium will include the first-ever 4K (2840 x 2160) 5.5-inch screen  if you did the math, thats about 806 ppi. A screen of such caliber has to have a camera capable of matching the output, so the aforementioned 23-megapixel 1 / 2.3-inch Exmor RS Sensor with a f/2.0 lens is capable of shooting 4K.UPDATE: Sony Malaysia will be launching the Xperia Z5 Compact Dual, Xperia Z5 Dual and Xperia Z5 Premium Dual. Other than its larger 3,430 mAh capacity battery, theres not much that sets it apart from the Xperia Z5. All three support LTE networks and could arrive in a dual-SIM variant on our shores but if youre relying on SIRIM, the Compact model listed only shows the singular SIM. However, the two larger devices arent shown, so maybe they might be dual-SIM capable.If youd like to find out more about the Xperia Z5 Compact and Z5 click here, for the Z5 Premium make your way here.[ SOURCE ]"

Words from Digis CEO, Albern Murty saysthat Digi has expanded their 4G LTE coverage to reach 28 major cities and secondary towns nationwide.Their 4G networks are now able to support the 1800MHz and 2600MHz base bands. Obviously more spectrum bands allow wider coverage and itll help both indoors and outdoors too.So far in the past 3 years, the yellow themed telco company has spent RM 2.3 billion in CAPEX (capital expenditures), with the funds mainly going to its networks.

Again toying with the notion of launching a smart phone, the new site reads A breakthrough device enhanced with Unifi with the claim of providing the best broadband experience for your device.Scrolling further down, the page emphasises on 3 things  unlimited experience, unmatched choices and unbeatable value. In terms of current Unifi broadband, we are still getting unlimited quotas and this is expected to remain unchanged for the time being. As for choices, weve seen TM introducing more HyppTV channels and newer plans that offer faster download speeds for less. Is TM going to respond to the competition with even faster speeds and affordable subscription? We really hope to see that this coming Thursday. Whats interesting is the area of Mobility as shown above. TM has the spectrum to operate a 4G LTE telco but we feel it is too soon for them to go live at this point of time. Furthermore, the site has been consistently talking about broadband rather than a mobile network. Perhaps it is an extended internet services from its TMgo 4G LTE broadband or its newly acquired P1 subsidiary that runs on WiMAX. At the bottom of the page, TM invites you to register your interest on whatever they are going to launch and youll stand a chance to win a smart phone. No smart phone models were mentioned but since TM is announcing this closely to the iPhone 6s, they better be giving that away after all that teasing.

In short, dont expect them to be any different from what weve seen from Digi.As seen earlier, the full pricing is similar to Digi with the iPhone 6s priced from RM3,199 for the 16GB model while the iPhone 6s Plus going from RM3,699 for the same capacity. Below is the full pricelist for the entire range available right now:While it is listed on the Apple Store, it isnt available for orders just yet. Our guess is to try checking them out next week closer to launch but you would probably need a wait a bit longer for delivery. So RM3,199 for a 16GB iPhone 6s, is this the flagship worth paying for? For long term practicality especially if you take photos and videos a lot, which we think you would, we strongly recommend that you go for at least 64GB.  Alternatively you could consider taking one up subsidised on contract with a plan that suits your needs. Both Digi and Maxis have revealed their plans and you can pre-order with them now. The iPhone 6s will be available officially in Malaysia next Friday, 16th October. [ SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,U Mobile offers more data and financial flexibility to own the iPhone 6s in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/10/u-mobile-offers-more-data-and-financial-flexibility-to-own-the-iphone-6s-in-malaysia/,"Flexi U MicroCredit,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia,iPhone 6s U Mobile,U Microcredit,U Mobile,U Mobile iPhone 6s,U Mobile Micro Credit","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2015-10-10,"The big 3 telcos  Celcom, Digi and Maxis have revealed their iPhone 6s plans. If you take a glance at all 3, they are the same old postpaid contract approach where you fork out a hefty sum for both device and advance payment. For U Mobile, they are offering similar plans as before but it gets more generous quotas and greater flexibility to make owning an iPhone 6s easier. Could this be the best iPhone 6s deal in town? Read on to find out.For starters, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are offered with their iPlans, offering Voice, SMS and data all-in in either postpaid or prepaid. The lowest option is their i40 plan that comes with 1.5GB of data, 40 minutes of calls and 20 SMS to all networks for just RM40/month. If you commit RM20/month extra on i60, youll get 5GB of data, 60 minutes of calls and 30 SMS. For any excess usage, all calls are charged at 5 sen/30 seconds and 3 sen/SMS to all networksFor the hardcore users, the higher i90 (RM90/month) and i130 (RM130/month) plans both offer unlimited phone calls and they come with 7GB and 10GB of data respectively. This is probably the closest plan to their recent P70 Hero Postpaid offering. Overall, U Mobile appears to be the most generous with data among the 4 participating telcos. If you have an existing device, you can trade-up hassle free with U Mobile and they are accepting as high as RM1,900 for an iPhone 6 Plus. On top of that, all trade-ups to an iPhone 6s will enjoy extra savings with an additional RM100 rebate.  In terms of device, the subsidised iPhone 6s pricing on U Mobile are as follows (inclusive 6% GST):During sign up, theres an advance payment which is rebated back across 24 months. However this can be waived if you pay the device by credit card and sign up for auto debit billing facility. Theres also a 0% interest EPP scheme with participating credit cards. Another neat reason to sign up with U Mobile is its Contract Freedom promise. You may leave their network at anytime without penalty. However youll either lose the remaining rebates if youve paid advance payment and for those who didnt, will need to pay back the pro-rated subsidy of the device.  Previously U Mobile had introduced its very own MicroCredit facility which is basically a special financing for the device. This time they are offering the extra flexibility of the amount (RM1,000-RM3,500) as well as repayment duration (12, 24, 30 and 36 months) according to your preference. With MicroCredit, theres no deposit or credit card required but take note that they will charge you with an interest rate of 1.2%. Interested?

Is this the OnePlus X?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/09/oneplus-x-e1003-malaysia-certification/,"Android,Dual Sim,OnePlus,OnePlus E1003,OnePlus E1003 malaysia,OnePlus mini,OnePlus mini Malaysia,OnePlus X,OnePlus X Malaysia,SIRIM","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-10-09,"Taking some heat away from OnePlus inability to supply enough of their OnePlus 2, a new device has been spotted on the SIRIM database as E1003. This comes 2 months after Carl Pei was quoted on USA Today that he had a hard time choosing between the (possible) OnePlus X/mini and the OnePlus 2. OnePlus newest smartphone is apparently its take on a more aesthetically pleasing product, not its usual Flagship Killer motive.What we can confirm so far is that the new One E1003 will only support Wi-Fi bands from a/g/n omitting the best ac support out. At least itll support Dual-SIM LTE based on the certification listing, bringing some hope for the device.A previous report states that the OnePlus X/mini would launch sometime during the holiday season, echoing the sentiments of its co-founderand will retail for only US$ 250 (RM 1,035). While its price might draw conclusions that itll less than worthy spec device, it surprises by supposedly running a MediaTek Helio X10 processor, coupled with 2GB of LP-DDR3 RAM.Its screen is reported to be a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and the storage appears to be 32GB internally, and itll have a microSD slot  a first for the OnePlus lineup. Tuned up with a polished 2.5D Gorilla Glass the edges will taper smoothly, hoping translating to better ergonomics.Somewhere under the hood, its purported that there will be at least 3,000/3,100 mAh powering the new smartphone. Straying a bit from the OnePlus 2, the Mini is claimed anonymously to carry NFC, an IR Blaster, front facing 1.2W loud speaker and the familiar USB Type-C that supports fast charge.Camera-wise it allegedly showcases a 13-megapixel f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor, supporting video up until 4K if youre into the whole pixel game. The front on the other hand, gets a 5-megapixel shutter. There also has been rumours that itll be IP67 dust and waterproof, yet itll still maintain the removable back with customisable finishes and textures.Do you think Maxis has delivered enough OnePlus 2s to be able to handle the ramped-up demand of this mid-ranger? Wed just caution everyone that the information above barring the SIRIM details are rumours, so dont jump the gun yet.By the way, our friends at the Skop are giving away a new OnePlus 2 with an Otterbox case, if youd like to find out more head on over here.Thanks to Felix for pointing this out."
Arif Lee,Half of iPhone 6s produced may have lower performance and theres nothing you can do about it,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/09/half-of-iphone-6s-produced-may-have-lower-performance-and-theres-nothing-you-can-do-about-it/,"apple,iOS,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Battery Life,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Processor,iPhone 6s variants,iPhone 6s versions,Samsung,TSMC","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-09,"iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s Plus with Geekbench results shown aboveA manufacturerwith high standards such as Apple would be assumed to be a company that it takes a lot to please but do 2%  3% of a gap make a difference? Well it surely does, if you look at the actual numbers. Immensely so, if you needed that extra battery mile to last through your long work day or on your expedition in some desolated area. Apple says the difference is negligible on the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus but well let you decide yourself.Basically, Apples iDevices vary in their processors by engaging two different vendors to supply their A9 chipset. On one hand, you have (their competitor) Samsung, while the other 50% is made by TSMC. The former has a 14nm FinFET process footprint, opposed to the latter  16.nm FinFET process. This allegiance is nothing new, as Apple has enlisted help for quite a number of years already.In real-world scenarios the 2-3% could set off alarms, depending how you use your new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. A Geekbench battery test was run comparing the two devices and the results are shown below:On the left is the Samsung processor. The right is the TSMC processor.Other than their battery scores, the two processors also performed differently on AnTuTus benchmark  TSMCs chip won overall. In the same test, it was also clear that their batteries levels differed; again, the TSMC processor had more battery left (77%), when compared to the Samsung powered iPhone 6s (71%). If you managed to do the math, thats a 6% disparity in numbers, which is double the 3% Apple noticed in their lab tests.Then again, once youve loaded up your apps and info, your device would run totally different compared to someone with the same chipset. So its possible that Apple was spot on with the 2-3% irregularity. Being quick to assess damage Apple has since made a statement addressed to the various publicationsthat brought this information to light.Theres nothing much you can do about it though, but if youd like to see if youve one-upped a friend/family member of yours, by all means use this iTunes approved Lirum Device Info Lite  System Monitorto identify if your iPhone 6s / Plus is using the better performing chipIf your device list these magic model numbers below then youre in luck:TSMC processor
iPhone 6s  N71MAP / iPhone 6s Plus  N66MAPbut if youre finding this model number instead, youre on the other end:Samsung processor
iPhone 6s  N71AP / iPhone 6s Plus  N66APThere may be a silver lining after all, cause any company should have an amazing reason choosing two sources for their internals. As far as supply and demand go, its tough when you need to go to a competitor like Samsung to get your chipsets, and relying on them is definitely pain. You could say that, biting the bullet and producing real-world results through its products on the shelves allows Apple to gauge if theres still worth in getting chips from Samsung.Can Malaysians nationwide do anything about this? Well itll be hard to make a case stating that their device is inferior, cause theres no way of telling the difference when actually buying the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus; unlike Android OEMs (e.g Samsung) that clearly tell you that this model is an Exynos processor, while the other is a Qualcomm chip.Apples statement was only directed at one publication but it doesnt take a lot to assume that they will continue to roll-out system updates that could make them more alike; whether that means making the Samsung chip in the iPhone 6s / Plus better than the TSMCs or vice versa, still remains unseen. Their power in controlling both their hardware and software internally gives them the ability to tweak and adjust to these issues highlighted.What do you make of this? Will Apples new iPhones suffer? Or will people just live with their new status symbol? Let us know your thoughts in the comment below.[ SOURCE, 1, 2 ]"

A year and a half later the CEO of Sony, Kazuo Hirai spoke to reporters saying that there has been constant restructuring in the smartphone department but if they fail to bring home the milk or at least self-sustain next year, they might have to scrap it all together.Change doesnt immediately equate to results but it points in the right direction, if youve been paying attention to the recently released Xperia Z5 line, its a glimmer of hope that could turnaround Sonys profits. A lesson from its Xperia Z3+ that received a lot of negativity, due to the bad choice of processor  the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 (at the time the heat issues werent mediated properly). Heres a look at how the Z5 Premium handles its heating.Sonys lineup has looked awfully familiar for quite a number of generations; begging the question, if theyll do away with their OmniBalance design. Rumours say that they might just do so in 2016  chances are itll coincide with the new Concept for Android that Sony has been testing in Sweden. Even with the aforementioned measures taken to decrease losses could not save Sony from expectedly posting a 60 billion yen / US$ 480 million (RM 1.97 billion) lost for this year. Exceeding the indicative figure of 39 billion yen / US$ 310 million (RM 1.27 billion) that was predicted. Not a great outlook for the Japanese company that ships only 1% of the smartphones in the States, while just captivating 17.5% of its own domestic market.Heres the statement from Hirai on the state of Xperias businessCan Sony make a U-turn? Wed like to see that happen, as the Xperias are a great offering and less competition is always a bad thing for consumers. Keep on keeping on, Sony, we hope for the best.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

If thats not enough, 3 more unique models will be heading our way which includes the epic ASUS Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition, Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Max.  This is the mother of all Zenfone 2s. The Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition is not only the fancier version of its top of the line Zenfone 2 with 4GB of RAM but it comes with a whopping 256GB of storage. In actual fact, the on-board storage is just 128GB but ASUS is throwing in additional 128GB extra with a bundled microSD card. The rest of the specs remain unchanged with a Intel Atom Z3580 Quad-Core processor mated to 4GB of RAM and it gets the similar 13MP+5MP camera combos, 3,000mAh battery and dual-SIM slots that support 4G LTE. From the recent ASUS media briefing, we are told that the Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition would be available in November.The elusive Zenfone Zoom that was announced earlier this year isnt scrapped just yet. Seen as the answer to other photography centric smart phones like the Galaxy K Zoom, the Zenfone Zoom offers a 3X Optical Zoom lens that surprisingly doesnt protrude. During its initial announcement, the camera has a 13MP sensor mated to 10 element lens which is assisted by OIS and dual-tone LED flash. In terms of hardware, it is said to feature a 5.5 Full HD display, 128GB of on-board storage, 4G LTE support and a 3,000mAh capacity battery. Since it is almost a year, ASUS is likely to make some tweaks to keep it up to date with the current smart phones.  Last but not least is the ASUS Zenfone Max thats entry level on specs but goes large on battery. It gets a 5.5 HD 720p display and under the hood it gets a Snapdragon 410 processor with 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage. The biggest star of course is the massive 5,000mAh battery which should probably last more than 2 days on a single charge. Both the Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Max would be available sometime in December before the year is out."

Thus, the BlackBerry PRIVwas envisioned, its first Android device. BB10 software was left out to see if this change would revitalise the brand but the PRIVdid still include some signature security tech, as the devices namesake is also drawn from the word privacy.Posting their recent financial quarter results, the manufacturer only managed to sell 800,000 phones, an underwhelming number by a long shot. PRIVs security thats quoted to match Samsungs Knox will still have some advantages according to Chen; battery technology, antenna technology and a physical slide out keyboard, along with other enticing specs.The CEO also refused to say that BB10 will cease to exist if the PRIVtakes flight and sells well. Their secure OS is often seen in high-risk business settings, similar to those in the public sector. Getting these same individuals to purchase the latest BlackBerry offering and move over to the new setting will be tough; migration aside, it isnt common to waltz into a telco or carriers store and be able to purchase a BlackBerry device in the US.As the new smartphone runs Android, carriers are more open to picking it up for their stores. As such the CEO has been busy reaching out to them to sell the Android slider. He adds that carriers have responded positively, citing that staff familiarity with the OS would help when it comes to customer interactions.If BlackBerrys run finally came to an end, would it make a difference in your life?

The new Surface Pro 4 marks its 4th generation of its 2-in-1 tablet/laptop convergence device and it runs on the very latest Windows 10. The current Surface Pro 3 to us is a breakthrough as it offers a full Windows experience in a true tablet form. It did live up to its Tablet that could replace your Laptop claim and the new one just raises the bar to a whole new level. Size does matter and weve seen countless of 2-in-1 devices that are just too heavy for tablet use. The Surface Pro 4 now gets a larger 12.3 display that does a higher 27361824 pixels resolution while maintaining the same footprint of 292.1mm x 201.42mm. As comparison, the Surface Pro 3 has a 12 screen that pushes 21601440 pixels resolution. On top of that, Microsoft has made it even thinner at 8.45mm (Surface Pro 3: 9.1mm) and lighter from 766 grams (Surface Pro 3: 800g). The front still gets a pair of stereo speakers and microphones while the top gets a 5MP front camera. Over at the rear, the camera gets bumped up to 8MP and it comes with auto focus. You still get a full sized USB 3.0, microSD card reader, headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort, all encased in its Magnesium body that comes in Silver. In the current Surface Pro 3, Microsoft had introduced a variety of Intel Core processors with various memory and storage options to suit every need. For the Surface Pro 4, the list is even more extensive with the latest 6th generation Intel Core processors. At the base level, they have opt for an Intel Core m3 processor instead of the usual i3 with a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage. For those who demand more power and have a loads of cash to burn, you can opt for the highest Core i7 processor with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Performance wise, the Surface Pro 4 is reported to be 30% faster than the Surface Pro 3 and 50% faster than the competing MacBook Air. No doubt it drives the price up to exorbitant levels and this is made worse with our current exchange rate. The full pricing for the Surface Pro 4 are as follows:Moving on to what makes the Surface Pro 4 a laptop replacement is the keyboard. The new Surface Pro 4 Type Cover has been massively improved to provide a better laptop class experience and it is thinner than before. The keys have been redesigned with larger spacing in between like a laptop chiclet keyboard which is made quieter and comfortable to type on.The trackpad meanwhile is 40% larger and it comes with a glass surface that tracks 5 multi-touch points. If youre using a Surface Pro 3, good news for you as the new keyboard is compatible as well. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover is priced at US$129.99 which is about RM554.With more players getting their hands onto styluses, Microsoft had introduced a newer Surface Pen. It boasts 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity (current Surface Pen: 256 levels) and it even comes with an eraser at the back. This replaces the secondary button on the sides, leaving just one for right clicking, while the eraser tip still doubles as a Magic Button which launches OneNote on a single click. For the right feel and shade, there are interchangeable Pen Tips where you can swap from 2H, H, HB and B tips. It still connects via Bluetooth and with a AAAA battery, the new Surface Pen still lasts a whole year without charging needed in between. For storage, the Surface Pen now clips onto the slides of the Surface Pro 4 with the help of magnets. It sounds like a good solution but were not sure if it could hold on well with clumsy hands.  Overall, the Surface Pro 4 is thinner, lighter, faster and massively improved to steer you away from the traditional laptop. For those who work on the lap a lot, we are still unconvinced with the practicality of the kick stand but it is perfect when its used on the table. With the price tag of US$999 for the minimum Core i5 model, it is quite expensive compared to other similarly equipped laptops. If budget permits, this is still the best 2in1 hybrid tablet/laptop out there and it is more practical than Apples iPad Pro. It will be available at selected markets on 26th October with pre-orders available starting today. For more info, head over to the Surface Pro 4 page."

Itll cost you from RM 3,199 for the iPhone 6s, while the iPhone 6s Plus starts from RM 3,699. Pre-orders start on the 9th can be made through the Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile but these devices will only be in your hands from October 16th onwards.Hotly anticipated by Malaysians, as the Apple craze will sweep the nation yet again this year, though the long queues have dissipated since the iPhone 4s. Other than the previously stated telcos youll be able to get the smartphones from authorised retail outlets.Tougher and thicker, thanks to the 7000D series aluminium that added 0.1-0.2mm to its overall footprint. It also adds on 14grams of extra heft at 143 grams for the iPhone 6s and 20grams on the iPhone 6s Plus at 192g.Stacking the phones side by side, youll see a 4.7-inch (iPhone 6s) and 5.5-inch (iPhone 6s Plus) Retina Display  the same on the older 6 and 6 Plus smartphones. Under the hood, theres a 64-bit enabled A9 chip that has a 70% increase in performance over the A8 processor.Performance is multiplied by integrating the M9 motion co-processor onto the A9 chip, saving some space internally as well at the same time. Taking a look at its battery, in actual fact the capacity decreases but in real-life situation it still maintains the same battery life with stronger power efficiency in iOS. For its colour options, Apple now adds a Rose Gold variant that is probably aimed to draw in the more feminine high-class crowd.Storage of these two devices remain the same at 16GB, 64GB and 128GB, a hard-case to justify why Apple doesnt raise their bare minimum to 32GB but people will likely accept it.The prices below are thanks to Digi, whose pre-order page went live before 12 midnight. So heres the breakdown of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, with a price comparison made to the older iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus during its initial launch:A turn of events have lead to Maxis providing another set of RRP pricing, differing from the RRP by Digi already listed above. Heres Maxis RRP pricing:Force Touch is a new feature on the latest iPhones that weve seen in action on the MacBook trackpads and Apple Watches. Already multi-touch packed, the screen now adds pressure sensitivity technology dubbed as 3D Touch. Gentle taps, long presses and hard presses bring up new options allowing users to do more with the same device.Doubling the iSIght camera on their new duo, both of them get bumped up to 12-megapixels with f/2.2 aperture, at the same time it also gets dual-tone LED flash for a more natural looking flash. The big brother in the form of the 6s Plus does have an upper hand in the camera department, as Apple has added Optical Image Stabilisation. On the front however, the old 1.2-megapixel sensor is replaced by a 5-megapixel shutter with f/2.2 aperture and adding the new Retina Flash to brighten up your selfies.Apple has prepared their new iPhones by adding more pixels to their sensors but how well will the devices stack up against the other camera smartphones in our latest camera comparison between the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s Plus, LG G4 and Samsung Note5.There are a wide array of features and other specifications on the pair of Apple devices, for more info you can head over here.[ SOURCE ]"

Likely to retain the same design as the current R7 series, the new model is to be called the OPPO R7s. While they havent officially released the specs for the device, the brand claims that the device will have a bigger battery, screen and double the storage of the R7 plus a stronger frame and camera.As far as rumoured specs go, the device is expected to have a Snapdragon 615 SoC with a 1.5GHz CPU under the hood mated to 3GB RAM and 32GB expandable storage via microSD slot. It will also have a 5.5 inch Full HD AMOLED display as well as a 13 megapixel rear and 8 megapixel camera combo. It is expected to run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. No word on the battery capacity however.If the rumours are true, then the device would be a slight step up from the original R7, be it only in screen size and internal storage.Aside from the R7s, OPPO will also be showing off many of their other devices such as the R7 Plus, R7 Lite, Mirror 5 as well as theR7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition.Speaking of which, to commemorate the new partnership, OPPOs booth will also include a football pitch, just to drive the partnership home.The launch is a little under two weeks away but we will be sure to update more on launch day itself."

Now theres a better solution on the way as Google has just announced Google Drive backup integration with WhatsApp. This allows you to save those important WhatsApp chats, audio messages, photos and even videos to the cloud, so youll never lose them if anything happens to your device. Once enabled, you can set to backup automatically by daily, weekly or monthly. You also get to choose not to include those bulky videos to your backup. The cloud backup feature has been long anticipated for Android users, and it was actually released for a short while in April before WhatsApp pulled the plug. For iOS, iPhone users are already able to backup their chats automatically and they are stored on Apples iCloud service.At time of writing, the latest version on the Google Play Store still doesnt have the Google Drive option yet. According to Google, the feature will be rolling out in the coming months, so it looks like weve got to wait for a while before it reaches here. [ SOURCE ]"
Arif Lee,Microsoft wants you to Live Healthier and Achieve More with its new Band 2,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/08/microsoft-wants-you-to-live-healthier-and-achieve-more-with-its-new-microsoft-band-2/,"2,Band,Band 2,barometer,heart,microsoft,Microsoft Band 2,Microsoft smartwatch,Microsoft wearable,SmartWatch,wearable","Android,iOS,Microsoft,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows Phone",2015-10-08,"The tech giant built by Bill Gates just released a wide line-up of devices during its keynote two days ago. They drew oooohs and ahhhhs during their presentation that starred the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book, the HoloLens and the smallest of the bunch, the Microsoft Band 2. Microsoft wants you to destroy limits with their new wearable, stated for individuals who want to be in a better state of health and just get more things done.Microsofts first band was packed with features but failed to be something people would want on their wrist, partly cause of its design; often compared to be clunky and simply too cumbersome to be a daily wearable. Consumers should now be happier, cause Microsoft listened and their engineers in Redmond took more time to design the Band 2 to be more ergonomic. A word that youd first expect to hear when wearables are concerned. Now curvier than ever, its Gorilla glass display tears at an angle! Yes, we all love curves.Some (beneficial) elements do return; in the form of the AMOLED display (320 x 128), 2 day battery life, GPS and an optical heart sensor. The device can thank the batterys change of placement for being less bulky, now at one end of the smart watches straps. On the opposite end of the strap is a metal clasps  nothing too interesting, except it doubles as the charging connector that you snap on to the charging dock magnetically.The 0-80% in 30 minutes fast charging feature makes a return too, making sure youll be ready to get to it after charging in just half an hour. Design language aside, the Microsoft Band 2 has some internal upgrades that increase its adaptability for those who love staying active. A barometer now lives somewhere on the watch, along with a native UV sensor that monitors rays constantly. Golfers will surely ravel at the sensors and functionality included; distances measured from the tee to the hole and swing mechanics to help those drives just to name a few.Itll help you track other stuff too with its 8 other sensors. Tracking sports like running, biking and weights should appeal to the common folk too. Day to day task are easier to handle with your new personal assistant, Cortana, who lives on your device as well.Supported mobile devices are listed below:Youll be able to get your hands on the Microsoft Band 2 in the States for $249.99 (RM 1,049), $50 more than its predecessor but a worthy price to pay for a hefty upgrade. Well let you know if/when it comes our way, locally. Do let us know what you think about Microsofts new wearable in the comments below.Check out the product site here."
Arif Lee,Shocking the world with the most powerful 13-inch laptop; the Microsoft Surface Book,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/08/microsoft-surface-book-the-best-13-inch-laptop/,"13-inch laptop,13-inch tablet,2-in-1 convertible laptop,Announcement,Book,keynote,launch,microsoft,Microsoft 13-inch laptop,Microsoft Surface Book,official,powerful laptop,powerful PC,Surface,Surface Book,Tablet,Windows 10,Windows 10 devices","Cool stuff,Microsoft,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices",2015-10-08,"We thought Microsoft was done after the HoloLens, Band 2 and Surface Pro 4 but nope, they kept the best (well-kept secret) for last; their first laptop, the Surface Book. If youve ever wanted a Surface but preferred it to be bigger and a non-flex like typing experience, Microsoft has just machined it for you.At 13.5-inches, the Gorilla Glass PixelSense screen will still give you a touchscreen experience at 3000 x 2000 resolution delivering 267 ppi. The display gives you the ability to tote it around if you just want a clipboard or attach it to the keyboard for (Microsofts promised) the best typing experience on a laptop.Microsoft bundles the Surface Pen together giving you the tool to create content, be it drawing or writing. The Pen, which has 1,024 levels of touch sensitivity  thats 4 times more compared to the old Pen, and they added an eraser too on the tail.Yet another way to interact with the screen in one of the most precise methods in a tool that supposedly gives you all-year battery life.. If the Pen doesnt suit your needs, the keyboard and trackpad should  giving you 1.6mm of key travel and a huge precision touch glass pad for those cursor movements.Intels latest 6th Gen Intel (Skylake) processor sits inside this wonderful package. If you need more graphics? Just add on the dedicated graphics card (at a pretty price), which is somewhere under the keyboard. RAM options start from 8GB and go up to 16GB and youll have PCIE storage that range from 128GB to 512GB  odd, if you noticed that the Surface Pro 4 went up to 1TB.Being a Windows 10 devices event, its a given that the it runs Windows 10 out of the box.Productivity and exceptional performance, Microsofts new toy is expected to handle your designing, video editing and gaming; all in one seamless (not gap-less, eh) package. So much power in a small footprint but how does the battery fare? Microsoft swears by a 12-hour battery life but well wait for the real-world testing first before jumping on the bandwagon.But wait, a laptop? Who could care less, then the video showed that you can detach it from the keyboard. Sharing information now is easier, just detach and pass it down; literally, they passed it around during the presentation. Run programs like Adobe Creative Cloud, AutoCAD, Citrix and anything else on the Book + Keyboard combo, since the discrete card lives in the latter.Their dynamic fulcrum hinge and cable wire lock technology looks promising but we noticed some unnecessary screen wobbling towards the end after angling the screen, hopefully it holds up well over time.Fashioned out of magnesium in a 3.48 pounds (approx. 1.5 kg) package, the dimensions of the device are below:The ports of this detach-able laptop are two USB 3.0 ports, a full-sized SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a mini DisplayPort. On connectivity youll get 802.11ac for Wi-Fi while also supporting a/b/g/n. Being a tablet of-sorts, it has an 8-megapixel rear camera with autofocus, capable of 1080p recording while for audio it has a dual microphone setup (front and rear) and Dolby front-facing stereo speakers.Here are the configuration options that youll be able to personalise your Surface Book and how well it stacks up against the Surface Pro 4:Theres no word when the Surface Book will arrive in Malaysia as of yet. A sadder notion is that the exchange rate isnt favouring the Ringgit at all currently, though wed like to know if youd consider Microsofts new Surface Pro 4 or the Surface Book.

Arif Lee,Has Apple made a comeback with its iPhone 6s Plus camera? You tell us,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/08/iphone-6s-plus-camera-vs-galaxy-note-5-lg-g4-iphone-6-malaysia-shootout/,,,2015-10-08,"UPDATE: Weve tabulated the votes for the shootout. Jump straight to Page 4to find out which is the best as voted by youNew devices, call for new camera shootout tests and our latest camera blind test will pit the newest iPhone 6s Plus against the iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy Note5 and LG G4. The last smartphone that took home the best camera as voted by you guys was the LG G4, but will it come to an end today?The newcomer of the group, the iPhone 6s Plus doesnt pack a high megapixel count  only 12 on its rear iSight camera but its pixels come in at 1.22 pixels, helping it somewhat. Storage might be an issue for the aforementioned device if you love those Live Photos, since the extra moving picture takes up roughly the same amount of space as the photos you take.Distinctive to the Plus is OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation), allowing you to take more stable shots when compared to its little brother, while its aperture is listed at f/2.2. For the first time we decided to include the front camera for our shootout and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus has a 5-megapixel sensor up front, with the same aperture as its rear camera. It also has the new Retina Flash, Apples alternative to putting an LED flash at the front like some selfie-centric phones in the market.Edging out the competition in the last shootout, does the 16-megapixel (rear) LG G4 camera have what it takes to hit the podium again? Well, the f/1.8 aperture rear camera has some tricks up its sleeves  similarly it has OIS as well but laser autofocus is what sets it apart. In terms of the front sensor, 8-megapixels makes its way on the top half of the display.A close second was the Galaxy Note5, that boasts the same megapixel count as the LG G4 and it also has OIS to back up its cameras capabilities. On the front however, it isnt so pixel hungry, as the selfie camera is only 5-megapixels."

To bring the same experience onto smaller screens, they had just announced their latest flagship smart phones  the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL. The operating system is no longer called Windows Phone but simply Windows 10 in line with its new direction. The Lumia 950 and 950 XL arent just about the latest hardware but a more integrated experience with its family of products. One notable feature is how it transforms the smart phone to deliver a PC-like experience via Windows Continuum. This is better implemented than other smart phone to PC docks weve seen before.Going through the specs, theres no surprises from what weve seen in earlier leaks. Both the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL come with a Quad HD AMOLED ClearBlack display that are 5.2 and 5.7 respectively. These are the highest resolution smart phones Microsoft has ever made with over 500ppi in pixel density. The Lumia 950 XL gets Gorilla Glass 4 protection while the Lumia 950 settles for Gorilla Glass 3. Under the hood, the 950 XL gets Qualcomms 2.0GHz Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor while the 950 gets a 1.8GHz Hexa-core Snapdragon 808 unit. Both of which comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. Should you need more especially when shooting 4K videos, theres a microSD slot which supports 200GB. But in theory, it can go up to 2TB when such capacity is available.Being a flagship, the PureView camera is back with a 20MP f/1.9 1/2.4 main shooter with a triple-LED RGB flash for natural looking illumination. Like most new high-end devices, it shoots 4K videos in 30fps while audio is is captured with Lumia Rich Recording that uses 4 microphones. For shake free shots, Optical Image Stabilisation comes as standard and you can capture moments quicker with a dedicated camera button. For the front, it gets a 5MP wide angle f/2.4 camera which supports Full HD video recording.Keeping the lights on is a removable 3,000mAh battery for the Lumia 950 and a larger 3,340mAh for the XL sibling. As one of the pioneers of wireless charging on a smart phone, it still supports native Qi Wireless charging for both models. If you decide to juice up the old school way, Microsoft is future-proofing its Lumia 950/950 XL with USB Type C that supports fast charging. During the presentation, they shared that a 50% charge can be accomplished in just 30 minutes.Connectivity wise, both ticked the right boxes with faster 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE. Which ever model you pick, theres also a dual-SIM variant but it is subject to each respective market. Another new feature is its Windows Hello biometric authentication feature. The actual workings behind it wasnt explained clearly but the product demo looks similar to Androids Face Unlock with the use of its front camera. Earlier rumours suggest an Iris recognition technology thats assisted by IR light.Probably one of the coolest feature is Windows Continuum. With a Microsoft Display Dock, you can simply plug in your USB Type C cable from your phone and it offers a PC-like desktop experience. The dock is a tiny box weighing 230 grams and it comes with 3 USB and HDMI/Display Port. When plugged in, you can check Outlook, edit your MS Office documents like a real machine and the transition is simply seamless. So if you got a spare monitor, keyboard and mouse at home, you can leave your clunky laptop at work but still get things done all from your mobile device. Now thats the power of a PC in your pocket.The Lumia 950 and 950 XL will be available starting in November and they are priced at $549 (RM2,379) and $649 (RM2,813) respectively. So far theres no word on Asia Pacific release but it is possible that they could be here before the year ends. For more info, head over to the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL product pages."

Most recently, Stagefright is to blame for all the manufacturers being caught with their pants down  if you dont know what Stagefright is, check it out here. To cut it short, its a malicious exploit that digs up personal information on your Android device. And as smartphone vendorsscrambled to get their acts together through rolling out OTA updates, HTCs President has gone on record to say that monthly updates are unrealistic.Following the whole shamble, both Samsung and Google jumped on to have monthly updates to remedy any such incidents in the future. Further extending on Android 6.0 when Google highlights the ability for the OS to show you when you last downloaded and applied a security update.Some HTC users took to Twitter to address their anxiety as to why the Taiwanese company had been so silent on the matter; compared to LG and Samsung who made statements immediately. Jason Mackenzie, President of HTC Americas then replied these tweets saying that cellular carriers are setting an unrealistic schedule; he then adds that HTC doesnt want to commit to something and receive backlash for not delivering that same promise.As a follow-up, Mackenzie does say that HTC has been very transparent with their updates, which will only get better  as seen by Android Headlines, who says that the company updates them frequently on submission of updates to carriers (even pre-approval). Also, theyve been notified about what these pre-approved updates include.Have the three vendor whove promised monthly updates stuck to them? Will they be capable in doing so? No doubt, the thought is a welcomed one, but after learning a thing or to about how updates get passed through carriers (at least in the States), maybe what Mackenzie is saying is somewhat true.[SOURCE,VIA ]"

Dubbed as the OnePlus mini, it is said that it would be  aesthetically focused instead of having top notch specs like the OnePlus 2.According to a new source, the OnePlus mini will be launched sometime in November/December with an estimated price tag of US$250, which is about RM1,091 in our current exchange rate. As expected with a mini model, it is a notch down with a purported 5 Full HD IPS display and is powered by MediaTeks Helio X10 processor mated with 2GB of LP-DDR3 RAM. On-board storage seems to be decent at 32GB and guess what, it even comes with a microSD slot. For the front, it gets a more polished 2.5D Gorilla Glass which makes it smoother to touch around the edges. Keeping the lights on is a decent 3,000/3,100mAh capacity battery which is non removable. The rest of the features appear to be an improvement over its 2016 Flagship Killer. The anonymous source claims that NFC will be present along with an IR Blaster, front facing 1.2W loud speaker and a USB Type-C connector which supports fast charge. The camera is said to be a 13MP f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor that supports 4K videos while the front gets a standard 5MP shooter with Full HD video capabilities. Like the current OnePlus devices, the back is removable allowing you to customise with a variety of shells and word has it, that it could feature IP67 dust and waterproof capabilities.At this point, these are just speculations and while the specs are no way top notch like the OnePlus 2, the feature list seems to be quite compelling. However for the price tag, it faces cheaper alternatives like the Redmi Note 2 thats priced at 999 CNY (about RM684). Even if you want it, buying it would be difficult as it would go through its rather limited invitation system. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Knowing that this is a roll-out, you can expect the OTAs to eventually come in but be ready to wait up to a month or so, until the actual notification update comes in.Expect new apps and features to now live on your device  notably, an extensive search function; Now on Tap, battery saving elements, and a revamped app permissions system.Now on Tap is pretty much now your best friend, on your smartphone. Itll help you search up pretty much anything you need, keeping your task, scheduling and info always in check. A video below details what you can do with Now on Tap.Skip to 53:30 for the Google Now on Tap presentation.Technology in the battery department has stalled since the installation of the lithium-ion polymer, causing heartache for those who rely on their devices for most of their life. Google however, wants to help out in terms of improving how your devices utilises the power it has. Doze on Android is just one of them, which puts your Android device into a deep sleep when idle for an extended period to minimize power usage.Tested in controlled environments Android techs pit one set of Marshmallow Nexuses against another bunch with the older Lollipop  and surprise, surprise, the former ran *roughly* 30% longer (based on standby time). Users will also get another function dubbed App Standby. A feature that puts your lesser opened apps into a state of reduced activity, making your device conserve more power for the apps that you use more often.Privacy options get a much appreciated update, now allowing you to personalise and select which permissions you want to give apps. Users are now able to pick what they want their apps to have access to at the time of use. All apps running on Marshmallow now only request permission when it needs to access one of the devices functionalities (e.g. microphone, contacts, camera). Rejoice cause now you can deny permissions and still use the app but at a reduced functionality, of course. Permissions can now even be turned on and off for any app, in the new settings.With Android M the arrival of native finger-print support came together. A new (naturally) supported way to interact with your device, giving you power to protect your device in a multiple array of methods. The new OS places your fingerprint at the forefront of safeguarding your information, unlocking your device, authorising payments on the Google Play Store (& more), signing into other apps and paying through Android Pay (if available in your country).Much to be excited about for those who own a piece of Nexus tech and a lot more incentive for consumers to pick up the newest Nexus smartphones; the 5X and 6P. We sure hope that Google Malaysia brings products (officially) to our domestic market soon, cause were loving what were hearing about Marshmallow so far. Are you?[ SOURCE ]"

Officially there was no mention on screen size but they said it was all about a larger viewing experience. Possibly occupying a place in our dwellings but not moving around as much as smaller tablets. Spotted on GFXBench benchmarks, we now have a rough idea of what this device is going to be.Codenamed under the model number SM-T670, the monstrous tablet is listed to have an 18.5-inch display at 19201080 (FHD); at this size, wed likely appreciate a higher resolution but well have to see it in real life before making any assumptions. Theoretically the tablet will be viewed further away, more like a TV, so the bigger pixels shouldnt be too noticeable.For its processor, itll run a 64-bit Octa-core Exynos 7580 processor coupled with a Mali-T720 GPU. This new processor is expected to fit in the mid-range chip-set market, as its supposedly only clocked at 1.6GHz; as far as we can tell, bigger model number doesnt mean that this processor will be anywhere near the Exynos 7440. Similarly, the new processor was seen on the mid-range Galaxy J7 and the devices benchmarks saw that it beat the Snapdragon 615  which isnt saying much.Back to the huge tablets specs, the listing also states that itll have 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Otherwise, itll carry an 8-megapixel rear camera (based on another report) and a measly 2-megapixel sensor on the front (probably just enough for video calls, if necessary).Samsungs Galaxy View will apparently size at 451.8 x 275.8 x 11.9mm and feature a 5,700 mAh battery; raising some alarms, but it could mean that Samsung assumes youll have the device plugged in long-term. It has already been passed SIG and RRA certifications, a tell-tale sign that Samsung will probably launch this device soon.[ SOURCE, 2]"

Celcom has introduced its new FIRST Basic 85 Internet Plan which gives you 21GB of mobile data for only RM85/month. Although it sounds the same, this isnt the same as the standard FIRST Basic 85 that comes with an OPTIMISER feature. Instead, this is a data-centric plan that gives you loads of data while calls are only charged when you need it.For RM85/month, by default it comes with 7GB of mobile data and 7GB of Celcom WiFi (if you could find one) thats usable anytime of the day. The remaining 14GB of data (plus 14GB of Celcom WiFi) is allocated only for off-peak hours between 2AM and 8AM daily. According to the FAQ, unused internet can be carried forward with a maximum of 7GB to the following month and this is only from your 24 hour data bucket. Once youve finished your internet allocation, speeds will be throttled to 64kbps and theres a limit of 15GB per billing cycle.If you need more data at full speeds, you can top up from as little as RM3 for 100MB, or you can opt for more at RM15/GB and RM50 for 5GB. As for calls, it isnt specified clearly but SMS and MMS are charged at 15 sen to all networks. Interestingly if youve finished your FIRST Basic 85 Internet allocation, all calls and SMS are charged at 10sen. Come to think of it, this is basically Celcoms PortaWiFi 2.0 Internet Plan with voice and you can sign up without the unnecessary activation and registration fee. Should you get this over the standard Celcom FIRST Basic 85? If you use more than 5GB a month and hardly make any calls, the answer is probably yes. As comparison, the standard FIRST Basic 85 currently gives you 5GB of internet, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS for the heavy internet user. Alternative those who talk a lot will get 2GB of internet plus 600 minutes of calls and 600 SMS each month.If youre interested, this plan is available from now until 31st October and take note that it comes with a 12 months contract.

What blew most people away was the fact that Sony decided to pack a 4K display on the 5.5-inch device  a first in the smartphone industry. But it certainly isnt cheap becausenative 4K content isnt easy to find. Sonys latest statement answers some questions but well have to see how well it attempts to levitate this problem.What the Japanese manufacturer attempts to do is downgrade non-4K content to a more reasonable 1080p, although it wont sacrifice any proper 4K content, ensuring youll still get the most pixels. Heres a snippet of what Sony said:They then offer an explanation as for why they decided to do so:Its great that Sony has chosen to address these concerns and the reasons listed do make sense. Adding to that, the statement goes on to say that presently, the microSD slot handles cards up to 200GB just fine so 4K recordings wont cause your phones memory to be maxed out so quickly.In the instance that youve yet to hear about the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium, let us jog your memory a bit. The device runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor thats surely to give you enough power to handle all your tasks. While its RAM is listed at 3GB and the internal storage is 32GB (expanded to the amount earlier stated). And yes, the screen is a 4K 5.5-inch that has a mind-blowing 806 PPI (3840 x 2160 resolution)The rear camera on the device (1/2.3 23-megapixel Exmor RS) has already received the seal of approval from Dxomark, whove rated the latest Sony smartphone the best-in-camera title  youll be able to read-up on that in a follow-up post.Its battery is rated at 3430 mAh; rather big for regular phones but Sony would be the first to show how 4K screens will affect a devices battery life  they however rate the battery to last up to 2 days (dependent on your personal usage habits, of course). The phone also features Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, so that should help giving your battery a quick boost if it needs it.You can check out our post here for more info about the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Worrying for Sony, who had relative success in supplying cameras to other flagships (iPhones, Samsungs and etc); success that has not streamed down to their own phone cameras, at least when field tested. A new change comes in the form of the latest Sony Xperia Z5 line, thats been tested by the guys at DxOMark, showing a vast improvement.The newer 23-megapixel 1 / 2.3-inch Exmor RS sensor with an f/2.0 lens, is the biggest determining factor here  when compared to the M5 that has a 21.5-megapixel IMX230 sensor. The newest flagship is expected to hit the streets in some markets by this week, since being released in September this year.Feature-rich in other elements too, with its 1080p 5.2-inch display, Snapdragon 810 SoC, 3GB, and 32GB of on-board storage.

Sonys thrown in the regular bells and whistles too, with its phase-detection autofocus technology, LED flash, and HDR.Looks like more camera shootout comparisons will be coming your way, if this is anything to lead on. Impressively the Nexus 6P could appear out of nowhere as well, since DxOMark lists them at the current number two spot.

Claimed to push the boundaries of interaction with your smartphone, it features a pressure sensitive screen that expands features based on touch and it could even weigh an orange!Following its global announcement, we finally have new details of it making a surprise appearance on SIRIM  leading us to believe that the device will soon make its way to Malaysia. The device isnt a one trick-pony, considering it boasts some decent specs to go along with its force touch technology. Housed inside the all metal-chasis, is a home-grown Kirin 935 8-core processor, mated to 3GB of RAM, all in a 5.5-inch package.Its screen is a FHD display (1920 x 1080) and has curves on the back that tee off slightly, while the front makes use of 2.5D Gorrila Glass 4 to smooth the edges. There are two variants of the devices but the model listed on SIRIM is the CRR-UL00 model which comes with dual-SIM and has a different band support. It also supports 4G LTE in either FDD and TDD standards. But as a rough indication, the UK Vmall site is selling the 32GB version at 469.00, instead of its larger 64GB model. Based on early reviews in the UK, the Mate S in Standard version doesnt come with the pressure sensitive display and it is said to be available later in a high-spec trim with 128GB of storage. So it is still a question mark whether we are getting the Force Touch high-spec version in Malaysia.In terms of its imaging, a 13-megapixel camera will support its photo taking on the rear, while the front gets a 8-megapixel shooter. The former is an f/2.0 4-colour RGBW camera sensor with OIS and dual-LED flash. On the latter, its an f/2.4 shooter with an accompanying soft LED light for flash.Fans of gestures will ravel over the (for show) Knuckle sense technology. An upgraded 2.0 version allows you to draw a C shape to open the camera app  were unsure how many of you will take notice or even use this though. The metal-chasis on the back surrounds a distinctive Huawei shaped fingerprint sensor. From Apple to Samsung, the Mate S also shares the 3 microphone multi way conference recording feature as seen on the Galaxy Note 4.A feather weight of sorts at 156grams and 7.2mm thick, it still manages to pack a 2,700 mAh battery under all that metal. Android 5.1 will run the devices OS but have a EMUI 3.1 skin to go on top.

At 5.7 inches, it is a phablet and could replace the ageing G Pro 2. Boasting a multimedia rich experience, the biggest highlight of the V10 is its dual-screen approach. Unlike Samsungs Edge display on the Galaxy Note Edge and S6 edge series, the secondary display is a tiny strip thats placed at the front, at top right of the main screen. The always-on display which claims to have no impact on battery life and it can be used for status, shortcuts, displaying next appointment and more. 
Like its current LG G4, it uses a Quad HD (25601440) IPS Quantum Display thats bigger at 5.7 inches with a pixel density of 513ppi. Meanwhile the secondary ticker display is also a IPS Quantum Display unit with a 2.1 unit doing 1601040 pixel resolution.For better durability, the V10 has a Dura Guard frame that protects the display from hard bumps and tumbles. The frame is made of SAE grade 316L stainless steel and it protects the most vulnerable areas around the edge and corners. The back and bottom of the device gets a softer material called Dura Skin thats resistant to scratches. With a grid pattern design, the V10 gets a more reassuring grip when held in the hands. Under the hood, it gets a Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor and it is mated with 4GB of LPDDR-3 RAM. For imaging, it retains a similar 16MP f/1.8 camera as the LG G4 that also comes with OIS 2.0. In addition, it also gets 3 directional mics which you can be manipulated fully with its Manual Video mode. If you love taking 4K videos, storage shouldnt be an issue with a 64GB of on-board storage and it still comes with a microSD slot supporting up to 2TB. For the professionals, it has an extensive manual mode and you can even shoot videos in 21:9 aspect ratio. Over at the front, LG wants to take Selfie and Groufie pictures to the next level with not one but two 5MP cameras with each doing 80 degree and 120 degree wide angle respectively. With the two cameras combined, it can produce a wide angle shot without the need of having a selfie stick. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery which is also removable.In terms of connectivity, it supports Cat 6 4G LTE, 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and it still uses microUSB 2.0. Overall it is 8.6mm thick and it weighs quite a heft at 192g, similar to an iPhone 6s Plus.The LG V10 will be available starting in Korea this month and it will be released later in other regions including Asia, US, China, Latin America and Middle East. Looks like a complete package if youre looking for a phablet for videos and photos, dont you think? After all, the camera of the LG G4 is a top pick as chosen by our readers.[ SOURCE ]"

Placed to fill a gap in the non-metal phones of this year, the Butterfly 3 packs a great package with HTCs signature dual rear camera setup in a lesser premium outer layer.For a pretty penny, the Butterfly 3 is filled with internals that beg the question, if priced so highly, why not just make metal-clad? Its been tough for the Taiwanese company to make profits and since September, theyve been dropped from the main Taiwan stock index (TWSE 50). Problems dont just stop there, as the company announced that they would lay off nearly 15% of their global workforce.Market strategies aside, HTC Butterfly 3 is a 5.2-inch device; its screen is a QHD LCD display (2560 x 1440). Occupying the processor slot inside the device is an Octa-core Snapdragon 810, while the RAM sits at 3GB. For your storage youll get a decent 32GB internally but if you need a boost, you can always take advantage of the microSD slot.The star of the show of the Butterfly line has always been its camera optics, and the third generation device a Duo camera setup; 20.2-megapixels as the primary camera and a secondary lens to help with those bokeh shots. Protected by sapphire crystal it boasts an f/2.2 aperture and a dual-LED module sits on the left of the main sensor.Selfie taking individuals will be pleased as on the front youll see a 13-megapixel shutter with a BSI sensor. In terms of aperture, the front lens steps it up a bit with an f/2.0 lens instead. If you prefer videos, the rear sensor gets you 4K quality and the front is capable of 1080p films.Aesthetically, the Boomsound speaker grills are slightly thinner this time around, giving it a sleaker look but still maintaining its large bezels on the top and bottom. Powering the HTC Butterfly 3 is a 2,700 mAh battery and the smartphone has a IP rating of 57, ensuring that itll be slightly dust and water resistant. It also has a single 4G LTE SIM slot.Android 5.0 Lollipop is behind the devices OS but has an overlay of HTCs Sense 7. The device launches in Taiwan on the 20th of October for TWD 19,.900 (RM 2,657) though no word yet on international availability.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Among the repercussions were the removal of iFixits developer account that was attached to the app, thus getting it removed as well.This dismissal of sorts were caused by iFixit receiving a developer unit and risking it by tearing down the device that has yet to go on sale. While being dissembled, the people behind the website released info of the internals down to their model numbers, as they usually do.If youre not familiar with iFixit, theyre the people behind the DIY fixing website for Apple products; they provide how-tos and even provide the parts for self-repairs (if youre desperate to look elsewhere).So far, theyve released an official statement explaining the whole commotion that lead to Apple banning them. They explained that they knew the risk associated with going-ahead to tear down the Apple TV and the fact that teardowns are in our DNA, they couldnt resist.Fittingly, Apple wasnt too pleased but were fair to weigh the aforementioned decision against the repairing maestros and sent them a follow up e-mail explaining their offences; in-turn, banning the iFixit developer account with the app in tow.It isnt all bad news though, as the team announced that their mobile site is essentially the exact same thing as the app; allowing the full functionality on the website. Adding that, due to the team being really small, they dont have enough resources tokeep the app up-to-date.Currently, theyve no plans to rewrite their app, however the readily available APIs allow whoever wants to take up the task as the team has alreadygiven their seal of approval since its open source. Meanwhile, the Android app still lives on and access to the repair guides are accessible on their existing mobile site.Watch the trouble-making teardown video below.[ SOURCE ]"

Seemingly, Asia as a continent isshowing a propensity to put aside their PCs to solely rely on their smartphones for their online needs  be it shopping, learning, searching and etc.So Google being Google, theyre tasked to illustrate an image to show how people use the Internet  as quoted by MD SEA Sajith. Essentially, the research serves to encapsulate the behaviours of the world while connecting to their devices  these instances are dubbed micro-moments and so far theyre transcending markets in Asia.How hooked are we? Well the insights show that 66% of all Asians own a smartphone, numbers that arent trumped by any other region; Americas and Europe are 60% each. Our neighbours down south (Singapore) sit high and mighty with 88%, the country with the fastest internet (South Korea) are at 83%, while Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia come in at 79%, 78% and 77% respectively  Malaysias percentile was at 71%.Malaysias data shows some trends that might be worrying; to sum it up, Malaysians could be likely to have ADHD, or rather just find it hard to concentrate on one thing  in this case, device for a span of time. Coming in at number 2 thanks to logging a percentile of 91% Malaysia was only beaten by Indonesia (92%); numbers that show that both countries have individuals that use their smartphones while watching the TV. Numbers which implicate that these two nations are either:Then on, the data also shows that 36% of Malaysians only use their pocket companions and nothing else to surf the web  again number two, behind Thailand 37%. It seems that it could be that the portability of their smartphones are driving them away from tablets and computers.Buying habits are now also being dictated through smartphones, although the numbers arent too high at 20%. Supplementing this data are more percentages that corroborate that e-commerce is still quite stagnant in the country.51% of Malaysians prefer to do their groundwork on their purchases online but purchasing the actual item offline. The internet is helping them find out what they need and compare on the internet but knowing Asians, they still want to take a proper look at the thing theyre putting their money towards. Another interesting trend is that 48% of our citizens find out about products through online resources, first. E-commerce as an industry is still finding it hard to tackle the local consumer, but theyll be happy to know that 30% of Malaysians are shopping online through other mediums (PCs, tablets, etc).Coming to a close, its no surprise that the majority of smartphone users come from Gen Y or younger (under 25; 93%) but these numbers are increasing in all age ranges. Some time during this article youd probably compare yourself and decide if you fall within the majority; nevertheless, consumers could expect more content to be marketed based on these findings, so be prepared for interactive content that spreads across multiple-platforms.For more info check out the online poll here."

Theres matte white, powder blue and pastel pink colours to choose from.As far as the specs go, the Selfie is on par with quite a few devices, but isslightly lower specced than the top of the line Zenfone 2.

And that appears to be the formula for new flagships like the Galaxy Note5/S6 edge+ and the more recent iPhone 6s/6s Plus. The Nexus project has always been a showcase of what Google can do if they have full control on both hardware and software. In its 7th Nexus smart phone generation along with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, they had introduced not one but 2 Nexus smart phones that cater towards different users. With very little introduction required, the Nexus 5X is their new compact flagship while the Nexus 6P is their crme de la crme with a 5.7 phablet form factor and top spec underpinnings. With LG being called up for another Nexus duty, the Nexus 5X is an upgrade over its previous Nexus 5 thats encased in a premium injected molded polycarbonate body. The screen gets a slightly larger 5.2 size but it still does a modest Full HD resolution. In terms of power, it manages to pull through with a Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor thats also powering the LG G4. It only gets 2GB RAM with an option of either 16GB or 32GB storage. Looking at the rear, the Nexus 5X gets a main 12.3MP camera which claims to outdo its better specced rivals. While there are cameras out there with higher pixel count, the 12.3MP shooter from Sony boasts a larger 1.55 m pixel size, which is pretty much the same formula as HTCs Ultrapixel shooter. The main camera has a f/2.0 aperture lens, dual flash light and an IR laser AF for quicker focus. For the front, it gets a rather standard 5MP f/2.0 camera with 1.4 m pixel size. Audio is pushed from a single speaker thats firing from the front. Connectivity wise, it supports a wide range of networks covering Cat 6 4G LTE in TDD and FDD spectrums. It also has WiFi 802.11ac in 22 MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC support as standard. For better security, the rear mounted fingerprint scanner thats called the Nexus Imprint lets you unlock by a mere touch. It recognises in under 600 ms and it learns to get better each time it is being put to use. Keeping the lights on is a 2,700mAh battery thats rated for all day use and it charges up using USB Type C that supports Quick Charge. The Nexus 5X is available for pre-orders at selected markets with the 16GB version priced from US$379 (about RM1,690).As seen in earlier leaks, this is the first Nexus phone produced by Huawei. Apart from being a new appointed Nexus maker, it is also the first all metal Nexus smart phone and it boasts a rather slender 7.3mm thickness. With Huawei being reluctant of pushing a Quad HD smart phones, the Nexus 6P breaks that tradition with a 5.7 Quad HD display that pushes a stunning 518ppi. To protect the display from harm, it gets toughen with Gorilla Glass 4 and theres an added oleophobic coating for smudge resistance. The design looks like an odd mix between a Huawei P8 and an honor 7 especially with that visible camera bump. For audio playback, it does get a pair of front firing speakers and recording is assisted by 3 microphones that double up for noise cancellation. Under the hood, the Nexus 6P runs on a Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. You get more storage options ranging from 32GB, 64GB and 128GB which are also non-expandable.The list of connectivity support, Nexus Imprint and USB Type C are similar as the Nexus 5X but the same 12.3MP camera gets an extra trick of having to support a higher Slow Motion recording of 240FPS. Taking selfies should be better as well as the 6P gets a higher 8MP f/2.4 shooter. In terms of battery, it gets a phablet category 3,450mAh capacity unit which is fitting for the specs it carries. The Nexus 6P is priced from US$499 which is roughly RM2,225 in our current rates.  Both models are quite pricey when compared to mainstream Android smart phones but for the Android purist that want to get the very latest Android might appreciate one of these Marshmallow preloaded smart phones.

Theyre more productive than regular mobile devices; the commonality? A keyboard. Yes, the way we type dictate how productive we are, or at least for the time being.So since weve seen that drafting long-winded text has always been a headache-inducing experience; hence, Google has reworked their existing Pixel brand to encase a new screen and bluetooth keyboard combination in the form of the Pixel C(onvertible).Could this be a direct answer to the dwindling tablet sales? Convergence devices have a chance to occupy some market share and it seems that most manufacturers are coming up with some sort of variation to tackle this problem.Omitting kickstands and clasps, yet maintaining its rigidity, the device attempts to be a tablet but combining the keyboard through magnets allows you to immediately start your full-on typing jobs. Adjustable to angles from 100 to 135 degrees, when attached, the presentation showed that you can handle it in an array of angles, not coming apart even without being grounded.As an add-on, the bluetooth linked keyboard decreases pitch of the key size from the regular keyboards 19mm (13-inch), to the Pixel Cs 18.8mm pitch; the size of keys center to center from each other. It also features a 1.4mm key travel, so typing wont be too annoying. Stowing the typing add-on is easy, simply placing it under the tablet. Battery-wise it charges inductively when closed through the tablet itself, and a few minutes a day will keep the small keyboards battery fully charged, otherwise the keyboard will last for roughly 2 months.In terms of the tablets internals, it pushes a 2560 x 1800 pixel resolution through its aforementioned 10.2-inch screen thats capable of 500 nits of brightness. Running the engine is a quad-core Nvidia Tegra X1 processor with a Maxwell GPU, mated with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage options are available in two choices; 32GB and 64GB.Youll charge the new Google device through the USB Type-C port, and it has a nifty way of showing the battery percentage, just tap twice on the light bar and itll show you a gauge of the current percentage. As for software, itll run Android OS leaving out ChromeOS out in the cold.Beckoning the question  are they going to market this solely as a combo? Or will they let the tablet do most of the talking? As is, Android tablets have already had third-party options that allow users to add-on a keyboard, so this is nothing spectacularly new from Google.Some details have been left-out for the time being  like the camera optics, type of screen, and battery size but more info will likely be released at a later date to keep anticipation high.The device today was just teased and Google hopes to release the device by the holiday season. Fortunately, they didnt withhold pricing and theyve announced itll cost you $499/RM 2,211 (32GB), $599/RM 2,654 (64GB) and $149/RM 660 for the bluetooth keyboard add-on. Google has set up a product page but for now its really bare bones, you can check it out here.Heres the Google Keynote below (skip over to 1:11:28 for the Pixel C)"
Arif Lee,Make entertainment smarter with Googles new Chromecast devices,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/30/make-entertainment-smarter-with-googles-2015-chromecast-and-chromecast-audio/,"Chromecast,Chromecast 2015,Chromecast Audio,google,Google annoucement,Google Chromecast 2015,Google Chromecast Audio,Google Nexus,Hi-Fi,speaker,stream stick,TV","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-30,"Ousting the 2 year old version, the new 2015 Chromecast is set to once again offer a better way to make your regular devices smarter; unspecific to it just being a TV anymore, with the Chromecast Audio. Coming in at a small form factor of 39.1grams the new streaming stick and its new music-inclined sibling now boast an improved WiFi frequency support, redesigned to now be a circle and include an integrated HDMI cable.The pre-existing Chromecast used to look much like a stick with a HDMI head, opting for something a little more discrete and easier to plug in, Google has decided to switch to an integrated cable system to make the device easier plug in to hard-to-reach TV ports. The modern-looking Chromecast 2015 now adds support for a wider WiFi frequency; extending to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz with 802.11 ac bands. These bands have allowed Google to prove that the new device adapts to your WiFi surroundings in your home, giving you the best connection at any given time.Hardware aside, its app experience is now tweaked to give you a better overall time while using the device. Content is now shown on a home-screen but only caters to your personal app list, so if you dont have a certain app, content from it wont be shown. Though, through content discovery, itll show you the available apps that have the content youve choose to search for. Picking up (to) Full HD content on apps like Google Play, YouTube, Spotify and Netflix, users will surely have a lot of shows and movies to choose from.The updated Chromecast app wasnt that slow to begin with but thanks to a pre-fetching option called Fast Play, app developers can allow their systems to decrease app load-times (80% faster in a test). Intrinsically, this pre-fetching extends further to utilise algorithms to pre-download content based on your behaviour  e.g. downloading a small bit of a new episode based on your current episode list. What about mobile gaming? Well, gaming is supported too, casting your screen onto your larger screen  now allowing multiplayer options that let users use their devices as controllers.Google also announced its audio only option with similar capabilities; the Chromecast Audio. As mentioned earlier, itll make your regular devices a little smarter, allowing you to repurpose your older expensive Hi-Fi systems by making them a streaming machine  similarly to a bluetooth speaker BUT you wont be interrupted by phone calls anymore, since the device can run on its own without disturbing your listening.Owners can choose from an extensive list of apps like iHeart Radio, Pandora, Google Play Music (not available in Malaysia), Spotify and etc. Google aims to add to their Chromecast Audio app list throughout its lifetime. Some other perks when comparing it to a bluetooth speaker would be less battery drain, ability to use multiple cross-platform devices to control your new smart-er speaker.Sharing is enabled through audio sharing on the app that gives users on the same network the capability to control music options on the Chromecast Audio. Best thing is, casting is done on the app youre playing your music from, so you wont need to learn an entirely new app just to play music. Later in the year an OTA update will even allow multi-room audio, syncing all your speakers to play from one source.Both devices are readily available in 17 countries (Malaysia left-out) but only cost $35 each (RM 156) and come in 3 colour options  Lemonade, Coral and Black. The devices work with computers or mobile devices that use Android 4.1+, iOS 7.0+, Windows 7, or Mac OS X 10.7 and ChromeOS Well be sure to update everyone if/when the two devices come to Malaysia.

A selling strategy that conjured up to ensure that they sell products at an extremely small profit margin. Their stint so far has proven that while people really want to buy their devices, they cant keep up with the demand. So much so till it has driven Carl Pei to ask Samsung for an internship position, so hell be able to learn about being a bigger name in the market.The Shenzen based company, has faced a lot of hurdles since coming to existence in December 2013. Theyve suffered immense pressure to keep up the supply chain, and even daring to declare themselves as the 2016 Flagship Killer. Maybe Mr Peis intentions of heading to Samsung would be to see how they incorporate Fast Charging in their devices; considering OnePlus didnt include any form of the technology in their 2 devices or perhaps get some insider info on how to kill Samsungs flagship in 2016.Hes even gone on record on his personal blog, stating that since the OnePlus 2, hes learned important lessons from not meeting demands of orders. Adding that the company is working overtime just to get their newest device into the hands of their owners.Its a given really when you intend to have a one-hour open sale that caused those on the invite-list to go mad  why have an open sale when you cant even sell to those already waiting. Were still not sure if they have a proper team handling marketing but at least theyve set out to disrupt the market. Tipping the scales in favour of the consumer, so well have to give lift our hats in that aspect.If the industry evolves, theres likely room for more competition amongst the respective manufacturers  loosely quoting Carl Pei. But this is when it takes the cake, he goes on to say :-Well let you be the judge if this is an honest attempt at reaching out or just another stunt that could lead the brand further down the rabbit hole. Subsequently, the guys at Android Authority managed to dig up Peis LinkedIn account, which shows that the Co-founder has been around. Take a look at the photo below.These kids could offer Carl some insights on how to successfully get an internship opportunity at Samsung.

This is the Piston 3.0 which succeeds its current Piston 2.1 version, thats priced at RM50. The new Mi Piston 3.0 is totally redesigned and gone is the metal chambers that usually come in gold, opting for a more ergonomic design with the use of durable plastic. While the previous version was straight, the new version slopes downward slightly with a 120 degree tilt outwards for a comfortable fit. The diaphragm in the ear piece uses an aerospace-grade metal composite material thats sandwiched between its PET layers for a more balanced output. For optimal mid-range and bass performance, the sound chambers now has a new spiral air flow design which seems to direct sound better into your ear. Designed for smart phone usage, the Mi Piston 3.0 also comes with a microphone module that has your typical volume up, down and selection button. Unlike the previous version where the mic is placed at the splitting end of the cord, it is now located on the right side cable, about 3 inches below the ear piece. The cable still uses kevlar fibre thats encased in a braided sleeve for better durability. From our long term use, the Piston 3.0 is more sleek in design and we find it to fit better in most ears. We know of some users complaining that the metal chambers of the current Piston 2.1 seem to hurt their ears during long usage, and it seems that the new ergonomic design has solved that. Noise isolation is a lot better and terms of quality, the mid-rangers are clearer while the bass is more warmer and full bodied. Overall, this is quite an improvement and the RM19 extra is definitely worth spending.If youre interested, head over to the Mi Store to place your orders. The sale starts today, 29th September at 12:00PM on the official Mi Store. [ SOURCE ]"

Just like the Nexus 6P, a couple of slides have leaked from what appears to be an internal presentation of the latest Lumia 950 and Lumix 950 XL flagship smart phones. NokiaForever initially posted these images but they were later taken them down. The details revealed have reaffirmed a couple of speculations weve heard before. Both Lumia 950 and 950 XL will have Quad HD displays, 20MP Pure View cameras and they will use the new future-proof reversible USB Type C port. While Microsoft is yet to jump onto the fingerprint scanning bandwagon, these new flagships are shown with Iris scanning built-in for Windows Hello. In terms of OS, they would be the first to run on Windows 10 mobile, in line with its current Windows 10 push. The Lumia 950 is the smaller version of the lot with a 5.2 AMOLED display and under the hood, it gets a Snapdragon 808  Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. It will come with 32GB of on-board storage which fortunately is still expandable with microSD. The back gets a 20MP Pureview camera assisted with dual-LED flash while the front will carry a 5MP selfie shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery which supports Qi Wireless charging like its predecessors. Meanwhile the Lumia 950 XL is a larger phablet sized sibling with a 5.7 AMOLED display. The screen isnt the only feature thats upsized as it gets a top of the line Snapdragon 810 processor thats mated to 3GB of RAM with 32GB of on-board storage. While the main camera is the same 20MP PureView unit, the 950 XL gets an extra boost with a triple LED flash light. For selfies, it still retains the same 5MP shooter as the Lumia 950. With a larger screen, the battery has a slightly bigger capacity at 3,300mAh.It has been a while since Microsoft had launched a flagship smart phone and this is probably the biggest upgrade that matches up with its Android rivals.

Think, Richard Mille, Patek Philippe, Franck Muller and the likes, in the watch making industry; similarly the Vertu Signature Touch aims to occupy the same segment, just for smartphones instead.The prices of their newest devices can fetch from between 6,500 all the way to 13,700, a hefty price for a smart phone. Now with premium prices, youd expect a premium product, so what goes into making a smart phone that costs roughly the price of a compact car?First off, well take a look at its exterior (yes, were treating this like a car impression); the device is fashioned out of expensive materials (go figure), youll get polished Grade 5 titanium  the kindyou see in the high-end automotive and aerospace industry. Then we have a 130 carat sapphire crystal display ensuring youll have the best viewing experience. Lastly, the materialthat surrounds most of the smart phone is leather, and not just any type of leather; were talking calfskin, lizard and alligator hides from the best tanneries in Europe.But wait, what about its specs? In this department, the Signature Touch is no slouch either, accompanying its expensive exterior is a 64-bit Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, mated with 4GB of RAM. Its screen is a 5.2-inch Full HD display, protected by the aforementioned sapphire crystal, while the internal memory is supported by 64GB of storage and features a MicroSD slot (support up to 2TB) that comes with a 64GB card inside.The devices rear camera stands at a pretty 21-megapixels with phase detect autofocus and a twin Dual-tone LED flash providing better colour accuracy when lit. Moving over to the front, youll get a satisfactory 2.1-megapixel wide aperture sensor for those (expensive) selfies.Vertus Signature Touch promises to pack a punch when audio is concerned, thanks to its duo of stereo speakers enhanced by Dolby Digital Plus surround sound decoding. For connectivity its equipped with the full WiFi spectrum (a/b/g/n/ac), as well as Bluetooth 4.0, NFC and 4G LTE to boot.Under its titanium housing, youll be pleased to find a 3,160 mAh battery thats readily compatible with Qualcomm QuickCharge 2.0 and also Qi wireless charging.

Well its safe to say that Mr. Chen uses a BlackBerry (10) himself, seeing he tried to swipe up in the video youll see below.Providing an exclusive hands-on, the CEO talked about how the brand identifies to give its customers privacy, security and privilege, while handling the device  that wasnt set up yet.The short time with the device was spent more on how the company has decided to give other OS a go, since they cant keep up with competitors app ecosystem. He also gave us a look at the slider in action, mentioning that the QWERTY keyboard will have capacitive keys.Recapping the rumoured specs, the Priv runs a 6-core Snapdragon 808 processor and3GB of RAM under the hood. Curved in nature (a first for BlackBerry) the 5.5-inch screen is purported to display in Quad HD resolution.For its camera, itll be sporting an 18-megapixel rear shutter with dual-LED flash, while the front gets a 5-megapixel camera. As you saw on the video, the Priv runs Android; apparently 5.0 but itll also have some of the BlackBerry exclusive apps like BlackBerry Hub.A stumble for sure, perhaps BlackBerry couldve asked their top technology guy to handle the preview of the device instead. Hopefully theyll buck up during their launch presentation, or at least get the demo unit set up properly  as it is estimated to launch around November.If youre a BlackBerry user, tell us what you think about the notion of switching over to Android in the comments below.[ SOURCE ]"

Our lives are now more reliant on technology to tackle the issues and problems that we face  in medicine, teaching impairments, home tech, and etc.An avenue to power these solutions and ideas has already been in the works with Samsung lending a platform through its Solve for Tomorrow competition globally held in the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore and now, Malaysia. A competition that challenges the minds and market-savviness of university students in the aforementioned disciplines to provide conceptualised solutions tasked at handling topical issues and day-to-day STEM related challenges faced by Malaysians.Facilitating these ideas through the competition platform that pits 20 teams to pitch their concepts to a panel that have been in the industry long enough to tell whether these ideas are worth investing in. A final third tier pitching conducted earlier this month was to narrow down the 20 groups to a top 10 public presentation and to a final 3 groups that stand to receive a RM 20,000 (each) seed grant; Samsung Malaysia has also taken upon themselves to provide an internship experience and devices to go along with their learning trip to Samsung HQ, in South Korea.Judging their pitches and works of innovation are a panelist of 5 well-versed individuals:Teams were given only 5 minutes to present their ideas together with their stage 3 beta prototypes, followed by another 5 minutes for a Q&A session with the panelist above. Taking the stage, the 10 groups sent their representatives each having to showcase their prototypes and address the problems they chose to tackle.An unassuming trend was starting to form when they announced the winning top 3; all of them had their own ways of benefiting the field of medicine. In no particular order, the winners were:Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (LEE)  a mechanical based exoskeleton that serves to help those with walking impairments, enabling them to stand and walk for longer periods. The group of boys from TARUC Selangor managed to get their 3rd prototype to only cost RM 150 (approx) and be light enough to promote ease of use.Flex Controlled Electrical Wheelchair  based at the same university as previously mentioned group, this team managed to put together an electronic wheelchair that utilises a flex sensing technology to allow motorised movement through bending movements. It will be meant for disabled groups that have difficulty in moving their hands to adjust joysticks of the current generation of motorised wheelchairs.Interactive and Portable Rehabilitation for the Disabled (IPRD)  a device purposed towards rehab patients going through physiotherapy, data can be recorded and analysed on the sensors attachment to determine rate of fatigue and instances when muscles fail. The wearable device interacts with computer or mobile games that uses motion controls through Bluetooth; making the whole experience a lot more fun and gratifying. Some noteworthy groups that didnt make the top 3 include the following:Insects Zapper  a team of foundation students from TARUC that defined the current-age of fly-swatters and insect zappers to be a level below their own creation; a bendable zapper that improves efficiency to rid homes and other spaces of flying insects. This young teams focus was to lessen energy exertion while improving the devices impact resistance. A feat that lead them winning the peoples choice awards.Mosquito Buster  an ultrasonic humidifying system that uses a combination of water and lemongrass to repel mosquitoes from inhibiting a large area. The team from UNITEN tested their prototypes around campus (a top 10 dengue site) and after which, cases were non-existent.6-Sense  a passive way of detecting blood glucose levels; an amazing invention made for diabetic patients that have to face constant finger pricking and blood-testing to monitor their sugar levels. The wearable system itself is in the form of a glove, enhanced by infrared sensors to detect blood glucose under the skin. However, KDU student Lim Wai Xiang didnt manage to get the prototype to work when demonstrating earlier in the day.At Malaysias first Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition they saw 108 submissions from their 5 Demo Days held at selected universities across 5 states. Next year they hope to make it greater and bigger to allow more public and private university students a chance at solving the societys STEM related problems.

Our fur coated pals couldnt be bothered of photo-taking, since it brings no benefit to them but now theres the ball to grab their attention.More of a ball holder (which probably can be compatible with any tennis ball), the mount attaches itself on your mobile device; the Kickstarter page does highlight that the Pooch Selfie is made specially for iPhones and Samsung Galaxys but it should work normally across most smartphones and tablets (if youre into that kind of thing).
As the squeaky ball is round, itll work in either orientation, be it front-facing selfies, or rear camera portraits. Well, this idea is a good one, provided that your pet is actually attracted to the ball though if it starts to lose interest, the ball squeaks  yet again all depending on how amused your pet is.Clever Dog Products, the makers behind this project has sought $7,000 and have came up with the amount in less than 12 days; if youre interested in funding this witty product, head on over here to back this project  you have 18 more days to do so.Itll cost the following:Whatre you waiting for?

Launched today for the Malaysian market, we are getting the Axon Elite which comes with a 5.5 Full HD IPS display and a top of the line Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. In terms of design, it gets a unibody aluminium back with some faux leather elements for the top and bottom. Size wise, it feels quite compact for a 5.5 incher. Over at the front, the display along with its 3 capacitive buttons are flanked by a pair of metal girder design grills. For imaging, it gets a pair of cameras at the back which consists of a 13MP main and a 2MP secondary unit. Meanwhile at the front, it gets a 8MP camera which also doubles up as an iris scanner dubbed as EyePrint ID. To unlock using your eyes, it isnt instant as you would need to swipe downwards on the lock screen and wait for about 2-3 seconds for it to work its magic. Alternatively you could also unlock with a fingerprint scanner thats mounted at the back or via its voice recognition feature. The ZTE Axon Elite also boast a AKM 4961 HiFi Chip, NFC and a dual-SIM slot which doubles up as a microSD expansion on the 2nd SIM tray. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery which supports QuickCharge 2.0. At the moment, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop and it comes only in Ion Gold colour.The ZTE Axon Elite is priced at RM1,999 and it will be available sometime in mid-October. Being the underdog in the flagship space, the price is quite steep considering there are plenty of high-end devices in this price range."

Apple has officially announced that Malaysia will be getting the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on the 16th October. This will be 3 weeks after its initial first wave release in countries including Singapore, Australia, US and the UK.In its recent release, Apple claims to have sold more than 13 million units of the latest iPhone 6s/6s Plus in the first 3 days, which sets a new record. For the month of October, 40 more countries will join the list beginning with its 2nd wave on 9th October, followed by the 3rd wave in 10th October and finally the 4th wave on 16th October which includes Malaysia.The following are the full release schedule:If youve been resisting the temptation to pick up an imported unit, looks like your patience has paid off. With the official launch date announced, we should be seeing a drop in pricing in the days to come. This is probably the fastest iPhone roll out yet as we are getting it within a month since its global release. Price wise, do expect to pay more especially with the recent price hike and our poor exchange rate against other countries. The new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are visibly the same as the previous iPhone 6/6 Plus with the exception of a new Rose Gold colour as pictured above. However it gets a significant upgrade underneath with an improved aluminium 7000 shell while the display has 3D touch which is similar to the Apple Watchs Force Touch. The performance claims to be double of its predecessor with a new A9 chip thats mated with 2GB of RAM. For taking pictures, the iPhone 6s gets a larger 12MP main sensor while the iPhone 6s Plus model gets added Optical Image Stabilisation. For selfies, you can expect better and brighter pictures with a 5MP front cam which uses the Retina Display as a soft flash in low light situations.

The Nexus 6P is a 5.7 phablet made by Huawei while the smaller Nexus 5X is an upgrade of the former Nexus 5 thats made by LG. Ahead of the official event, the spec sheet of the Nexus 5X has been revealed and it is definitely a mid-ranger compared to its bigger Nexus 6P sibling. Head after the break for the full list.For starters, the front gets a 5.2 display that pushes a Full HD resolution with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. Thats slightly bigger than the Nexus 5 and the size should be perfect for single handed use. Powering the Nexus 5X is a 2.0GHz Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor which is pretty decent but it is mated to only 2GB LPDDR3 RAM. For storage, it comes only in 16GB or 32GB storage options without expandable microSD. In the imaging department, the main camera is a 12.3MP f/2.0 shooter with a larger 1.55 M pixel size and it comes assisted with IR laser auto focus and dual LED flash. For the front, it gets a 5MP f/2.2 camera with a standard 1.4 M pixel size. Interestingly, the cameras are similar to what was rumoured for the Nexus 6P. As supported natively with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Nexus 5X also comes with a rear mounted fingerprint scanner and it uses the future proof USB Type C connector port. Theres no mention of the battery size but the feature list promises all day battery life. We can only hope that LG can do better this time round as the previous Nexus 5 battery comes with just 2,300mAh capacity. With Android M, users can expect improved battery life as demonstrated on the Nexus 5. With such specs, this should be geared towards value conscious customers compared to its top end Nexus 6P. According to Android Police, the Nexus 5X is priced from US$379.99 for the 16GB version, which is about RM1,687 with the current US$1=RM4.44 exchange rate. Meanwhile the Nexus 6P with 32GB storage could carry a US$499.99 (about RM2,215) price tag. What do you guys think?[ SOURCE ]"

With about 2 days to go, the purported presentation slides for the Nexus 6P have surfaced online, revealing almost everything you need to know about the latest phablet. Firstly, the new Nexus 6P is the first Nexus flagship to feature an all metal build. Instead of a 6 incher (5.96) like the current Motorola based Nexus 6, the new 6P thats made by Huawei is going for a slightly smaller 5.7 display. It pushes a Quad HD resolution thats protected by Gorilla Glass 4. Accompanying the display is a pair of front ported speakers similar to its predecessor. Under the metal body, the Nexus 6P runs on Qualcomms Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor thats found on most flagships today. Theres no mention of RAM but it comes with a variety of storage sizes  32GB, 64GB and 128GB. As usual, theres no expandable storage via microSD.For the first time on a Nexus, it will get USB Type-C which supports both faster data transfer and Quick Charge. At the back, theres also a fingerprint scanner, that lets you unlock or skip passwords at a single touch.For imaging, the deck didnt reveal exact pixel count numbers but its Nexus Camera is said to have been improved for better low light shots. Paired with its Google camera app, it promises quicker capture while keeping your subject in focus. We have a hunch that this could be a Sony IMX230 21MP sensor with Phase Detection AF like the honor 7.UPDATE: According to Android Police which has gotten a couple of more slides, the camera is confirmed to be a 12.3MP f/2.0 unit that comes with a larger 1.55 M pixel size which allows more light. Meanwhile at the front, it is expected to carry a 8MP camera that has a standard 1.4 M pixel size. With a 3,450mAh capacity battery, the Nexus 6P weighs 178 grams. Thats quite remarkable as it is 230mAh more than the current Nexus 6 but it is still lighter by 6 grams. The biggest change in terms of experience is definitely Android M as it comes with a couple of tweaks on app management, power efficiency and native support for more features including a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C. UPDATE: The Nexus 6P could be priced  at US$499.99 (about RM2,215) for the 32GB storage option.It will be available in 4 colours  Aluminium, Graphite, Frost and Gold, with the last colour surprisingly exclusive initially for Japan. The Nexus 6P and its smaller Nexus 5X will be launched on 29th September at 11:00PM (Malaysian Time). You can check out all the slides in the source link below.[ SOURCE 2 ]"

Most mainstream players have announced their flagships for the 2nd half of this year, which includes the Galaxy Note5, Sony Xperia Z5 and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. If you are expecting HTC to come out with a new flagship to close the gap, you could be in for a disappointment. The new HTC Aero was initially rumoured to run on MediaTeks top of the line Helio X20 processor that comes with 10 cores. However based on the recent information from @evleaks, the new HTC One A9 is likely to be a premium mid-ranger instead, which is more of a direct competitor to the Galaxy A8 and the OPPO R7 series. Even the model name One A9 seems to be poking fun at Samsungs Galaxy A series. Instead, it gets a more mainstream 5 Full HD display, a Snapdragon 617 processor thats mated with just 2GB of RAM and has 16GB of storage on board. For imaging, it has a 13MP main camera with OIS while the front retains HTCs 4MP Ultra-pixel camera. The Aero is meant to be a fashion centric device with a slender unibody metal design at 7mm thick. As usual, HTC is rumoured to pack a smaller battery with just 2,150mAh capacity. As seen in the new pic above, theres a fingerprint scanner at the front but surprisingly it is missing a speaker grill at the bottom. Just a few hours ago, @evleaks has also shared the 6 colour options available, which looks like a collection of iPod Touches. In summary, this isnt going to replace its current One M9 but instead it is a possible successor of the former HTC One S. The new HTC One A9 is expected to be released in November and hopefully this could be priced competitively to attract the masses. [ SOURCE, 2 ]"

Its generally pretty stable and produces minimal distortion.Its same kind of driver that resides on OPPOs PM-1 headphones that features a FEM-optimized neodymium magnet system as well as seven-layer double side voice coil diaphragm to make it lightweight but still maintains sound quality. The drive also comes in at a rather large 55mm diameter which OPPO claims is tuned to deep, tight bass with a smooth sound signature. That essentially means youre going to be getting some really good sound reproduction."

The positive ones that come to mind would be its camera capabilities, good performance (for an 808 SoC), and satisfactory QHD screen. Consequently, according to this rumour, LG wants to build on what it has going for itself but dont expect it to be out so soon; probably sometime in Q1 next year.Quoting an anonymous report from an insider, the G5 will have the best of what Qualcomm and Sony has to offer, in the processing and camera department. The latter is supposedly going to be an LG exclusive sensor made by Sony; all 20-megapixels worth, boasting a half an inch diagonal size sensor (the biggest yet).Comparing the current-gen lot below:So weve compared the top end cameras of the smart phone world and you guys decided that more pixels dont necessarily mean the best photos, in real life scenarios. It doesnt help either that manufacturers place an absurd amount of emphasis on the number of pixels a camera carries.Problems at the time with Qualcomms hot Snapdragon 810 processor saw LG look off and choose the 808 SoC instead; lets keep our fingers crossed that the 820 is the product of Qualcomm learning from theirpast and theyve managed to keep it cool. So its safe to say the LG G5 will deliver in processing power  however there have been leaks of LG developing its own signature chipset.Rumours are rumours, so dont be too excited for now; nonetheless, well wait till Q1 2016 to see if theres any weight to this news.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

From the appearance, it looks the same as the Gear VR Innovator Edition which weve reviewed but there are some notable differences.Firstly it loses the top strap that goes across your head, leaving just the side straps to secure the Gear VR in place. While on the right side, it gets a redesigned touch pad that has visible directional groves which supposedly give you better controls. Still retained is a back button and a volume rocker thats placed near the front.In terms of experience, the specs remain unchanged with a 96 degree field of view and a 54-70mm IPD Coverage.

Rolling on those releases, the unannounced Lenovo device (possibly camouflaged to actually be the Vibe X3), has shown itself in certification associations in Malaysia and China.Theres still some uncertainty surrounding the whole matter though, as the supposed successor to the Vibe X2 had already been seen on TENNAs site; only carrying a different spec sheet and additional Vibe branding on the back.Luckily the newest report has some backing  benchmarked carrying a 5.5-inch Full HD screen (1920 x 1080), a six-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 and 3GB of RAM. Itll also have 64GB of internal memory (no mention of expandability), a 21-megapixel camera and finger-print sensor combo on the back, while upfront it receives an 8-megapixel snapper. Overall, it is quite a huge step up from its former Vibe X2.Cellular connections will be managed by a dual-SIM LTE enabled slot, while the device runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and is powered by a huge 3,500 mAh battery; fitting, as Lenovo has a knack for putting large batteries in their devices.Since Lenovos acquisition of Motorola and the announcement that they plan to dissolve their Mobile division to sell under the Motorola name, their design language has shifted  as you can tell from the photos, the speaker grills and less aggressive curves tell the tale.The same device has already been spotted in the wild, at a 2015 Chinese Telecommunications Expo, no less; so it definitely exists, but no confirmations of specs are to be seen.When will we see it being released and what specs will it carry? Your guess is as good as ours, but itll be soon enough, if the certification appearances are anything to lead on.

Alexander Wong,You can buy the iPhone 6s in Malaysia and heres how much itll cost you,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/26/buy-iphone-6s-malaysia-latest-pricing/,"AP Set,apple,Buy iPhone 6S,DirectD,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6S Malaysia Price,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia Price,iPhone 6S Plus Price,iPhone 6S Plus Pricing,iPhone 6S Price,iPhone 6S Pricing,Lazada,SatuGadgetDotCom","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-26,"UPDATE: The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus comes to Malaysia officially on 16th October. The iPhone 6s and its bigger iPhone 6s Plus went on sale since yesterday in first wave countries which includes Singapore. For us in Malaysia, it would probably take months before it gets here officially and thats despite the latest Apple duo making an appearance in our SIRIM database . If you cant wait, our enterprising retailers are always there to fulfill the need of those who want the latest. Most of these units are likely to be from Singapore due to proximity and more favourable prices, based on our current exchange rates. Want to buy the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus? We compared the current deals offered by DirectD, SatuGadget and Lazada Malaysia for your easy reference. Check them out after the break. 
Getting an iPhone in Singapore is quite expensive to start with, no thanks to our current 1 SGD = RM3.08 exchange rate. Being an import or AP set, theres an obvious premium to pay on top of the original price. The cheapest iPhone 6s with 16GB can be yours starting from RM3,559 on SatuGadget but this is limited to the more classic Silver and Space Grey colours. Meanwhile, the phablet sized iPhone 6s Plus starts from RM4,699 for 16GB from both SatuGadget and Lazada. Across the board, the gold colours would cost more due to anticipated higher demand and it is more extravagant for the new pinkish Rose Gold. If you do plan on shooting lots of 4K videos, it is advisable to give the 16GB model a pass and go for at least 64GB. If money is no object to you, the iPhone 6s Plus with 128GB storage is sold starting at RM5,945 on Lazada and it goes up to RM7,288 for the Rose Gold colour option. Thats seriously a lot of money to pay and history has always proven that there are always people willing to spend that insane amount. UPDATE: The iPhone 6s/6s Plus will be launched in Malaysia officially on 16th October. Better to wait for the official sets which are also available on contract from our telcos. UPDATE 2 (29/9/2015): Some sellers have started throwing price with the iPhone 6s 16GB going for as low as RM3,199 on Lazada. Thats below the market price since it is priced at S$1,048 in Singapore, which is about RM3,282. For a more sensible purchase, you can probably wait until sometime in November when it is expected to launch officially in Malaysia. Looking at Apples constant price hike in Malaysia, do expect to pay more compared to previous years. The prices above are correct at time of writing and they are subject to change without prior notice. You can check out the iPhone 6s/6s Plus listings in the links below:

Codenamed internally as the Venice, serial leakster @evleaks has revealed BlackBerry Priv as the official commercial name. The name Priv sounds more edgier than the current models that sounded more regular like the Passport, Classic and Leap. Probably sounds fitting since this is BlackBerrys first diversion into a competing OS. After all it has been a while since BlackBerry makes a QWERTY slider device like the BlackBerry Torch. To recap on the specs, the BlackBerry Priv is said to be running on a Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. The front display is a 5.4 unit thats expected to push a Quad HD resolution. The back camera is a 18MP unit with dual-LED flash while selfies are handled by its front 5MP shooter. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop but it gets BlackBerrys own proprietary apps including BlackBerry Hub. Based on earlier rumours, this should be launched sometime in November and hopefully it arrives in Malaysia in time for Christmas.

The front display is a 5 inch IPS panel that does Full HD resolution, giving a pixel density of 441ppi. With glass on both front and back, it is toughen with Gorilla Glass 3 for better resistance to scuffs. Under the hood, it uses a 64-bit 1.3GHz Octa-Core MediaTek MT6753 processor thats also powering the Meizu M2 Note. In terms of RAM and storage, it gets 3GB and 32GB respectively which is expandable with microSD up to 64GB. Like most dual-SIM devices, the microSD slot is shared with its 2nd sim slot.

Codenamed Envoy the new band could feature a more refined design, allowing the display to be viewed in different angles, and not justunder your wrist anymore.On the surface, the images seem to confirm the notions of earlier reports by the group at Windows Central; mentioning the curved display and possibility of expanding the devices availability to include more countries.Microsofts second generation wearable handles the problem of ergonomics and viewing angles that were faced by its predecessor. The tech giant has also moved the battery from the sides to underneath the coloured display. Itll also include an altimeter; if we understood what Microsoft Insider reported as sensor to measure the height of an exercise.Accented with what looks like metal on its side, the Band 2 will supposedly include an optical heart sensor, accelerometer/gyrometer, GPS tracking, a microphone, ambient light sensor, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and UV sensor.Being the City That Never Sleeps, NYC will host the Microsoft event on the 6th of October  rounding off a busy few weeks thats already seen the city host Apple and soon to go ahead with LG as well.

Considering the brand has been hit hard even in Korea, its assumed that adding devices to their existing inventory could boost sales; especially since they have yet to refresh the LG G Pro 2 that was released early last year.Touted as the aforementioned phablets successor, the LG V10 is seen to be the makers answer to their domestic rivals, Samsung  a move that saw the LG G Pro 2 rival the then Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Much alike their rivals with their styluses, LG seeks to add their own twist to the mobile device world (while still copying some cues from who else, Samsung) by adding this ticker display.A similar rendition of Samsungs Galaxy Note Edge, that allows users to have a continuousinfo-stream on the smaller display, while the devices main display is off. But for a better viewing experience, the LG V10s tickerdisplay is horizontal, so no need to turn your head or the device in horizontal orientation to view notifications  assuming that it offers the same features as the Note Edge.When looks are considered, it pretty much takes a lot after the LG G4, more so due to the lower front being empty, as the button placements are all on the back. A backing which seems to have a textured finish, based on photos.That aside, itll sport a 5.7-inch main display that pushes QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution, while the secondary smaller notification-like display has no mention of its pixels. In terms of its processor, the V10 is rumoured to carry the tried and true 6 cored Snapdragon 808 processor; aimed to play it safe and forgoissues with the Qualcomm 810s overheating. It will have 3GB of RAM and a standard 64GB of internal memory; no mention of a microSD slot, unfortunately.Camera optics however stand at a supposed 16-megapixels for the rear camera, together with laser auto-focus and dual-LED flash but the front is where it takes an expected turn. From the image provided, it looks like LGs V10 will have some form of dual-front facing cameras  then again these are leaks so lets not dwell much further. It could simply just be an LED flash but there is information stating that the front camera will be a 5-megapixel sensor.Rounding off, the home button might have been redesigned to house a finger-print sensor but were just speculating off TENAAs earlier report. For now thats pretty much all there is about this new LG device but with October the 1st not long away, the New York announcement should answer all our questions about this phablet.[ SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,The Pebble Time Goes Round. The thinnest and lightest round smart watch you can buy,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/24/the-pebble-time-goes-round-the-thinnest-and-lightest-round-smart-watch-you-can-buy/,"Pebble,Pebble Smart Watch,Pebble Time,Pebble Time Round,Pebble Time Round order,Round Smart Watch,Smart Watch","Mobile Devices,Smart Watch",2015-09-24,"Not too long after releasing its Pebble Time series, Pebble has just introduced its new Pebble Time Round. Moving away from the typical square and toyish design, the new Pebble looks like a traditional watch with a variety of colours and bands to match. Furthermore, it is the lightest and thinnest smart watch yet weighing from just 28 grams with a thickness of 7.5mm. Like the new mainstream smart watches, the Pebble Time Round comes in 2 strap sizes, a 14mm size for the ladies and a broader 20mm version for men. It is slightly narrower than the typical 22mm size on the previous Pebbles and the bands are easy to swap with its quick change mechanism. For now, it comes with just leather bands and the metal versions would be made available later. In total there are 3 options (Silver, Rose Gold, Black) available for the 14mm Pebble Time Round and just 2 (Black and Silver) for the larger 20mm version.In terms of design, it looks pretty sleek with its marine grade stainless steel body and the watch display is an always-on colour E-Paper unit, just like the Pebble Time. It has the same buttons with a back button on the left and the typical 3 navigation buttons on the right, so usability hasnt changed if youre using the current Pebble Time. It still gets a built-in microphone thats used for voice commands. When compared to other smart watches, youll notice a much thicker bezel but Pebble somewhat has managed to mask it with a variety of patterns from circular lines to numeric markers for the hour and minutes. The biggest sacrifice of going round and thin would be its battery life. Instead of the usual 7 to 10 days of use, the Pebble Time Round is rated to last just up to 2 days on a single charge. According to Pebble this is a worthy trade off for style and the new Time Round also supports quick charge, giving 24 hours of use with a quick 15 minutes charge. So a full charge for 2 days use in theory can be done in just 30 minutes, which is heaps faster than the Apple Watch. Charging is still done with its magnetic USB charger that snaps onto the back of the watch. Another trade off for the Pebble Time Round is it isnt as water resistant as before. On the previous Pebbles including the Time Steel, it can be submerged under 30 metres of water with its 5 ATM rating. The Pebble Time Round however is only splash resistant even with its IPX7 rating. The product page has explicitly mentioned: Pebble Time Round is splash resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to waterlike unforeseeable rainwont ruin your device, but submerging the watch is not recommended.No doubt the Pebble Time is more basic in smart features as compared to the Moto 360, Samsung Gear S2, Huawei Watch and LG Urbane. For Pebble, it isnt about cramming the most tech but the main focus is on building a functional watch that tells the time 24/7 without sleep with the capabilities of notifications and apps. It is a pretty looking thing but we expected them to at least maintain the impressive 7 days of battery life. The good thing about Pebble is that it supports both Android and iOS devices, giving it a wider compatibility than other smart watches out there. If youre interested, it is available for pre-orders now at US$249.99 (RM1,095) with shipping to start sometime in November. Want something simpler? The original Pebble Classic is now going for US$99 (RM438). [ SOURCE, 2 ]"

With Samsung dominating benchmarks with its own in house developed components, you wont be surprised to see Meizu putting the best possible specs to raise the bar higher.At 5.7 inch, it has the same display size as the Galaxy Note5 and home ground rival Mi Note. Instead of having a Quad HD display, Meizu is settling for a more traditional Full HD AMOLED display that comes encased under a 2.5D glass. Design wise, it retains the same unibody metal design as the past flagships like the MX4 Pro and the MX5. At the front, it has a home button that doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. The new generation fingerprint scanner is said to be quicker with 0.5 second response time when touched in any direction. The hardware underneath is where it gets a little interesting. It runs on the same Exynos 7420 processor as the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5 thats mated to either 3GB or 4GB of DDR4 RAM. On top of that, it also utilises Samsungs Universal Flash Storage (UFS 2.0) which is faster and more efficient compared to typical eMMC 5.0 storage. With its own optimisation, the Meizu PRO 5 smashes the Galaxy S6 in Antutu benchmarks scoring over 77,000 points. There are 2 variants available, with the 3GB RAM paired with 32GB of storage, while the higher 4GB RAM variant gets 64GB of storage. In the imaging department, the back gets Sonys new IMX230 21MP camera with Phase Detection AF, Laser Auto Focus assistance and dual-LED flash. Meanwhile the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter that comes with its own beautification features. For sound, the PRO 5 boasts Hi-Fi quality audio with its additional ES9018K2M DAC and OPA1612 OP Amp. Keeping the lights on, the Meizu PRO 5 is juiced up by a 3,050mAh capacity battery which comes with its mCharge 2.0 feature. With a faster 24W fast charger, it can charge up from 0-65% in just 30 minutes. Thats faster than Samsung but it is still a notch below OPPOs VOOC Flash Charger that does 0-75% in the same duration. Meizu has also ditched the old school microUSB port for a reversible USB Type C thats currently used on the latest MacBook, OnePlus 2, Nokia N1 and the recently announced Xiaomi Mi 4c.   In terms of connectivity, it supports dual-SIMs with 4G LTE and the 2nd slot accepts microSD with expandable storage up to 128GB extra. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.1 but with a heavily skinned FlymeOS 5.0 running on top. The Meizu PRO 5 is priced at 2,799CNY (about RM1,908) for the 32GB version while its bigger 64GB model is priced at 3,099CNY (about RM2,112). Thats quite a huge step up from its previous flagships, encroaching the price range of its mainstream rivals. Nevertheless, it is still quite an interesting alternative considering it packs the same high performance hardware as the Galaxy S6. For more info, you can check out the Meizu PRO 5 product page."

Storage options will leave users with 32GB of internal memory, while youll get a microSD slot to calm your memory capacity woes  utilises the only nano-SIM tray of the micro + nano hybrid tray.Camera optics on the other hand get you a decent 13-megapixel shutter that has a dual-tone LEDs to brighten your photos.

To put it shortly, the code needs it so it can fake alerts to trick you to reveal personal data or read and change any information on your copy clipboards  including password management apps.

In addition, it is now able to display on its side while charging and theres a new time travel feature which lets you check your past and upcoming appointments from the watch face. Probably the biggest change is the support for independent watch apps that would work standalone. To get watchOS 2, you must first update your current iPhone to the latest iOS 9. Once thats done, launch the Apple Watch app, and head over to My Watch > General > Software Update. To install, the watch needs to have at least 50% of battery life and it must be connected to the magnetic charger in order to proceed. Once the update is done, your Apple Watch will reboot itself.If you cant get the update to work, iMore has suggested a few troubleshooting steps. First you can try switching on Airplane mode and off again for both the Apple Watch and your iPhone. If that still doesnt work, you can try restarting both devices or re-pair the watch from scratch.

Speculated to be a phablet, replacing the LG G Pro 2, todays launchconfirms that LG might still have another device up its sleeve (excluding the V10 thats supposed to be on October the 1st).The Korean phone maker is changing it up this time around, as their latest device is more metal than ever before, carved out of a single block of metal, this unibody device carries a 5-inch (1280 x 720) display. A let down to many that in this generation feel that screens should at least be 1080p but moving along, its designed with 2.5D curved glass  easing ergonomics for those concerned but being a 5-inch device, it should be a non-issue.Other internals include 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage (expandable). The mid-ranger will be equip with 4G LTE, NFC but only have a 2,050 mAh battery on board; fueling reasons to why they may have chosen the lowly Quad-core Snapdragon 410 chip, that clocks at only 1.2GHz.The device weighs in at 147grams and runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. So far the LG Class has been classified as a domestic-only product but if youre still interested it retails at KRW 399,300 aka RM 1,451 (at that price, youll be able to purchase the ASUS Zenfone 2 or the OnePlus 2, if you can get an invite). That said, were not sure what direction LG is going for but if they manage to price this lower and team up with Korean telcos well enough, they just may see some market demand.Do tell us what you think about LGs new device, does it compete well at its price-range? Would you buy it? Do you like the direction LGs design team is heading towards (with more metal and less polycarbonate)?[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Unfortunately things doesnt seem to go well as planned. Like the name suggests, the Move to iOS app is designed to make switching from Android to an iPhone easier. It allows you to transfer existing photos, messages, contacts, calendars and more over WiFi. With Android die hard fans seeing this as a blasphemous act, they had raged a Review war by downloading the app and then leaving some deliberately poor ratings along with some interesting remarks. Some of the comments are hilarious with one claiming that he is turning into a sheep and another reporting the app is fake as it turned his LG G3 into a BlackBerry curve. There are those that are demanding Google to remove such app as Apple themselves would not allow such app to exist on their own App Store.

Nope, you wont even need to lose any of your vital organs to get it and it is easier than you think. In a populous country with over a billion people, China surprisingly is in dire need to fill up 18 sperm banks around the country. Struggling to attract new donors, they have started a campaign that offers an easier way of obtaining an iPhone 6s. All they need to do is to make a donation at a sperm bank. The Hubei Human Sperm Bank had sent out a message over WeChat that links to an article entitled New ways to get an iPhone 6s. Inside it explains that the bank is seeking donors aged 22 to 45, with each to receive 5,000 CNY (about RM3,321) in subsidies. This in return would make them a step closer of buying an iPhone 6s thats priced at 5,288 CNY (about RM3,512). So far theres no word of its reception but the intimate deal has managed to get quite a lot of attention recording over 400,000 reads. You must be wondering why sperm donation is a concern in China considering they have strict population control. According to a research by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, the sperm fertility of Chinese males has been dropping by 1% each year since the 80s.

So far it isnt clear it the microUSB to Type C adapter comes included in the box, but do expect this to be priced cheaply if sold separately. The rest of the specs are pretty much the same as before with a 5 Full HD display, 2GB of RAM and the option of 16GB or 32GB of storage. For cameras, it would be utilising a 13MP main sensor at the back while the front gets a 5MP shooter. Battery is said to be more than 3,000mAh which is likely to be of the same capacity as the Mi 4i. Xiaomis Weibo page has been teasing its upcoming event with the title the prince is coming. Since this is a Chinese market device, we are not too sure if it will be sold outside mainland China.

So what about the 5.7-inch phablet we saw in the Geekbench benchmarks?Were not quite sure, it seems that there may be two devices out there thats soon to be launched by LG (aside from the V10 in October). Though, the photo also brings confirmation of the Class being built out of real metal, not those faux metal (plastic) shells finishes.Its well possible that LG is trying out this all metal design to combat the brands lack of premium feeling phones, instead of opting for those (good quality) polycarbonate designs that has made their mobile brandwhat it is today. A bid to unseat Samsungs A series perhaps? All we can say is LG G4 didnt perform to the companys expectations so maybe a change of direction might be good for the smartphone maker.What else does this latest report confirm? Only the fact that the images show the branding of one of South Koreas mobile telco carriers, and possible pricing in the aforementioned country  KRW 400,000, roughly translating to RM 1,457.

Apart from the new iPhones, the latest Apple TV with its Bluetooth remote has been spotted with the model number A1625. Also getting the green light is the new iPad mini 4 with both A1538 (WiFi) and A1550 (WiFi + Cellular) making an appearance.

The front camera is now a 5MP shooter and you can use the Retina display for selfie illumination in low light situations.

Our southern neighbour Singapore has commenced its pre-orders last week with actual shipping to start next Friday. If you want to get one, it will cost at least RM3,200 for the 16GB in Singapore, no thanks to current exchange rates. The new iPhone 6s does shoot 4K videos and we strongly advise you not to take the 16GB version if you plan on recording videos a lot.As for the Apple Watch, theres still no news until today and if you want to get one, it is already available in both Thailand and Singapore. iPhone 6s Malaysia SIRIM Certification

Although, the specs dont really deserve a second glance, itll be fully constructed in metal, which could mean LG is changing its stance on its removable battery and plastic bodies for a more premium feel and look.Some things still remain as brand trademarks; seeing the button placements havent moved from the back but there seems to be a thin line that looks like aspeaker grill, now nearing the top.

The camera optics of this device could be either a 12 or 13-megapixel sensor on the rear, assisted by a 5-megapixel camera on the front.Seeing that it carries the 615 chipset, it should come with LTE capabilities and will run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box.LG has already sent out invites for an event on October the 1st, but thats likely the V10, so it possibly means that they arent placing such an emphasis on their supposed phablet.

From their hands-on, the new slider device gets a stock Android looking interface thats shown on a 5.4 like display. It isnt mentioned whether it has an actual curved display but it does have a slight Galaxy S6 edge-like appearance from the front.

The waterproof capability of Sony Xperia flagships lets you to take them where no other smart phones have gone before. With its current highest IP68 ingress rating, on paper you shouldnt have anything to fear as it could withstand being submerged under 1.5 metres of water for up to 30 minutes.With the release of the Xperia Z5 series, it appears that Sony is taking a step back with its waterproof claims. This is quite unusual especially they have been pushing its waterproof claims as a killer unique featureUnder its new waterproof page, the have mentioned the following:This is quite surprising considering Sony has been promoting its use underwater including taking photos and videos in the swimming pool. At one point of time, they even introduced a series of apps designed for underwater use. Perhaps Sony is trying to manage customers expectations since they wont cover damages caused by water in their standard warranty. To ensure its ready for a splash, all ports must be covered fully but theres always a risk that some flaps are not covered properly or its protective rubber lining starts to fail after a long period of time. In short, you can use it underwater but it will be your own responsibility if it is damaged as a result.  Sony isnt the only one having such policy. When the Galaxy S5 was announced with IP67 water and dust resistance, it was marketed as a splash resistant rather than a submersible device. The same goes with the Apple Watch with its IPX7 rating but they are against any use under water.Will this deter you from getting a waterproof Sony Xperia device? Let us know in the comments below.

Alexander Wong,The newly updated iPad mini 4 is the lightest iPad yet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/11/the-newly-updated-ipad-mini-4-is-the-lightest-ipad-yet/,"apple,iPad,iPad Mini,iPad mini 4,iPad mini 4 Malaysia,iPad mini Retina display,lightest ipad","Android,iPad,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-11,"The previous iPad mini 3 was hardly an upgrade. It was just an iPad mini 2 with TouchID and it comes available with a gold colour option. When the iPad Pro was announced yesterday, they managed to slit in the iPad mini 4 into the keynote without much fanfare. So whats new with the iPad mini 4? Surely it is better than the iPad mini 3 and it really is. As usual, theres nothing new with the design so it still retains the unmistakable iPad mini appearance with its unibody aluminium body. However Apple has made some significant changes on the overall dimensions. It is only 6.1mm thin, which is the same as the iPad Air 2, the thinnest for an iPad. In addition, they have also made some weight reductions bringing it down from 331g previously for the WiFi version to just 298.8g. Likewise, the WiFi + 4G Cellular versions which used to weigh 340g on the iPad mini 3 is now just 304g. The display is still the same 7.9 incher but they have improved it with the same fully laminated display as the iPad Air 2 with additional anti reflective coating. In the camera department, it gets the same combo as the bigger iPads with an 8MP f/2.2 main camera which now brings Burst shots and Slow-mo onto an iPad mini. Meanwhile the front still gets the same 1.2MP unit.The most welcome change is the processor, where it gets a newer A8 chip but it is still a notch below the A8X chip thats powering its top of the line iPad Air 2. Apple claims that the A8 is 1.3x faster in processing and 1.6x faster in graphics than the previous A7. With iOS 9 being released very soon, the new Split View feature allowing you to run 2 apps side by side was previously exclusive just to the iPad Air 2, (and now iPad Pro) likely due to processor requirement. The new upgraded processor allows the iPad mini 4 to use split view, so this is good news for multi-taskers that prefer to use a smaller iPad. In terms of connectivity, it supports faster 802.11ac WiFi as well as Bluetooth 4.2. The battery life remains unchanged with up to 10 hours of use in a single charge.You get to pick up the iPad mini 4 in 3 colours  Silver, Space Grey and Gold. So far no word on its Malaysian availability but it wont be as affordable as before especially with the recent price hike due to currency fluctuations.

The current iPhone 6 has just 1GB of DDR3 RAM while their existing iPad Air 2 comes with 2GB RAM. Developer @hamzasood has tinkered around Apples Xcode developer tool and has managed to confirm the amount of RAM on the latest iPhone and iPad. The iPhone 6s comes with 2GB of RAM while the new gigantic 12.9 iPad Pro comes with 4GB of RAM. With added features such as 3D Touch and a Pencil support on the iPad Pro, the extra RAM comes at a right time for seamless multi-tasking. This would be more apparent with iOS 9 with more extensive features including split-screen. The 2GB RAM for the iPhone is the first upgrade since the iPhone 5 and this helps to keep more sessions in memory and less reloading of apps from scratch. So the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus looks like a bigger upgrade than we all expect from the iPhone 6. [ SOURCE 2 ]"

With most new devices offering Quick Charging, Qualcomm is speeding things up with its newly announced Quick Charge 3.0. This shortens the time required to recharge a mobile device so you can get up and running in no time. According to Qualcomm, the new Quick Charge 3.0 is up to 38% more efficient than Quick Charge 2.0 and it can do 0 to 80% charge in just 35 minutes. As comparison, OPPOs VOOC charge does 0-75% in 30 minutes while Samsungs Adaptive Fast Charge on their flagship devices does 0-50% in the same time.Quick Charge 3.0 is available as an option with their newer Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, 620, 618, 617 and 430 processors that are expected to be commercially available next year. It is backward compatible with previous Quick Charge supported devices and it supports various USB standards including the latest USB Type-C. Going down to specifics, Quick Charge 2.0 is able to charge dynamically with 4 voltages  5V, 9V, 12V and 20V. For the newer Quick Charge 3.0, it is able to charge more optimally beween 3.6V to 20V with 200mV increments. This results lower losses, better efficiency and better thermal performance.

Alexander Wong,"iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus announced with upgraded specs, tougher materials and its thicker than before",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/10/iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-announced-with-upgraded-specs-tougher-materials-and-its-thicker-than-before/,"apple,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s announcement,iPhone 6s launch,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia","Android,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"Apple has just announced its new iPhone 6s and the larger iPhone 6s Plus phablet, and like every iPhone S model, it is an update over its previous model without having an all new design. This time around, it is more than just incremental performance upgrades. The new iPhone 6s uses tougher materials to silence its bendgate critics and it incorporates its Force Touch and Taptic engine features from the Apple Watch. Theres also a new colour for the iPhone thats called Rose Gold.This is possibly the biggest iPhone incremental model update since the iPhone 4S.  Like the iPhone 6/6 Plus duo, the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus retains the same 4.7 and 5.5 Retina Display option. No changes in display resolution but underneath its metal unibody shell is an upgraded 64-bit A9 chip that promises up to 70% better performance over its previous A8 processor. The M9 motion co-processor that keeps track of your activities is now integrated onto the A9 chip, which helps to improve performance and battery life. Now it gets the additional ability to track your running as well as your walking pace in addition to steps, distance and elevation. While the overall design looks the same as the previous model, the iPhone 6s/6s Plus is actually slightly bulkier and heavier than its predecessor. This is probably due to its new use of material that comprises of 7000 series Aluminium, the strongest theyve ever fitted on an iPhone and special dual ionexchange process glass which they claim to be the strongest in the smart phone industry. As a result, it adds 0.1-0.2mm to its thickness, width and length. The weight should be noticeably heavier with 14 grams extra on the iPhone 6s (6s: 143g, 6: 129g) and 20 grams more on the iPhone 6s Plus (6s Plus: 192g, 6 Plus: 172g). In terms of colours, Apple is still retaining the same Silver, Space Grey and Gold but it now gets a Rose Gold colour option which is a more feminine with a pink hue. Nothing has changed in terms of storage as Apple continues the same 16GB, 64GB and 128GB capacity options. Personally we wished Apple had killed the 16GB option and set 32GB as the bare minimum for a flagship. After toying around with Force Touch trackpads and watches, the pressure sensitive tech has finally made its way onto the iPhone as 3D Touch. This gives the multi-touch display another form of interaction as it is able to differentiate soft to hard presses. With a gentle touch, you can now preview links while hard presses bring up additional shortcuts and menus on iOS 9. From the home screen, you can jump straight into selfie or slow-mo videos by hard pressing on the camera icon. Alternatively you can jump straight to Inbox or New Message when you do the same on the Mail icon. In short, this is like having a right click function on a computer. Developers can also take advantage of 3D Touch as well with games making use of the finger pressure for additional controls. The iPhone 6s/6s Plus also gets a Taptic engine which gives a more immersive feedback as you force touch into the display. Like the Apple Watch, this gives you a sensation of a glass being tapped or pressing through the glass that feels more realistic than the conventional buzzing vibration. Speaking of touch, the Touch ID fingerprint scanner has been improved with its 2nd generation unit, promising quicker response time than before.As the competition beefs up its camera capabilities, Apple has finally upgraded its iSight camera in pixel count from 8MP to 12MP with f/2.2 aperture. This is the first major camera upgrade since the iPhone 4S. It still gets dual-tone LED flash for more natural lit pictures while the 6s Plus has the additional feature of Optical Image Stabilisation. Finally 4K Video recording is supported and you can make ultra high resolution movies on the fly with its built-in editing tools.For Selfies, the front FaceTime HD camera has been upgraded from 1.2MP to 5MP f/2.4. To illuminate your face in the low light conditions, the new iPhones get Retina Flash, which basically increases the front display brightness by 3X as a light source.  Another neat feature is Live Photos where it starts shooting before the point of shooting a picture until after a few seconds after that. This gives you a short clip which actually consists of multiple shots and it is done automatically on every single photo that you take, which is kind of similar to HTCs Zoe. To preview the Live Photo, just simply press harder onto a picture in the gallery for a quick playback. Only for the US, Apple has introduced its iPhone Upgrade Program where anyone can switch to the latest iPhone every single year. It works quite similar to Maxis Zerolution where you sign up for a 24 months installment plan with an added option to change phone every 12 months. According to Apple, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be priced the same as its predecessor at launch and they have reduced the price of its current models. The iPhone 6 Plus in the US carries the same contract price tag as iPhone 6s. With immediate effect, the iPhone 5C has been discontinued, making the iPhone 5S their new entry-level smart phone available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are still in the market but it is now limited to just 16GB and 64GB options. Colour wise, youre limited to just Space Grey and Silver. So if you want to get a gold iPhone, youll have to go for the very latest model. Pre-order starts this Saturday on 12th September with official sales to begin on 25th September in first wave countries. As usual Malaysia wont be among the early batch of countries but if you want, you can try your luck in Singapore, Australia, China and Hong Kong. When it gets here, we can only assume there will be another round of price hike due to our weakening Malaysian Ringgit against the dollar which currently stands at US$1 = RM4.34. For more info, you can check out the Apple iPhone 6s page."

Malaysia isnt going to be in the first wave for iPhone releases anytime soon. So if youre trying to get your hands on the latest iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, your best bet is to get from the first wave of countries which will commence pre-orders this Saturday, 12th September with stocks shipping on 25th September. This includes Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, United Kingdom and United States.If you got a friend or relative abroad, buying one overseas is better than getting an overpriced unit through enterprising scalpers. So how much does it cost to get one overseas? Head after the break to find out.In our current exchange rates, Australia and Singapore are your best options right now with the iPhone 6S priced below RM3,300 for the 16GB version. Of course, 16GB wont cut it for most power users so the 64GB iPhone 6S option is the next alternative but be prepared to fork out around RM3,800 for it. Surprisingly the iPhone 6S in 64GB, iPhone 6S Plus in 64GB/128GB are cheaper in Australia but do note that these are based on the todays rates. If dont mind paying more to be among the first to use it, you can start pre-ordering this Saturday at 3.01PM in Singapore or 5.01PM in Australia Eastern Standard Time. As the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus took about 2 months from its official announcement to arrive in Malaysia, the newer models could be launched here sometime in November. Looking at how Apple increased the price for several iPhones and iPads today, getting the latest models would be an expensive affair but theres always people willing to pay that extra premium for a shinny new Apple product."

Significant jumps in each category; that sees Apple also adding more internal storage (32GB or 64GB), a better WiFi radio (802.11ac) and even a redesigned tvOS.A great operating system that will see the Apple TV now support Apps and have an accelerometer and gyroscope on its newest remote. Connectors on the small black box are similar on past editions, a power, HDMI and an ethernet port.With an addition of the app store for tvOS, Apple hopes that its third-party developers will expand and further the devices functionality that places a new emphasis on gaming.

Since it is new, theres only a handful of products available which includes the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C and the Galaxy S6. With the recent price hike for the iPhone 6 in Malaysia, U Mobile appears to be the only telco selling the device outright on prepaid and it is a more affordable than the usual market price.With its U Mobile Prepaid bundles, the iPhone 6 16GB costs just RM1,982 and it calculates to just RM2,395.60 in total inclusive of the required top up and refundable upfront payment. Thats cheaper than the RM2,699 asking price for the same unit without contract. Since U Mobile prepaid has no contract, you can leave at anytime but youll lose out the potential savings from the upfront payment rebates that goes into your credit balance over 24 months. Still, this is a better option than buying one outright.If you look at the iPhone 6 Plus offer, the largest 128GB is going for RM3,381 all in (inclusive of GST, upfront top up and payment). Thats cheaper than the iPhone 6 Plus 64GB priced at RM3,699 currently. Interested?

Alexander Wong,The iPhone and iPad gets another price hike in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/10/the-iphone-and-ipad-gets-another-price-hike-in-malaysia/,"Apple Malaysia,iPad,iPad Air,iPad Air 2,iPad Air 2 Malaysia,iPad Air 2 Malaysia price,iPad Mini,iPhone,iPhone 5C,iPhone 6,iPhone 6 Malaysia,iPhone 6 Plus,iPhone 6 Plus Malaysia,iPhone 6 price,iPhone 6 price Malaysia,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6S Malaysia Price","iOS,iPad,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"Shortly after the announcement of the latest iPhone 6s, iPad Pro and iPad mini 4, the Malaysian Apple Online Store has made some price revisions on its product line up. With no surprises, most of the current iPhone and iPad models are getting a price increase, no thanks to our weakening currency exchange rate. The iPhone 6 Plus costs as much as RM149 extra while the iPad gets price hike as much as RM459. Overall all models are getting an increase with the exception of the iPhone 6 16GB and iPhone 5S 16GB which have gotten a slight dip of a couple of ringgit. For the iPad range, the iPad mini 2 gets a slight reduction which is to be expected for an ageing model. Below is the current full price list with the old post-GST price. For the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, this marks the 3rd price increase since it went on sale late last year and the recent hike was when the 6% GST came into effect on 1st April. When the iPhone 6 Plus 64GB was initially launched, it was priced at RM3,149 and now it is sold at RM3,699. Thats RM550 more since launch which is about 17% increase after a year. Suddenly buying iPhones are looking like an investment if you bought one early. Apart from having the 128GB version discontinued, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus no longer has the Gold colour option.  So if youre looking for gold, you need to look for the latest iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.  So for the newer iPhones, be prepared to pay more once they get here. From the looks of it, it would take probably another 2 months and we can only hope that our currency doesnt slide down further against the dollar."

A testament that holds true for young customers who dont have the luxury of having access to thesecards.Today onwards, Digi customers on postpaid can simply add any purchase (in-app or otherwise) on the Google Play Store and be billed directly to their monthly bill. On the other hand, those on prepaid arent left out, as they can use their prepaid airtime balance to deduct the purchases outright.Digis Chief Marketing Officer, Christian Thrane shed some light on the partnership  stating that Digi aims to be the best mobile internet provider for the mass market. and introducing a service like Direct Billing for Google Play Store serves to add value for their 11.8 million customers.Looking at the Digi website, theyve also support for the Windows Phone Store app, as well as the Blackberry World app  giving uses on these devices the same Direct Billing feature.The telco provider hopes that their aforementioned efforts will kick-off an echoing effect for mobile app developers to step up localised content for our market.

Apple has even stepped up the personalisation of their two (out of three) watch models.App developers are now tooled to improve their apps thanks to watchOS 2, letting them play around with the watchs hardware, opening doors to apps like iTranslate; for giving you voice translations on the fly, or the GoPro app, that lets you use your watch display as a viewfinder.Innovating in other fields like those involved in medicine, AirStip has already existed on other iDevices (iPhone and iPad) but with an upgrade to watchOS 2, the app now gives medical practitioners and the hospital team easier accessibility to patient records and their health readings.Daily rounds are displayed on the app, connecting the team within a network that lets them communication and share patient data on a more productive level. Time travel is now enabled and turning the digital crown lets you go through your daily rounds schedule to see upcoming patient visits and other appointments.

It isonly available in the 42mm stainless steel case in a Fauve colourway.Subsequently, Apple has also been busy updating their own designs, as two new finishes are now added to the line-up  Gold and Rose gold (38mm and 42mm) are now available in iodised aluminium. Two great colours that maintain the pricing of the original sports line up ($ 349/RM1,526 for 38mm, $ 399/RM1,736 for 42mm). Theres also a product RED version of the stainless steel case, which will have part its proceeds directed towards fighting AIDS.Although most of the updates are already available, the Hermes collection and watchOS 2 are slated to be out in October and September the 16th, respectively.

Thats 4X the resolution of a standard Full HD 1080p clip.While most TVs and displays are still pushing full HD, there are those who prefer to capture moments in the best quality possible in 4K. Theres nothing wrong with that but the biggest concern is always on storage. With greater detail comes bigger file size and that could be a problem if youre intending of buying the cheapest iPhone model available.MKBHD has gotten a hands-on with the new iPhone 6s and has shared some info on the new video formats. Under the settings page, a 4K video at 30fps would take around 375MB/minute of recording while a standard Full HD 1080p takes up just 130MB/minute. Thats nearly triple the file size just to shoot in the highest quality.Like most smart phones, you dont really get the full available space as advertised as the storage is often partitioned for the operating system and bundled apps. So if youre getting a 16GB iPhone 6s, youre probably left about 10GB of free space once youve installed and set up all your essential apps. With just 10GB, that leaves you with enough space for just 27 minutes of 4K video. If 4K video recording is your thing, it is recommended that you take at least the 64GB model or 128GB if you could afford that extra premium. Alternatively, you can free up more space from time to time with the SanDisk iXpand, which is like a thumb drive for your phone. With Apples premium iPhone pricing that continues to get even more expensive in Malaysia, it is high time for them to kill off the paltry 16GB model. Most of its flagship rivals are pushing 32GB minimum storage as standard especially if it doesnt come with microSD expansion.The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be available for pre-order staring tomorrow with full availability by 25th September in first wave countries. If youre interested to get one, you can try getting one from Singapore through a family or friend residing there. Prefer to get the current iPhone 6/6 Plus model instead?

To celebrate its 3 year partnership, OPPO has introduced its R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition, clad with the Catalans football team insignia.  Just like the standard OPPO R7 Plus, the FC Barcelona Edition shares the same internals with a large 6.0 Full HD AMOLED display. Underneath, it runs on Qualcomms Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor mated with 3GB of RAM. From the presentation earlier, China will be getting the 64GB storage option while the rest of the world appears to be getting the 32GB version. For storage expansion, this dual-SIM phablet supports microSD cards up to 128GB which utilises its 2nd SIM slot.  It still gets a 13MP Sony IMX278 camera at the back with dual-tone LED flash and an ultra-quick laser AF while selfies are taken with its front facing 8MP camera. Powering the device is a huge 4,100mAh capacity battery that supports VOOC Flash Charging. According to OPPO, a quick 5 minutes charge can deliver up to 2 hours of talk time. The back of the R7 Plus also comes with a fingerprint scanner which lets you unlock quickly in a single touch.Apart from having a FC Barcelona logo engraved at the back, it comes well kitted with additional goodies including a FC Barcelona leather case, water bottle, VOOC Power bank and a selfie stick. Theres also 5 OPPO R7 Plus units autographed by Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Dani Alves which will be sold through a charity auction on ebay. In China, the 64GB OPPO R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition is going for 3,999 CNY (about RM2,726) while the 32GB version is priced at US$549 (about RM2,383).

After seeing leaks of its purported device, HTC is likely to launch the Aero on 29th September in Taiwan as shown in the teaser image above. Improving over the current HTC One M9, the new device is purported to have a 2.5D curve edge screen at the moment, for a smoother feel around the edges. The screen is reported to be pushing Quad HD resolution and it is toughen by Gorilla Glass 4. In terms of camera, the new unit is said to be having a f/1.9 camera and hopefully it is a huge improvement over its current average HTC One M8/M9 shooters.If the image of the Aero above is real, it looks quite similar to the current iPhone 6 with its metal body and antenna band lines. Can this new flagship turn their fortunes around? Alongside the new HTC One A9 (Aero), the international variant of the Butterfly 3 is expected to make its debut offering waterproof capabilities. As launched in Japan as the J Butterfly, it gets a similar spec as their current flagship offering with a 5.2 Quad HD display, 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM and has 32GB of on-board storage. It also packs a 20.2MP Duo Camera at the back and a front facing 13MP shooter for higher resolution selfies. However in the battery department, it gets downsized to just 2,700mAh capacity which raises concern on its overall battery life. In Taiwan, the Butterfly 3 is expected to be priced at TWD 20,900 which is a hefty RM2,700 in our current exchange rates. [ SOURCE, 2 ]"
Alexander Wong,Meet the 12.9 iPad Pro. Apples answer to convergence devices,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/10/meet-the-12-9-ipad-pro-apples-answer-to-convergence-devices/,"apple ipad pro,Apple iPad Pro Launch,Convergence Devices,iOS,iOS 9,iPad,iPad Pro,iPad Pro Announcement,iPad Pro Malaysia,Tablet","iOS,iPad,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"The iPad has revolutionised the way we consume content on a portable device. It started the whole tablet mania and it became the worlds fastest selling consumer product in history. For those needing to do some serious work on the go, the iPad still works but it isnt as cut out as a real workhorse like the MacBook Air. With dwindling tablet sales, the next big wave seems to be focused on convergence devices that blurs the line between tablet and PC like the Microsoft Surface series. And thats where Apple is heading with its new iPad Pro that was announced today at San Francisco. Designed as the ultimate media consumption and productivity tool, the iPad Pro is their largest tablet yet with a huge 12.9 Retina Display that does 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution. This gives 78% more display area than its current iPad Air 2 and it pushes the same pixel density of 264 pixels per inch. It is 6.9mm thick, the same thickness as the iPhone 6 but thicker than the iPad Air at 6.1mm. Being a bigger device, it is heavier as well at 713 grams for WiFi and 723 grams for the Cellular version. As comparison, the original iPad weighs in at 680 grams for WiFi and it goes as much as 730 grams for the 3G + WiFi model. Like the rest of the iPad range, the exterior design is typical iPad and it gets a TouchID enabled home button along with Silver, Gold and Space Grey colour options.What makes this a productivity beast is on the inside. With a newer iOS 9 out of the box, you get more multi-tasking features which include split screen along with more shortcuts to get things done quicker. The A9X 64-bit chip on-board is their most powerful mobile processor yet with almost twice the power of the A8X chip found on the iPad Air 2. Setting the iPad Pro apart from the mainstream iPad is its new Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessory. Now this is starting to look like a Surface fighting device. The Smart Keyboard is sold separately as a US$169 option (about RM730) and doubles up as a smart cover with a keyboard built-in. It consists of 64 seamless keys thats spill resistant. The fabric microfiber of the cover is just 3.2mm thin while the keys pops up slightly at 4mm with its spring-like tension feedback. Attaching the Smart Keyboard onto the iPad is seamless which lets you snap on and use immediately without the need of wireless pairing. Unlike the Surface which has ridges on the sides, the iPad Pro connectors are flush with its 3 smart connector pins. Steve Jobs used to poked fun at the stylus when the iPhone was introduced. For its new productivity product, they have finally introduced one as the Apple Pencil. This adds another freehand interaction which gives you the familiarity of a pencil. Boasting a 240 times per second response time, drawing claims to be more real time with no noticeable lags and it recognises pressure from a gentle touch to thicker stroke lines. It even supports shading when drawn sideways, as if youre drawing with a charcoal pencil. During the keynote, they have invited Microsoft and Adobe on stage to demonstrate the Pencils editing capability for both MS Office and Photoshop. The Apple Pencil lasts 12 hours on a single charge which is juiced up with its lightning connector hidden underneath its silicon cap at the end. To charge it, youll need to plug it into the iPad Pro, which would probably look awkward if youre carrying it while on the go. Thankfully it manages to rejuice an impressive 30 minutes of battery life from a mere 15 second charge. The Apple Pencil is sold separately at US$99 which is about RM427. One minor gripe is theres no place for you to keep the Pencil on the iPad Pro and it doesnt even come with a clip for you to hook it onto the case or a folder. Perhaps that might come as another optional accessory.So for the full productivity suite, the Smart Keyboard and stylus pencil will set you back close to RM1,200. Quite a substantial amount to pay compared to the Surface 3s Type Cover Keyboard and Pen costing RM479 and RM189 respectively. For video and music playback, the iPad Pro boasts 4 speakers with a pair of stereo speakers mounted on the top and bottom which rotates according to the orientation youre in. For imaging, it gets the same 8MP f/2.4 main camera and a front facing 1.2MP HD Facetime unit as the iPad Air 2. Even with its bigger display and power processor, the iPad Pro still pushes its same 10 hour battery life on a single charge. At this point, you probably know that the iPad Pro will not come cheap. This is going to be a very niche device like the 12.2 Samsung Galaxy NotePro 12.2 and its higher end model is actually pricier than a full blown MacBook Air 11 with 128GB at US$899 (RM3,391 Malaysian RRP). With the thinner MacBook around, the iPad Pro potentially could replace the MacBook Air completely. After all, you could run all your regular office and designing chores with iOS versions of MS Office and Photoshop. The iPad Pro starts from US$799 (about RM3,462) for the 32GB WiFi model, while the larger 128GB unit is sold at US$949 (about RM4,112). For the all round connectivity with 4G LTE support, the 128GB WiFi + Cellular version is priced at US$1,079 (about RM4,700). The iPad Pro goes on sale in November just ahead of the Christmas shopping season. For more details, you can check out Apples iPad Pro product page."

With the new OS version going live, Google has released its latest Android breakdown figures based on active devices on the Android and Google Play ecosystem. While the current Android Lollipop is gaining momentum taking up 21% (inclusive of Android 5.0 and 5.1), majority of Android devices are still running on KitKat which stands at 39.2%. Whats more surprising is that a substantial number of devices are still running on versions that are more than 2 years old. If you look at the chart above, a total of 31.8% of Android devices are still on Jelly Bean which covers Android 4.1 to 4.3, making it the 2nd highest used right after KitKat. Meanwhile the rest of the older versions including Ice Cream Sandwich, Gingerbread and Froyo stands under 5%, which mostly should be retired by now. While the upgrades from KitKat from Jelly Bean seems to be fast, the fact remains that most devices are still being left behind without much software updates. This is partly due to respective device makers that have ended software support for older models or are simply reluctant to make the switch to newer versions in favour of its own custom UI. Some brands especially from China have re-skinned the interface so much, it looks anything but an Android device. Of course, being an open platform, the adventurous ones can find a way to get the latest OS with the use of Custom ROMs. Unlike Apple or BlackBerry where its has better control over both hardware and software, the Android environment is quite vibrant which sometimes is seen to be fragmented. There are different brands, hardware choices, added features and software customisation involved, making it a challenge to ensure every device maker is on the same page. With software support becoming a huge concern by consumers, some brands have pledged for quicker software updates and pathces especially after the recent Stagefright incident.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

For selfies, it gets a larger 8MP f/2.4 front camera that comes with a host of beautification features. In terms of connectivity, the R7 Plus is a 4G Dual-SIM device with the 2nd slot performing double duty as a microSD slot when only 1 SIM is being used. Keeping things running is a large 4,100mAh capacity non-removable battery which can be replenished quickly with its VOOC Flash Charging.For the international market, the 32GB version is priced at US$549, which is about RM2,383 in our current exchange rates.

Having spent some time with the honor 7 in London, were looking forward how the Malaysian market reacts to this device, possibly outclassing the Huawei P8 in the process.The honor series has raised the bar since releasing their latest device in Europe, which boasts a metal chassis, a first for the honor lineup. Perhaps honor has taken a new turn, as theyve announced during the release in UK that they want to reach out to the new generation. Capturing the youth is a daunting task but it gets easier if you have an affordable, yet great looking product.Recapping some specs, the honor 7 carries a 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x1080) IPS-Neo display. Underneath the metal-clad body is a home-grown 64-bit Octa-core Kirin 935 processor, coupled with 3GB of RAM for zippy performance.Internationally, it gets 16GB of on-board storage, opposed to Chinas huge 64GB step up option. Luckily theres support for a microSD card up to 128GB for your expanded storage needs.Photo bugs will be pleased by the larger 20-megapixel sensor (f/2.0 aperture) that makes up the back of the device, along with its finger-print sensor module. On the front, selfies will be taken by an 8-megapixel shooter with soft flash.The lights will be kept on thanks to a 3,100 mAh battery that supports quick charge (0-50% in 30 minutes). A feature packed device that weighs in at 157 grams and 8.5mm thick. Operating system-wise it runs on EMUI 3.1 over Android 5.0 Lollipop.Malaysians love a bargain but theres no info on the pricing as the vmall registration link leads to nothing (we checked), a bug that we hope the webmasters can sort out since many would be interested in this device. Its predecessor was launched at RM999 but the latest honor could see the price hover around RM 1,200 to RM 1,300, mainly dependent on how our currency continues to float on trading. Were most probably going tohear something from the China based company soon regarding its pricing, as they usually do so before sales kick off.In the mean time, you can watch our hands-on of the honor 7 below:

A brave venture, considering that when the device will go on sale is still unknown; even crazier is the fact that Apples keynote only happens tomorrow.Pitching himself outside the extremely well-lit store located on George Street (the same store we visited to check out the Apple Watch), has so far spent a day on his fold-able chair and tentcombo. His intentions are based on past instances of the Oceanic country being one of the first to have the latest Apple products in store.Handmer has taken this brief moment of fame to (shamelessly) plug his self-created online secondhand technology marketplace, mysparetech.com, since seeing that other individuals have done it prior during their own line-up adventures. Apples iPhones tend to hit shelves around the 18th of September, if theyre sticking to their existing habits, Handmer will be out in the 12-17 degree Celsius weather for quite some time.Apart of his marketing stunt, the Australian wont be purchasing the device for himself, instead he intends to auction the device(s) off for a charitable cause  Mission Australia, a startup that helps the homeless. Hes said that so far its an up and down process when asked about his experience so far going 24 hours in to the camp-out and had times where he questioned his decision to do so.The legality of it all is kind of up in the air, at least as far as Handmer is concerned, as the police officers he momentarily crossed paths with only pulled up to head into the nearby McDonalds  at least for now. When more people join in the craze, he plans on keeping the atmosphere high by getting some party lights and music.Itll be interesting to see how long he lasts out there but hes fortunate enough to have a 24/7 McDonalds and some gyms around the vicinity if he needs to get some food and freshen-up. Best of all, hell have some company during the weekend, when his fiance joins in.These occurrences are never bad for Apple but the employees at the Sydney store have some raised eyebrows at how the first potential person to purchase the latest iPhone uses a Dell laptop, together with a HTC phone. When asked about this, Handmer merely quipped that Apple makes great products, but I guess I like the more technical stuff. Android, for those type of things. and I just tend to opt for the more affordable side of stuff.If youre interested to prepare yourself for a similar adventure, you can follow his journey on Twitter.Share with us your best experiences of lining up to purchase something, wed surely like to hear about it in the comments below.[ SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,Camera shootout: 10 smart phones compared. Which is the best?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/09/camera-shootout-10-smart-phones-compared-which-is-the-best/,,,2015-09-09,"UPDATE: Weve tabulated the votes for the shootout. Jump straight to Page 3 to find out which is the best as voted by you.Its time for another round of smart phone camera shootout. In our last camera blind test, most of you picked the Galaxy Note Edge, followed by the Galaxy S6 as the camera of choice.With the Galaxy Note5 released with a similar 16MP sensor, is it better than the rest of todays new smart phones? To find out, weve taken pictures with 10 devices and we are letting you decide which is the better shooter.For this shootout, we have the Galaxy Note5, the Galaxy S6 edge, iPhone 6, OnePlus 2, Sony Xperia M5, honor 7, HTC One E9+, Xiaomi Mi Note, Huawei P8 and the LG G4. The Galaxy S6 edge has an impressive camera and the new Note5 shouldnt be far off. Following closely is the LG G4 which boast a similar 16MP sensor, faster f/1.8 lens and it comes assisted with Laser AF. In terms of pixel count, the Sony Xperia M5, honor 7 and HTC One E9+ leads on paper with its 20MP+ sensor. Like everything weve seen in the past, a higher pixel count doesnt necessary represent higher quality. The Xperia M5 and honor 7 looks promising as it uses Sonys latest IMX230 sensor that has Phase Detection AF for faster focus. While we are at it, weve also thrown in the Xiaomi Mi Note, Huawei P8 and the OnePlus 2 that comes with a 13MP camera with OIS. Of course, we cant forget the iPhone 6. It might have the lowest pixel count at just 8MP but it is still impressive with its ease of use and snappy response. We want you to pick the top 3 photos from each set. For example, heres how you can rank the top 3 pictures in Set 1, from best to worst: I, E, C. Just so you know, the smart phones are randomised so each alphablet represents a different device in each set. Then the reader proceeds to rank sets 2  4. So your votes should appear something like this:Submit your votes in the comment section down, well tabulate the results. Voting closes on Sunday, 13th September and we will reveal the results on the following Monday on the same post. Head to the next page to view the pictures and enjoy!"

A newer Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update with the version number 10.7.A.0.222 is being rolled out to the first gen Xperia Z series. This covers the Xperia Z (C6602 and C6603), Xperia ZL (C6503 and C6506), Xperia ZR (C5503) and Xperia Tablet Z for both WiFi (SGP311, SGP312) and LTE (SGP321) models. Although the version number is newer, it doesnt seem to fix the Stagefright exploit. Hopefully this means there are more updates to come and it is good that Sony is still taking care of its ageing flagship devices.As usual, the updates should be pushed Over the Air (OTA), but to get it quicker we recommend you to check using the Sony PC Companion desktop app. From the looks of it, the Android 5.1.1 is being pushed to Xperia Z users before the Xperia Z1.

Alexander Wong,Compared: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ Malaysian Telco Pricing,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/04/samsung-malaysia-galaxy-note-5-s6-edge-plus-celcom-digi-maxis-umobile-comparison/,"Celcom,Comparison,DiGi,Dual Sim,Maxis,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Price,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus price,samsung malaysia,Telco Comparison,Telco Price Comparison,U Mobile","Android,Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,Samsung,U Mobile",2015-09-04,"Want to buy the latest Galaxy Note 5 or S6 edge+ but not sure which telco plan is the right one for you? Weve compared the current postpaid contract offers in Malaysia, to assist you with your purchase decision. Outright, the Galaxy Note5 is priced at RM2,699 and the S6 edge+ is at RM3,099, inclusive of 6% GST. Buying one without a contract is probably the most convenient way to go but you could save some money with telco subsidies. At the moment, our 4 main telcos  Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile have started their contract bundle plans for the Galaxy Note 5, while the S6 edge+ is offered by everyone except U Mobile for now. Across the board, they are pretty much tied with 24 months duration with exception for Digi where it has a shorter 12 months option.As always, we recommend picking a plan based on your usage. So it is best to find out roughly how much data, calls and SMS youll need to avoid paying more than what you need. To calculate the cost of ownership of each plan, we add up the bundle price of the device together with the minimum subscription amount that you need to pay throughout the contract period. Below is the comparison chart which you can click for a larger view.Celcom
On Celcom, theres just 2 choices. A FIRST Basic Plan at RM85/month that optimises between 5GB of data, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS or 2GB of data, 700 minutes of calls and 700 SMS. The next option of FIRST Elite comes with 2 SIM cards  one with up to 5GB of data, unlimited free calls/SMS and the 2nd SIM which gives you 3GB of data, 200 minutes of calls and 200 SMS. The amount of data and calls have been revised slightly with more data and calls than before.Digi
Digi offers the widest choice from as little as RM78/month up to RM238/month on its SmartPlan. To cater for different type of customers, each SmartPlan has an option of having more Voice or more Data. As part of their current promo, all plans from SmartPlan 78 and above will get additional 1GB of data for 6 months (not included in the comparison table above). For Digi, they still charge advance payment but it can be waived if you pay by credit card with its 0% interest EPP offer. All plans come with 24 months contract with exception for SmartPlan 78 that also comes with 12 months duration. Maxis
In terms of plans, Maxis is offering the Galaxy Note5 and the S6 edge+ through its Zerolution programme which allows you to pay for your phone on a monthly installment without penalties and upfront payments. This however is only offered for its new MaxisONE Plans that come with unlimited calls and SMS starting at RM98/month. The bundled price is the same across all plans and the only difference is the amount of data you need on each month. While unlimited phone calls and SMS is perfect for those making lots of calls, it is quite expensive for those who require more data. It offers the least amount of data per buck compared to its rivals. For the highest MaxisONE Plan 188, they are offering 1GB additional data but it is only for the first 6 months. For this comparison, we calculated based on the assumption that you will be keeping this device after 24 months. Therefore we are only considering the minimum monthly installment of RM93/month for the Note 5 and RM111/month for the S6 edge+, without the optional RM30/month early upgrade option and RM15/month device protection. If you look at the device price alone, the Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ isnt getting as much subsidy as the other telcos, but the benefit is that you have the freedom to stop at any time without penalty charges. Just pay the remainder balance of the installments and youre done. If you do plan to switch phones, the Zerolution RM30/month early upgrade option lets you do so after 12 months. So if the Galaxy Note 6 is out next year, you can just surrender the Note 5, and pay for the Note 6 installments for the next 12 months. Do note that you would need to return your old device in good condition, so it is recommended that you take up the RM15/month device protection offer. U Mobile
For now U Mobile is only offering the Galaxy Note 5 on contract and it is bundled with its Ultimate Device Plan that ranges between RM65/month to RM135/month. This is a more data centric plan with a couple of free calls thrown in. Despite not having unlimited phone calls, the rates are the lowest across the range at only RM0.10/minute. If only U Mobile offered its new Hero plan as on option, they would definitely unbeatable in value. Similar to Digi, theres also an advance payment but it can be waived if you pay by credit card with auto debit enabled for future bills. Conclusion
Considering the long contract period youre signing up for, you should look beyond the cheaper device price tag. Cost comparison is just half the picture and there are also other areas to look at such as the network quality and customer service. Most telco contracts do charge early termination fees so it is best to stick to a telco that would satisfy your needs for the next 2 years without worry.

Measuring at a humongous 6.8-inch, the manufacturer claims the device is optimized for one-handed use, but that remains to be seen (even to those with fairly large hands).Announced at IFA, the Chinese tech company released two phone dubbed the PHAB Plus and the oddly (bigger) named PHAB. The former is the higher-end device, hence the name and it sports a FHD 1920 x 1080 resolution screen.Other specs includes dual-SIM 4G LTE support, 2GB of RAM and runs an Octa-core Snapdragon 615 SoC. 32GB is the standard for internal storage out of the box and is easily expandable through a microSD card.Lenovos PHAB Plus dons a 13-megapixel rear sensor along with a 5-megapixel front lens for your photo taking needs. To round off the internals, it carries a 3500 mAh battery to juice all the other components and weighs in at 229g.Moving on to the entry-level PHAB, unsuitably being the more affordable option, youd expect it to smaller but this phablet maxes out at just a hair under 6.98-inches. Although, its screen gets a size step-up, it runs at a lower 1200 x 720 resolution and has less RAM (1GB) on board. Processor-wise its a mystery but it is an Octa-core Qualcomm chipset. Forgoing a lot when specs are considered, it does fortunately carry a bigger 4250 mAh battery to power its bigger display.Both phone/tablet/whatever you want to call it runs on Android 5.0 out of the box for its OS. However, if youre interested in this peculiar market-segment, youll be happy to know there are other considerations out there; like the P8 Max and the SamsungGalaxy W. Pricing for the two Lenovo devices are $300 for the PHAB Plus and $180 for the PHAB.[ SOURCE, 2]"

Repositioning of the sole hardware button is also apparent, moving it from a 3 oclock position to the now more practical 2 oclock  supposedly to prevent scuffing while moving and flexing your wrist around.All three options run the same 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 mated with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage.

If you include GST, that comes up to RM1,788 outright and we are not sure if this is the 16GB or 64GB storage version. As comparison, the US pricing for the OnePlus 2 stands at US$329 (about RM1,418) for 16GB and US$389 (about RM1,676) for the 64GB version., so it is more likely we are getting the higher option.

With a V10 branding behind along with what looks like a textured backing, it seems that LG is considering the notion of releasing a successor to the LG G Pro 2. Whats most interesting about this just certified device is it carries a smaller display on top of its larger one, next to the camera and flash modules.Previously, its predecessor was considered to be LGs answer to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 but this ticker display could possibly set it apart from other large phablets in the same category. This secondary screencould be used to display notifications and other information that would otherwise clutter the primary screen.Sharing a lot of qualities ofthesmaller G4, it seems to look the part as well  utilising the back-placed power buttons and volume rockers, as seen on the aforementioned smaller smart phone.

However, being a phablet, word from @evleaks goes to state that itll have a 5.7-inch QHD display. Camera optics supposedly will be powered by a 16-megapixel rear shutter (a great camera, from what weve seen on the LG G4) and a 5-megapixel sensor on the front.Weve seen this concept before from its Korean competitors, Samsung; though still unsure what this innovation could bring to the current market as it is.

Arif Lee,Smartphone and tablet sales remain buoyant despite GST and weakening currency,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/07/smartphone-and-tablet-sales-remain-buoyant-despite-gst-and-weakening-currency/,"Acer,apple,Asus,gst,huawei,Lenovo,mobile sales 1st half,mobile sales 2015,mobile sales first half,Ringgit,Samsung,weakening ringgit","Android,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Others",2015-09-07,"Malaysians purchased 4.8 million smartphones and 0.9 million tablets during the first half of 2015. Numbers which rose by 42% and 15%, in the two aforementioned categories, compared to the same half of 2014. Predominately, sales were geared towards makers from China and Taiwan for smartphones and the tablet space still leans towards global vendors.These numbers tell a different story, if youve been keeping tabs on the recent downward spiral of the Ringgits trading value, GST implementation and other of the countrys uncertainties. Seems like the rise in figures are tied to most mobile tech manufacturers adapting a wider ranger of devices that also cater to those looking for a more affordable option. Smartphones hovering around RM 500, pre-bundled with SIM plans and larger tablet slates going for less than RM 300, seemed to make a difference.Taking a look at who received the biggest slice of the pie, numbers by Apple and its Korean competitor Samsung fell opposed to past performances. When looking at the other makers from China and Taiwan, theyve managed to scrap on by through maintaining their competitive stance on pricing and targeting the local market based on their needs.Nonetheless, Samsung still sits pretty at the top, with a huge majority of 40%  sales coming from their mid-rangers and lower-end models, the Galaxy J series and Galaxy V smartphone. Surprisingly, Samsungs top of the line Galaxy S6 and S6 edge didnt stir up a lot of figures.Other major players in the same league were, Asus (20%), Apple (15%), Lenovo (13%) and Huawei (12%). Asus had the ZenFone 5 and the Zenfone 2 to thank, keeping it as number two in an already competitive market segment. More premium in the eyes of the world, Apple held steadily in third position, while the last two let their more budget friendly options do the work: the A319 and A7000 for Lenovo and Huaweis Honor series leading the way.Tablets, while still performed positively, didnt have the same rapid adoptive rates, unlike smartphones. Fingers could be pointed that due to the devices costing more, buyers might reconsider purchasing as the larger screened devices dont always boast a better spec sheet. In similar fashion, Samsung has the largest piece with 30%  sales mostly coming from the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0.The rest of the pie is shared by Lenovo, Apple, Asus and Acer; Lenovo shares the number two spot with Apple (27% each). Asus had about 13% driven by its 7-inch Fonepad 7, while Acers telco team-up, managed to get the Iconia Tab A1-713 rolling as well.Have you personally felt the pinch?

So how did Sony attempt to keep temps low? A teardown revealed that Sony has built a special dual heat pipe on the upper part of the smartphones frame to improve ventilation. In addition, theyve also added thermal regulating paste underneath the processing chip to further regulate its running temps.Not a lot of news has surfaced regarding how Sonys latest offering handles multitasking, gaming and larger processing extensive tasks, so it seems like theres a lot of real-world testing to be done.

Going as the Galaxy View, it made its brief appearance at the end of the Samsung livestream during IFA 2015, earlier in the day.Looking like a propped up Microsoft Surface with its own kick-stand, the Galaxy View left us asking more questions as Samsung only hinted with a couple of phrases for us to put together: think bigger and a new dimension of entertainment. Oh and they mentioned that more information about this huge tablet will be out come October.If the devices screen does indeed come at an 18.4-inch size, were left mystified as to why earlier reports state that itll only pack a 1920 x 1080 display (works out to about 119 ppi), a lowly resolution for a screen that size. In terms of processing it packs a bigger punch  thanks to an assumed Exynos 7580 processor, together with 2GB of RAM. The earlier report labels the device as the SM-T670 or Tahoe but were unsure if these two are the same.For in-built storage the device apparently carries 32GB of internal memory that can be expandable through a microSD card. The report also mentions that the device carries an 8-megapixel rear shutter, while the front only gets a lowly 2.1-megapixel camera. Being quite a large display, the device will measure 451.8mm x 275.8mm x 11.9mm and feature a 5700 mAh battery powering it.Currently, Samsungs largest tablet in their line-up is the Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and it runs a QHD (2560 x 1600) screen. Will Samsung let its latest multimedia consuming tablet only run at a 119 ppi? Well only find out in October. Then again the earlier reports are just rumours, so dont think Samsung has dropped the ball, just yet."

Though, were likely to always go back to the circle, eventually. Samsung decided to do that very thing, leaving the square faced Gear S for its latest Circular UX Gear S2.Thanks to the circular bezel, it rotates to navigate  interaction with the screen without obstructing views on the 1.2-inch (360 x 360) screen. On the device, other than the rotating bezel navigation youll have a home button and a back button to help make your way around the OS.Tempting potential smart watch owners with two user focused designs: the quick detachable silicon band on the Gear S2 and the timeless 22mm leather band on the Gear S2 Classic  allowing buyers to choose based on their lifestyle preferences.Thin and compact at 11-4mm thin (non-3G), the aforementioned screen will allow you to view your notifications on its home-grown Tizen OS running a 1GHz dual-core processor. Utilising a 24-hour activity log, its functions include calendar, e-mail and news glances, as well as text notifications.For the first time ever, the Gear S2 will also come with an e-SIM option that runs on a 3G network. In-built with NFC, youll be able to use the function for mobile payment enabled terminals through Samsung Pay.Solving issues with home and car security, the Gear S2 is capable of connecting to smart homes and cars that use smart car keys. The device will allow you to run about for 2-3 days on its 250 or 300 mAh (3G model) before having to charge it with the included wireless charging dock.A smart wearable that will cater to individualistic creature comforts of having a personalised device. Partnering with organisations will allow Samsung to offer a range of visual watch faces and watch bands, allowing you to fully customise your wearable to make it your own.Water resistant with a water and dust resistant IP68 rating across all variants, so the Gear S2 can be worn during any sweat earning activities and itll allow you to track your movements through its activity tracker (inclusive of an accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate sensor and so on).The 3 models differ in dimensions slightly and are listed below:All three will run the same aforementioned processor and come with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal memory. Theyll also be equip with Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 for the internet and pairing. Samsung brought great news to its wearable users as the new Gear S2 will now work with other Android devices (not restricted to its Samsung smart phones). Prerequisites for pairing are the smart phone runs Android 4.4 and above, as well as at least 1.5GB of RAM.Slated to go on sale from October onwards, this smart wearable will be priced at  349 / approx RM 1,645 (Gear S2, non-3G) and  399 / approx RM 1,880 (Gear S2 classic) in Europe but no information has come to light on the price of the 3G version. Just tocompare,the most affordable Apple Watch Sport 38mm in France costs 399 / approx RM 1,880.

Based on leaks, well likely see a better screen-to-body ratio that will help the aforementioned problem. Supposedly carrying a 1920 x 1080 resolution screen, this Huawei phablet is said to have the Kirin 935 processor on board, mated with 3GB of RAM.The device has been rumoured to feature a 20-megapixel rear camera, most probably a Sony IMX 230 module, an 8-megapixel front facing camera and a fingerprint reader as well. Sounds to be an exciting product so far but weve kept the best for last  itll likely have Force Touch on its large 5.7-inch display. Innovation in the area, could see better interaction with our devices, and beating Apple to their own punch (as the iPhone 6s is also rumoured to have this technology on its Retina display).Based on what were hearing so far about the MateS, it seems like the Honor 7 and the formershare cues in the respective departments: processor, RAM, camera module and finger-print sensor.IFA 2015, in Berlin will be the place to be if you want to know more about this phablet from Huawei. Though, their tweet seems to confirm that the MateS will have Force Touch, Apple still might have a head start, even though theyre set to announce a week later  seeing that theyve dabbled in Force Touch technology before in their MacBooks and Apple Watches.[ SOURCE, 2,VIA ]"

Since Maxis has launched its new Zerolution programme, you now have a third alternative which is something worth considering if you hate to be tied down with 24 month lock-in periods that comes with nasty penalty charges. To refresh your memory, the Zerolution programme is a new way of owning a new smart phone and it comes with added device protection in a form of an insurance as well as the option to swap to a new phone after 12 months. Theres no hefty upfront payments and you can leave at any time without any penalty charges as long as you settle the remainder of your monthly installments in full.The Galaxy Note5 is offered at RM138/month while the Galaxy S6 edge+ can be yours at RM156/month. These installment figures are inclusive of its RM30/month early upgrade fee, which allows you to swap to a new device after 12 months and RM15/month for extra device protection which covers theft and all sorts of damages to your device. Note that for the early device upgrade to happen, you would need to ensure that your device is in pristine condition, hence they have recommended the optional device protection offer. If the device is returned in unacceptable conditions, a RM300 fee might apply when you make a swap.Even if you dont plan to upgrade or need the extra device protection, the Galaxy Note5 effectively costs RM93/month, which in 24 months cost a total of RM2,232. Thats RM467 cheaper than the full retail price of RM2,699. The Galaxy S6 edge+ would effectively cost RM2,664 in the same calculation, which is a RM435 savings from its RM3,099 outright price.Of course, the catch is that youll need to subscribe to their new MaxisONE Plan which starts from RM98/month. That comes with unlimited calls, SMS and 1GB of data. For every additional 2GB of data, it will cost you RM30/month extra. Note that the monthly subscription fee is charged on top of your monthly Zerolution phone installments. For more info, head over to Maxis Zerolution page.

Right on the heels of Apples new iPhone release, the Huawei Mate S boasts a smart pressure sensitive screen allowing you to Force Touch the display to do more things like zooming into a picture or to preview an object. The screen apparently is so sensitive that it could weigh objects by placing them onto the display. They even measured an oranges weight during the announcement event.The Mate S comes with a 5.5 Full HD display and it sits right between the 5.2 Huawei P8 and their 6 incher Mate 7. The design of the back looks like an honor 7 with its subtle curved metal back while the front gets a clean all-glass look thats smoother around the edges with the use of 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4.  Under the hood, it uses their own in-house developed Kirin 935 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM, thats also powering the honor 7. You get 32GB of on-board storage on the standard version and theres a larger 64GB premium version as well. A larger 128GB is said to be released at a later date. For imaging, it gets the same 13MP f/2.0 4-colour RGBW camera sensor with Optical Image Stabilisation as the Huawei P8, and it is also assisted by dual-LED flash light. For greater controls, the camera interface now comes with professional mode, allowing you to make fine tweaks on ISO, Shutter speed, White Balance and more. With its protruding camera lens, it is protected by sapphire crystal to keep it away from nasty scratches. The front also gets a larger 8MP f/2.4 shooter and it is illuminated with a front mounted soft LED light.  When the Huawei P8 was launched, they introduced its Knuckle sense interaction, allowing you to take a screenshot by tapping with your knuckle. In reality, that was quite gimmicky and it robbed the P8 of its double tap to wake feature. On the Mate S, they have upgraded its knuckle technology to 2.0 which allows you to perform gesture controls like drawing C for camera using your knuckle. On top of that, the fingerprint scanner at the back also doubles up as a touch pad where you can use it for scrolling vertically or horizontally. The Mate S also gets 3 microphones which allows recording for multi way conferencing, similar to the Note 4. With a 2,700mAh capacity battery, this is slightly larger than the Huawei P8 and overall it weighs 156 grams with a thickness of 7.2mm. The Huawei Mate S is currently running on Android 5.1 with its own EMUI 3.1 skin on top. For more details, you can check out the Huawei Mate S product page."

The R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition is purported to match the original R7 Plus, when considering hardware  though itll have some sort of Barcelona emblem on the back and pre-installed themes associated with the Catalan club.Recapping some specs of the R7 Plus, it features a huge 6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) AMOLED display and runs the 64-bit Octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor.

Outed as the void-filler in between the One M9 and its yet to be released successor, it looks pretty much like an iPhone if viewed from the back. The official HTC Weibo post states that we will be able to take a look at the device on the 6th of September, leaving us to only 4 days before well see the latest HTC smart phone.Since the images textwas posted in Mandarin, many are still unsure of its meaning  even after getting help from Google translate, which struggled to translate it to English. Supposedly, the text goes to say something along the lines of the strength to fight bias and simple colour value.Not giving away much, by any means, however, itll be a tough climb for the Taiwanese company, if the device theyre releasing doesnt offer any visual distinction from its competitors (provided the Aero looks like how it does in the previous leaks)Internally, that might differ, as the new HTC A9 is touted to be powered by an industrys first tri-cluster Deca-core (10) MediaTek Helio X20 and a Mali-T880 MP4 graphics processor. Itll also apparently carry a QHD display with Gorilla Glass 4, protecting it from any unwanted scratches and smudges.Notorious leaker @evleaks posted that this new flagship might carry the One title, with the HTC One A9 (Aero) but well wait to see if September the 6th confirms his speculation.The late rise of Samsung in the Android market, brought the demise of the HTC name, so we hope in earnest that their new handsome hero can bring back some good news for the company.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

This time it will be released in 3 sizes  a Z5 Compact, a mid-sized Z5 and a larger Z5 Premium version. Thanks to a couple of sources, we now have a clearer look at the new Xperia flagships ahead of its official announcement. In terms of design, the overall shape hasnt change since the early Z series with its omni-balance approach of having a flat slab with subtle rounded corners. Gone is the iconic chrome power button and it is replaced by a wider flat looking one which potentially could double up as a fingerprint scanner. The frame has a poly-carbonate looking material with matte finish, while the premium version seems to have a glossy look to it. We are not sure if the devices shown here is a final product but it looks more sturdy than the previous version.Retained also is the standard volume rocker and dedicated camera button, and the micro USB port is exposed just like its newer waterproof devices. On the left side, all 3 models has the word Xperia written and it still gets a flap cover which potentially still houses both Nano-SIM and microSD expansion. The back hasnt changed since the beginning of the Xperia Z series and it is shown to carry a 23MP 1/2.3 sensor, which is an upgrade over its current 20.7MP shooter on the Xperia Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z3+. In terms of specs, the Xperia Z5 Compact will get a 4.6 HD 720p display, while the Xperia Z5 retains the similar sized 5.2 Full HD display. For the Xperia Z5 Premium, it is said to be a larger 5.5 screen that pushes a Quad HD display of 25601440 4K display at 38402160. According to leaked benchmarks, both Xperia Z5 Compact and Xperia Z5 will be running on Qualcomms Snapdragon 810 processor and it gets 3GB RAM for the Z5 and just 2GB RAM for the Z5 Compact. In terms of storage, the benchmarks suggest 32GB on-board for both models. They are also expected to receive a 23MP main and a front facing 5MP camera. Strangely the front camera is a notch below its current Xperia M5 and Xperia C5 Ultra that comes with a 13MP front shooter. So far there isnt any indication on the Z5 Premium specs but it is likely to carry better specs with 4GB RAM being a possibility. The Xperia Z5 is expected to be announced early tomorrow morning and we will find out the full specs by then. Do you like what you see? Or did you prefer if Sony went bonkers with an all new design?[ SOURCE 2 3 ]"

It packs a 4K display at the front which is basically 38402160 pixels crammed into a 5.5 screen, giving an insane pixel density of 806 pixels per inch. If you cant imagine how big a deal this is, it is like squeezing 4x Full HD displays into a single smart phone. This a huge leap not only for Sony but also for the smart phone industry where most players are still reluctant to jump onto the Quad HD bandwagon due to power and cost practicality.With a display allowing you to watch 4K content in its intended resolution, the Xperia Z5 Premium also gets a newer 23MP 1/2.3 Exmor RS sensor with a f/2.0 lens. This is a fully upgraded camera since the Xperia Z1 that came with a 20.7MP shooter until its recent Xperia Z3+. It records 4K videos and despite having no Optical Image Stabilisation, the Inteligent Active Steady Shot technology helps to remove unintended shakes from your footages. With a Hybrid AutoFocus system that first featured on the Xperia M5, you can capture moments quicker with its 0.03 second focus time. For the front, it gets a 5MP camera that could also record Full HD videos.Under the hood, it gets the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor as the rest of the Xperia Z5 series and it is mated to 3GB of RAM along with 32GB of on-board storage. Being a 4K consuming and creating device, it allows storage expansion with microSD up to 200GB. In the audio department, the Xperia Z5 Premium has no compromises with its High-Res Audio support, DSEE HX upscaling and built-in Digital Noise Cancellation. For better audio playback, it gets an S-Force Front Surround speakers and it also records audio in stereo format. Even with such a high resolution display, the Xperia Z5 Premium still maintains Sonys phenomenal up to 2 days of battery life thanks to a much larger 3,430mAh capacity battery. The long battery life is achieved with a built-in memory on the display which cuts down processor utilisation when the screen isnt refreshed. To juice up faster, it supports QuickCharge 2.0 that could give you 5.5 hours of use with just a 10 minute charge. In terms of design, it is slightly thicker at 7.8mm and it weighs 180 grams. On the right side, the iconic physical power button has been replaced with a capacitive unit which doubles up as a one touch fingerprint scanner. To live up to its Premium name, the device comes with a stainless steel frame and it comes with a mirror finish Black, Gold and Chrome colours. As always, the Xperia Z5 Premium is also water and dust resistant with a capless micro USB charging port with IP68 rating. In terms of availability, the Xperia Z5 Premium will be available from November 2015 and it comes in both Single and Dual SIM variants.

The Xperia Z3+ or better known as the Xperia Z4 in Japan was seen as stop gap measure launching just months ahead of IFA 2015. Now the Xperia Z5 and its Z5 compact appears to be a more worthy replacement of its former Xperia Z3 series, launched exactly a year ago.In terms of design, the Xperia Z5 still looks familiar but there are some subtle tweaks to its appearance. The aluminium frame now gets a carved Xperia on the sides and the iconic power button has been replaced with an integrated fingerprint scanner. In the past Xperia Z series, the glass back is elegant to look at but it is also a huge fingerprint magnet. This time, Sony has opt for a frosted glass back, which aims to put an end to smudgy looking phones. Surprisingly the dimensions of the Xperia Z5 is identical with the Xperia Z3 at 7.3mm thick and it weighs slightly heavier at 154g (Xperia Z3: 152g). This makes the Xperia Z3+ the thinnest and lightest Xperia Z flagship at just 6.9mm and 144g respectively.

In terms of colours, the Xperia Z5 comes in Graphite Black, Gold, White and Green. It is also available in either Single and Dual-SIM variants, supporting 4G LTE.

It shares the same Snapdragon 810 processor as the bigger Z5 brother but it comes mated with just 2GB of RAM. Storage remains unchanged at 32GB and it also gets the same 23MP main and 5MP front cameras. Keeping the lights on is a 2,700mAh capacity battery thats rated to last up to 2 days.

Seems like ASUS wants put its Zenfone devices in smaller niche categories by making them differ in small aspects.However, we arent sure this is a great strategy to begin with. Nevertheless, the determining factor that sets the Zenfone 2 Laser apart from the Zenfone Selfie, is omission of the 13-megapixel sensor on the selfie camera, no dual-LED up front and tuning the internal specs a tad lower. Its quite unfortunate that Malaysia will be getting only the mid-rangemodel from the list of three Zenfone 2 Laser devices released.Zenfone 2 Laser on the left, Zenfone 2 on the rightThe Zenfone 2 Laser has an entry level 64-bit capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 410, coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Although, being a slouch in the processing department, the device is no slouch in the cellular connectivity department  LTE enabled dual-SIM support. Sporting a 5.5-inch display with only 720 p resolution, the smart phone is powered by a large 3000 mAh battery and runs on a ZenUI skinned version of Android 5.0 out of the box.Upping the stakes on its current Zenfone 2 series, ASUS also announced pricing of the Zenfone 2 Deluxe. An upscale model that redesigns the back to look like intricate polygons scales, purported to increase the grip of the device. That aside, ASUS also decided to maintain theIntel Atom Z3580 to 2.3GHz butdouble the internal storage to 128GB.Once youve considered the two, otherwise, the Zenfone 2 Deluxe is pretty much the same as the high-end Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) model. Packing 4GB of RAM and even a microSD slot for additional storage (up to 128GB), given that youve stuck out on your already existing 128GB of internal memory. Itll also run the 5.5-inch IPS screen at FHD (1920 x 1080), thats present on the ZE551ML. ASUSs latest premium device supports 4G LTE on its Dual-SIM capable phone that has a 3000 mAh battery (fast charge enabled). Lastly, it runs the same ZenUI skinned Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system.Slated to arrive in retailers from the first week of September onwards, the Zenfone 2 Laser will run you back RM 799 (w/ GST), while the Zenfone 2 Deluxe will cost nearly double, at RM 1,599 (w/ GST) and the existing 64GB high-end ZE551MLZenfone 2 costs RM 1,399 (w/ GST). Stay tuned for a breakdown of all the Zenfone models, so you can easily decide which device suits your needs."

The new display is apparently 2 grams heavier than the display on the iPhone 6, but the brand is planning on compensating for the extra weight with a lighter rear cover. But will that solve the Bendgate issue or make it worse?For those not in the know, Force Touch is essentially a feature thats currently available on the Apple Watch and the 12 inch Macbookwhich allows users to access functions based on pressure applied on the screen or trackpad. The next closest thing to Force Touch would be gesture controls, which is a feature thats already available on certain Android devices from ASUS and Huawei for example.Still, no one else has yet managed to re-create anything likeForce Touch just yet, so depending on how popular it gets with the new iPhone 6s, it might very well be the next thing the phone companies try replicate. Like fingerprint scanners.We have yet to get a chance to see Force Touch in action on the new phone yet, but the iPhone 6s is expected to be announced on 9th September.[SOURCE]"

Planned to be held at San Franciscos Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, which seats 7,000 people  meaning itll be their grandest yet, leading many to believe there will be a lot to be talked about.Were likely to see the internal upgrades of the iPhone 6sand the iPhone 6s Plus, coming from the Cupertino natives. Subsequently, theres a possibility that a fresh iPad and Apple TV might make an appearance during the event. Apples take on an iOS 9, OS X El Capitan and watchOS 2 are also stated to be released during the time.Word floating around goes to say that the displays on the new iPhones will sport the innovative Force Touch function. If youve havent heard of Force Touch, its basically a pressure-sensitive technology that enables users to access extended functions  thats been available on the Apple Watch and their latest line of MacBooks.Do we think its absolutely necessary to have Force Touch on board? Itll be negligible at best, with increased accessibility to functions; widgets, maybe? Nonetheless, Apples innovation has always been revolutionary like Siri (which people ended up forgetting about), so well see if theres anything to shout about while having this feature incorporated in the Retina Display of the new iPhones.Other hardware upgrades should also bring about 2GB of RAM, a new A9 processor chip, and a camera optics bump to 12-megapixels. In recent times, Apple has gradually slowed its ability to innovate, or at least innovate something thats game-changing. A worrying trend thats been faced by other manufacturers, as well.That aside, iOS 9s features, has already been previewed in June and itll come in just a 1.3 GB package. This is a great improvement since iOS 8 required at least 5GBs to unpack. A little late to the party, but the new OS will allow users to take advantage of iDevices with larger displays through multi-window. Other nifty improvements can be seen here.Fortunately, Chinese tech site cnBeta gives us something to look at (since the device will look the same) with the purported packaging images. What youre looking at is a stupendously pretty Butterfly Koi image on the said device. Rumours say that this image could be the similar motion wallpaper previously available for the Apple Watch.Will the s in the 6s compel more people to jump aboard the Apple ship? Well have to wait to see the reactions following the September 9th event; watch the livestream here at 1 am (GMT +8/local time) on the aforementioned date.[ SOURCE ]"

The Pebble is a perfect example of a functional smart watch but for some, it is still too much to pay for a digital accessory.At the honor 7 global launch in London, they have announced the availability of its new honor band that could bring smart watches to the masses with its affordable price tag. The design of the honor band is simple. A round OLED display thats surrounded by a metal frame without any use of buttons. Navigation is done simply by swiping and tapping onto the black and white OLED screen. However essentially this like having a Huawei TalkBand underneath and it tracks your steps, sleep, display alerts and you can find out whos calling you while your phone is in your pocket. The watch itself is pretty slim and the overall package including the rubber strap is rather light. If youre wondering if you could take this for a swim, you would be pleased to know that it has IP68 water and dust resistance which they say is capable of being submerged under 10 metres of water for up to 30 minutes. In terms of battery life, the honor band does up to 3 days on a single charge. There isnt much details on the full specs including the display resolution and battery size, and we are told that these units arent final for full commercial release. There are 3 colours available  Black, White and Khaki. For the European market, the band will be available sometime in Q4 2015 and it carries a price tag of 79 Euros or 59 GBP. Thats approximately RM370-RM380 in our current exchange rate. Theres no info on Malaysian availability just yet but we are told to stay tuned for future local announcements. If youre just looking for something basic, the honor band could be your cup of tea. For those wanting more with a longer battery life, you could top up around RM50 extra and go for a Pebble smart watch thats currently priced at US$99 (about RM415). Before you pass any judgement on the honor band name, they are actually running a naming contest from now until 27th September. If your suggested name gets picked, you will win the opportunity to use all honor products for the next 5 years. To participate, just head over to the honor Facebook page, drop your suggested name and your reasons under the Facebook comments."

After revamping its postpaid offering with probably the most generous serving of data, they have upgraded its P70 plan that could please most chatterboxes. Dubbed as the U Mobile Hero postpaid plan, this is likely a response to MaxisONE plan that has been thumping on unlimited calls and SMS.For just RM70/month, the P70 comes with unlimited free calls to all networks in Malaysia and on top of that, you still get the same 7GB of data which was upgraded from just 4.5GB previously. According to the FAQ, the upgraded unlimited calls and 7GB of data are offered on a permanent basis, so you can enjoy this until you switch plans or when you port out. For SMS, it is still chargeable but at a low 3 sen/SMS within U Mobile and 8 sen/SMS to other networks. Cant finish 7GB in one account? You are able to share this with up to 2 more SIM Cards with its supplementary member line at RM10/month each. This is probably the best all you can eat postpaid offering right now unless youre still into good old SMS. As comparison, the new MaxisONE plan starts from RM98/month and it offers unlimited calls and SMS but it comes with just 1GB of data. Additional data costs an incremental RM30 for every 2GB extra. If youre an existing U Mobile P70 subscriber, the plan will be upgraded automatically and they wont charge any fees to make the switch. For clarity of its unlimited call usage, according to U Mobiles fair use policy, this covers all domestic calls within Malaysia excluding those premium numbers (e.g. 1300/1500/103).

Boasting an IP68 rating (waterproof) and to come in 3 models: the Gear S2, Gear S2 classic and the Gear S2 3G, itll be the first round faced watch from Samsung.Offering the two visually different models to a different crowd  Gear S2 towards the sportier, always running about user, while the classic version will be for individuals who much rather have a timeless watch face design. The former will be attached to the silicon band, available in either a dark grey case + black band or a silver case + white band combination. Then well see a black case donning the leather black band, on the Gear S2 classic.All three variants share the latest Tizen OS, seen on previous iterations of Samsung wearables, with only the inception of the rotating bezel screen changing the game for the Korean outfit. Specs internally will feature a 1GHz dual-core processor, mated to 512MB of RAM on the 1.2-inch Super AMOLED housed device. Resolution stands at 360 x 360 with a 302ppi and itll have 4GB of internal memory on board the 11.4mm thin frame.Youll connect to the internet through Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n and pair with other devices through Bluetooth 4.1 and NFC. Assuming youre picking up the Gear S2 with 3G capabilities youll have an e-SIM slot available at your disposal.All three models come in the same 11.4mm but differ slightly in dimensions and battery size. The regular Samsung Gear S2 measures at 42.3 x 49.8 x 11.4mm at 47 grams, while the classic model is slimmed down to reflect a more elegant look  39.9 x 43.6 x 11.4mm at 42 grams. They both share a 250mAh battery, supposedly will last up to 2-3 days of normal use.Being a 3G model, the 2 day rated Gear S2 e-SIM enabled smart watch will run on a slightly larger 300 mAh battery, bulking the device a bit  44.0 x 51.8 x 13.4mm and tipping the scales at 51 grams. Theres no pricing yet but well see that during IFA in Berlin. So does it make sense to pick up a wearable like this? Its great that theyve added two different models appealing to a different crowd, matching a more traditional round watch-face and an innovative rotating bezel for manoeuvring through its OS. It also beats the Apple Watch in battery life, which only has 18 hours but it still leaves us asking for more  perhaps battery technology has to catch up to our power-hungry needs.It still leavesus to this question  will you buy it?[ SOURCE ]"

Now we get to see fresh glimpses of the said device thanks to a leak in China.Struggling to stay afloat, theTaiwanese company is trying to redeem itself, since its less than stellar sales of its flagship smartphone. Sharing an uncanny resemblance to an iPhone from the back; only differing in terms of camera placement, this could mean HTC has lost all luster in the design department. Weve seen it before with the M9, M8 and M7  all sharing the same aesthetic appeal.Taking a look at the front, the huge HTC logo stays in place at the bottom being closely followed by the bottom Boomsound speaker, while topside theres nothing much we can tell from the blurry photo, other than the top Boomsound speaker and a front-facing camera.Internally, the devicepurported will carry a QHD screen with Gorilla Glass 4 protecting it from scratches and smudges.

By chance this does happen, you probably werent paying attention to your fourfigure device in the first place; sheer negligence on your part.

Out of the box, it runs on EMUI 3.1 thats based on Android 5.0 Lollipop. The honor 7 is expected to come to Malaysia officially in September. In China, the dual-SIM 4G LTE variant with 16GB is priced at 2,199CNY which is about RM1,436. Meanwhile in the UK where the device is being launched, the honor 7 is priced at 249.99 (about RM1,611). We should be getting some price indication closer to local launch. In the mean time, do check out our first impressions with the honor 7."
Alexander Wong,Honor 7 First Impressions: Get more without busting your budget,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/28/honor-7-first-impressions-get-more-without-busting-your-budget/,,,2015-08-28,"High performance and low price. Thats the name of the game with these online driven brands. Before the rise of Xiaomi in international markets, Huawei claims to be in the forefront of e-commerce with its honor smart phone line up. Although both Huawei and honor share the same roots, they are distinctively different in terms of positioning and for us consumers, the price tag makes a whole world of difference.During todays event, honor was emphasised as a brand for the new generation and for those who are young at heart. Being a digital-native driven product, it goes directly to consumers, cutting out the middle man which results lower cost and a more competitive price tag.Last year, the honor 6 stood out as one of our favourite 4G LTE smart phones under RM1,000. With its in-house developed Kirin processor, it performed just as good as a flagship Galaxy S5 and yet it cost half the price of other similar flagship devices. For 2015, the new honor flagship isnt just an improvement but it aims to move the goal post further.The honor 7 gets a slightly bigger 5.2 Full HD display encased in an all metal unibody design. It feels much better than the honor 6 which felt plasticky. The front looks virtually the same as the honor 6 but youll notice the changes as you turn to the sides. The back has a nice curve which makes it comfortable to hold, while the top and bottom ends have a plastic cover with some nice texture to it. Youll find a large camera lens which protrudes slightly but you need not to worry about scratches as it uses sapphire glass. Also prominent is a new fingerprint scanner thats quite similar to the Ascend Mate 7. On the right, youll find your usual power and volume rockers, while the left houses a SIM tray slot and a new Smart Key. At the top, it is no surprise with a typical headphone jack, a secondary mic as well as an infrared blaster.Looking at the bottom, it gets a pair of speaker and microphone grills on each side of the microUSB port, which is much better than the old one having the speaker placed at the back."

No worries as the band is also water and dust resistant with IP68 rating.  The honor band is priced at 79 Euros (about RM372) or 59 GBP (about RM382) and it will be available in Q4 2015.

The returns were minimal, although achieving sales through the high end Moto X, and lower end Moto G and Moto E. Lenovo decided that their portfolio was better suited if they capitalised on buying Motos presence in the Western market, giving them a better chance worldwide. Almost a year on, theyve now decided to sell solely under the Motorola name, dissolving its Lenovo Mobile branding.A merging will see all future phones to be sold under the Motorola name, solving the problem of managing two separate companies, who sell the same type of product. In theory, both companies gain as Motorola has always had an issue with only having a limited model inventory, at least presently. Lenovo tops out in terms of its marketability, for the markets theyre not well known yet.All of this is speculation, for the most part  as no official English press release has been outed. So what happens to the latest Lenovo Vibe Shot and the Lenovo Vibe S1? Itll likely be Lenovos last offerings, to match Motorolas conspicuous design or could we see a more varied aesthetic language from the future Motorola devices?Back to the lack of worldwide mention on the subject; based on the lack of information coming from Lenovo, instead only coming from Xiaomi Times  we hope all customers take this information with a grain of salt. So who knows what the future holds for both Lenovo Mobile and Motorola Mobility? Tell us what you think in the comments below.[ SOURCE, VIA, IMAGE SOURCE]"
Arif Lee,First solid rollable keyboard comes to life: the LG Rolly,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/28/first-solid-rollable-keyboard-comes-to-life-the-lg-rolly/,"LG,LG Rolly Keyboard,portable keyboard,Rolly Keyboard","Cool stuff,LG,Mobile Accessories,Others",2015-08-28,"Announced as the industrys first solid rollable wireless portable keyboard, the LG Rolly is made for people on their tablets and smartphones who need to type out a wordy document or quickly reply to conversations on instant messaging apps.Weve seen a lot of flexible keyboards in the past but being made out of silicon, they were flimsy at best. The LG Rolly keyboard tackles that by existing in an impact-resistant polycarbonate with ABS plastic  potentially increasing the experience of the tactile feedback.Roll it/fold it and turn it into a slim cuboid shape to carry around, increasing portability without sacrificing too much on the typing feedback. Itll connect to your favoured device through Bluetooth 3.0 and can be paired to two devices at the same time and has an in-built stand (limited to tablets not more than 10 inches).LG probably took some cues from Logitech K480, which has the same two previously mentioned features but loses out to the Logitechs ability to switch between 3 devices, not just 2. Though, youre likely to prefer the rollability of the LG Rolly more, if itll be joining you on the daily.For a device powered by a single AAA battery, itll provide enough juice to last you 3 months  as quoted by LG. Scheduled to make an appearance during IFA 2015 in September, were hoping to see this thing in action and if its all its made to be. Theres no word on pricing and availability for now but youd probably find out early next month.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Arif Lee,Heres what happens when your S Pen gets stuck,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/28/heres-what-happens-when-your-samsung-galaxy-note-5-s-pen-gets-stuck/,"Android,Galaxy,note 5,S Pen backwards,S Pen slide-gate,S Pen slidegate,S Pen stuck,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note,samsung galaxy note 5,samsung Galaxy Note 5 launch,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy note 5 Photos,Samsung Galaxy Note5,Samsung Unpacked 2015,Slide-gate,Slidegate,smart phone","Android,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-28,"Yesterday we addressed the big ruckus thats been going around regarding the Samsung Galaxy Note5s S Pen design flaw  we use that phraseloosely, as the Korean manufacturers realised the problem but it was probably too late to rectify the problem, due to it being too late in the process. So does printing a disclaimer save them from the backlash?As far as were concerned, when you fork out RM 2,699 for a phablet, youre expecting something that has stood up to vigorous testing. How far along were they before they finally realised? Was putting up that 25th page in the user manual adequate? What actually causes the S Pen functionality to go bust? We arent entirely sure about the first two questions but well help answer the third in this article.Blessed to have the guys from 9to5google anduBreakiFix whove dived into this whole mess by showing what it looks like on the inside of the Note5 when the S Pen inserted the wrong way. Looking closer at the photo, youll see levers that jut out in the silo: one controls S Pen detection and functionality, while the other secures the stylus from falling out the silo.The former/lever 1 sits in between the middle and the end of the silo, under the primary logic board angled upwards on the right of the S Pen; without this lever, youll lose two features  Screen-off memo and Air Command. However, lever 1 doesnt cause the S Pen to get stuck  thats caused by lever 2. Located a little further up the silo, towards the end is the lever that will be the doom of your stylus.An intricate writing tool of sorts, its designed to have two small cutouts near the writing end that holds it in firmly when slotted correctly, writing tip first. A positive design but heres the deal  if its placed backwards or click side first, youll see it getting hitched after passing the second lever. Once youre in this deep, youre probably not getting it out, considering the lack of space following this mishap.If youre lucky enough to get the backward S Pen passed the second lever, youre gonna have to get past the first lever again. Removing the Samsung stylus after this could likely damage the other plastic lever thats mounted inside an internal part soldered to the main board. Thin in nature, this plastic lever gives you the S Pen detection capability, thus making you disable S Pen Detection to get the stylus to work (that is if youve managed to get it out in the first place)  killing the two aforementioned features, delivering a bleak Note5 writing experience.Sympathising with current and future owners of the Galaxy Note5, all we can do is advise everyone to avoid this scenario (as unrealistic as it is) and dont try to replicate this problem at all, youll regret even trying to do so. Weve yet to see if Samsung will buckle from the feedback, probably offering some sort of replacement program, or have a software alert when the silo detects backwards insertion.Still excited about the Samsung Galaxy Note5?

Revamping the former and making the latter bigger but keeping the insides relatively the same; Samsungs two updates will seek to cater to the markets attraction towards bigger screened mobile phones.The latest Galaxy Note5 will set you back a cool RM 2,699 (w/ GST), while the bigger S6 edge+ will cost RM 3,099 (w/ GST). Both of the aforementioned devices will go on sale from the 4th of September onwards; the former will come in two colour options  Gold Platinum or White Pearl, as the latter will be available in either Gold Platinum or Black Sapphire.They are essentially hitting the marketnext Friday so be sure to check out any promotional materials from telco companies soon.Envisioning a market space that grew thanks to its humble beginnings with the Note series, the Galaxy Note5 is promised to be a worthy 5th year edition. Focused towards users who want to be more productive and have a larger screen real-estate, the S Pen will attempt to be an amazing writing companion. Designed to help people with its writing capabilities through the pen computing of the renowned S Pen, itll enable you to jot information down quickly with Screen-off Memo. Scroll capture is a great new edition to the S Pens features  allowing you to screen capture up to 22 pages for easy reference of conversation history or GPS directions while driving.Weve talked about the Note5s specs before but just to refresh your memory, this is a 5.7-inch QHD (2560  1440) screen device that runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Itll be powerfully equipped with an Exynos 7420 processor thats clocked at 2.1 GHz, mated with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. Internal storage options currently only stand at 32GB but were sure bigger versions will make their way to out market soon. Weighing in at 171g, this device has a rear 16-megapixel camera sensor and a 5-megapixel camera sported on the front (both at f/1.9 aperture).Powering this phablet is a 3,000 mAh non-removable battery  surely disappointing fans of the old Note(s) that always had a battery that was hot-swappable. The same goes for the MicroSD slot, that used to live on the Note 4 and its predecessors but has been omitted from the newest Note5. Dont be too disappointed though, as youllbe pleased to know that the LTE capable device now has Dual-SIM support on board, allowing dual-wielding phone users to minimise the number of phones they need to carry.The other star of the show, is the Galaxy S6 edge+, and while it only differs in terms of the availability of the S Pen, the dual edged display and its aesthetic value, has the same specs as the Note5. Succeeding its smaller sibling in a big way, the 5.7-inch screen is larger to increase visibility, and improve its hardiness, with a tougher 7000 series aluminium  stronger than the S6 edge.Since were 10 days away, let us know what you think of the device so far and to recap our coverage of Samsung Unpacked you can check it outhere."

Utilisation of this feature omits the need for a front camera and allows a higher pixel resolution quality of the regular pictures youd normally use your front-facing smart phone snapper for.Apparently build with hardiness in mind, the camera module is said to be able to withstand 132 flips a day, for two years. A bold proclamation for the number two Chinese smart phone maker. The camera sensor itself will be a Sony 13-megapixel BSI sensor with a f/2.0 aperture lens.Notwithstanding its regular smart phone features, the Honor 7i also comes with a fingerprint sensor, placed at its side. Claiming to be the smallest said sensor on any phone, the Honor 7i embraces cues from the Saygus V SQUARED  this same fingerprint sensor can also allow you to take photos using your thumb on the Honor 7i. Not short on similarities, the swivelling camera concept has also been on the OPPO N3and theDoov Nike V1 for quite some time.Glass sandwiches the aluminum frame of the 5.2-inch 1080p display device, while internally itll pack the latest Snapdragon 616, mated with two configurations for memory: 2GB RAM and 16GB of internal storage or 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Itll come with Huaweis EMUI 3.1 out of the box and be powered by a 3000 mAh battery.The Honor brand will soon release and market the Honor 7 internationally, so this could mean the same applies for the Honor 7i in the near future, however grey importers should find no trouble in bringing in the new phone, as they normally do. The device sells for 1,899.00 in China, roughly RM 1242 after conversion.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

We liked the compact design, its full HD display and 13MP camera. However its performance leave a lot to be desired.Now it appears that Xiaomi is trying to fix this with a newer model thats expected to be called the Mi 4c. As shown above in its TEENA certification, the Mi 4c is identical to the Mi 4i but it runs on a higher-spec Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor. The Mi 4i is only sold internationally outside of China and it was jokingly called Mi 4 India during its launch. Perhaps the Mi 4c could stand for Mi 4 China. If the TEENA certification isnt convincing enough, the Mi 4c has also dropped by Geekbench and Antutu benchmarks, revealing some of its specs and some pre-release performance figures. The front is still having a 5 Full HD 19201080 display but underneath it runs on Qualcomms Snapdragon 808 processor, which is the same processor powering the LG G4 flagship. The Mi 4c still gets 2GB of RAM and storage starts from 16GB just like the Mi 4i. For imaging, it retains the same 13MP + 5MP camera combination and the battery is said to be a similar 3,100mAh unit. As a new device, it should be running on MIUI 7 thats based on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop.Interestingly its TEENA certification reveals an Infrared Blaster and this allows you to use the device as a universal remote control. Their recently announced Redmi Note 2 also comes with one as well.With a faster processor, hopefully the Mi 4c can solve the shortcomings of the Mi 4i. The price shouldnt be far off from their current Mi 4i as anything higher is encroaching into the ASUS Zenfone 2 space that packs more RAM and storage. At the moment, the Mi 4i is priced at RM749 for 16GB and RM889 for the 32GB version. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

The Phi aim is to simplify drone flying and make it easy for the average consumer to use with minimal training required. Extending up to 26 feet and having the ability to attach a GoPro to the kite-drone, one can only imagine the possibilities of aerial photography.Being funded through the crowd-funding platform, Indiegogo, the Phi (drone only, no GoPro) is available for pre-order for $249 USD / RM 1027 (now $289 USD / RM 1191) and will ship sometime in Q1 2016. Not a stranger to the drone world, Fotokite previously developed and launched the Fotokite Pro, that has made itself a regular in news organisations like the BBC.Handing tools to potential citizen journalists around the world, the Fotokite Phi is set to enable access to harmful protests zones or provide a less worrisome experience in a large open spaced area. Flight is propelled by 4 low-torqued plastic blades shielded by guards to decrease chances of injury, if one were to come in contact with the flying robot.The aforementioned inspiration behind the creation of the Fotokite was Lupashins observations during protests stemming, due to the suspicious federal election that took place in Russia back in 2011. Thankfully, some of these occurrences were captured by drone photographers who were in the area, which gave us a good look at how the Russian people were reacting. Hence, it proved that drone journalism would be pivotal but the only obstacle would be the necessary knowledge to fly a drone in crowded areas  thats where the innovative leash system would come in.Making use of the same technology in retractable dog leashes, Lupashin excluding the need of a well-versed drone pilot. Tethered in such a manner whereby the leash line sits just below the provided GoPro slot, itll ensure that the lens always stays pointed towards the individual manning the drone.Weighing only 12 ounces / 341 grams (including the battery and camera) the Fotokite Phi can fold itself to maximise space and is kept away in its packing tube. Twist gestures command the device to start-up and turning min-flight is manipulated by a button click and similar flick of the wrist, while the leash can be slacked to provide a wider viewing area for stills and video.If youre in the market for something a little higher end, you can look at the Fotokite Pro  mainly the same as its more affordable sibling (15 minutes fly-time) except for the tether doubling as a power cable and a downlink transfer for uncompressed HD video, providing longer recording and flight-times.

Full instructions after the break.The self-proclaimed 2016 Flagship killer is getting its first OxygenOS software update that aims to quash teething problems after its global debut. Just to recap, the OnePlus 2 comes in 2 flavours  HydrogenOS for the Chinese market and OxygenOS for international users.  The OTA update weighs 1.1GB and it will be rolled out first in India before it trickles down to the rest of the world. As you would expect, the latest update fixes the critical Stagefright issues and it addresses other stability and performance concerns on the new device. The changelog reads as follows:1. Download the latest Oxygen OS ROM or update file (if youre currently running on Oxygen OS 2.0.0)2. Connect your phone to your computer via USB and copy the file to the root folder
3. Switch off your phone
4. Press and hold the (Volume Down) and (Power Button) Together until the phone starts
5. Select English
6. Select Install Upgrade File from SD
7. Select the file that youve copied and click OK
8. Reboot after upgrade is completed. You can read the full upgrade details here.============If youve followed our Twitter and Facebook feed, we shared that the OnePlus 2s battery life leaves a lot to be desired. Despite having a massive 3,300mAh capacity battery, we managed to do an average of 17-19 hours on a single charge with 4 hours of screen on time. At thats on a very light usage with no GPS disabled. Considering the OnePlus is still on a Full HD 1080p display resolution, thats quite short compared to other flagship smart phones with higher Quad HD screens and smaller batteries.So far no issues on performance and we liked the stock-like nature of OxygenOS which feels very fluid. One of such bugs weve spotted is the Google Photos app. When you try to pinch and zoom, it automatically springs back to 100% width view and this is annoying. We ended up installing QuickPic viewing instead.At time of writing, the OxygenOS 2.0.1 update isnt available on our unit yet and hopefully this would fix the problems we encountered so far.

The rest of the spec-sheet is the same as before with a 5.2 Super AMOLED display that does full HD 1080p and it runs on an Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor.

Just like the original R5, the R5s also lacks a headphone jack and youll need a micro-USB to audio adapter if youre planning to plug in your head phones. The price of the OPPO R5s is quite surprising as it was listed at 199 Euros (about RM947). As comparison, the OPPO R5 in Malaysia is currently priced at RM1,398, down from RM1,598 previously.

To simplify things, all new MaxisONE Plans now offers unlimited calls and SMS to any local number across the board and the only difference is the bundled data that youll need. There are total of 4 plans available that are named after its monthly commitment fee  MaxisONE Plan 98, MaxisONE Plan 128, MaxisONE Plan 158 and MaxisONE Plan 188.With that, the minimum option is now priced slightly higher at RM98/month and it comes with 1GB of data bundled in. The next option is the MaxisONE Plan 128 which comes with 3GB of data. This is an extra 1GB for the same price that was offered previously. If you need 3GB, it used to cost RM158/month with the RM30/month extra data add-on.Have a bigger data appetite? Theres the MaxisONE Plan 158 with 5GB and MaxisONE Plan 188 at 7GB. Basically youre paying RM15/GB extra for each step above the base MaxisONE Plan 98 plan. As a promo, those who subscribed for MaxisONE Plan 188 will get 1GB extra for 6 months, giving you a total of 8GB/month. Should you need more data, it will cost you 200MB for RM10, 500MB for RM20 and 1GB for RM30. Thats still quite expensive and if you know your usage patterns well, it is better to opt for a higher MaxisONE Plan option in the long run. For more info, head over to the MaxisONE Plan page."

After the release of its rival Apple Watch, the Korean maker wants to show the world what a smart watch should be. This time, it gets a round display which has becoming popular among Android Wear. However Samsung is taking the round approach to a whole new level with its rotating bezel ring as opposed to a digital crown thats being used on the Apple Watch. To get a taste of what to expect, they have finally released the teaser video which was first shown during last weeks event and it revolves around the circular interface. In terms of design, Samsung has toned down its gadgetry look, opting for a normal watch appearance. With Apple pushing the Watch as a fashion piece, Samsung is expected to follow suit by offering an array of build materials and strap designs. You can view some lifestyle shots of the Gear S2 over here. One of the pet peeves of having a circular watch is the impracticality of the display versus a square display that gives a more usable space for reading. It is fine for notifications but beyond that, it isnt ideal for reading long text messages. Can Samsung overcome this shortcomings with the Gear S2?  Well find out in 2 weeks time. In the mean time, do let us know if you prefer round over square or otherwise. [ SOURCE ]"

Alexander Wong,All you need to know: 10 new features on MIUI 7,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/20/xiaomi-miui-7-top-10-features/,"Android,Custom ROM,MIUI 7,MIUI 7 Features,MIUI OS,Xiaomi","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-08-20,"After 5 years running, Xiaomi has made its global announcement of MIUI 7 yesterday. With its humble beginnings back in 2010, the MIUI custom ROM has grown with over 150 Million users and is supported by a team of 750 people. While the interface looks the same as the current MIUI 6, the new version offers more customisation and it gets smarter with a several intelligent tweaks. Read on for the 10 new features after the break.Your smart phone is a personal device and MIUI has been known for its wide array of radical customisable themes. On MIUI 7, they are really pushing the themes up a notch with greater focus on design details. With Muse, a new theme creator, you can design new interfaces with animations including the lock screen like never before. And this is done without the complicated coding.Receiving phone calls can be made more interesting especially when its from your loved ones. Instead of having a static photo, you can change this to a 5 second looping video. If you have tons of instant message groups and social media accounts, your phone would always be demanding for attention. While you can always turn on silent mode before sleeping, MIUI 7 is making the DND mode automated with the help of a Mi Band. The Mi Band as an activity tracker knows when youre asleep and will automatically turns on DND mode. Once youre awake, it is also smart enough to disable DND mode so that you start receiving alerts right away. Especially for the elderly, viewing normal text size can be a strain. While you can easily bump up the text size, the execution isnt always perfect with broken lines and ugly alignment. With MIUI 7, it now offers an even larger XXL size and it is done beautifully in any screen without breaking its original layout design. Data is core in every smart phone experience. Not everyone has a huge data plan and high-speed coverage could be limited especially in developing countries. To ensure an optimal internet experience, Xiaomi has incorporated Opera Max Data Saver which helps to compress data not only in browser but also in other internet connected apps. This helps to speed up loading and will also help to cut down consumption of your precious internet quotas. For those with kids, your smart phone is the best camera of capturing moments in any situation. If need to show photos of your baby, it can be a daunting task if your album is filled with random pictures. To make things easier, they now have a Baby Album which automatically creates a collection for your baby with the help of facial recognition. Similar to Huaweis Magazine cover feature, you can have a different lock screen wallpaper every single day. Theres a selection of high quality images and this will be made available first in India before it is released for international markets.  Sometimes your kids might want to steal your phone for a short game or two. To keep your data private and phone settings intact from curious fingers, the Child Mode lets you pick which apps and features that are accessible to them.  Performance is always a concern of users and MIUI 7 has been tweaked to provide a faster experience. App start up times have been optimised by loading both data and animations in parallel and Xiaomi claims a 30% improvement in app response. According to Xiaomi, as much as 48% of battery life are consumed by background processes such as GPS, mobile data and WiFi. To squeeze more life from each charge, they have optimised its background usage as well as regulating app sync times to minimise consumption. As a result, this would give 10% better battery life which is equivalent of up to 3 hours extra each day. If you cant wait to give it a go, MIUI 7 will be available as a beta release beginning 24th August on the official MIUI website. The Beta release will support Redmi 1S, Redmi 2, Mi 3, Mi 4, Mi 4i, Redmi Note 3G and Redmi Note 4G. To watch the full presentation, you can hit play in the embedded video below."

ASUS doesnt seem to be slowing down, as the Zenfone 2 Laser (ZE500KG) has been spotted on SIRIM Malaysias database, meaning a fourth device could be soon announced by the mobile computing company.Appearing in SIRIMs list could mean that ASUS could discretely be planning a joint event to release two (or more) devices at one time. ASUS ZE500KG model is mainly a mid-ranger that sports a 5-inch HD 720p display with a 1.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 410, under the hood. Multitasking will be handled by the 2GB of RAM and storage comes in either 8GB or 16GB of expandable memory.Maintaining its namesake, the Laser will offer a laser auto-focus system coupled with its 8-megapixel rear shutter at a f/2.0 aperture and PixelMaster technology.

How much will this wallet friendly device cost? Itll likely be around RM 400  RM 500, as the higher end phone around RM 631 (converted from Indias sale price) for the ZE550KL model of the same phone.Well update everyone as we know more but be sure to stay tuned cause it wont be long following the SIRIM listing.[ SOURCE ]"

Not only youre tied for 24 months but you would also need to fork out a huge sum of money upfront, which sometimes cost more in total than the actual phone itself. While there are some telcos offering zero waiver for upfront payments, youre essentially still tied down to the same phone until your 24 months duration is up. Maxis wants to change the way you buy your smart phones by introducing the Zerolution program. It promises absolutely no payment upfront, no contracts and no interest fee over your monthly payments. Best of all, this isnt an Easy Payment Plan that requires a credit card. Everything you hate about a phone contract be gone. Sounds too good to be true? Read on to find out. To get a phone through Zerolution, youll need to pick a new MaxisONE Plan that starts from RM98/month and then pick the phone you want. By default, the monthly payment is calculated over a 24 months period and if you decide to leave, youll just need to pay the balance without any penalty charges.For those that want to own the latest phones every year, theres an early upgrade option at RM30/month. So after 12 months, you can surrender your current device and switch to a newer phone without any penalty or upgrade cost. Just pick a new phone and pay the new monthly payment. In order to upgrade, the device must be in good working order which means no cracked screen or serious dents on the device. If the device is not in good order, a RM300 fee will apply. For better peace of mind, they are offering a device protection at RM15/month thats comes with 48 hours replacement. For now the Zerolution program covers 4 devices  the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, HTC One M9+ and the Samsung Galaxy A7. All new flagship devices will be available on Zerolution moving forward and gradually its existing line up including the iPhone 6 will be offered later. Considering the easy ownership and zero penalty charges involved, the Zerolution is a hassle free way of owning a device. This isnt a leasing program as you do own the phone after 24 months. If you calculate the monthly payment over 24 months it is cheaper than buying the phone outright at full retail price. Thats of course without the optional early upgrade (RM30/month) and device protection (RM15/month) add-on. For those that change phones on an annual basis, this can be seen as a leasing programme as you can swap phones easily without the hassle of trading in. Once youve completed the full 24 months period, the phone is yours to keep. Below is one example of buying the Galaxy S6 on Zerolution versus a typical 24 months contract.For more info, head over to Maxis Zerolution page."

Most die hard Samsung fans have been frowning upon the lack of a removable battery and expandable storage when the Galaxy S6 was launched earlier this year. This would not change for the new Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+, leaving users to rely on its built-in storage and cloud options should they need to store more. A few days back, there had been rumours that the Galaxy Note 5 will be having a hybrid SIM tray slot, which allows you to plonk a microSD card into the 2nd SIM slot if the need arises. That lead turned out to be false, as the alleged proof was actually a Galaxy A8 which was recently launched here at RM1,888.As written on the official spec sheet, the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ will not come with microSD expansion. If youre not convinced, a dual-SIM Galaxy Note 5 in Taiwan had its SIM tray slot shown off and it only fits 2 nano-SIM cards. This is the same model that has been certified in our Malaysian SIRIM database carrying the model number SM-N9208. Lets face it, the microSD slot is slowly disappearing from flagship smart phones these days. Performance is one of such reasons as there are different microSD standards and a slow card could hamper the overall user experience. This is more apparent as Samsung uses its high performance Universal Flash Storage and some alleged that unreliable external storage could hamper its overall performance. Samsung isnt the only one singing the same tune as both Google and Xiaomi too have omitted microSD slots from their flagship device. If youre dying for a microSD expansion, youre left with just a handful including the HTC One M9+, Xperia Z3+, LG G4, OPPO R7 Plus and the Huawei P8. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Said to come from two manufacturers LG and Huawei in two sizes  a 5.2-inch phone and a 5.7-inch phablet, respectively. An alleged image of LGs Nexus offering has made its rounds showing how the phone looks like from the back.Theres nothing much to run on regarding the device in the image except for the camera module and a circular metal ring below the camera sensor. No branding appears on the actual body of the phone but there is a white sticker with an LG logo on it, so we can safely assume this is LGs Nexus and not the Huawei Nexus.Protrusion of the camera could mean that the phones design is very thin, giving LG not much to work with in terms of how much the camera sensor juts out. Accompanying the camera (purported 16-megapixel or 20.7-megapixel) will be what seems to look like laser focus technology and dual-LED flash.Some go on to claim the circular metal ring is actually a fingerprint scanner; a design differing from Androids design cues but very much like Apples (differing placements). However, we advise all of this be taken with a large dosage of salt  mainly because LG has been fairly discrete about its Nexus, though it does match older renders here. The majority believe Google will keep to its annual scheduled release of the Nexus(es) and Android M, which is due usually in October. Since theres still 2 months to go, be sure to expect more rumours and leaks as autumm nears.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

If you had the interest to get one, you might want to buy yours before this weekend. According to DirectD, both high-spec ASUS Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) models with 4GB RAM will be increased by RM100. The Zenfone 2 4GB RAM + 32GB which is priced at RM1,099 will be increased to RM1,199, while the 64GB storage model will be marked up from RM1,299 to RM1,399. The prices mentioned above are inclusive of GST and comes with ASUS Malaysia 1 year warranty. With every purchase, DirectD is offering a free original bumper case while stocks last. It is quite unusual to see a sudden price increase for smart phones. This could be due to our weakening currency against the dollar or a re-positioning of ASUS smart phone line up since there are more Zenfone 2 variants coming out way like the Qualcomm based Zenfone Selfie and Zenfone 2 Laser. The Zenfone 2 is a dual-SIM 4G LTE device and it offers a large 5.5 Full HD IPS screen. Under the hood, it runs on Intels 64-bit 2.3GHz Quad-Core Atom Z3580 processor thats mated to 4GB of RAM.

For the BlackBerry purist, youll appreciate that it retains the same 4 row keys instead of the Passports compact 3 row layout.With the recent rumours that BlackBerry is exploring an Android device, the new slider could be their first device to run on Android Lollipop. In terms of availability, Evan Blass has added that it will be available in the US in November with all 4 carriers supporting it. Theres still a market for QWERTY based smart phones and for it to run on Android is definitely interesting. Even Samsung has tried to reboot its QWERTY keyboard experience by introducing its Keyboard cover for the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+. For Android users who are itching for the tactile feel of a physical keyboard, this is one device to look out for. In terms of pricing, dont expect this to be cheap as BlackBerry will definitely position their slider as a premium device especially with that curve display."

Not only it gets a huge 6 Full HD display, it also features 13MP cameras for both front and back. To get the best out of your selfie shots, the front camera has a wider 22mm view and it gets a soft LED Selfie Flash for better illumination.

The new Note delivers a whole refreshed look, packs an amazing camera and an enhanced S Pen experience.Having had an exclusive hands-on experience (you can read and watch about it here) I can tell you that from the offset, the Note 5 doesnt seem do anything ground-breaking. The Notes crown jewels were always the big format display and exclusive stylus experience. Having said that, its an evolution from the previous generation with little touches that enhance productivity and overall user experience. Here are my favourite five top features of the Galaxy Note 5.Aside from the size of the big display, the Note 5 looks nothing like its predecessor. Gone is the faux leather and chromed frame. In fact, the Note 5 has more in common in terms of looks and build with the beautiful Galaxy S6. In comes a premium build with an all-metal finish and beautiful glass curved back. Whats important to note is that, despite having a large 5.7-inch QHD AMOLED display, the Note 5 is actually smaller, thinner and lighter than the previous Note devices. If you loved the S6 and S6 edge, then youll appreciate the lines, curves and feel of the new Note 5Samsung has finally introduced a spring-loaded auto-eject mechanism to the infamous S Pen. So no more fiddling and using your nail to detach the stylus from the silo. It makes perfect sense, really, and something youll definitely appreciate. The S Pen itself features better build, and seems more durable and less plasticky than the previous versions. The S Pen is more responsive and the hand-writing recognition is better than ever, making writing and drawing as natural as doing it with a real pen. The Air Command is a Note special. Click the button on the S Pen and a pop-up menu shows up on screen. It gives you quick access apps and features. This is a much-loved feature of the Note series. With the Note 5, it gets even better. Now you can customise Air Command to modify and add up to three favourite apps to it. Its really neat and a long time coming.This is one of those Now why didnt they think of this before? features. Imagine this scenario. You need to quickly jot down something  a phone number, a message or a scribble. Youll need to scan your fingerprint or unlock your phone, search for your app, fire up your app and then write your message.What if you can do it with a single step? Well, now you can. Just detach the stylus and write on the screen. There is no step two. And thats brilliant. In smartphones, especially in the flagship Galaxy series, audio has always been something of an afterthought. Pretty strange if you think about it. Since we spend so much time on our phones listening to music, watching movies and playing games, why isnt it made to deliver better quality sound?Audiophiles will love this. The Note 5 now has Ultra High Quality Audio (UHQA) support built in. That means you get up to 24bit/192kHz quality audio. A UHQA upscaler enhances existing MP3 music and make them all more listenable and enjoyable. The Note 5 includes a new UHQA-Bluetooth codec which means better quality audio streamed to your favourite Bluetooth headphones. And naturally, UHQA works perfectly with Samsung LEVEL.Samsung didnt just adopt the best design and build elements from the S6 and S6 edge. It also brought one of my biggest loves about the S6 series  the amazing camera. Weve raved about the S6 camera and even our readers tend to agree. Make no mistake, the 16MP f/1.9 snapper with OIS is stunning, the best on any smartphone. It features an enhanced software-based OIS for smooth, shake-free video. Shoot high-resolution stills or 4K video. The only limit is your imagination. For taking selfies, the Note 5 gets a 5MP shooter, which is an upgrade from a 3.7MP unit on the Note 4. Performance is unmatched in low light and if you need fast autofocus and shutter, youve got the best in your hand. Photography is often spontaneous and unplanned, so simply double-click on the Home button to fire up the camera. All in under a second.So there you go, my 5 top features of the new Galaxy Note 5.

With the use of glass, obviously it wont play nice when the device meets a hard concrete floor. The guys over at PhoneBuff had conducted what appears to be the first drop test ever for Samsungs latest flagship. While the metal frame helps to absorb impact from the sides, direct drops facing downwards will definitely cause some serious damage to the screen. Even when it was dropped with the back facing down from 1 metre height, the impact is strong enough to crack the protruding camera lens. It is interesting to point out that they rated the Note 5 to be more durable than the Galaxy S6 but it is still behind the predominantly metal iPhone 6 and HTC One M9.

Alexander Wong,OnePlus 2 tear down reveals modular internals and it is easy to repair,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/19/oneplus-2-tear-down-reveals-modular-internals-and-it-is-easy-to-repair/,"OnePlus,oneplus 2,OnePlus 2 Malaysia,OnePlus 2 Repair,OnePlus 2 Tear Down,tear down","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-08-19,"The OnePlus 2 is heading to Malaysia soon. If youre wondering how easy it is to repair, we turn to the dismantling experts at iFixit. Most unibody smart phones these days are quite complicated to dismantle and it is common to see them using tons of adhesive and proprietary screws that would require special tools. But not with the OnePlus 2. With its replaceable sandstone back cover taken out, the back plate is held together with standard Phillips screws. The non-removable 3,300mAh battery is kept in place with a little adhesive and it shouldnt pose much problems if you need to replace it. The rest of the components such as the camera module and the USB Type C port are modular, making replacements an easy task.Probably the only difficulty would be the display as the IPS LCD is fused together with the glass. So if youve cracked your screen, you would need to replace the whole piece which can be quite costly. Overall iFixit rates the OnePlus 2 with a repairability score of 7/10, which is easier than the first OnePlus One that scored 5/10. As comparison, the Galaxy S6 scored 4/10, while the HTC One M9 did badly at just 2/10.

Happening from the 26th of August up till 1st of September 2015, the Unitysale promises to slash service and product prices up to 94%.The 5 said companies will be joining forces to provide a celebratory experience with their contributions towards users who sign up anew and also existing users who have used their platforms before. Akin to corroborate the Digital Malaysia initiative, the 5 e-commerce team up is purposed to leverage the 20 million internet users of Malaysia. By capitalising on the 66% of the population, online shopping has grown exponentially in the last two years and hands buyers a new medium to shop.Luca Barberis (Managing Director of ZALORA Malaysia) went on to say that it is through the partnership of the biggest e-commerce players the industry can strength itself. Echoing sentiments by his counterpart at Lazada, who said that as more users use the service, more feedback will be received, thus proving that through collaboration all 5organisations will benefit.Improving platforms and customer service was also addressed at the event. To quote LazadasCEO, Hans-Peter Ressel said the Unitysale will be a joint-campaign to benefit Malaysians together and Lazada will push for better service through their larger warehouse thats set to be in full swing come November or December of this year. Theyre plans also extend to East Malaysia, by setting up a first warehouse there, to shorten delivery times by having inventory on-hand. Similarly, foodpanda is said to be facing the same qualms with complains of delivery times, so theyve attempted to mediate that by creating smaller cluster areas to ensure all food is delivered in one hour.HappyFresh Malaysias Managing Director, Opal Wu also reiterated that time-saving will be one of the biggest advantages of e-commerce. Families can now spend less time going to the market and local grocery store by moving their foodstuffs purchases online.Saving time may be only one of the said perks of e-commerce, as with economic constraints both Uber and foodpanda agree that in trying times, Malaysians should try to save money. With the cost of private transportation gradually going up, uberX aims to help riders save by using our technology to maximise efficiency, said Leon Foong, General Manager of Uber Malaysia.Heres a sneak-peak of the deals coming from the respective e-commerce sites:"

Close to a month after the launch of the 32GB model Mi 4i in India, Mi Malaysias Facebook page gave us the same wonderful news to happen at 12pm tomorrow. Budding buyers were fighting fears of the 16GB model (non-expandable) since its introduction to our shores but the 32GB variant might just be the answer to those worrying woes.Keeping the original spec sheet as it is, the device will run a second-gen Octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor (1.7 GHz) on board the 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen device and 2GBs of RAM will help optimise the MIUI skin of Android 5.0.2. Although capable of a LTE enabled dual-SIM offering, the system isnt a hybrid SIM + MicroSD, hence why the bump in the internal memory storage is much sought after.Tomorrow is not long off but well choose to speculate the pricing of the 32GB Mi 4i  India offers the two models for Rs. 12,999 (RM 814) and Rs. 14,999 (RM 939), 16GB and 32GB, respectively. On the other hand, here in Malaysia the 16GB model goes for RM 749, leading us to believe that the 32GB capacity model could go for less than RM 900.Be sure to keep a look out on Mi Malaysias website for any updates regarding the Mi 4i and check out our review of the device here.[ SOURCE ]"

Featuring a round display, the next smart watch will be called the Samsung Gear S2 and this will succeed its current Gear S.  Formerly speculated as the Samsung Gear A (codenamed Orbis), the new watch is still running on Tizen and it offers rotary bezel ring interface as new form of interaction. From the screenshot above, it looks similar to the LG Watch Urbane LTE, thats based on WebOS. Unlike the early generation Gear smart watches, the Gear S2 is expected to cut down on non essential features like a camera and infrared blaster.  With Apples new Watch going full swing, Samsung is speculated to release up to 3 distinctive line ups that cover different price range differentiated by the materials used. Being a personal device thats seen as a fashion item, the new watch needs to be more than just features to win the masses. The Gear S2 will be revealed on 3rd September in Berlin, during IFA2015."
soyacincau,Compared: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 versus Galaxy Note 4,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/14/compared-samsung-galaxy-note-5-versus-galaxy-note-4/,"galaxy note 5,S Pen,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note 4,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Malaysia,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,stylus","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"Nearly a year has gone since the Galaxy Note 4 and flash-forward to the present with the arrival of the much anticipated Galaxy Note 5 is a reality. Today we aim to pit the old against the new and discuss the main differences, mainly positive but some questionable.The mobile tech giant has made some brand-new features both in hardware and software. Mentioning the former first, the processor gets an upgrade from the Exynos 5433 (SM-N910C) / Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 (SM-N910S) to the chart-topping AnTuTu scorer, the Exynos 7420. Samsungs newest phablet also gets a 1GB bump in the RAM department compared to the Note 4 (3GB), adhering to the current industry standard for new flagships.Furthering connectivity speeds is the Note 5s latest LTE Cat 6/Cat 9 pushing the older Cat 4 enabled Note 4 out of the water, with blistering future-proof speeds once telecommunication infrastructure is done catching up. Moving to the camera, well see a similar 16-megapixel main camera, but the front shutter is now 5-megapixels from the previous 3.7-megapixels. Samsung has said to make the camera interface zippier as launching speeds have improved from 1.1 seconds to 0.6 seconds. Audio advancements are now up scaled to support an ultra-high-quality listening experience  couple that with Samsung Milk Music and youll be set to enjoy yourself.The star of the show of course will be the spring loaded eject-able S-Pen that will no longer chip anymore finger nails. Samsung has promised that the feeling of writing will be as close as to writing on paper but hasnt mentioned raw specifications of increasing pressure sensitivity as for now. Hardware aside, itll also be enhanced to Scroll Capture long screenshots with Screen Write: a sure favourite for long direction instructions and conversations. Air command will now always appear on-screen to assist you with your S-Pen functionality.Off-screen notes can be easily written with the S-Pen just by simply tapping on the screen with the stylus while in standby. PDF annotations are also easier with the S-Pen, giving users the means to simply sign a PDF document using the stylus and sending it off to be printed for your business needs.Design language also takes a turn with the latest iteration of the Note series. Gone are the days of plastically backs and in comes a more superior built product. Comparing the old and the new side by side and youll be able to tell them distinctively apart, especially so when you take a look around the edges and rounded backing of the Note 5. Placement of the camera and audio speakers have been adjusted to make the device better to look at and change the listening experience a little. Making up the bottom is now the moved speaker, and audio jack, while the positions of the S-Pen and micro-USB port remain. The phablet is now lighter too, weighing in at 171g, opposed to 176g (Note 4) and comes in a smaller footprint  153.2 x 76.1 x 7.6mm compared to the slightly larger Note 4 (153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5mm)Samsung has addressed some qualms  mostly related to its stance on premium materials and removable batteries. Seeing a change of trend towards users who prefer a more luxurious feel, the Korean manufacturer has decided that it was time to exclude removable batteries in replacement of a metal encased design From the S6 series to the current Note 5, were now seeing a more streamlined aesthetically pleasing device with more metal and glass. Although, there will always be trade-offs and this time its no exception, as the glass will pick up finger prints and smudges quite easily. The battery also takes a hit, now only 3,000mAh battery housed in non-removable fashion due to the unibody design, which dips from the old Note 4  3,220mAh.Worry not, as the Note 5 will be helped along by fast charging the device from 0%  100% takes 90 minutes, 9 minutes quicker than its predecessor. If cables is not your thing, youll be happy as the newer Note even supports fast wireless charging, although charge times are nothing to shout about (0%  100% in 120 minutes). Other than the removable battery omission, were also seeing an exodus of MicroSD support from the Note 5  unsure why they decided to go down this route, seeing as dual-SIM trays usually are hybrids, allowing users to choose two SIMs or use one + a MicroSD card. Lastly, seemingly seen as an odd decision, Samsung decided to leave out the infared blaster seen on older released devices.To cap-off, the Note 5 has made refinements in these categories:and sacrificed some features in the process, as well:Well see how the Note 5 fares when it goes on sale in selected regions, while itll make an appearance sometime in September for our local market.[ SOURCE ]"

Typing will be supported by the QWERTY style keyboard that has 3 Android buttons  Recent Apps, Home and Back button. One could assume that the Keyboard Cover would benefit to those who felt that the typing experience on the two said phablets wouldnt be a great experience when one-handed.We spent a short time with the Keyboard Cover attached to the edge+: describing the keys akin to a soft resin-like texture and it felt flimsy at best. A lackluster solution but tries to appeal to those who like tactility when typing on the capacitive screen. These tactile inclinded typist that prefer BlackBerrys signature typing experience might just consider jumping ship given the option to add this US $80 extension. The keyboard itself doesnt have any special technology, merely the keys will touch the screen as if your fingertips would but it does move up the UI when the keyboard is in place.Now the real question comes about; would you buy it?"

It should be noted that the screen to body ratio is 72% and the dimensions are 189 x 110.9 x 8.7mm  considered light and compact for its dimensions, probably due to the plastic body that still has an upmarket feel, thanks to the leather-looking texture.Given the devices affordable nature, it doesnt come with 4G LTE and well only get a 3G model that supports a single SIM.

You can check out our Galaxy Note5/S6 edge+ price plan comparison from the big 4 telcos. Samsungs latest phablets the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ were launched last week, both offering 5.7 Quad HD displays and 4GB of RAM. For Malaysia, both devices are expected to arrive sometime in early September and if youre curious about its pricing, we can gather some clues from our southern neighbours.The Galaxy Note 5 had went on sale in Singapore last Saturday, 15th August with two colour options Black Sapphire and Gold Platinum. Meanwhile the double edge Galaxy S6 edge+ will be available a week later on 22nd August with the same colour options.Just like the Galaxy S6/S6 edge, the Singapore market has the option for multiple storage options with 32GB and 64GB available. For easy reference, weve compared the launch prices of the past Galaxy flagships in Singapore below, which are inclusive of GST. As expected, the Galaxy Note 5 is priced slightly higher than the Galaxy S6, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ is a notch higher than the S6 edge. Based on the pricing in Singapore, we can roughly guess how much it will cost in Malaysia. With GST taking effect since April, you can expect to pay much more for the Note 5 compared to the previous RM2,499 price tag for the Galaxy Note 4. Assuming if GST was in effect back then, the Galaxy Note 4 would cost RM2,649 which is more than the Galaxy S6. Furthermore, the Note series is usually priced slightly higher than its compact Galaxy S series model.We are guessing that the Galaxy Note 5 could be priced around RM2,699 while the Galaxy S6 edge+ hovering around RM3,199. Take note that this is just an estimate and Samsung Malaysia could price them differently considering our depreciating ringgit and both phablets will be coming with Dual-SIM slots.

Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge gets a Plus for a bigger screen,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/14/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-hands-on-first-impressions/,"Android,Curved Display,Dual Sim,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus first impressions,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus hands on,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"If youve always wanted to get an S6 edge for its dual curve display but held back due to its smaller 5.1 size, the folks at Samsung has probably heard your prayer. Like the name suggests, the S6 edge+ is a larger Galaxy S6 edge with a phablet size display. The screen isnt the only thing that has been upgraded as the the internals for both hardware and software have gotten plus size in their own areas. Underneath this familiar looking device, the Galaxy S6 edge+ is an identical Galaxy Note 5 underneath minus the productivity S-Pen. Strangely Samsung didnt release the successor of the Galaxy Note Edge, but instead they have upgraded an existing Galaxy S smart phone it into a phablet device. The Galaxy S6 edge is a beautiful looking thing but holding it isnt as reassuring as the flat edged Galaxy S6. On the bigger Galaxy S6 edge+, it is no different. The front has curved front glass that slops onto its thin frame. If we have both the S6 edge+ and Note 5 side by side, the Note feels more reassuring to hold with its thicker sides and a curved back glass thats more natural to hold.The rest are identical, from the placement of its volume and power buttons down to its headphone jack, micro USB port and speaker grill. Looking at the top, youll find a SIM tray slot and thats when you notice that it lacks an infrared blaster that used to be located in the middle. The front display is a Note category 5.7 display that does a similar Quad HD resolution (25601440) with a pixel density of 518 ppi. Overall, it is a tiny bit thinner at 6.9mm (S6 edge: 7.0mm) and it is 21 grams heavier at 153g (S6 edge: 132g).  Although it shares the same Octa-Core Exynos processor, the Galaxy S6 edge+ gets 4GB RAM, which is 1GB more than the standard model. For storage, it has the same non-expandable 32GB or 64GB storage options using Samsungs speedy Universal Flash Storage 2.0 solution. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery, which is 400mAh more than its smaller brother. While it gets the same native wireless charging, the Galaxy S6 edge+ like the Note 5 now supports faster wireless charging which does 0-100% charge in 2 hours. Compared to the Galaxy Note Edge, the S6 edge curved display doesnt offer as much features due to its reduced curvature at the sides. Instead of a permanent edge panel, the edge display thats customisable for either left or right was mostly used for People Edge, a customisable bar with 5 of your closest contacts. In addition, Samsung wants you to reach out to your contacts in a more emotional manner. So in addition to the typical call, SMS and email, the People Edge lets you send sketches, emoticons and video. As mentioned in our S6 edge review, we prefer if Samsung adds the option for instant message considering it is the main communication channel these days. While the screen is off, you still can take a peek on your notifications and infostream when you rub from left to right on the edge. In addition, they have introduced Apps Edge which offers additional 5 edge shortcuts for your favourite apps. Since the S6 edge+ shares similar underpinnings as the non-plus model, we reckon Samsung could be extending these additions for its current S6 edge models. Another nice touch is that the edge features are now accessible on any screen. As comparison, it could only be triggered on the home screen and you cant toggle it if youre running other apps. 
The rest of the S6 edge+ remains unchanged. You get the same excellent 16MP f/1.9 OIS camera at the back and a front facing 5MP f/1.9 camera at the front for better lit selfies. Similar to the Note 5, it does get Live YouTube Broadcast from the camera app as well. Nope, the battery isnt removable and despite us getting a dual-SIM version in Malaysia, theres no microSD expansion for the S6 edge+ either. So would you pick this over the Galaxy Note 5? They are identically the same underneath and the only difference is the curve display and productive S-Pen that sets them apart. The edge display to us has always been a technological showcase and it is hard to justify to pay a lot over a non-edge device for the sake of having a fancier screen. So the question of whether to get a Note 5 or an S6 edge+ really depends on whether you want something you can do more with or having a device thats good to look at."

Given their thicknesses both devices will probably have some form of curve, with the greatest thickness in the middle not unlike that of the Motorola Moto X. An earlier rumour detailed that the 5.7 inch Nexus would have a QHD display as well as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC, but it hasnt been confirmed yet.Both devices are also likely to be metal, especially the Huawei with an all-aluminium body, while the LG would probably sport a metal frame instead of having a metal unibody design. Theyre rumoured to come out of the box with Android M too, but there arent any newdetails about the devices aside from dimensions.Still, this isnt official info so best to take it with a pinch of salt.More images of the Nexus devices:[VIA][SOURCE, 1]"

Before this, we were given a glimpse of the upcoming affordable phablet from its TEENA certification listing, but now we get to see a clearer view on its exterior and its purported internals.The Redmi Note 2 retains a 5.5 phablet sized display but this time it pushes a higher Full HD 1080p resolution, instead of HD 720p on the current Redmi Note. In terms of design, it looks like a bigger version of the Mi 4i and its rear camera lens is placed right smack in the middle.Since the Redmi series is often associated for value for money, one would expect an entry to mid-range processor. However the Redmi Note 2 seems to be packing some serious firepower with MediaTeks 2.0GHz Octa-Core MT6795 processor thats mated to 2GB of RAM. The processor is a Helio X10 unit, which is rather high-end and could be found on flagship devices like the HTC One M9+ and One E9+.For storage is gets 16GB which is expandable with microSD.

The Redmi Note 2 is much thinner, lighter and narrower than the previous Redmi Note thanks to its compact design and narrower bezels. It looks like a bigger Mi 4i and it has a 5.5 IPS display which now pushes Full HD 1080p resolution. Overall, it is 8.25mm thin and weighs just 160 grams. The Redmi Note 2 is definitely no slouch as it gets MediaTeks 64-bit Helio X10 MT6795 Octa-Core processor, which is the same unit thats powering the Meizu MX5 and HTC One M9+.

Although the brand is not commonly known in our side of the world, with only China being the exception, the Axon Lux and Pro has popped up on lelong.my.Appearing on the e-commerce website under seller androidworld, this industry underdog is not shy about flaunting its specs. Being sold aretwo variants the Lux (RM 2,550) and the Pro (RM 3,499)  with the differences lying in the RAM, screen resolution and internal storage options. The Lux will get you 3GB RAM, a FHD (19201080) screen and 32GB of internal storage. A bump up with the Pro edition will get you 4GB RAM, a 2K (2560 x 1440) screen and a massive 128GB internal storage, both of which support MicroSD, up to an additional 128GB for a whoppinggrand total of 256GBs.Everything else about the China model variants are much the same  they both run a Snapdragon 810 Octa-core processor thats clocked at 2.0GHz.

Other features include HIFI quality audio; thanks to the AK4961 audio chip, a finger print and iris scanner for biometric security and NFC. The past has shown us that the iris scanner on the vivo X5Pro doesnt work in our market, so thats yet to be tested on the Axon.Photos will be shot on a duo combination of a 13-megapixel and 2-megapixel rear sensors and selfie-centric individuals can take advantage of the 8-megapixel front camera. The secondary camera located on the back will help with depth of field while taking photographs, similar to HTCs concept.LTE support, Bluetooth and dual-SIM (Nano-SIMs) make up the connectivity options for the device. ZTEs Axon will run Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box, thickly skinned by MiFavor3.X. Noting that the device isnt officially brought to our shores, itll be nice to see how it fares given the prices are comparable to other flagships that have already made a name for themselves locally.Thanks to Twitter user @baliriot forthe tip![ SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

Alongside the Redmi Note 2, they have revealed its Mi WiFi nano, a tiny little wireless router that fits on your palm. Measuring just 91mm x 95.2mm, it is roughly the size of a coaster and it weighs just 100 grams. Best of all, it is priced at only 79 CNY, which is less than RM50. The Mi WiFi nano supports 802.11n connectivity with speeds up to 300Mbps and it boast superior signal strength with its external PCB Antennas. This is good enough to cover a space of about 150 square metres. For ease of management and monitoring, the Mi WiFi is connected via a mobile app that comes with an easy to use interface. Even if youre not at home, you can see whos accessing your network and set permissions if required. At the back, it gets 1X WAN port and 2X LAN Ports for wired connectivity. Another neat feature is that it powers by a micro USB port. This makes remote usage possible as you can power the Mi WiFi nano router for up to 30 hours with a single 10,000mAh power bank. It is amazing how the Mi WiFi nano could do so much in a little package. During its announcement, it showed a tear down of other competing routers and it clearly shows that efficient PCB design has contributed to its compact footprint. Will we ever get this officially in Malaysia? It is unlikely to be anytime soon until Xiaomi releases an English version of its firmware. If youre interested, the slightly bigger Mi WiFi is going for RM118, while the enterprise grade Mi WiFi with 1TB storage can be yours at RM589. Obviously they are imports and you would need to know Chinese to get started. For more info, check out the Mi WiFi nano page."

Samsungs unpacked event in New York today finally confirmed rumours and debunked some in the process, so say hello to the new Galaxy Note 5 and the Galaxy S6 edge+.Home-grown Exynos processors make an appearance and have been leading the way to better performance of our Samsung portable devices. Samsung might prove doubters wrong that every new generation, beckons the need for better performance; justifying the similar Exynos 7420 making a reappreance. Reusing the same processor as the old guard isnt a totally horrible idea, as it continues to top AnTuTu benchmarks with over 67,000 points.The Galaxy S6 edges double edge display now gets a +, stretching the screen to phablet stardom at 5.7-inches. We might have a bigger screen but the other innards are all the same, except for a bigger battery. When the Galaxy S6 edge was first introduced, it came with a couple of features including a Peoples Edge which brings your 5 favourite contacts closer to you. With the S6 edge+, they have enhanced this further with Apps Edge which allows you to put 5 app shortcuts within a thumbs reach. In addition, the edge features are now accessible in any screen interface, instead of being limited to just the home screen.Even though internally it is very much the same but the introduction of the new Keyboard Cover accessory further enhances the typing experience on a large smart phone  giving it a more ergonomic feel that could possibly please die hard BlackBerry users.The Galaxy Note 5 is a similar device with the Galaxy S6 edge+, offering a 5.7 Quad HD display and a similar Exynos Octa-Core processor with 4GB of RAM.The S-Pen is the key differentiation in the Galaxy Note series and already in its fifth generation, weve seen a steady progression of innovation. From AirView during the beginning to an extension of features which includes Action Memo, Screen Write and increasing pressure sensitivity. The Note 5 promises to bring a stylus experience to another level  touting it to be a close second to writing on paper.Accompanying the S-Pens housing silo which now has a push to eject mechanism will be the standard micro USB charging port. But if youre not into cables, you could make use of its built-in wireless charging properties of the device which is similar to the Galaxy S6. Youll get a 0% to 100% charge with the cable in 90 minutes with Adaptive Fast Charging, while wireless charging takes a little longer  120 minutes for a full charge.Optimisation of the TouchWiz will be influential in keeping the lights on the 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED screened phablet that pushes a pixel density 518 ppi. That latest battery-friendly Exynos processor and 4GB RAM might help and hopefully wont stump the 3,000mAh battery too much as the older Note 4 survived quite well on a battery larger by 220mAh.Encased in metal and glass, the Note 5 will be thinner and among the lightest Note ever, weighing just 169g. For imaging well see a familiar 16-megapixel sensor on the back with Optical Image Stabilisation coupled with a 5-megapixel front camera. Moving on to another sensory experience, the Note 5 will return with UHQ audio capabilities which helps to upscale low bit audio to a higher quality. Probably the biggest omission on the new Note would be a microSD slot and a removable battery, a trend which is slowly disappearing with flagship smart phones today.Both phablets will be making their way to our shores with dual-SIM enabled, catering to those who prefer to have one mobile devices for work and their social life. Alsoincluded asstandard is its signature heart rate sensor and a capacitive home button that doubles up as a fingerprint scanner.In terms of availability, it is expected to go on sale in Malaysia as early as first week of September.

Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy Note 5: Not bigger but noticeably better all round,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/14/first-impressions-samsung-galaxy-note-5-malaysia/,"Android,Dual Sim,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Dual SIM,samsung Galaxy Note 5 First Impressions,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 hands-on,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,samsung malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"Samsung has created a market for productivity phablets with its Galaxy Note series. With more players cashing in on the big screen phablet game, Samsung has to stay ahead beyond just having a bigger screen and better specs. The last Galaxy Note 4 was a great device but it faced stiffer competition with the likes of the iPhone 6 Plus. With an early announcement for 2015, the Galaxy Note 5 aims to secure its spot as the new king of the hill for the remainder of 2015. Read on for our hands-on experience to find out about this 5th generation productivity phablet.  Before that lets talk more about the device. The overall build quality has been improved and you get the same premium look and feel as the Galaxy S6. Gone is the faux leather back that made its debut on the Galaxy Note 3 and it now gets a stylish looking curve glass at the back, thats similar to the Mi Note. This design somewhat makes the device to better to hold as compared to the Galaxy S6 edge which has little area to grip with its thin metal frame.The screen size of 5.7 has been retained but Samsung has managed to make the Galaxy Note 5 thinner (7.6mm) and lighter (171g) than its predecessor. On-board the Galaxy Note 5 gets a choice of either 32GB and 64GB storage options. Like the Galaxy S6, theres no expandable microSD card memory and you would need to rely on cloud storage for further expansion.The front Super AMOLED display still retains its Quad HD resolution of 25601440 and it pushes a pixel density of 518 ppi, which is still among the sharpest in its class. Powering the internals is a familiar 14nm process Exynos Octa-Core processor thats mated with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. The decision of using the same processor as the Galaxy S6 isnt a bad thing considering it performed well and it is still the best performing processors out there at the moment. From our brief experience, the processor and the generous 4GB RAM combo combined promises a buttery smooth experience for the hardcore multi-taskers. The S-Pen has been completely redesigned. Gone are the days where you need to pry the end with your fingernails as the Note 5 features an eject mechanism, popping up the end of the S-Pen with a light push. In the last Note 4, the S-Pen has doubled its pressure sensitivity to 2048 levels. On the new Note 5, Samsung claims to have improved the experience, making it as close to writing on paper.  Taking down notes is even faster on the Note 5 as you can start scribbling on the front display even while the screen is off. This saves time unlocking the device and finding the app to jot your notes down. The Air Command has been improved with more customisation and it allows you to add shortcuts to your favourite apps.As we move towards a digital office, there are some things that still require analog input. With the Note 5s enhanced handwriting feature, you can now digitally sign PDF documents and have it sent out by email instantly. So you save time printing and re-scanning documents. Another neat feature is taking screenshots with its scroll capture. This allows you to capture a whole web page or a long chat message in a single action. For those that still prefer to type on a tactile keyboard, Samsung has also released a Keyboard Cover which lets you type on a full QWERTY keyboard. The case is surprisingly thin and it lays over the touch screen covering the bottom portion of the device. Theres no batteries or bluetooth pairing required and it connects directly on the touch screen display. When not in use, you can move the keyboard towards its back cover. The Galaxy Note 5 gets a 16MP f/1.9 main camera thats assisted with optical image stabilisation and it is capable of shooting 4K videos. The front camera gets a 5MP f/1.9 unit, thats also similar with the Galaxy S6. To launch the camera at any time, it is also triggered by double pressing on the home button. For great shots anytime, it has Auto HDR for both front and back cameras. In terms of features, it gets better stabilisation for video and now theres also an option to broadcast your moments live on YouTube. This isnt new for a flagship smart phone but nevertheless it is a good option to have especially when you need to share an important moment in real time. Just make sure youre in a location with fast upload speeds on 4G. 
For high speed downloads, the Note 5 supports 4G LTE up to Cat 9 speeds, where available. It also gets 802.11ac WiFi with MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC. Surprisingly Samsung has dropped its Infrared blaster, which has always being a standard feature on its previous flagships. Health still remains one of Samsungs key focus and it still retains a heart rate sensor module that also houses its cameras LED flash. For the very first time in Malaysia, the Galaxy Note 5 will come with Dual-SIM slots, which is good news for globetrotters and mobile warriors that want to separate both personal and work lines. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery that supports both fast charging by cable as well as wireless charging. Using compatible adaptive fast charge, it takes 90 minutes for a full charge. The Galaxy Note 5 has also improved its wireless charging speeds, with 0-100% being accomplished in 2 hours. Like the S6, it supports both wPC and PMA wireless charging standards. The Galaxy Note 5 comes in four colours  White Pearl, Black Sapphire, Gold Platinum and Silver Titanium. US and Canada will be among the first in the world to get it starting next week 21st August, with the rest of the world to follow shortly after. Some might argue that the Galaxy Note 5 is just an incremental upgrade from the Galaxy S6 but the winning formula is more than just better specs and a larger screen. For those who have gotten hooked to the S-Pen, the Galaxy Note 5 is a direct upgrade path with the top notch specs crafted in a premium package. Want to get more things done with a bigger screen? The Galaxy Note 5 still offers one of the best multi-tasking features that have been perfected over the years. Granted that the previous TouchWiz were pretty bloaty, the new iteration is much lighter and certainly theres still room for Samsung to improve. For those who are not convinced with the S-Pen in the previous model, you certainly should give this version a try. Galaxy Note 5 Photo Gallery"

The folks at ASUS Malaysia has invited the media for a sneak preview this coming Friday, and we expect the latest Zenpads to go on sale shortly after. Just to recap, the ZenPad was announced initially with ZenPad 8.0 and ZenPad S 8.0. Right after that, ASUS has expanded the line up with a cheaper ZenPad C 7.0, ZenPad 7.0 and a larger ZenPad 10.For the upcoming launch, we are likely to get the ZenPad 8.0 and the ZenPad S 8.0. The ZenPad 8.0 gets an 8 1280800 display and under the hood youll find an Intel Atom X3 processor with either 1GB or 2GB of RAM. Meanwhile the ZenPad S 8.0 gets higher end specs which includes an 8 2048 x 1536 display, Intels Atom Z3580 processor with 4GB of RAM and it uses USB Type C. Some of the interchangable back covers include a power case that extends your tablets battery life up to 15 hours and an audio cover that gives you a DTS 5.1 Surround Sound with its built-in 6 extra speakers. Also included with the Zenpad S 8.0 is a Z-Stylus that has a 1.2mm writing tip and it works quite similar to Samsungs S-Pen from the Note series. Just earlier last week, ASUS Malaysia has quietly released its budget friend ZenPad C 7.0 thats priced at RM499. While it looks like a bargain, the specs are quite underwhelming when compared to FonePad 7 that offers 2GB RAM and better cameras. Stay tuned as we will be there at the event to provide live updates."
Arif Lee,Curves of the Honor 7 teased in a sneaky photo,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/12/huawei-honor-7-malaysia-teaser/,"Dual Sim,fingerprint scanner,Honor,Honor 7,Honor 7 Malaysia,Honor Facebook,Honor Malaysia,huawei,Huawei Honor 7,IFA 2015,lte,SIRIM","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-08-12,"Honor Malaysia posted yesterday showing us a glimpse of something in the works on their Facebook page. Speculators have come to a conclusion that its definitely an Honor 7 coming our way. A device that sold out (200,000 units) in just 2 minutes in China, it could possibly give other mid-range competitors a good fight locally.Making an appearance inSIRIM Malaysias database as PLK-L01 as of yesterday, further fuels that the device will arrive soon enough, with no tentative date that we can tell for now. As a rough indication for European markets, there has been rumours that the device will make an appearance in September during IFA 2015.Power-packed for its price the Honor 7 features a 5.2-inch 1080p Full HD display and retails (China market) in 3 versions. The lowest  16GB internal storage and LTE, middle option  16GB and dual-SIM LTE and the top end model  64GB and the same dual-SIM LTE. No mention if these will be the same variants that make it to Malaysia but itll be a rough indication what to expect.Aside from all the cellular and internal memory differences, all 3 share a Kirin 935 processor that has 8 cores: 4 high powered running at 2.2GHz and 4 efficient cores clocked at 1.5GHz. While, those on a strict budget can opt for the more affordable16GB dual-SIM LTE model but make use of the MicroSD slot that is available on all variants.Camera bugs who emphasise on pixels will be pleased with a 20-megapixel Sony sensor protruding out of the back of the smart phone, while a decent 8-megapixel shutter makes up the front. The Honor 7 will also come with a fingerprint scanner for biometric security functionality. 3GB of RAM gives the device ample memory to handle multitasking on the distinctive EMUI 3.1 overlay of Android 5.0 Lollipop. To cap off, juicing all these internals will be a 3100mAh battery that is non-removable.Do let us know if youre excited about likeliness of the Honor 7 coming our way in the comments below.Thanks to @KevinNgTK for pointing out the SIRIM listing and Facebook post to us.[ SOURCE]"

If youre a new FIRST postpaid customer or an existing one making the switch to FIRST, youre entitled to get 6% off on Fitbit wearables at their Blue Cube and Celcom Xclusive stores. The promo covers the Surge, the Charge HR, Charge and the Flex. According to the T&C, the selling price for the Fitbit wearables after the 6% discount is equivalent to buying the device without GST. If youre not a new FIRST customer, they are still selling it but you need to pay the full retail price with the 6% GST. On top of that, Celcom is also giving a 5 day pass to Celebrity Fitness to get your game on.   For a mere 6% off, it isnt much considering you can get it cheaper from online retailers. Furthermore, the T&C also states that prices displayed do not include 6% GST, which is surprising considering Fitbit authorised retailers like Harvey Norman are selling them at the same price (before 6% discount) inclusive with GST. Perhaps Celcom should offer them for free or with substantial discounts along with a smart phone contract.Head over to Celcoms Fitbit promo page for more info.[ SOURCE ]"

One of which is its new inclusion in Alphabet; a new company who will be managing Google and all it associated products.This means that there will be an extra eye on Google as a company and Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies andaccording to Google the move was meant to make their operations cleaner and more accountable as they push new technologies like their glucose detecting smart contact lenses and drone delivery service.This of course, will be affecting users on a more subtle level for now, butthe new company wants to make a real difference in the long term view. So we might be seeing changes in the way Google operates (as they say this new Google is slimmer than it used to be)and perhaps even more growth as they are going to be focusing on pushing on potentials they already have.Alphabet Inc. will be replacing Google Inc. as will Google shares convert into the same number of shares for Alphabet, essentially making Google a wholly-owned subsidiary of said company. But dont worry, all the apps we know and love will be staying the same for now. In terms of leadership, co-founder Larry Page will be the CEO of Alphablet Inc while Sergey Brin holds the President position. Meanwhile Sundar Pichai which used to head Android has now been appointed as CEO of Google Inc.  What do you think this big change will bring for Google?[SOURCE]"

PIECE may be your solution designed to look like a phone battery that is relatively the size of a credit card, this tiny device allows you to pop your second SIM card in and receive calls and text through your smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0.Launched since the 27th of July, 2015, PIECE had already accomplished being 100% pledged in only 1 day. Since then, the company has tripled their initial funding and have promised an Android version on the way as well. PIECE currently only has plans to support GSM, EGSM, DCS and PCS SIMs; SIM types that are supported are Micro SIM and Nano SIMs can be used through a PIECE adapter.The device is said to provide 150 hours of stand-by time but only 4 hours of call time on a single charge. Contacts on the other hand, will be accessed either from your SIM in PIECE or your contact list on your smart phone through the PIECE app.All calls and messages will run through the PIECE app and notable features include the ability to warn you, when your phone is getting out of range. This security alert trigger when your phone or device is 10 metres away from each other. As is meant to be designed small and with small things come those times when you cant find them  this is why the creators gave an option to find either PIECE or your smart phone through the app or PIECEs function key.Although being able to support calls and texts, the device will not support cellular data, a bummer to those wanting to use one line for calls/text and the other for only data. Users who dont own a smart phone but an iOS device will be pleased to know that PIECE supports the iPod Touch and non-cellular iPad.Heres the breakdown of the cost backing PIECE on Kickstarter:CAD $70 (RM 211) to CAD $80 (RM 241)  one PIECE (depending how quickly you back the project)CAD $80 (RM 241) to CAD $90 (RM 271)  one PIECE and one card holders (depending how quickly you back the project)CAD $120 (RM 361)  two PIECECAD $140 (RM 421)  two PIECE and two card holdersShipping is an additional CAD $ 15 (RM 46) or CAD $20 (RM 61) depending which options you choose from the above. Businesses and potential retailers can also look out for the other larger orders available on the Kickstarter page. The people behind PIECE aim to put out the device by November 2015.It should be warmed as with any crowd funding projects that there are risks involved and there have been times where projects fell apart and backers lost their money.

Seeing much success in this area, the people behind Znaps, the Magnetic Adapter have envisioned the same but for your mobile devices.Consisting of two magnetic parts: the adapter (plugs into your existing cables connector) and the connector (stays in your devices charging port). A simple solution that will attempt to lessen fraying, tripping and fiddling with your cables. Built initially for Micro USB and iOS lighting adapter only, the company has added a stretch goal offuture-proof USB Type-C. All aforementioned goals have already been reached, with the company raking up an excess of $2.5 million Canadian Dollars so far in funding.One would wonder why Apple didnt bother capitalising and licensing this technology much earlier but the folks at Znaps have refuted claims of patent infringement and possible suing  saying that this is why they didnt create a cable mechanism, instead deploying custom adapters and connectors.Znaps aims to provide support for Quick Charge 2.0 giving it future-proofing factors in the long run. The nifty add-on will also let data transfers to function normally, as per usual cable and is seemingly compatible with other devices that use a Micro-USB, lighting and USB Type-C ports (power banks, laptops using USB Type-C, and other peripherals that require charging/data transfers)Cross-cable swapping (if thats even a term) will be made easy  so basically you wont be dictated by what cable you have, simply as long as you have the right adapter and the right connector to your device. Their pledging system has been plagued with complains, so Znaps has come up with a custom pledge calculator thatll do the work for you. Prices will be reflected below ($1 CAD = RM 3.01)Delivery of the said product is estimated to arrive in November 2015 but as Kickstarter projects have flopped and been delayed before  like these cases: OUYA, Coolest Cooler, DASH Wireless Smart in Earphones.

With the phone actively in use, the edge display only functions as a Peoples Edge, giving you instant shortcuts to 5 of your favourite contacts. For the upcoming Galaxy S6 edge+, Samsung is extending its capabilities which goes beyond basic communications. According to a source, the Peoples Edge will get another layer of shortcuts which is just a swipe away as shown above. This allows you to customise 5 more shortcut icons for your favourite apps. In addition, you can do more for each contact shortcut which is currently limited to Call, SMS and Email. For the new Peoples Edge, you get 3 more actions which includes sending a photo, emoticon and to initiate a video chat. Personally, we felt that it would be better if Samsung offers more options such as sending an Instant Message via WhatsApp, WeChat or FB Messenger. Like the current S6 edge, the new phablet version is expected to retain the same info stream that lets you peek on latest notifications and info panels when you swipe on the edge, while the screen is off. As usual, you also get to see whos calling from its flashing preset colours while the phone is placed upside down. You can read up more about it in our Galaxy S6 edge review.

Initially when the R7 series was launched officially in Malaysia, we are supposed to get its R7 Lite and R7 Plus siblings, priced at RM1,298 and RM1,998 respectively. The folks at OPPO Malaysia has shared that due to market demands, they have decided to bring in the original R7 which claims to be quite popular in its home ground in China. If youre looking for better specs without the phablet size, the R7 will be available starting tomorrow 12th August at RM1,598. But youve got to hurry since theres only 2,000 units to go around for now. The OPPO R7 slots in between in the R7 family and it features a 5 Full HD AMOLED display with a 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor and 3GB of RAM. It gets 16GB of storage thats expandable with microSD, a 13MP main and a large 8MP front camera for higher resolution selfies.Keeping the lights on is a 2,320mAh capacity battery which supports VOOC Flash Charge and overall the R7 is only 6.3mm thick. Despite having an all metal build, the R7 is lighter than its ultra-slim R5 at just 147 grams. In terms of design, the OPPO R7 is identical to its R7 Lite and the only way to tell the difference is the display, since the Lite version pushes just HD 720p resolution. Another difference is the operating system where the OPPO R7 still runs on Android 4.4 KitKat. This is surprising since its R7 Lite and R7 Plus are already running on Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Nevertheless OPPO Malaysia promises that a Lollipop software update will be made available for the R7 soon. Like the rest of the family, the OPPO R7 series supports 4G LTE and Dual-SIMs, with the 2nd slot doing double duty as a microSD expansion if required. For those that pre-ordered the R7 Plus, it will be available starting this Friday, 14th August. If youre one of them, OPPO will be contacting you soon on collection details. For the R7 Lite, theres no firm availability details yet but OPPO Malaysia is targeting by end of August."
Arif Lee,Heres what to expect from the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/12/heres-what-to-expect-with-the-samsung-note-5-and-the-samsung-galaxy-s6-edge/,"Android,Galaxy,note 5,S6,S6 edge,S6 Edge Plus,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note,samsung galaxy note 5,samsung Galaxy Note 5 launch,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy note 5 Photos,Samsung Galaxy Note5,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus photos,Samsung Unpacked 2015,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-08-12,"Bigger is always better, right? A much anticipated refresh of the Samsung Note series will be unveiled tomorrow. Taking place in the Big Apple itself, itll also feature the newer and bigger Galaxy S6 edge+. Introduced 4 years ago, the Galaxy Note series had created a whole new phablet category, promising a tablet-like experience in a smart phone form factor. With a 5.3 screen, it was considered quite huge during its time and most flagship smart phones are at least 5.5 inches these days. Can Samsung maintain its phablet king status in its 5th generation?Heres the stuff we know about the Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ and its quite a mouthful.Practically everything has already been leaked but the weight of this information should always be taken with a grain of salt to ensure no disappointment. For the Note 5, weve seen mock-ups, prototypes, benchmarks and even the packaging! Not short on building the hype for the actual device, which is assumed to carry either a 64-bit Exynos 7420 Octa-core processor or a better Exynos 7422 with an all-in-one chip solution. Screen size will stick to the 5.7-inch footprint and utilise its own Super AMOLED display technology with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 (Quad HD).Performance will be helped along with an ample amount of RAM at 4GB and internal storage will cap off at 32GB. Some will be put-off by omitting the microSD option but will take comfort in the S-pen being improved to auto-eject through a spring loaded mechanism. Some sources go on to say that the device will be as heavily skinned as previous iterations, as TouchWiz and S-pen apps will be taking the load from the 4GB, leaving probably about only half left to be used.Snapping photos will be made using a 16-megapixel rear shooter that takes advantage of OIS feature and the front will be a decent 5-megapixel sensor, similar to its current Galaxy S6. In terms of battery capacity, the Galaxy Note 5 is said to be having a 3,000mAh capacity battery thats non-removable. Just like the Galaxy S6, the battery is smaller than its predecessors but Samsung reckons that its frugal Exynos processor and Universal Flash Storage would sip less power.  Skimming only halfway through, weve yet to mention the Galaxy S6 edge+. Design aesthetics will not be much to rave about for the S6 edge+ will retain the same design as the S6 edge, just a slight increase in its width and length (obviously being a 5.7-inch display). The processor is likely to be the same Exynos 7420 powerhouse but it gets 4GB of RAM just like the Note 5. The battery is expected to be similar with the Note 5, housing a 3,000mAh capacity unit thats embedded into its unibody form. The double edge display will also be updated with more features so you can use it for more than just contacting your 5 favourite contacts. For better productivity, Samsung is expected to introduce a Keyboard Cover accessory which turns the S6 edge+ into a full QWERTY typing machine. A recent leak indicates that the keyboard add-on would cost 60 Euros, or approximately RM263 when converted directly. For those juggling between 2 mobile plans, the new Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ are very likely to come with dual-SIM support as spotted recently on our SIRIM certification database. While theres no microSD expansion slots, there are those who are hoping that Samsung might allow you to pop-in a microSD card onto the 2nd SIM slot just like its current Galaxy A8.Though all this information has come out, weve yet to hear anything about the price range of the two devices. Based on past launch prices of these devices, well attempt to speculate the range of Samsungs newest additions:Looking at how Samsung priced their previous models and considering GST has kicked in, we reckon that the Galaxy Note 5 could be priced around RM 2,699, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ hovers above the RM 3,100 mark. Definitely they are not going to be cheap but it is still more affordable than the iPhone 6 Plus thats priced at RM3,126 for its base 16GB model. With 2 new flagship phones, we expect Samsung to slash prices of its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge by about RM200-300 and this is taking place worldwide. In terms of availability, the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+ could go on sale as early as end of this month. For Malaysia, we reckon both models could go on sale in early September. Leaks were abundant with the two devices but Samsung has also teased us with the unpacked teaser with a mysterious third device. Fresh on their Samsung Tab S2 launch, could this mean Samsung might add another tablet to its line-up? If you want to get up-to-date information on it dofollow us on our Twitter account as we will be reporting live from Samsung Unpacked 2015 at New York.

The Pebble Time Steel costs US$249.99 (about RM977) and it comes with a single leather strap. If you want the metal band, it is available as an additional option but it will cost you US$49.99 extra, bringing the total price to US$299.98 (about RM1,172). As comparison, the standard Pebble Time with a silicon strap is priced at US$199 (about RM777). The Pebble Time Steel isnt the same Pebble Time with a metal body attached on a fancier strap. While the Pebble Time still does 7 days of battery life with its colour e-paper display, the steel version has a slightly larger battery allowing up to 10 days of use on a single charge. The watch frame is crafted with a CNC-finished 316L stainless steel which is similar material used by the Apple Watch (Stainless Steel Case). For better durability of the screen, it also gets Gorilla Glass protection at the front.Like the original Pebble, the Pebble Time Steel is also water resistant with 5 ATM rating and over at the sides, theres a microphone for voice command. Despite having a bigger battery and more upmarket materials, the Pebble Time Steel is merely 1mm thicker than the standard Pebble Time. Another appeal of the Pebble is its compatibility with both iOS and Android. So if youre an iPhone user and dont fancy the Apple Watch, the Pebble Time Steel can be an alternative. If youre interested, you can place your orders on their online store and Pebble will ship it to Malaysia for free via standard mail. [ VIA ]"

Powering the device is a 2,070 mAh battery and it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with its ZenUI.The ZE500KL is similar with the ZE500KG but it is slightly better with support for 4G LTE and has a higher resolution 13MP f/2.0 main camera. Another difference is the battery where it is listed to come with either a 2,070mAh unit or a larger 2,400mAh option. Thesemodels would compete directly with the likes of the Redmi 2 that are priced under RM500.Moving up a notch is the 5.5 Zenfone 2 Laser which is likely to be the popular choice. The front display is a larger 5.5 sizewith a HD 720p resolution and accompanying it is a generous 3,000mAh capacity battery. Under the hood, it is the same story with a Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. It also comes with the same 13MP f/2.0 and 5MP f/2.0 camera combo, dual-SIMs with 4G LTE and a microSD slot supporting up to 128GB cards.For those wanting a bigger screen like the former Zenfone 6, theres also a 6 inch variant and it gets beefier specs with a Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor thats mated to 3GB of RAM. Unlike the previous models, the 6 ZE601KL gets a Full HD (19201080) display for greater clarity. Apart from these upgrades, the rest of the device is the same including its 3,000mAh capacity battery. This could be an affordable alternatives to the larger phablets in the market like the OPPO R7 Plus and Huawei Ascend Mate 7.The ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser series is an alternative to the current Intel-powered Zenfone 2 line up. Between the 2, the current Zenfone 2 seems to be the better optionwith more RAM, storage and it offers a higher Full HDresolution on its 5.5 models. In terms of performance, the Intel Z3580 processor has proven to be superior than Qualcomms Snapdragon 801 processors. Since the Zenfone brand is often associated being cheap and good, the price would be the main deciding factor. The obvious compromise is its lower HD 720p screen resolution especially on the 5.5 Zenfone 2 Laser model but ASUS tries to make up for it in the imaging department by fitting a Laser AF. For more info, you can check out the respective ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG, ZE500KL and ZE550KL pages.Which would you pick? The Intel based Zenfone 2 or the Qualcomm powered Zenfone 2 Laser?[ SOURCE ]"

Since the Galaxy S6 edge+ is merely a bigger screen version of its S6 edge, Samsung could be adding more productivity features that could even please the hardcore BlackBerry users. Serial leakster @evleaks has posted a picture of a Keyboard Cover accessory that gives the S6 edge+ a full QWERTY typing experience. This looks like a add-on Typo keyboard for the iPhone, that was short-lived due to lawsuits by BlackBerry.The keyboard covers up the bottom portion of the device and it offers the typical 3 Android buttons for Recent Apps, Home and Back. It does look interesting but the overall solution does look bulky considering this is a phablet category device. Furthermore with the attachment in place, we wonder if theres another fingerprint sensor on the add-on keyboard since the home button has been covered fully. If you love the tactile feel of a physical keyboard, this may be your cup of tea and it has been a long time since we saw a new Android device with a full keyboard. But we are not too sure about the size though and already we felt that the BlackBerry Passport is too huge for our liking. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Their next device is likely to be the Redmi Note 2, offering a big screen phablet at competitive pricing. The current Redmi Note is definitely due for a replacement and the new one appears to be promising.According to MyDrivers, the Redmi Note 2 was spotted on the Mi online store at 799 CNY (about RM504). Whats more interesting is that it carries 32GB of storage which pretty generous considering the last model only came with 8GB. As spotted on Chinas TEENA listing, the Redmi Note 2 still maintains a 5.5 display but this time it pushes a Full HD 1080p resolution. Powering the device is a 2.0GHz processor (possibly MediaTek MT6795) thats mated with 2GB of RAM. On the certification listing, it gets 16GB of storage, so it is likely that there are multiple storage options available. For taking pics, it gets a 13MP camera at the back, while the front gets a 5MP shooter which is similar to the current Mi 4i. Like the recent Mi smart phones, it will come with dual-SIM slots supporting 4G LTE.

Its purported retail packaging in shrink wrap has appeared online and it gives us some confirmation on what to expect with their next big thing.In terms of design, it is the same as the Galaxy S6/S6 edge with a plain looking box with Galaxy Note 5 written in its new Galaxy font. Interestingly the Note 5 is spelled with Note5 without a space in between. At the back, the specs follows what weve seen so far which includes a 64-bit Octa-Core processor, 4GB of RAM and a 5.7 Quad HD AMOLED display. The cameras are similar with a 16MP OIS main + 5MP front camera like the S6 and it also comes with Wireless Charging built-in as standard. Just to recap, the Galaxy Note 5 will continue their new premium approach of using metal and glass materials for its body. As seen previously, the back features a curve glass thats very much like the Mi Note. For the S-Pen stylus, it stows flushly into the metal frame and it appears to be ejectable with a slight push. For Malaysia, we could be getting a Dual-SIM variant as spotted recently on our Malaysian SIRIM database.If youre seeking for a different type of display, the Note 5 will be announced together with the S6 edge+, which is basically a phablet version of the current S6 edge.

Blass goes on to state that Huawei will go on to launch this device during IFA 2015, on the 2nd of September.Based on the design language and timing of the launch, this could very well mean that their latest device will take over the current 6-inch Mate 7 phablet but conflicting reports say otherwise. Media correspondents from China are claiming this could be Huaweis stab at a smaller screened device. Slated to include a 4.7-inch screen that pushes 1920 x 1080 pixels, the device will run a Kirin Octa-core processor and have a Mali-T624 graphics on-board  based on information from AnTuTus benchmark site.If the aforementioned specs leave you quite disappointed, youll be happy to hear the opposing rumours of the latest device. Considering that the Mate 7 utilised the latest and greatest processor at its time of release, if it were to be the Mate 8 that arrives, itll potentially feature a yet to be seen Kirin 950 processor. The processor in question will be capable of clock speeds that max out at 2.4GHz, which is promising. This means it coulddefinitely give the Snapdragon 810 and the Exynos 7420 a run for its money.All of this numbers are only in theory, nothing has be shown in practice yet but the 64-bit processor will support 4K video, USB 3.0 transfers, LPDDR4 RAM , and a i7 co-processor for sensor hub and security processing. Audio-enthusiasts will also be awed at the processors dedicated DSP audio co-processor (TensilicaHi-Fi 4 DSP).However, dont jump the gun yet, as they are only rumours and leaks. As IFA draws closer, surely more information will come to light and well have to see whether itll be a Mate 7 Mini or the beastly Mate 8.[ IMAGE SOURCE,SOURCE,2,3]"

The Galaxy Note 5 (SM-N9208) was mysteriously removed from SIRIMs listing a few days after its discovery.Just to recap on the purported specs, the Galaxy S6 edge+ comes with a double curve screen which scales up to 5.7 inches like the Galaxy Note 5. Internally it is pretty much the same as the current S6 edge except for 4GB of RAM and a larger 3,000mAh capacity. Like the current S6 edge, theres no removable battery but some are speculating that the dual-SIM slot might offer a hybrid microSD/2nd SIM card option. From the earlier leaked photos, the IR Blaster is missing from the top but this could be an early prototype which could turn out differently in the final product. While the S6 edge+ lacks the productivity S-Pen from the Note series, an interesting keyboard accessory was spotted which could give the device a full QWERTY typing experience.It appears that Dual-SIMs are becoming mainstream even on the high-end models. What used to be a staple of most entry-level devices, a significant number of new flagship models released this year were dual-SIM ready including the Huawei P8, Sony Xperia Z3+, Xiaomi Mi Note and HTC One E9+.

Above it are obviously the Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Galaxy Note 5. Since Samsung has just launched its Galaxy Tab S2, it is weird for them to announce another high-end tablet. It could be another new Note Tablet like the Note 8.0 and Note 10.1, but it is unlikely since there isnt any indication of an S-Pen in the teaser.There are speculations that Samsung might introduce a Tab edge tablet featuring a curved display, just because they can. With declining tablet sales, is there really a need for yet another Galaxy tablet? If theres one more product that Samsung should announce, it would be a new smart watch since the Gear 2 and Gear Fit wearables are about a year and a half year old, while the Gear S is almost a year old. The Samsung Gear A is to be their first round smart watch and it is expected to come with a unique rotating bezel ring.All shall be revealed next week.

Alexander Wong,Spigen starts offering Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ cases ahead of launch,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/06/spigen-starts-selling-galaxy-note-5-and-s6-edge-plus-cases/,"Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Case,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus casing,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,Spigen,Spigen Case","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-06,"The Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ is probably one of the most leaked Samsung flagship weve seen in recent times. With about a week left to its Samsung Unpacked event, case maker Spigen has started offering a wide range of protective covers for the Galaxy Note 5 and the Galaxy S6 edge+. This yet again confirms what weve seen in the last few weeks and it doesnt stray away from the Galaxy S6/S6 edge design language. If youre definitely putting your money on one of these new flagships, you can now order your case from Spigen with shipping expected to start from 1st September for selected models. Just to recap, both phablet models are expected to run on the same benchmark topping Exynos 7420 processor with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM with the Note 5 retaining a 5.7 Quad HD display. Following the S6, both the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ are almost certain to come without any expandable microSD slot and the unibody design also means that the battery is also non-removable. The cameras from the S6 are likely to be retained, which includes a 16MP camera with Optical Image Stabilisation, while the front keeps its 5MP selfie shooter that supports wide selfie. There wont be any Note Edge this time around. If youre looking for a device with a unique screen to show off, youll have the S6 edge+ which is basically the phablet version of the curent S6 edge. With a larger screen, both Note 5 and S6 edge+ would pack large battery capacities but word has it that it would be just 3,000mAh, thats smaller compared to its previous Note series.If youre interested to get a case, you can check out Spigens Note 5 and S6 edge+ product rage.

If endurance is what you seek, they have just announced the ASUS Zenfone Max, a new mid-ranger that comes with a huge 5,000mAh capacity battery.
Like the mainstream Zenfone 2 models, it has a 5.5 IPS display that pushes a modest HD 720p resolution and it runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor mated to 2GB of RAM. For storage it gets 16GB of storage which is expandable via microSD.For taking pictures it gets a similar kit as the ZenFone Laser with a 13MP f/2.0 main camera with dual-tone LED lens and it is further assisted with Laser AutoFocus. The front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter for selfie duties. It also supports 4G LTE with dual-SIMs and out of the box it runs on Android 5.0 with the latest ZenUI 2.0. In terms of availability, the Zenfone Max will go on sale in October but they have yet to give any price indications at the moment. With a battery capacity this large, you probably could go more than 2 days on a single charge. Overall this is better speced and it looks better than ZTE Q519T. If you value long battery life above having top end specs, the Zenfone Max is definitely worth considering.  [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

While it shares the same internals as the Xperia C4, the C5 Ultra gets a larger 6.0 Full HD display and a higher resolution 13MP camera upfront for better selfies.Its pricing wasnt revealed during its announcement but now it has appeared on Sonys Hong Kong store with the retail price tag of HK$3,298. This comes out to about RM1,653 with our current exchange rate. All 3 colours are being offered with stocks to be available beginning on 14th August.The Xperia prices in Hong Kong are considerably higher than Malaysia. For example the Xperia Z3+ Dual which is priced RM2,599 here is sold at HK$5698 (about RM2,856) in Hong Kong. If the Xperia C5 Ultra gets here, we reckon it could hover around the RM1,500-RM1,600 range. The closest competitor that offers 13MP cameras for both front and back would be the Desire EYE which is priced at RM1,699. As comparison, the Desire EYE is a smaller 5.2 incher but it gets water resistance rated at IPX7 and the front also comes with a dual-tone LED flash.

Essentially this is the same Passport as before with a squarish 4.5 screen that does 14401440 pixels resolution along with a 3-row keyboard that doubles up as a trackpad. The internals remained unchanged with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The difference is on the exterior where it gets a Porsche Design-like appearance without the crazy price tag. It is supposed to be a premium upgrade over the current Passport with a stainless steel frame with rounded corners. The back gets a textured pattern for better grip and the camera lens now has a ring element that protects it from scratches. The keyboard also gets some subtle improvements for better typing while on the go. And you get all of these for an extra US$50 over the standard BlackBerry Passport. The optics are the same as well with a 13MP f/2.0 main camera with Optical Image Stabilisation, while the front gets a 2MP fixed focus camera. Powering the device is a 3450mAh non-removable battery that is rated to last 30 hours of average use. When compared with the earlier Passport, the Silver Edition is taller and wider but it is slightly thinner at 9.25mm (Passport: 9.30mm).

This comes after Microsoft successfully launched the mature version of Windows 10, albeit some raised eyebrows on their stance of user privacy.The model numbers of the 950 line were still vague in the past  purported to continue with the 940 after the current-gen 930 flagship but this articlesaysMicrosoft might skip one number ahead. Codenamed the Cityman, the device has been rumoured to be phablet sized, a 6-inch screen running at 2K (Quad HD) resolution to be precise. It will allegedly run a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor and be paired with 3GB of RAM for speedy performance. Internal storage is said to be 32GB but those who need more can opt for the microSD expansion.The shutters will be a 20-megapixel Pureview (back) and 5-megapixel (front), the former equip with a three LED flash. Powering the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL is a 3,300 mAh removable battery and USB Type-C will be the port of choice.We hope Windows 10 Mobile will tone down the privacy intrusions or at least be more forward about it and allow users to change the settings easily. In the past, the device has been said to be revealed at a grand announcement sometime in October, and be out on the shelves in November.[ SOURCE, VIA]"
Alexander Wong,Here are more hands-on photos of the Galaxy Note 5,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/05/here-are-more-hands-on-photos-of-the-galaxy-note-5/,"Android,Dual Sim,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy note 5 Photos,Samsung Unpacked,Samsung Unpacked 2015,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-05,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 continues to pose for the camera ahead of its official launch next week. For those who are clueless about how the next flagship phablet would look like, the folks at Droid-Life has gotten a fresh batch of hands-on pictures for your viewing pleasure.Nothing has changed from what weve seen earlier as it gets a metal frame with glass on both sides just like the Galaxy S6. At the back, it gets a sloping curve on both edges which is similar to the Xiaomi Mi Notes 3G Glass for its back. As expected from Samsung, the new Galaxy Note 5 lacks a microSD slot and a removable battery, just like most flagships today. For the Malaysian market, we are expected to receive a dual-SIM version which is good news for those with multiple telco subscriptions. Looking at the bottom, the S-Pen sits flush with the metal frame, which leads us to believe that it will offer a push to eject mechanism. It is worth pointing out that the S-Pen is now placed on the right, instead on the left side like its previous generations. From the screen above, Samsung has updated the new TouchWiz interface for the S-Pen and it looks like you could customise the shortcuts that appears when the S-Pen is taken out from its slot. Looking at the top. the infrared blaster appears to have been omitted and this could be bad news for those relying on their phones as a universal remote. The bottom of the Note 5 is the same the Galaxy S6 with a headphone jack and a drilled speaker grill. Theres no fancy USB Type C connector as it retains the usual microUSB 2.0 port with adaptive fast charging supported. We also expect the Galaxy Note 5 to support wireless charging natively without extra cases, just like the S6. To recap on the specs, the Galaxy Note 5 is predicted to carry the same Exynos 7420 Octa-Core processor as the Galaxy S6, but it gets 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM along with storage options starting from 32GB. The camera is likely to carry the same 16MP + 5MP camera combo and keeping the lights on is said to be a 3,000mAh capacity unit, which is even smaller than the Galaxy Note II (3,100mAh). The Galaxy Note 4 was launched in Malaysia at RM2,499 and judging from the Galaxy S6 RM2,599 retail price, do expect to fork out more for a Note 5 this year. Hopefully it isnt as insane as the iPhone 6 Plus that starts from RM3,126 for a mere 16GB of storage. Live photos of the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ appear
