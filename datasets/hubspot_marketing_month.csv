It can be short-term, like  , or we're embarking on a new project but have no idea where to start. Other times, it's a little more long-term, like when we feel like we're  , or  Where should you go from there? In times like these, we all have our own coping mechanisms. But if what you need is some words of wisdom and a little motivation, check out the 10 TED talks below. We've curated some of the best TED talks for when you're feeling down and out, stuck, unmotivated, or generally in need of a confidence boost. Check 'em out, and bookmark them for when you need a little encouragement. They could be just what you needed. Before she authored the book  Elizabeth Gilbert was an ""unpublished young diner waitress,"" devastated by rejection letters. And even after she published the book and it became a huge success, she found herself identifying strongly with her former self -- and feeling the urge to quit the fame game and move to the country to raise corgis. In this TED talk, Gilbert reflects on the strange and unlikely psychological connection between how we experience great failure and how we experience great success. She then offers simple (though hard) advice for making sure Carol Dweck starts her talk off with a short but powerful story about a high school in Chicago where students didn't receive failing grades. Instead, they received the grade ""Not Yet."" The grade implies that not passing the course doesn't mean you're going nowhere, but rather you're on a learning curve. Dweck uses this story to frame the rest of her TED talk, where she talks about her research on ""growth mindset"" -- the idea that we can actually grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. She talks about two different ways to approach a problem that's just a little too hard for you to solve: Are you not smart enough to solve it ... or have you just not solved it yet? I'm a long-time fan of Isabel Allende, author of (among other wonderful books)  She's 71 years old, but says she's still 17. Hey, why let society decide when you're old? In her TED talk, she talks about how we all experience age differently. She talks about her fears as she gets older, and shares how she plans to keep living passionately. Through aging, she says she's gained freedom -- mainly, the freedom from having to prove things to people anymore. ""My body may be falling apart, but my brain is not, yet,"" she says. ""I love my brain. I feel lighter. I don't carry grudges, ambition, vanity, none of the deadly sins that are not even worth the trouble. It's great to let go. And I should have started sooner. "" When have you, or others in your life, opted out of being creative? Many organizations divided people into categories: Either you're a ""creative,"" or you're not. But designer and educator David Kelley suggests that creativity is not limited to a chosen few. In this TED talk, Kelley tells really interesting, touching stories from his legendary design career and his own life, and offers ways to build the confidence to create. He believes that when people gain this confidence, they start working on the things that are really important in their lives -- and come up with more interesting ideas. Boniface Mwangi is a photographer whose job was to document the horrific violence in his home country of Kenya -- and watched as his government kept it silent. Finally, he made a plan to protest against the corruption: During a large public meeting where the Kenyan president was speaking, he and a few friends would stand up and heckle the president to get his attention. He says what he decided to do in that moment showed him who he truly was. As he says, ""There are two most powerful days in your life. The day you are born, and the day you discover why."" visceral, body-hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of 20 folk-music fans at an open mic night. Kowan used to just write songs, but at some point, that wasn't enough anymore. He had all these stories and ideas he wanted to share with people, but his stage fright was keeping him from doing it. The week of his 30th birthday, he decided to put that fear behind him, a process he describes in this talk. Body language can have profound effects on how others see us. We make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language, and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes -- like whom we hire or promote, whom we ask out on a date, and so on. But, even more importantly, body language can affect how we see  Social Psychologist Amy Cuddy's research on body language proves that we can actually change other people's perceptions of us (and even our own body chemistry) simply by changing body positions. In this TED talk, Cuddy specifically talks about how ""power posing"" -- i.e., standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can affect testosterone and cortisone levels in the brain. If we do it for even two minutes at a time, it can have profound positive impacts on how we feel and whether we succeed. Where does creativity come from? Are some people born with it? Is creativity a function of some other neurological quirk, like psychosis or depression? Are some people equipped with certain skills that enable creativity, like artistic ability? Or is creativity developed mostly through experience? You may know Amy Tan as the author of  or one of her other well known books. In this TED talk, she dives into her own creative process and stories of her life that could lend a clue to where it comes from. She reminds us that, in our moments of doubt, even if there is an answer, there is uncertainty in everything -- and that's a good thing. In fact, that space where the uncertainty is can be the birthplace of creativity: She finds that by filling those holes with her own imagining, she can find particles of truth and discover new possibilities she'd never considered before. In this TED talk, Colantuono shares a simple and surprising piece of advice. The talk's aimed primarily at women, but there are universal takeaways in here for men, too, as well as for new graduates and mid-career workers.",Lindsay Kolowich
2016-04-20,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/interview-questions-ask-hiring-managers,14 Questions Job Candidates Should Ask to Impress Interviewers,"""Do you have any questions for me?"" We've all been on the receiving end of that question in an interview. If you're prepared, you've probably got some good questions you usually cycle through. But we want to be better than ""good"" in an interview. We want to be standout candidates that hiring managers are excited to extend an offer to. ""I'm always surprised at the lack of good questions candidates have, and I always respect the candidates that ask insightful questions during interviews,"" says  , VP of Learning and Development at HubSpot. To help you prepare to stand out at your next interview, here are some questions that'll make hiring managers' ears perk up. Try them at your next interview and see how the conversation changes. It's not terribly difficult to find a candidate that can execute on a role. It   terribly difficult to find a candidate that can not only execute on their role, but also understand how it fits into larger goals. This includes being able to self-manage, prioritize high-value activities, and grow their role in a direction that aligns with the company's growth.  This information can be hard to come by if your company isn't very communicative or transparent, so this is a good chance to get that information while the gettin's good, and use it to guide your decisions if you land the role. This question shows that you're the type of person who likes to hit the ground running, instead of spending a week filling out HR forms. It also shows that you recognize patterns of success and want to replicate only the most effective performers. Every company has its weird nuances, its own environment, and its own unspoken expectations. This helps you start with a little bit of the insider info so you don't suffer a case of ""if I knew then what I knew now"" in six months. Asking a question like this shows that you're goal-oriented and aren't afraid to be held accountable for those goals. You don't shirk accountability. You welcome it -- and will work hard to hit the goals you're responsible for. It's shocking how many people don't actually know what they want from their employees beyond a vague idea of some work that needs to get done. Asking this question will force a hiring manager to figure it out -- and then can communicate it to you, so you can execute on it. A question like this indicates that you're already envisioning yourself in the role and thinking through a plan of attack, should you land the gig. It's also a sign that you're well aware that no job comes free of roadblocks. It shows that not only are you not afraid to deal with those challenges, but you're also prepared for them. bureaucratic processes, internal politics, and so on. You can use that information to decide that the role really isn't a good fit for you ... or that you're up for the challenge. While the interviewer might be trying to paint a pretty perfect picture of what working on the team might look like, asking this question will help you uncover some of the realities the team has been facing recently.  It really helps to know what challenges you could find yourself or your team up against ahead of time. In some cases, it could affect whether you accept the role. Not only that, but learning about these challenges could give you some great insights into the steps the team has taken to overcome these challenges already. This question gives an interviewer a chance to do two self-serving things: talk about themselves and perform a no-holds-barred sales pitch on the company. For promising candidates, the sales opportunity is welcomed. And most people love any excuse to talk about themselves. ;) This gives you insight into what motivates your future colleague or manager, as well as insight into what the company offers its employees. If those all line up with what you're looking for in a job, you've got yourself a good fit. If your interviewer has been at the company for several years, understanding why could give you some really interesting insight into the company, how it treats its employees, and a taste of what motivates the people who work there. Plus, it shows you've done your research on the interviewer, which is always an impressive sign. Depending on the interviewer's answer, you might learn something about the company's career training, leadership opportunities, workplace flexibility, internal job opportunities, and more. You might dig a little deeper by following up with related questions, like, ""What do you enjoy most about working here?"" Do they take the time to go out? Do people bring lunch but eat in groups? Do folks normally eat at their desks because they're too busy to socialize? Asking this question serves as a great way to find out a little bit about the company culture. Plus, this is a more lighthearted question that might relax a stiffened atmosphere or lead to a conversation about shared interests. Along with learning about company culture, it doesn't hurt to get a few good lunch suggestions for the future. This is an impressive question because it shows that you can make the connection between how the company thinks about its customers and the end result. In other words, how the customer is treated on a day-to-day basis, and in turn, how that shows up in the product.  While you might be able to find a canned response to this question on the company's website, it'll be useful -- and possibly eye-opening -- for you to hear it more candidly from an employee. How the company treats its customers could end up informing your decision to join if you are offered the job, especially if you're applying for a job where you'll be communicating directly with customers. Ever work with people that just   That's who hiring managers are looking for. This question demonstrates that you understand a job is about more than just going through the motions. Successful people have a specific frame of mind, approach, attitude, work ethic, communication style, and so on -- and you want to know what that mix looks like at this company. Because these characteristics are often hard to pin down, this question forces a hiring manager to articulate that ""it factor"" they're really looking for -- even if it wasn't written in the job description. Asking a question like this shows you're interested in getting a practical example of what success looks like to the manager of the team you'd be joining. Plus, when you phrase the question in this way, ""you leave no room for a hypothetical answer,"" says  , a recruiting team lead here at HubSpot. Instead, you're pushing the hiring manager to think about their top performer. Because this question forces an example, the answer to this question will give you a strong idea of what success actually looks like. That way, you'll learn what it takes to impress your colleagues and be a star candidate. Follow question #9 with this question, and you'll show the hiring manager that you're really trying to get a concrete idea of what to do and what not to do as an employee on the specific team you're applying to join, says Fernandez. And while this question can make a manager uncomfortable, it's impressive because it shows that the candidate is not afraid to ask tough questions. First, you'll get an idea of what poor performance looks like, which will help you set expectations for the position. Second, you'll learn how the hiring manager handles a tough question like this -- which can teach you something about how office politics are handled in general. If you would be working with the person interviewing you, this is another tough question that can give you some insight into how the team works. It pushes the hiring manager to think about how he or she would handle an uneasy situation, while at the same time showing your level of maturity in that that you (realistically) expect to receive tough feedback sometimes. Just like different people take negative feedback differently, different people give negative feedback differently. Does this person tailor their feedback approach depending on whom they're giving feedback to? Do they make feedback a two-way street? Their feedback style -- especially when it comes to negative feedback -- will help you understand how well you would be able to work with them. This question shows that you're not afraid of critical feedback -- in fact, you welcome it. Interviewers tend to make note of red flags -- whether it be something on your resume or something you said -- to discuss with a colleague following the interview. This question gives them the green light to ask about any of the things that are holding them back from being 100% on board with hiring you. You get a chance to address concerns face-to-face without being too confrontational. This could be the difference between an offer and a rejection -- or maybe even a higher opening offer.",Lindsay Kolowich

Mistakes are the best way to learn, right?  When we make a mistake once, we usually don’t make it again. And the less time we have to spend correcting our mistakes, the more time we have to actually get things done.  I've outlined a list of eight common mistakes that professional content writers sometimes make below. The idea is that once you learn about these mistakes, you’ll be less likely to commit them yourself. Let's walk through them ... Some people tend to think that writer’s block is an unbreakable force -- nothing can be written until the block is broken. The truth is, you   break writer’s block. Some people  , but there are other  , too.  Next time you experience writer’s block, try shifting your mindset. Don’t think, “Oh no! I can’t write.” Instead, think, “Okay, I’ve got this.

You need time to edit your writing when it’s   In other words, let some time pass before you go back and work on that article again.

For advice on how to approach a piece of content, check out   from HubSpot's Ginny Soskey. After you edit, you need to proofread, too. Editing is making those big changes to the content itself. Proofreading is making the tiny changes to the grammar and spelling. I’ve made a habit of never releasing a word of content until it’s been edited or proofread at least four times. Proofread, and proofread again. You’ll be glad you did. You may be the world’s most brilliant writer and master of your subject, but you should do a little bit of research on your subject matter. People aren’t as impressed by your opinion as they are by a breadth of studies, data, evidence, and other information that  Get ready for hard work, though. Here’s how   process: Research can be fun.

Huh? What does “not defining your pronouns” mean? Allow me to explain ... The following words are  : There are a lot of pronouns in the English language. Pronouns are helpful, useful, important parts of speech. What is the problem? Not defining them: You should define all pronouns either within the context of your writing or within the sentence. Undefined pronouns lead to unclear writing. There’s no   writing speed. Each writer should write at the pace that suits them and allows their creativity to flow. However, be aware that your speed of writing influences your   of writing. When reading  the mind goes over information faster than while writing  Keep this in mind when you write. Your mind easily processes long sentences or big words when you’re writing them. But to the reader --   -- your writing is dull, ponderous, slow, and agonizing. If you write fast, your brain is moving at a closer equivalent to the normal reading speed. Of course, you should still pay attention to your words, sentences, and structure. But at the same time, you’ll be able to get down those thoughts in a more fluid and natural way. Here’s how the  reported on one writing speed researcher: A 2016 study from the University of Waterloo  , “the quality of your writing will likely get better if you simply type slower.” Does this mean that you should try to move your fingers slowly, type with one hand, or just trudge along at a lazy pace? Not necessarily. Each person has their own   And different types of content demand a slower or faster pace. You move at the pace that’s best for  In some situations, the ideas and words are coming at an incredibly fast rate. You have to type as fast as you can. In other cases, you might be doing careful research, searching for the precise word, or writing about a sensitive subject. Slowing down is a good idea. If you want to become a better writer, become a better student of your reader. It’s actually pretty simple. Great writing is connecting with readers in a meaningful way. You won’t be able to perform that task unless you  I challenge all writers, before putting a single word on a page, to do as much research and gain as much understanding of their potential readers as possible. The process is as simple as going through the exercise of   and reminding yourself of that person every time you write. ( .) Outlining might bring back memories of high school English class. Don’t worry. That’s not what I’m talking about here.  The process of outlining is simply creating a structure for your article. I do a lot of writing, and one of the things that helps me write with  First, I jot down a quick introduction and conclusion. This helps me to lead up to my subject matter, and then sum it up. Doing so also makes me fill the empty space between with something relevant and meaningful. Generally, my outline simply looks like a few bullet points. My goal is to write down the main things I want to talk about. Usually, they aren’t even complete sentences. (No big deal. I’m not writing my article at this point. I’m just outlining it.) The whole process takes me ten minutes or so, but it saves me hours of time. Plus, it gives my article more clarity. Writing better is about blowing apart old habits and horrible mistakes. Even though I’ve been writing almost every day for ten years, I still make mistakes. Hopefully, my mistakes are becoming fewer and fewer, but I still catch myself making them sometimes. At the same time, however, I feel like I’m improving.

2016-04-19,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/basics-of-website-security-for-ecommerce,Safety First: The Basics of Website Security for Ecommerce Retailers,"If a retailer has an insecure website, then, all other marketing and inbound efforts simply won't bring results. Here, we run through some basic security practices that all ecommerce retailers should employ to make sure that their website is a secure, successful online destination. The PCI Security Standards Council is a global group — whose founding members include American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard and Visa Inc. — formed to develop, enhance and maintain security standards for payment account security. Together, the members of this group came up with a set of security requirements, known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) that all merchants or organizations that process, store, or transmit credit card information must adhere to. There is good reason for this: these guidelines ensure that all stored credit card data is protected and that sensitive information is secure throughout the transaction process. Many companies meet these guidelines through the use of tokenization: Staying PCI Compliant and ensuring that all stored credit card data is fully tokenized in this way greatly reduces the risk of this sensitive information being stolen and used. Keeping this data secure is extremely important for all online retailers: if cardholder data is stolen, their credit can be negatively affected and they could lose credibility, money, and even their business. The SSL Certificate — also mandatory per PCI — also works to ensure that the sensitive information that is sent over the internet is encrypted and secure. When retailers or site visitors send information or data over the internet, it gets passed through multiple computers before reaching its destination server. At any point during this chain, it could get stolen if it is not encrypted with an SSL Certificate. How does the certificate work? It essentially makes all sensitive information —which includes passwords, credit card information, and usernames — unreadable for everyone except the destination server, thereby protecting all communication from eavesdropping and theft. It is particularly valuable for ecommerce retailers not just for security reasons, but also to build trust with site visitors and prospective customers: attaining an SSL certificate essentially verifies an entity’s credentials, certifying that they are who they say they are and that their site is safe to visit. Make sure to watch for changes in requirements - such as the recent change from SHA1 encryption to SHA2 encryption - to make sure your company stays compliant. Hypertext Transfer Protocol with Secure Sockets Layer, or HTTPS, is a protocol to transfer data over the web that should be used instead of HTTP on all pages where data is created. Once again, the issue here is all about encryption. With HTTP, information is not encrypted — instead, it is sent as plain text, which means that anyone can intercept it and read what has been sent. Further, many customers know about this insecurity and tend to avoid ecommerce websites that use HTTP. This means that keeping HTTP could hurt a retailer's security and their business over time.   It’s important to note, though, that HTTPS isn’t necessary on every page of a website. Why? If retailers try to include it everywhere, it will slow their page load speed and likely hurt their business. Instead, HTTPS should just be used on pages that collect and store data so that site visitors customers can feel secure sending their information. That means skip the homepage, about us page, etc.  DoS and DDOS protection work to guard against denial of service and distributed denial of service attacks. Denial of Service and Distributed denial of service: During both denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, attackers attempt to block legitimate users from accessing information or services by flooding a network with requests, thereby overwhelming the bandwidth of the targeted system and preventing legitimate requests from coming through. While both attacks work in the same way, the key difference is that a DoS attacker usually uses a single computer and internet connection, while a DDoS attacker uses multiple connected devices, making the flood of information that much larger harder to deflect. There are many ways to protect from DoS and DDoS attacks. The easiest and most expensive way is to buy more bandwidth. Think about it: during these attacks, they’re trying to flood your space, so if you have a ton of space it will be more difficult for attackers to overwhelm you. However, this is a largely impractical solution -especially for DDoS attacks - since in today’s day and age the attacks are just too large to overcome. However, there are more inexpensive and effective other ways to mitigate attacks. Setting up effective, well-configured firewalls, for example, can prevent this attack traffic from reaching your computer. As the name suggests, a firewall is a hardware or software system that essentially works as a wall or gateway between two or more networks, permitting authorized traffic and blocking unauthorized or potentially malicious traffic from accessing a network or system. Like an actual wall. It essentially protects what is inside a network from the outside — a.k.a from other networks or from threats on the internet like backdoor and DDoS attacks. Since ecommerce websites have a lot of inbound traffic, they need firewalls to protect themselves against malicious entry. There are many different kinds of firewalls, but two very effective firewalls for online retailers are application gateways and proxy firewalls. Both function as intermediary programs between two or more networks, meaning that incoming traffic has no direct connection or access to a retailer's network. With an application gateway in place, there are two lines of communication: one between your computer and the proxy, then one between the proxy and the destination computer or network. It’s essentially a checkpoint that all network information has to stop at. By serving as this middle point, the application gateways help hide and protect your network from others’, only letting in traffic -or packets -that have been authorized. Proxy firewalls are among the most secure. Why? Like the application gateway, the proxy serves as an intermediary connection. However, they take it one step further -instead of your network connection going all the way through, a new network connection is started at the proxy firewall. This means that there is no direct connection between systems at all, which makes it even harder for attackers to discover your network and get in. It is important to note that, for a firewall to be effective, it has to be properly configured. What does this mean? Well, firewalls don’t automatically know which traffic is malicious — they need to be programmed with this information. Make sure, then, that whoever sets up the firewall is properly configuring it so that all of the right information gets through. By staying on top of all these security measures, online retailers can effectively build their customers' trust and their own company's reputability, taking the first steps to ensuring that they have a successful, long-lasting online presence.",Caroline Ruhland
2016-04-19,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/top-ways-to-use-user-generated-content-ecommerce,The Top 3 Ways to Use User-Generated Content in Ecommerce,"Social proof is essential to any marketing strategy. User-generated content (UGC) in the form of customer reviews and pictures addresses the ecommerce pain point of uncertainty that affects shoppers and store owners alike, while providing social proof.  Shoppers sometimes hesitate to buy online because it can be difficult to gauge information about the fit and quality of items without seeing them in person. Conversely, ecommerce store owners are challenged to build trust with site visitors and communicate the sense and feeling of tangible products through the barrier of a digital screen. Customer opinions and experiences give shoppers the information they want and the confidence they need to convert into buyers, while providing online brands with a gateway to build relationships with their audience. This is where UGC comes in. Here are three of the top ways that you can leverage UGC to grow your business:  Customer reviews and pictures build a shopper’s confidence in a brand by providing relatable information and authentic answers to questions that may otherwise keep someone from buying. Including user-generated content throughout ecommerce stores—such as on the homepage, checkout page and product pages—makes the online shopping experience more dynamic by addressing specific pain points with genuine customer experiences. Enabling a conversation between interested shoppers and past buyers builds a community around a brand, providing social proof for the products and for the brand as a whole. Such communities break down barriers between individual online shoppers, which in turn creates an emotional connection with the brand and leads to conversions.  is an effective way to engage with your audience and increase retention by making them feel appreciated and valued. User-generated content is a powerful tool for building social proof and one of the most effective ways to build trust on social media. Social ads are a way to broaden your reach and influence shoppers while they are not actively shopping. To people scrolling through social media, a often times a brand-sponsored ad sticks out like a sore thumb and is easily ignored.  by providing immediately visible social proof by including authentic customer reviews and photos in social ads allows you establish a relatable brand image and brings more shoppers to your site. Yotpo data shows   by 300% and leads to a 50% drop in both cost-per-click and cost-per-acquisition. Customer reviews differentiate your company and products from all of the other search results that come up. They not only attract shoppers’ attention,   and in turn to more reviews. Using UGC in your paid and organic search engine marketing activities such as product listing ads and rich snippets enhances your search listing and makes it more enticing for shoppers to click through. When shoppers see customer reviews in the research phase of the buyer journey, it gives your product an edge over other search results and encourages them to go to your site. Happy customers are one of your most valuable marketing resources. Encourage them to provide user-generated content, which you can repurpose throughout the buyer journey, by making them feel valued, engaged and appreciated.",Joanna Alter
2016-04-20,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-editing-software,7 of the Best Pieces of Free Video Editing Software,"Not sure if video marketing is worth your time? Here's an eye-opening statistic for you:  , businesses that use video grow revenue 49% faster year-over-year than businesses that don't. Still not convinced?  . Of course, even if you are completely sold on the idea of incorporating video into your business's marketing program, there's still the issue of actually   the videos. And in order to do that, you're going to need some video editing software. If you have a PC that's running Microsoft Windows, or an iMac/Macbook, there's a good chance you already have video editing software installed on your computer. For Windows, that's  , and for Macs, it's  . However, depending on your particular skill set and/or what it is you're trying to accomplish with your videos, you may find that the above options are either too complicated or not packed with enough features. The good news: There are several free video editing solutions you can download that run the gamut from super simple to Hollywood-level powerful. At the simple end of the spectrum is Machete Video Editor Lite, which allows you to cut, copy, and paste different sections of video.  , Video Editor Lite was ""designed for quick and simple 'slicing' of your video files."" The program's intuitive interface means you won't have to waste time shuffling through technical support documents. And because Video Editor Lite doesn't re-encode your video files when you slice them, you don't have to worry about losing video quality. The main downsides to the program? It only supports the AVI and WMV video formats, and it doesn't allow for audio editing. Still, if you have zero video editing experience and only need to make simple edits, it's a great option. Like Machete Video Editor Lite,   allows you to do basic video editing (no audio editing) without having to worry about loss of video quality. But Avidemux also has a few more tricks up its sleeve. For starters, the program supports multiple video formats, including AVI, DVD, MPEG, QuickTime, and MP4. What's more, Avidemux comes with several filters that allow you to perform a host of different functions, from flipping and rotating clips, to adding subtitles, to adjusting colors and brightness levels. And while the learning curve for Avidemux is slightly steeper compared to Machete Video Editor Lite, the upside is that   that covers everything you need to know.

And one of the programs leading the charge is  . Compared to the first two programs on this list, WeVideo definitely offers some more advanced features and functionality, including audio editing capabilities and a library of commercially licensed music. However, the free version of WeVideo isn't without its limitations. One major downside is that you're only given 5GB of cloud storage. If you're making a one-off video, this is fine. But if you're planning to edit multiple videos you'll definitely need more space. The free version also puts a WeVideo watermark on your videos, which isn't ideal.

In addition to supporting nearly every major video format, the program offers advanced video effects, including object transformation and color correction, as well as advanced audio effects like volume correction and sound normalization. And unlike WeVideo, the VSDC Free Video Editor is truly free. You can use the program's full feature set without having to deal with pesky watermarks. But unfortunately, there is one catch. If you want technical support, you need to pay. (And because there is a bit of a learning curve, there's a good chance you'll need to.)   (formerly Wondershare Video Editor) is the perfect option if you want to start out with basic video editing functionality while also having the opportunity to get more advanced as you go. The program's ""Easy Mode"" strips away the complexity so you can drag and drop video clips, choose a pre-designed theme, add some music, and produce a finished video in a matter of minutes. Go into ""Full Feature Mode,"" however, and you'll be able to do much, much more -- from adding transitions, filters, and overlays, to playing video clips in reverse, to using split-screen effects.

2016-04-21,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/7-tips-more-personal-transactional-emails,7 Tips for Making Your Transactional Emails More Personal,"As consumers, we receive transactional emails constantly, and frequently read and interact with them, so why are they ignored by so many inbound marketers? While promotional emails seem to drive the most traffic and results, odds are you are missing out on a great opportunity to improve your transactional emails by making them more personal. Most marketing emails are either promotional or transactional. Promotional emails are usually tied to specific campaign goals and are custom built for targeted delivery to promote a specific product or service from your company. For a B2B company, a promotional email could share a new ebook you've written or service you're offering. For B2C ecommerce companies, a promotional email could be announcing a sale or new product line. Transactional emails are received automatically after certain events through your site. Emails like order confirmations, shipping notifications, password recovery, and event reminders are all examples of transactional emails. We all receive plenty of these types of email, and it's easy to overlook how integral they are to a great user experience and how making them more personal can go a long way towards retaining current customers and gaining new ones. While you may be tempted to focus all your energy on your promotional emails, the fact is that transactional emails are always going to get opened more. From  :  When you order something from Amazon, you might open your confirmation email a dozen times while it's being shipped to check on its progress. Just think about the opportunity that level of open rates and interaction gives you to provide personalized value to the reader. While promotional emails are great to jumpstart interest in something new from your company, because people are expecting transactional emails after they sign up/order/request something, they are much more likely to open them, giving you a great chance to optimize and improve that experience.  That means it includes the recipient's name. It'll help your email actually get delivered, and who doesn't like seeing their name? If you're sending an eCommerce email, it's easy to get the name dropped in from the order. If you're sending a B2B automated email, make sure your submission form is capturing the full name and adding it to the email.  If you're sending an ecommerce email, make sure the sender name is your brand, and it's from an email that people can reply to and ask any questions about their order. For a B2B email, send it from a real name and an email address with a real name. People are much more likely to interact with an email that seems like it's from a person than a bland ""marketing@abccompany.com"" type of email. We've all seen this from Amazon, where they suggest other products you might like based on what you just purchased. This is an easier task to accomplish for ecommerce transactional emails, where you have more data on who the purchaser is and what they might also be interested in. For B2B emails, every single one doesn't have to be uniquely customized but treat each email like your drip campaigns. Give the reader a blog to read and share, give someone a primer if they just signed up for your service, or offer a consultation if they just downloaded some information on your product. This can take some A/B testing to get right, so be willing to revisit your email and tweak it down the road. It's always so disappointing to see B2B emails from a ""no-reply"" where they want you to take extra steps to get in touch with the person or company who sent the email. It's like they don't want your business! Make sure people have no hoops to jump through if they want to ask you questions or get more information. If you are sending an ecommerce transactional email, it's okay to want to keep those organized and not all replied to, just make sure to provide a nice obvious call-to-action where people can check on their order, read FAQs, or get in contact with customer support. You've got access to the traffic certain pages on your website get, so use it! Don't make people search around through your site after they've received an email when you can see what they are likely to want to know. It's easy to include an email footer with quick links to the pages people are likely to need, or to place big, bold, calls-to-action that address their most likely needs based on the type of email they are receiving. Being proactive and anticipating what your reader is going to need is a great way to provide personalized value. So many transactional emails are very dry and boring, but you can provide a dash of brand personality that will help people connect with your company, product, or service. Don't sacrifice the value you just spent time providing, but you don't want to waste a great opportunity to tell your brand story, even if it's just through your template design and a couple sentences. One of my favorite examples is from Seamless, a staple food delivery app here in New York City: I appreciate that they assume I am doing something interesting and awesome and not just binging House of Cards on Netflix. It's simple but fun and gives you all the information you need while having a little personality. While many transactional emails are passive responses to some interaction a user is making, you should also consider how you can use transactional email to reach people based on what interactions they aren't making.  Different user behaviors (or lack thereof) give you the opportunity to reach out to them with a whole new transactional email style, not reacting to anything other than their lack of engagement.  These types of triggered transactional emails can  , and it's worth testing out. Obviously, there's a limit to the number of emails you should be sending people, and triggering an email because someone hasn't logged onto your app in a week may say more about your app than their usage. But finding non-intrusive ways to reengage users with quality content that is relevant to what they've been interested in before can be a good personal use of transactional email that can bring people back into the fold. Sometimes it's easy to think that copywriting is something for advertising and not marketing, but taking a good hard look at what you're saying and how you're saying it in your emails can reap rewards. Consider how your brand is viewed by your customers. Don't make your emails too formal if you are a casual company, and don't use overly familiar copy when you're providing professional services.  This ties back into who you are saying the email is from. If it's from your company, that doesn't mean it has to read like it's from your company, but it should mirror the copy you promote through your other emails, your social media, and your website. If your email says it's from a real person with a real name, experiment with the copy and see if a more relaxed copy style can make it more relatable and create more clicks. Don't write another robotic email that you yourself wouldn't read. Think about what value you can bring through your copywriting and how you can make your email more personal through the tone and style of your writing. Glad you asked. This Amazon email hits almost all the criteria you want in a transactional email: personalized to me, gives me big CTAs to check my shipping and order info, and provides suggestions based on what I ordered. I opened the email and clicked through several times, so by providing a good transactional email, Amazon maximized the potential they had to connect with me. Because you don't know how much your ride-share trip with Uber is going to cost, their transactional emails are incredibly important and specific, breaking down the cost, mileage, route, and total time for you. Asking for a rating could be a little larger, but they ask you to do that before you take your next ride through the app, so that's acceptable.  That's it! I definitely encourage you to dig in on your automated transactional emails with a critical eye and find areas to improve. While marketing automation platforms like HubSpot have great emails to begin with, I guarantee there are ways you can make them more personalized that result in better open rates, more click-throughs, happier customers, and more business. Transactional emails don't get a lot of attention, but by making them more personalized, you'll improve your connection with the reader.",Nathan Miller
2016-04-22,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/website-redesign-timelines,Time for a Website Overhaul? A Look Into the Redesign Timelines of 6K+ Businesses,"Redesigning your website is a great way to get a fresh start. But how do you know when it's actually time to get the ball rolling on an overhaul?  Many times, a redesign begins when an executive or marketer begins to feel like the website is outdated. This can especially be true if a competitor, or someone in an adjacent industry recently redesigned their site.  To help shed some light on how businesses look at redesign frequency, we surveyed 6,000+ HubSpot customers about their redesign plans for the future. The results revealed some interesting trends that should help you determine when to start your own project. Of the 6,000+ companies that answered the survey, 57% told us of their plans to redesign this year. That's   from this survey group alone. Here's the breakdown of specifically when marketers are planning to redesign: The last time we surveyed our customers, their redesign timeline was within  . Why the shift in frequency? Well, when you think about how much your business has changed in that timeframe, this shift becomes much easier to understand. As you learn more about your audience, gather feedback from visitors, and develop a better sense of how certain pages are performing, design needs begin to crop up more often.  Beyond general redesign timelines, we also looked at how redesign timeframes compare by industry. There were over 40 industries captured in this survey, but here are the top three: How does the redesign timeframe breakdown by industry? Let's take a closer look ... What can we learn from these timeframes? How can we apply these findings to our own business? There are a few lessons here, starting with when you can start your next website redesign. Let's dive in. Of the 40 different industries captured by this survey, software companies are redesigning most often, while construction/building materials companies seem to be redesigning least often. When should you start thinking about your next website redesign?  While there's no one perfect universal answer, we'd recommend that you begin planning your redesign anywhere between 90-120 days before you'd like to launch it. Again, this is simply a general guideline. The larger -- and more complex -- your plans are, the more time you should allow.  To get a better sense of timeline, we'd recommend defining your  . Once you nail down your goals, you can begin to plan your redesign needs and develop an approximate sense of timeline. Many website redesigns take 3-4 months, have a moderate up-front cost, and don't guarantee success. In fact,   with their last website redesign.  Growth-Driven Design helps address many of these key issues with a traditional website redesign, and ensures that your next website will be connected to -- and help drive -- results. This approach to design fundamentally starts with an initial version of  , and layers in testing and heatmapping. This allows you to quickly iterate from the feedback you are receiving. For example, let's say you're a software business looking to drive trials of your product through your homepage CTA. To get the best results, you could test CTA colors, location, size, and so on, and make a design decision based on the results.  In other words, your redesign will truly never be complete. Instead, you'll be continuously iterating based on data from visitors to ensure that you're delivering the best experience possible. Pretty cool, right? ( .)",Jeffrey Vocell

2016-04-21,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/trello-board-tips-for-teams,8 Creative Ways to Manage Your Tasks & Projects Effectively Using Trello Boards,"This is where tools like Trello come in. We've talked about Trello before, like   (see #3). And why shouldn't we? Here at HubSpot, all different teams have used it for years for everything from project management to our blog's editorial calendar. It's worked very well for us, and we want to share the love. There are a ton of different ways you and your team can use Trello for work, and what works for you may not work for others, and vice versa. That's why we've rounded up eight useful ways to organize your Trello board.  Trello is a well-known app that's especially good for tracking and visualizing progress. Using their card-based layout, you can create a card for every idea, blog posts, piece of a project, and so on. Then, within each of these cards, you can jot notes, assign them to others, organize them into categories or lists, create task lists and checklists within cards, color-code them, attach files ... the list goes on. While boards can be organized in many ways, here's an example of what one looks like: Once you click into one of those cards, you can label them, add a due date, add ""members"" to the card to assign tasks, and so on. Another great feature? The calendar. If you   (much like Labs in Gmail), then you'll be able to assign everything in a calendar view that makes organizing due dates much easier. (To learn more about Trello's capabilities, you can  .) For now, let's move on to some different ways you can structure your Trello board. There are  . If you tend to be a more visual person, Trello could be a great choice for you. Why? Because it lets you drag, drop, color-code, and manipulate to-do list items in a way that many of the other tools don't. For your day-to-day list items, you might keep different lists for projects assigned to you by different clients. Or, you could organize them based on priority, as in the example below: For all you bloggers out there, I use the drag-and-drop feature to track blog post ideas and progress. To do this, I named columns things like, ""Idea Backlog,"" ""In Queue,"" ""Research/Interview Stage,"" ""Draft in Progress,"" ""In Editorial,"" ""Scheduled,"" and ""Published."" (Okay fine, the real name of last column was ""DUNZO."" To each her own.) If you're hoping to access your to-do list from your mobile devices,   for iPhone, iPad, Android phones, tablets, watches, and Kindle Fire tablets. Trello markets itself as a collaboration tool -- and that's probably what it's best for. If you're managing a project, it's an awesome tool for organizing all the moving parts of a project, including people, due dates, and progress tracking. In Trello's extensive free product, you can invite as many people as you want to your board. To divvy up tasks, all you have to do is add members or drag-and-drop people to cards. Everyone can see the whole board, but folks who are added to cards will be notified of their assignment. You can also start discussions using comments and attachments within each card. So if you want to add a quick note (or a not-so-quick note), then you can write 'em in there -- and even mention another member to make sure they get notified. Add files by uploading them from your computer, Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, or OneDrive. Plus, Trello works in real-time -- so when someone moves a card, it'll move on your own board instantly. This means you never have to refresh your browser to see the latest updates. If the project's top secret, all you have to do is put the project's ""board"" on private. All the information and data you put on there is   -- and the folks at Trello keep encrypted, off-site backups of all the data in case something crazy happens. Once a project -- or even a week at work -- is finished, you and your team can always benefit from reflecting on what went well, what didn't go so well, and what you can do to improve the process going forward. This is sometimes called a ""retrospective."" It's all in the name of continuous improvement. While many people choose to take notes during these retrospective meetings using a good ol' whiteboard, Trello can actually be a great digital tool that'll eliminate the need to type up and send out disjointed notes later. It's also convenient for folks who have remote teams in different cities and time zones because it allows you to make the feedback visible to everyone, at any time. That's exactly why Mitchel Seaman used Trello for retrospective meetings for his remote team, which he wrote about  . His system involves voting: Throughout the week, members of the team can go into the board and post cards denoting what's going well and what's going poorly as it happens. Then, folks can go in and vote on things to talk about during a weekly retrospective meeting, discuss them, and keep track of action items. While Trello does have a voting feature (which you can enable by going to Menu > Power Ups > Voting), it requires people to click into a card, and then click the Vote button. To make it so folks don't have to click into a card, Seaman uses stickers instead -- which, he says, also makes it ""way more fun."" Before the meeting, whoever's running it will drag the top-voted items to the top of each list. During the meeting, each top-voted item is discussed one-by-one. Cards that are actionable can be moved to the ""Action Items"" column. That ""Action Items"" column never moves, and you can even assign people to it and give due dates. Once the meeting's over, the lists are archived and a new one is created for the coming week. (  Even when you archive a list, it's not gone forever. You can still search for items within it and retrieve entire old lists when you want to.) You can read the whole article  . Coming up with fresh, new ideas isn't easy. And even if you take the time to brainstorm, it can be tough to get started. Where do you begin? How do you create enough ideas? How do you sort the great from the good from the bad when you're done? Trello just so happens to be a great tool to help you brainstorm -- and then organize your ideas once the brainstorm is over. Using their card-based layout, you can create a card for every idea and even jot additional notes in there, attach files, and so on.  Once the brainstorm is over, you can color-code them based on priority, like using green for high priority, yellow for medium priority, and red for low priority. If you want to use that board to assign topics to content creators, you can add members to each card to assign it to them -- and attach due dates, too. Your blogging team could be one person, it could involve tens of contributors, or it could be somewhere in between. No matter how many people are writing for your blog, it's crucial to have an editorial calendar to keep track of which blog posts you plan to publish when.  In fact, here at HubSpot, we use Trello (among other tools, like   and  ) to organize our own blog's editorial calendar. And we aren't the only ones -- news sites like Mashable, ReadWrite, and The Changelog use Trello as an editorial calendar, too,  . You can create a Trello board for your editorial calendar in several ones. One way is to create columns based on a single post's progress, like in the example below: In this example, each card represents a single blog post, and you can move it along the progress bar by moving it from ""Article Ideas"" to ""Researching"" to ""On Hold"" to ""Writing"" to ""Editing and Graphics"" -- all the way to when it's published. While it's in progress, you can add notes into each card, assign writers by adding members, and so on, until it reaches that ""Published"" list. Another way to organize blog posts for your calendar is by creating columns based on post type. If this is the way you like to brainstorm your blog posts, you can simply brainstorm in the Trello board, assign writers and add notes as needed, and use the ""Calendar"" feature to plan out the actual editorial calendar. To add the ""Calendar"" feature, simply go to Menu > Power Ups > Enable Calendar. Once you've enabled the calendar, you can view it by clicking the ""Calendar"" link in the top right of your board. If you want to use an editorial calendar, but would rather not use Trello,  . A lot of moving parts go into launching a new marketing campaign, and usually, a lot of people are involved -- sometimes from different teams and even different time zones. If you're not totally organized for the launch, this means a lot of opportunities for things to slip through the cracks. Trello is really good for keeping track of all those moving parts for a launch. When you create a new board for your promotional plan, you can create lists to categorize each part of the plan. Then, you can put cards under those lists and fill them in with things like blog posts, kickback emails, creating click-to-tweets, and so on. You can label each of these cards ""Pre-Launch,"" ""Launch Day,"" or ""Post-Launch,"" add members, set due dates, and use the notes within each card to give details, update members of your team, start discussions, and so on. It's a great way to keep track of what's going out when, and who's responsible for it. If you've done user research before, you know that all those user interviews usually end up in a series of unorganized notes that are tedious to sift through, organize, and find patterns in later. One innovative way to organize these notes and find those patterns faster is by using Trello.  I can't take credit for this idea: I came across  , a product designer at Pivotal Labs. Ghent uses Trello to synthesize user research and minimize the time spent organizing Post-It notes onto a board. If you use Trello cards instead of Post-It notes, he says, you'll come out with a digital version of your user research that'll make skimming, referencing, and sharing your learnings later much easier. Here's what it looks like. (You can see the larger version by opening  .) The process starts with setting up a Trello board before your very first user interview. The first column will be your list of users, and you'll attach a specific color to each user. That color will be used to mark their comments throughout the board. Then, you'll label each column based on your area of focus. ""If it's an interaction test, each new column title can be 'Page X,'"" he writes. ""If you’re at more of a generative stage, then each column could be titled 'Stage X Behaviors,' and so on."" When you get into your interviews, you'll type notes directly into cards on the Trello board (under the right column if you can, although you can always do it later) -- with the right color label added to show which user said it. After each interview, you can sort your notes into the correct columns. As you do this with more and more interviews, you can start grouping commonalities by dragging the different cards into the same columns. ""You’ll start to see stacks of cards with multiple color labels show up in the same spot. Viola! Patterns."" You can read the whole article  . If your team operates using the sprint or Scrum philosophy, Trello is a pretty decent free option to help you and your team move through tasks more quickly with greater agility. ( .) To make Trello work for the Scrum, they create one board per client, which they share with that client. Then, they use the same, general framework to start off each project. The framework consists of six columns: ""Resources,"" ""Sprint Planning,"" ""Current Sprint,"" ""Blocked,"" ""QA,"" and ""Done.""  : What do each of these columns mean, exactly? Here's how they define it,  : Here's a video to show you what it looks like in action: They also share their Trello boards with their clients to hold themselves more accountable while  ""Together, Trello and the Scrum framework help our internet marketing agency stay organized, and provide a level of transparency and accountability to our clients that I haven’t seen anywhere,"" CEO Adam Steele  .",Lindsay Kolowich
2016-04-21,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-tools-resources,17 Tools & Resources for Conducting Market Research,"We are creatures of habit, especially when it comes to buying behavior. We know the location of our favorite products in the store, and we trust that they'll work year after year. In fact,    People don't like change. It's a battle to get someone to switch to an unknown brand. When a client wants to launch a new product, get into a different market, or open a new store location, the odds are stacked against him. Consider this:  In part, we can blame lack of research for why there are so many unsuccessful product launches and ill-conceived new feature additions. Founders and brand managers ""know"" it will be successful -- they run on their instincts, not the facts. (It was this instinct that led Clairol to release  , which some people thought was a breakfast food option.) Finding out if a product will be successful beyond the initial curiosity is just good business. With market research, you determine if the opportunity exists, how to position the product or service, or what consumers' opinions are after the launch.  If you're sensitive to the high costs of failure and need to gather facts and opinions to predict whether your new product, feature, or location will be successful, start by investing in market research using these tools and resources.    Sometimes you need a no-frills test to take the pulse of consumers.   allows you to add a question, grab a snippet of code, and pop it onto your website.

Implementing Growth-Driven Design processes is an effective way to ensure that this always happens. Here are the basic steps to implementing GDD to your ecommerce website: Always start by setting S.M.A.R.T goals, developing complete buyer personas, and doing quantitative and qualitative research. Taking the time to properly lay down this groundwork will give you a realistic sense of what steps you need to take to create a top converting ecommerce site, and exactly who you need to be speaking to in order to increase traffic, drive conversions and ensure your success in the future. First, setting goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T) will ensure that you avoid generalizations and accurately measure your progress, keeping yourself accountable every step of the way. Instead of saying that your goal is, ""to generate more revenue"", set a more targeted goal like, ""to increase product conversions by 10% (from 50 per month to 55 per month) in the next 6 months."" That way, you'll be able to keep track of exactly how you are progressing and what else you need to do to reach your goal in a timely manner.   Similarly, doing the research and creating fully-developed buyer personas will allow you to accurately segment and target all of your marketing efforts, making sure that they reach the right people at the right time. Ultimately, your goal as an online retailer is to attract, convert, close and delight your site visitors, and in order to create content that accomplishes this task you need to know who they are, what motivates them to buy and what will get them interested.  Finally, getting feedback from your current customers and analyzing your current year-over-year metrics in terms of traffic, transactions, and conversion rates will guide your strategy moving forward and help you really keep track of your improvement over time. You’ll know where you’re at, who you are selling to, and where to focus your efforts in the future. With this information, you can start developing an informed and effective site, coming up with a global and page strategy that works to effectively attract, convert, close and delight your potential customers. Before you go headfirst into putting together a full website, GDD strategy suggests that you create a wishlist and Launch Pad site, always keeping the information that you discovered in the “Plan Ahead” section in mind. To create your wishlist, sit down with your team and write down all of your “a-ha” creative ideas and everything that will set you apart from your competition. If you were creating your dream ecommerce site, how would it look and what would it include? Maybe every product detail page would include a 360° image or the site would be fully integrated with all social media accounts. Clearly not all of these ideas will be implemented, but putting together this wishlist will help you develop your vision and a clear idea of what your “best website” would look like. Once you have your wishlist, do a 80/20 analysis on it, finding the top 20% of ideas that will have 80% of the impact. What are the “must-have” items on this list - what do your buyer personas want to see, and what will effectively turn them into delighted customers? This would include features like a user-friendly shopping cart and a well-designed product page. When considering these ""must-haves,"" it's helpful to think of your website as a store and try to make it as inviting as possible. What are the basics of any good store? At the very least, work to make sure that your top 80/20 list ideas work to optimize these essential ecommerce pages. Once you have this list whittled down, put together your Launch Pad website with these top must-have features. Think of the Launch Pad website as a starter site. It won’t be perfect, but it should be launched quickly so that you can start generating valuable feedback and revenue. With a starter site up, you can quickly start analyzing data and seeing what pages are working, what products your site visitors are interested in, and where you could be losing opportunities for conversions. Are your buyer personas accurate? Are you on a path to reach your S.M.A.R.T goals? Here is where you find out.  As you move forward, continue to analyze, develop and revise your site. Always keep track of your metrics, checking the effectiveness of your strategies and make any necessary changes along the way. Are site visitors bouncing on your homepage? What items on your product page are they most interested in? Are there certain blog post topics that get the most views? Staying on top of this kind of information and maintaining this dynamic relationship with your data, progress, and customers ensures that your marketing efforts are effective and that you maintain an up-to-date, successful site over time. As you analyze this data and continue to draw conclusions, make sure that you also publish all of your important findings in a central location that everyone in your company can see and take advantage of. This will not only provide a roadmap for future site changes and decisions, but also ensure that every branch of your team - development, sales, marketing, etc. - has all of the information that they need to effect positive change on your ecommerce site.   Say, for example, that the data shows that products with fun, conversational descriptions have the highest conversion rates. If this information is available for all to see, then the team can effectively and cohesively implement that language in email campaigns and throughout the site. The point, then, is to transfer all of the most impactful information that has been gathered to other parts of your site in order to see a marked positive change.  Looking at it more generally, then, applying GDD in this way and following these steps gives ecommerce retailers the edge that they need to create a successful site. It provides them with all of the tools that they need to take full control of their websites and its performance, ultimately creating the most high-converting, successful online presence possible. With traditional web design, this kind of precision and control is extremely difficult to achieve: without using live data and feedback to speak to their buyer personas and provide relevant content, online retailers just can't know what changes will be most effective and well-received long-term.  So, while GDD may seem like a time-consuming and complex process, its dynamic, data-driven approach ultimately makes it one the best, most effective marketing strategies out there.",Caroline Ruhland

2016-04-25,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-we-need-sleep,Why Am I So Tired? A Deep Dive Into Our Need for Sleep,"When you nestle into your warm bed, shut your eyes, and slowly drift off to sleep ... do you think your mind and body are shutting down for the night? Not the case, my friend. While our bodies might remain (relatively) still when we sleep, our minds are hard at work. During these critical hours, a lot of that processing, restoration, and strengthening that's so important to our bodies and minds is taking place. It's crystal clear that we need sleep to live, period. Not only is getting fewer than six hours of sleep on a regular basis bad for your productivity, but it also affects your short- and long-term ability to think clearly. In some cases, sleep deprivation has even been   like depression, anxiety, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s, Woof. To help us understand how important sleep is,  . Sleepiness, like hunger, is a natural, protective mechanism, they say. It's a powerful message your body sends you to signal that bad things will happen if you don't hit the hay. While scientists know hunger fulfills our need for nutrients, growth, and tissue repair, it turns out   To this day, s But that doesn't mean those scientists don't have theories. In fact, there are some really interesting ideas out there for the function(s) that sleeping serves us -- some more plausible than others. To get a better understanding of why sleep is so important, let's dig in to the four most popular theories of why we need sleep. Of course, there are plenty of counterarguments to this theory. For example, isn't is safer to stay conscious -- even if you're lying awake in the dark -- so you can react to a potential threat? Some scientists pair this first theory with the next one on energy conservation. This is one of the most commonly cited theories on sleep function. As you might guess, this one is all about conserving energy -- and it's especially relevant in times when food is scarce.  to compare two animals: The theory states that Animal #2 is more likely to survive during times when food is scarce because they need (and use) less of it for energy. In other words, Animals #2 is trading time for energy:  It might be harder for us to imagine this now, living in societies where food sources tend to be readily available. But keep in mind that, relatively speaking, it hasn't been very long since humans were living in a constant state of food scarcity. In those situations, the competition for -- and use of -- our energy resources was (and still is)  in natural selection. It's a similar concept to hibernation, actually, where animals are inactive and have reduced metabolic rates. Of course, this theory relies on energy metabolism being a lot lower when we're asleep than when we're awake -- including when we're awake, but remaining quiet and still. So, is that true? , it   true to some degree: Energy metabolism is reduced during sleep by as much as 10% in humans, and even more in other species. But   that the amount of energy we  What ""things"" would your body need to restore? This is where the theories branch off into sub-theories. Some have to do with physical restoration, others with mental restoration. The list includes immune function restoration, muscle growth, tissue repair, protein synthesis, and hormone release. When it comes to immune function, for example, our bodies need to maintain a very careful balance of cells and immune responses in order to stay healthy.   that sleep-deprived animals eventually lost  of their immune function -- and died within just a few weeks.  that sleep is crucial for our cellular, organic, and systemic functions. For example, sleep deprivation makes our bodies synthesize protein slower, which can cause us to lose muscle and hinder muscle recovery after damage from exercise, injuries, and so on. You may have heard that sleep is good for cognition and memory. Specifically,   to help us retain memory:  by removing us from the constant disruptions we experience when we're awake. When we're awake, new situations and stimuli can prevent new memories from consolidating in our minds.  according to how important they are to us, and our expectations for remembering them.    Another one of the restorative theories is centered around a brain chemical called adenosine. Our cells release adenosine on a regular basis just by functioning normally. But, unlike chemicals like carbon dioxide, our bodies don't just get rid of adenosine. Instead, it builds up in our brains throughout the day -- and   to our increasing fatigue as the day goes on. Finally, we have the brain plasticity theory -- one of the more recent theories on why we sleep. ""Brain plasticity"" is the brain's ability to change its own structure and organization in response to changes within our bodies and in our environment -- and it plays a big role in our ability to learn new information and skills. Where does the need for sleep fit in? The theory suggests  Without adequate sleep, we have a hard time learning something new because our brain doesn't have the opportunity to review and ""absorb"" the new information. This is especially true when we're young.  , sleep plays a crucial role in the brain development of infants and young children. Y Sleep affects your physical well-being and your ability to learn new skills, absorb new information, and be the productive, happy, functioning person I'm guessing you'd like to be. For most adults, that means getting seven to eight solid hours of sleep every night. Here's the good news: If you find yourself in sleep debt, you   make it up.   followed a group of student volunteers who slept only four hours per night for six consecutive days. All of the changes they experienced during that period of sleep deprivation -- from high blood pressure to fewer antibodies to insulin resistance -- were reversed when the students made up the hours of sleep they’d lost.

2016-04-24,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productivity-lessons-hubspot-dharmesh-shah,3 Productivity Lessons From HubSpot Co-Founder Dharmesh Shah,"Successful founders are productive. I'm not sure if they're successful because they’re productive, or if they forced themselves to become productive because they wanted to be successful. It's very much a chicken-or-egg question. But the fact remains that even though successful founders only have 24 hours in a day,   while the rest of us are doing … well, who knows what? (I’m still mourning the loss of scheduled naptime.)  is an example of one of those founders. Since he co-founded HubSpot almost 10 years ago, the business has grown from $0 to $181M in annual revenue. We employ over 1,100 employees and serve over 18,000 customers. Not too shabby. So last week, I asked him exactly how he approaches his work. Below are the three productivity tips he uses to get stuff done. Sleep Expert   that people regularly report working more hours than they actually do. We’re used to glorifying professionals who work a lot. That’s why people say, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead,” right? If you subscribe to this school of thought, I urge you to rethink it.  We all know from common sense and personal experience that when we’re tired, we can’t perform at our best. But science backs this tip up, too. , Drew Dawson and Kathryn Reid found that sleep deprivation has roughly the same effect on our performance as alcohol intoxication. If you’re sleeping fewer than six hours a night, you’ll experience the same effects   -- the legal limit for driving. You’ll never be at your best if you’re tired and distracted, so avoid overworking. It’ll pay off in the long run. “Don’t kid yourself that you can multitask -- you can’t,” Dharmesh said. “Task switching is cognitively expensive.” The human brain is only wired to focus on one thing at a time. So trying to complete multiple tasks simultaneously is not only ineffective, it’s actually bad for you.   that when adult participants in their study attempted to multitask, their IQ scores lowered to the average range you’d find in an eight-year-old child.  Instead, focus on one thing at a time -- especially when it’s something you have to get right. “Give yourself contiguous time to work on the important things,” Dharmesh suggests. It can be tempting to jump back and forth between projects -- as you see new emails and notifications come in, your instinct is to respond immediately. But the more you’re switching between tasks, the longer it will take you to complete everything. Shut off channels you’re not using at the moment to minimize distraction. This one’s actually two tips in one: Organize your day in chunks of tasks, and plan your days ahead of time. “I block out time on my calendar to do the things I need to do,” Dharmesh said. “Otherwise, my day gets fragmented. Fragmented days lead to fragmented weeks -- not good.” Depending on your job, planning can only take you so far. Surprises and shifts might just be part of your job. But if you can enter each day with a sense of your priorities, it’ll be easier for you to shift things around when last-minute changes do come up. Since you’re guaranteed to face interruptions in your day, make sure the time you can plan for is structured strategically. It takes an average of   after a distraction, so minimize your mental load by knocking out similar types of tasks one after the other.",Leslie Ye
2016-04-25,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/unstuck-career,How to Get Unstuck in Your Career,"“I feel stuck. Where should I go from here?” It’s not uncommon to feel like there’s no obvious next step in your career. It’s hard work to guide yourself, especially when you’re walking into the unknown. So what do you do when you feel stuck? Do you jump ship? Apply for a new role within your company? Or just stick it out?  In the right context, any of those options could work out just fine. But how do you know which direction is right for you? If you’re in marketing or a part of a big team, chances are you work with individuals with many different skill sets. Maybe you sit next to a woman named Tracie who’s a jane of all trades. It seems like there’s nothing she can’t do! Your other co-worker, Seth, might be the go-to-guy for all things analytics and reports. Sometimes he even holds team workshops on metrics and reporting tools. Despite their differences, both Tracie and Seth are most likely equally valued by the company. Their roles represent two common directions an employee might pursue in one’s career, depth and breadth, and both are excellent paths to get yourself unstuck. Ideally, most teams will have healthy mix of people pursuing both depth and breadth. People may also choose to switch between the two over time in order to have a wide skill set as well as a particular area of expertise. In the past, this has been referred to as a “T-shaped” person. To figure out what's right for your own career development, let’s dive into the values of each direction and how to know which could be right for you. If you want to figure out if finding depth is the right path for you, the first piece to consider is whether you’ve truly gotten all the developmental value you can out of the role you have today. This could be a hard question to ask, especially if you’re so burnt out it seems like there is nothing left to learn. That can be dangerous. In that case  Why is this so important? It’s really easy to mix up moments when you’re tapped out of learning, and moments when you’ve simply plateaued. In fact, they can often look exactly the same. Think about it: What makes a topic advanced? It’s not obvious. It’s difficult to understand. Very few people understand it. It takes serious skill, effort, and brainpower to acquire that advanced knowledge. And without a significant foundation, you wouldn’t have the opportunity to learn it. In other words, becoming “stuck” is an instance in which you’re actually approaching mastery. Seth Godin goes into this idea in  . The key point it shares is that as one progresses toward mastery, the individual often first hits a “dip,” or a point when continued learning now requires significant effort and time -- much more than it took to begin learning the skill in the first place. The reality check? This is the obstacle that’s in front of everyone who strives to move past general proficiency. It’s valuable to expect this dip, if only as a way to recognize the difference between a natural obstacle in your progression (when learning becomes more challenging) vs. a lack of learning opportunities overall. If you mistake the former for the latter, you could be keeping yourself from a valuable opportunity for advancement. The other piece that makes achieving mastery so challenging -- and thus so valuable -- is the fact that as you progress, there will be fewer and fewer people who can teach you and help you improve. You’re valued for the very fact that the level of mastery you possess is uncommon and rare. Now you are the one that can advise others. People will come to you to better understand this skill or learn it for the first time. If anyone needs an expert in this area, they will come to you. Another equally valuable path is pursuing breadth. By holding many different roles over time, you’ll get a wide context that serves as an investment for the long term. In fact, moving around horizontally could eventually become your strategy to move up. Think about it: Have you ever made a structure out of popsicle sticks -- perhaps in grade school or summer camp? Pretend you want to build a structure that can reach four or five feet high. What do you need to build first before you can start building up? A wide foundation. Take it back to marketing:   When you have experience doing many different pieces within your industry, you’ll be much more likely to understand how all the pieces fit together. That’s the type of context that supports a person in strategic decision making, program management, and more. Interested in going into management one day -- perhaps to lead a big team? It can be smart to hold off on management until you have that wide foundation. That wide context you get from having multiple roles might be extremely helpful in being able to manage and mentor people of various expertise down the line, as well as make it easier to move around within leadership roles long term. After all, it’s easy to train someone who has a job you once had. Sounds great? Before you act, let’s discuss the downside as well. When going for breadth, you risk walking away with shallow knowledge for each area. For example, it’s easy to get excited about the next thing before you’ve gained substantial knowledge in the role you have now.  Similarly, if you’re good at everything and great at nothing, you also may be missing out on an opportunity to differentiate yourself. It’s a good idea to pick one of your skills to be your top skill, and invest the most time in that area. If this feels like the right path for you, the best way to pursue breadth is through a corporate mobility program. It may be a formal program, or it may be casual. Either way, understand the process you should pursue to be considered for a new role on the team. Then, make yourself an obvious candidate. In other words, do your best to demonstrate some of the skills needed in the new role while in your current role. Evaluating an internal candidate is nearly exactly the same as an external candidate. The hiring manager needs to make the case that you will be a fit, so you need to give her a dozen reasons for why you are. So how can you get that early experience? Here are a few ideas: Regardless of your path, there’s always one element that’s going to be the biggest factor in your career no matter what you do: the unknown. You never know how your team or company will change over time, whether will it grow, shrink, or change priorities. You never know if there will one day be a new role you’ll go after that takes you in a new direction. You never know if one day you’ll fall in love with an area of expertise. As long as you stay in the driver’s seat of your own career, you’ll be able to roll with the punches and make the best decisions for you in the moment. Defining something as ambiguous as a career path means to pick the best path that works for you today.",Rebecca Corliss
2016-04-26,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/you-can-still-reach-people-using-ad-block-software,You Can Still Reach People Using Ad Block Software,"That vocal bunch known as ad block users are quickly becoming one of the most sought after audiences on the internet. This untapped audience, if you can reach them without trivializing their concerns, is a massive opportunity for marketers. If done correctly, reaching ad block users isn’t as complicated as it’s often made out to be by the ad tech industry. With a few simple tweaks to your marketing strategy, you’ll be able to target an audience few others are reaching currently.  While people who use ad blockers are actively trying to shut out promotional messages, they also tend to be the most engaged audience online. Studies consistently characterize them has  , well educated, and   of new products.  Statistically, they are also heavily   they read, and   with both the media sites they support and the authors who pen their favorite content. In other words, the payoff for reaching these readers can be unprecedented. With the growth of ad blocking online, the relationship between media company and reader continues to deepen. For properties that have the trust of their readers, the opportunities to market directly to them often comes in creative and untraditional packages.  If you’re looking to target an audience that exists solely because of advertising blocking on the internet, you’ll need to learn as much as possible about them before you start working with brands to target them. Categorically speaking, some websites have audience segments with higher levels of blocking than others. For instance, ad blocking adoption has grown the quickest amongst the  , and by extension the publications they frequent are under the biggest threat. That said, ad blocker adoption also continues to shrink across older demographics.  Installation intention, however, seems to be trending in the opposite direction. While the 18-24 demographic may have the highest adoption rate already, the benefits of ad blocking is resonating the most with those that are 45 or older.  .  Understanding your website’s readership and their tendencies will go a long way towards developing a successful outreach strategy.  You can quickly capture information about your ad block audience by implementing technical solutions to track them. Today, most savvy media companies online know exactly the size of their audience currently using ad blockers. Sophisticated tools exist to collect that information, and both   and   will collect information about those using the blockers across their sites. Once you know who’s blocking your advertisements, you can start compiling a plan to sell against your newly uncovered audience. Cutting edge media companies looking to target ad block end users often have dedicated content teams whose primary responsibility is to create content that leaves lasting impressions with their audience. Both the   and the   have teams in-house that focus on designing native campaigns for brands. Understand the value of non-traditional advertising opportunities, and then prepare yourself to answer advertiser questions about audience trends, demographics, and what types of content resonates the most with your readership. Prepare marketing material to provide prospects with a compilation of your team’s best work, and then success metrics around each example piece of content. Determine what this new target audience is already reading and sharing online. Does your ideal marketing target spend most of their time reading editorials, or do they spend time digging through reviews on your website?  The only way to reach an ad blocking audiences at a targeted publication is to give them material that they’re already consuming online and in a format they prefer. Once you’re able to build a content profile for your target within a website’s customer base, you can begin to explore native advertising options with advertisers interested in reaching ad blockers on your site. The truth is, it’s time move on from display advertising as a sole offering to advertisers. While media companies are still engaging brands about display, today most advertisers are looking for more interesting or custom offerings from publications. There’s a reason: sponsorships and natural alternatives reach their most valuable audiences while doing a better job of telling your brand’s story online. 70% of people online want to learn about products through content. That means reviews, videos, podcasts, and mediums that offer more than just “buy this now” advertising. In most of those cases they can instruct audience on why they should buy your products, or how it compares to the competition.  Product reviews and product-related editorial need each other.  Customers want to know if your products are up to the task, and if you’re providing the best option on the market.  Display advertising, when used as brand recognition can be a powerful tool, but product editorials provide more context and incentive to make a final decision on purchasing a product.  Reputable publications may be pricey, but if their audience trusts them, they’re more likely to buy products than they are when they see a simple display advertisement. One of the quickest growing mediums on the internet is newsletters. Media companies, and their users love newsletters because they’re one of the most engaging mediums in their arsenal. Few mediums can guarantee a reader will view content, but newsletters can focus directly on who clicked a sponsorship, and who avoided your native content.  Newsletters also boast some of the best click-through numbers on the web.  Much like display, your open and click rates will vary by content category, but the clickthrough rates tend to outperform display across the board.    The other beauty of newsletters? Readers have opted-in for the information being sent by media companies. The majority of subscribers know what type of information will be arriving in a newsletter, so if there’s a natural with with your brand and marketing strategy, newsletter readers will often embrace your advertisements. Advertorials and Sponsored Content, Branded Content, and In-Feed Ads are all examples of native content types that fall under a sponsored content umbrella, but they all take a slightly different approach to displaying your content to readers.  In some cases, ad blockers can be configured to block sponsored content and other forms of native content, but when it comes down to it, if advertisements are built with care and adhere to a reader’s expectations, it’s unlikely that your sponsored content will be ignored.  Sponsored content is often built by a media company for their audience, but based on your marketing targets. In this situation, media companies work alongside advertising teams and determine which types of content  (infographic, an article, etc.) will align with an advertisers campaign goals.  Just like newsletters, podcasts result in very high engagement number.  Unlike its written brethren, media company audiences opt-in to receive continuous content in a variety of applications on both mobile and desktop computing systems. If your targeted media company has a podcast with embedded advertisements, the content will bypass ad blockers and reach your intended audience.  Podcasts are a great way to target the ad block demographic with your marketing messages while giving them content in a format they prefer. While display may be on the way out, there are a couple approaches marketers are taking to get their display campaigns in front of ad block users. Did you know some display ad networks are currently whitelisted across a variety of ad blocking applications by default?  That means some networks,   can fulfill your display advertisement campaign needs, while still being able to target consumers running ad blockers. As a marketer, it makes sense to search out networks and exchanges that have been whitelisted and place your display ads through those mechanisms versus traditional exchanges. Targeting ad blockers isn’t without its dangers. There will always be a vocal minority who admonish your marketing attempts publicly no matter your best efforts or pure intentions. There’s nothing you can do about it. Arming yourself with facts may help you get over the anxiety of publishing native content, but you should be prepared for a negative scenario that may manifest itself after publishing your campaign. Some people just like to watch the world burn.",Joshua Schnell

That is where research comes into play.   Whether you're a newbie or experienced with market research, this guide will give you a blueprint for conducting a thorough buyer's journey study. Buyer personas -- sometimes referred to as marketing personas -- are fictional, generalized representations of your ideal customers.

Let's walk through them ... Start with the characteristics that apply to your buyer persona. This will vary for every organization, but here are some additional guidelines that will apply to just about any scenario: Market research firms have panels of people they can pull from when they want to conduct a study. Trouble is, most individual marketers don't have that luxury -- and that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the time you'll spend recruiting exclusively for your study will often lead to better participants.  Here's a simple recruiting process to guide your efforts: The best way to make sure you get the most out of your conversations is to be prepared. You should always create a discussion guide -- whether you'll be conducting a focus group or a phone interview -- to make sure you cover all of the top-of-mind questions and use your time wisely.  (Note: This is not intended to be a script. The discussions should be natural and conversational, so we encourage you to go out of order or probe into certain areas as you see fit.) Your discussion guide should be in an outline format, with a time allotment and open-ended questions allotted for each section. Yes -- this is a golden rule of market research. You never want to ""lead the witness"" by asking yes/no questions, as that puts you at risk of unintentionally swaying their thoughts by leading with your own hypothesis. Asking open-ended questions also helps you avoid those painful one-word answers.  Here's a general outline for a 30-minute phone interview with one B2B buyer. Although, we recommend that you schedule 45 minutes to allow for tardiness, potential technology issues, and bit of small talk. This section is intended to break the ice and get the respondent(s) talking.  Before getting into the details around a specific purchase, it will be helpful to understand their role and team better. Here, you want to understand how they first realized they had a problem that needed to be solved without getting into whether or not they knew about your brand yet. Now you want to get very specific about how and where the buyer researched potential solutions. Plan to interject to ask for more details. Here, you want to wrap up and understand what could have been better for the buyer. Now for the fun part: talking to people! This step is pretty straightforward, but here are some tips to make sure everything runs smoothly: Feeling overwhelmed by the notes you took? We suggest looking for common themes that will help you tell a story and create a list of action items.  To make the process easier, try using your favorite presentation software to make a report, as it will make it easy to add in quotes, diagrams, or call clips.

2016-04-26,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-cover-letter-template,How to Write a Cover Letter That Gets You the Job [Template + Examples],"No one seems to agree on cover letters. How much time do you need to spend perfecting them? Do hiring managers even read them? Is it better to just send in your resume and call it a day? Now, I'm not in HR, but I've been approached by applicants who wondered whether their cover letter would actually be read. My answer is one not many of them wanted to hear: ""Sometimes.""  Sometimes it will be read. Other times, you can get away with just sending in your resume -- like when you network your way into applying for a position. aving a cover letter will give you an upper hand in ways your resume doesn't. It allows you to show off your writing skills, provide details that you couldn't fit on your resume, demonstrate your passion, and show your willingness to put in as much time and effort as possible.  But if your cover letter is sloppy, you might as well have not applied at all. Grammatical errors could mean your application is thrown in the trash. Using a generic ""one-size-fits-all"" cover letter -- especially if you forgot to change the name of the company -- will definitely hurt your chances. So if you take the time to write a cover letter, take special care that it reflects you in the best possible light. Let's take a look at an example. Here's an example of a great cover letter. The numbered sections are explained in more detail below. The level of formality your header has will depend on the company you apply to. If you're applying to a formal business, it's important to use a formal header to open your cover letter, like in the sample above. Put your address, the date, and the company's address. But if you're applying to a company that isn't as formal, you don't need to include yours and the company's addresses. You can still include the date, though. Using ""To Whom It May Concern"" is okay, but you may want to take the time to research the name of the recruiter or hiring manager online. If you do your research and aren't confident you found the right name, then you should definitely use the generic greeting -- but if you  sure, then it shows you put in the effort to find their name and it will catch the recruiter's eye. If you have the recruiter's name, do you greet them by their full name, or by their courtesy title (i.e. Mr., Ms., or Mrs.)? Similar to the header, it depends on the company's level of formality. If you're applying to a corporate business, you may want to consider using ""Mr. Snaper"" instead of ""Jon Snaper."" If you're applying to a start-up or a business with a more casual culture, you can use ""Jon Snaper,"" as shown in the example. Your opening paragraph should, in 1-3 sentences, state why you're excited to apply and what makes you the perfect candidate. Get right to the point, and don't worry about explaining where you found the posting or who you know at the company. This isn't a place to go into detail about why you're a great candidate -- that's for the second paragraph. Here, simply list a few key reasons in one sentence to set up the rest of your letter. Keep in mind that the recruiter may cross-reference your cover letter with your resume, so make sure the two sync up. Next, sell yourself and your experience by choosing one or two concrete examples that show why you're a great fit for the position. What did you do at a previous company that gave you relevant experience? Which projects have you worked on that would benefit the new company? How will your prior experience help this company grow? Stay humble in your explanation of credentials while still showing that you would be an asset to the team. Use this paragraph to show you're genuinely excited and interested in the position. While it's certainly important you're a good fit for the job, it's also important that the company is a good fit for you. "" Don't write off the final few sentences of your cover letter -- it's important to finish strong. Be straightforward about your interest and enthusiasm about the new position without coming off too strong. Tell them you're available to talk about the opportunity at any time and include your phone number and email address. At this point, the ball is (rightly) in the recruiter's court to decide how to follow up. Last but certainly not least, thank them for their time and consideration.  Use a formal sign-off like ""Best,"" ""All the best,"" or ""Sincerely,"" and finish by typing out your full name. You don't need to sign it with a pen. In order to craft a truly compelling cover letter, you need to show that you understand what the company does and what their pain points are. And that usually entails doing more than simply reading a job description. Start by soaking up all the information you can find on the company's website and blog, and then consider drilling down into the LinkedIn and Twitter accounts of executives and employees you could end up working with. That research will help you fine-tune the messaging of your cover letter. If you follow the tips in the previous section, the cover letter you end up crafting will invariably be unique. That being said, looking at examples of successful cover letters that other jobs applicants have created can help give you ideas for improving your own letter. Remember: Writing a cover letter is easier said than done. Don't hesitate to spend a lot of time writing and editing it. Or, ask a friend or family member to read it over and give you feedback. If the recruiter does end up reading it, you'll be thankful you did.",Rachel Sprung
2016-04-19,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/using-audience-data-to-power-native-ads,Using Audience Data to Power Native Ads,"Native advertising is on the rise for publishers—and  . In recent years, media companies have been dealing with the perfect storm: industry-wide programmatic ad revenues   while  . The bottom line for these trends is that consumers are extremely picky about their online experiences. Readers want and will always want great content, but they don’t ads to interrupt their browsing experiences. That’s where native enters the picture. Rather than interrupting natural browsing patterns, media leaders can instead, connect advertisers with readers through engaging content. The end result will be a browsing experience that feels natural rather than forced or salesy. And believe it or not, the value proposition that native advertising brings to the table is about to become even better. As native advertising strategies become more refined,  . If you’re part of a marketing team at a media company, you’re likely collecting data around your audience’s browsing patterns and preferences. Why not reinvest this information into the native ad packages that you’re offering your advertisers? Stay ahead of the publishing industry curve by using the data that you’re already collecting. Here’s how you can use audience data to power your native ads: In today’s marketing context, 1:1 is the name of the game. Instead of helping your advertisers cast their nets wide, why not help them build a deeper, stronger rapport with a specific audience subset? For instance, you may be a consumer-facing publication with an equal distribution of male and female readers. A beauty company may come to your media company looking to provide education around makeup products. With this example campaign, you may think that the right approach is to target   women. But you may be ignoring the individuals who self-identify as women, even though their birth gender is male. You might also be casting your net too wide in targeting women who don’t wear makeup. Why not personalize your native ad campaign to audiences who have read make-up related content in the past, regardless of where they fall on the demographic spectrum? One of the biggest challenges that marketers face when designing a native ad campaign is ideation: choose the wrong topic, and your entire strategy will flop. Instead of relying on guesswork, use the data that you’re already collecting to better align your advertisers with their target audiences.  Start by defining the group of readers who you’re aiming to reach, and then do some research around their browsing habits. What types of headlines do they find engaging? Which stories generate the most engagement?  Align these natural sharing patterns with your advertisers’ marketing goals. Use data to choose the right topic. Let’s say that you’re working with an advertiser who is looking to drive sign-ups to a free trial from a sponsored article. Instead of casting your net wide and targeting everyone, why not serve your ad to audiences who’ve demonstrated signs of engagement in the past?  Don’t target your native ads to audiences who never read sponsored articles. Instead, focus on the readers who:  Using this data, you can connect your advertisers to audiences who are likely to convert rather than passerbyers who aren’t interested. With this level of precision, everyone wins: advertisers reach their highest value audiences, and readers only see relevant native ads. In addition to reaching your target audiences, you can optimize your reading experiences around the specific actions that you want your readers to take. For instance, you may notice that in one of your audience segments, group A is more likely to redeem an offer than group B but that group B is more likely to spend time engaging with and sharing sponsored content than group A. Why not  ? Instead of creating one-size-fits-all native ad campaigns, use your on-site marketing data to provide different types of offerings for the following types of marketing goals: You can also use your native ad units as data collection opportunities for your advertisers. Package the information you’re generating into follow-up or off-platform marketing audiences. Position your media brand as a company that supports the full marketing lifecycle in building a long-term relationship with readers. The advertising landscape moves quickly. Maximize the value of your campaigns by learning from and building upon the data that you’re gathering. Follow the progress of your campaigns, long after they’ve launched, so you understand the results that your native ads are delivering across the conversion funnel. Improve upon your efforts over time.",Greg Brown

2016-04-05,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/get-more-from-your-fundraising-events,Get More from Your Fundraising Events,"Fundraisers are great opportunities to raise money, right? Wrong—well, sort of wrong. Often hosted just a few times a year, these races, picnics, galas, and more are great opportunities for nonprofit marketers to learn more about their communities, members, and donors. Rather than chasing down your website visitors to complete sample surveys or connect with your team over the phone, you can have a good old fashioned conversation. Rule #1 is to tone down the selling. Focus on   so that you can empathize with them. Human connections are often difficult to replicate online, so it’s important to make the most out of all the face time that you have—it’s a treasure trove. And because your donors are often busy individuals, it’s rare that you’ll be able to wrangle them into a room together. Make sure that you have a good marketing and research plan in place for your next fundraising event. Here are a few tips to guide you:  As you spend time with members and donors at your fundraising events, you’ll collect immensely valuable information that can inform your marketing strategy. Where are you storing this information? The answer to this question is mission-critical. These days, companies are making huge investments in researching their audiences—something that you can do at no additional cost when you’re hosting a high-profile event. Weeks before your event, do a little due diligence on your marketing systems. Make sure that you have a unified database with  . The information that you collect from your events will ultimately need rehoming from your notebooks and brain. Personalization is one of the biggest opportunities—and biggest challenges—in marketing. The amount of data that you’ll collect at an event is unparalleled compared to what you’ll collect online and over time. Make sure that your database is flexible enough to organize this information. The best way to get started? Brainstorm a set of personalization elements that you think will make your core website experience better. Then, make sure that your database can accommodate this valuable information. At the event, focus on collecting the information that you’ve identified as ideal for your user experience. While you’ll want to keep the pitching to a minimum at your fundraiser, you should still feel comfortable ‘talking shop.’ When mingling at your fundraiser, ask your members and donors to share feedback around your marketing campaigns. Are they reading your blog posts? Do they find your one-pagers valuable? What information do they wish they could have on hand? By answering these questions, you’ll be well-positioned to build upon your marketing campaigns. Instead of generating content and messaging that are off base, you can develop a more compelling value proposition. Since you’ll be talking to donors in person, you’ll have an especially valuable opportunity to collect feedback ‘between the lines.’ Pay attention to what people   telling you during your conversations.   with a survey or request for feedback is a great way to make sure no attendee information falls through the cracks.  In a day and age when automated marketing campaigns are the norm, your company needs an extra edge to stand out.  Why not follow up with the donors that you ended up meeting in person? Take initial steps to build a lasting, long-term relationship with each person: show that your organization cares. When it comes to marketing, never underestimate the value of a personal touch. When the people behind your organization are present and visible, your audiences will take notice. Stuck on the messaging for your next ad campaign? Looking for case study ideas? Next time you host a fundraiser, make sure to identify these goals ahead of time. As you’re well-aware, marketing moves at a million miles per hour. If you want these same donors to come back next year, you’ll want to start your event planning process now. Look for in-depth stories. Pay attention to the conversations that elicit the most emotions from your donors. Figure out what you can do better next time. Effective marketing campaigns are getting tougher to develop—especially if your organization is budget-strapped and lacking a seven figure marketing budget. Stop trying to compete with more dollars: improve your value proposition instead. Make the most out of every donor touchpoint—build lasting, impactful relationships.",Nick Cholakis
2016-04-06,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-schools-can-use-segmentation-to-increase-enrollment-rates,How Schools Can Use Segmentation to Increase Enrollment Rates,"Chances are thousands of prospective students and parents visit your website each year. Perhaps hundreds of them fill out a form to learn more about applying to your school. Great - now you can market to them. But, not all prospective students are the same and nor should your emails be that way.  your click through rate (CTR) is higher when using the recipient's first name in the subject line versus not using the first name. And CTR is also higher when using the recipient's company name in the subject line over no company mention. Segmenting your email list is a fundamental building block of personalization. Think of all those parents, school counselors, graduating students, students just starting to look around – they all need to be identified and segmented into separate email groups so you email them the content most relevant to them. The first step in segmentation is know who you're talking to. As the marketing cliché goes, sending a vegetarian a coupon for a free meat-lovers pizza is no way to build trust with your prospect. Effective segmentation means tracking online behaviors and designing sign-up forms on your offers that collect the information most valuable to you. Identify the key distinctions  . What are some simple questions you can ask so you can put the lead in their proper persona bucket? You don't have to be coy. Your form can include a dropdown question:  When you analyze your distinguishing persona characteristics, prioritize them. You can't ask for all the information you want at once. Knowing which contacts in your database are potential future students, or people in the position to influence the decision of a potential future student, is a basic distinction. Same with knowing what programs are most interesting to your prospect or when they plan to enroll.  But from there, consider your school's priorities. For instance, are you looking for a more geographically diverse student body? Or maybe you want to enroll local high school juniors in an advanced placement program. Also consider the niches of content you have available to send. If you have a report on graduation employment rates and articles of curated links to academic journal and press accounts of your school's achievements – wouldn't it be valuable to know what motivates a prospective student's school choice?  You're not going to send your educational resource guide for returning military personnel to everyone, right? Segmentation is only as valuable as the information you're collecting about leads. There's much discussion on how much information people are willing to give online. Fortunately, you don't need to collect all the information you want from a prospect on the first offer form. In fact, if you take that approach, chances are good that won't get many sign-ups.  Instead, you can use   so you can add one or two new fields for them to fill out. Knowing to whom you're talking is one part of segmentation. From there, let's cross-slice this intel with what you know about where a lead is in their enrollment journey.  The   may be most challenging for segmentation, since by definition you're looking for people who haven't identified themselves to you yet. That doesn't mean you can't segment during this phase. Do you want to target teens who are interested in STEM subjects? Create some social media memes or .gifs with the right hash tags and links back to STEM-related content on your school's blog or website.  You can use persona information such as where they get information, what devices they're using to access content, what questions they have about how to look for a school or figure out what kind of school makes sense for them. Once a lead gets into your database, you can refine which segments they fit in as you collect more information about them. As people move into  , their questions are shifting to what can   offer them. This is the time you can send those prospects you've identified as returning veterans invitations to a meet-up with current soldier-students on campus. Or you can send an offer to talk with a financial aid counselor to someone who downloaded a financial aid guide. Once a prospect gets into the decision stage, you want to have data on what will motivate their decision to select one school from among their options. You can't push out the most compelling content to a prospective student in this final stage without understanding what's going to motivate their decision. Let's go back to those student personas. Let's say you've got a list of prospective students (or their parents) who have downloaded applications, but haven't submitted them. Your marketing system is set up to set a ""nudge"" email at the 15-day mark. Will they be motivated by the same email? Probably not. Instead, you can send: Each email will contain a call to action regarding submitting their application. However, the segmented content communicates information genuinely valuable to each persona's motivational priorities, which boosts their perception of your school as a good fit for them. As you can see, having the data about leads so you segment them accurately is only half the battle. The other half is having the content that speaks to these personas in order to engage with them effectively. As you create your list segments, that's a great time to uncover and address any content gaps you may have. That way you can be sure each persona segment has the content they need for whatever stage of their decision journey they're in.",David Ross

2016-04-05,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/successful-dropouts,From Steve Jobs to Jay Z: 6 Successful People Who Dropped Out of School (And Why),"""Never let schooling interfere with the tech startup you're running out of your dorm room."" - Mark Twain Admittedly I may have taken a few artistic liberties with the Mark Twain quote above, but the underlying sentiment remains: When it comes to learning -- to amassing the knowledge you need to be successful in life -- formal education isn't always the best option. Of course, there's no ignoring the evidence to the contrary: The overwhelming majority of billion-dollar companies were founded by people who not only earned college degrees, but who earned them from selective schools. So the point of this post, to be clear, isn't to convince folks to drop out of school. It's simply to highlight some of the exceptional cases where taking a less traditional route ended up paying off big. Bill Gates applied to just three colleges after graduating from high school: Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.  He was accepted to all three. In the end, it was Harvard's campus that Gates chose to stroll onto in the fall of 1973. But within a couple years, earning a degree from one of the most prestigious universities in the world would take a back seat to another opportunity: Creating a programming language (Altair BASIC) for one of the world's first personal computers, the Altair 8800. Originally working out of his Harvard dorm room, Gates would formalize his partnership with long-time friend Paul Allen in 1975 under the banner ""Micro-soft."" The two then set up shop in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which was where their first customer -- Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), maker of the Altair 8800 -- was located. And while Gates did initially try to balance academics with business, and would travel back to Harvard to take classes, the business inevitably started taking up more and more of his time. (He was a CEO, after all.) So Gates made the decision to drop out of school for good. . And you might be surprised to learn that he also has a Harvard degree: Gates   from the school in 2007. Unlike Bill Gates, who dropped out of college so he could run a company, Steve Jobs dropped out of college so he could ... well ... go to college. Allow me to explain. Having found the required classes on his schedule too boring to bear, Jobs dropped out of Reed College just six months into his freshman year so he could drop in on the classes that he was actually interested in -- like Shakespeare, dance, and calligraphy. That calligraphy course,  , helped inspire him to incorporate multiple typefaces into the Macintosh. In that same speech, Jobs mentioned another reason why he dropped out of college: He felt bad for spending his parents' money on an education that he didn't really see the value in. And when you consider that Jobs went on to create what is now (at the time of this writing)  , I think it's safe to say it all worked out OK. Three years after Steve Jobs gave Stanford's commencement speech, another college-dropout-turned-billionaire would take the stage: Oprah Winfrey. , the Queen of Talk recalled how she started working in TV at the age of 19 while she was a sophomore at Tennessee State University. ""I was the only television anchor person that had an 11 o'clock curfew doing the 10 o'clock news,"" she commented, before continuing, ""Seriously, my dad was like, 'Well, that news is over at 10:30. Be home by 11.'"" By the time her senior year rolled around, Winfrey's TV career was looking promising. So promising, in fact, that instead of sticking around to complete the one credit she needed to graduate, Oprah dropped out of college. A year later, at the age of 22, Winfrey was co-anchoring the 6 o'clock news in Baltimore. Needless to stay, Winfrey's decision to drop out paid off big.  . But there was one person in Winfrey's life who could never come to terms with her not finishing college: Her father. As Winfrey recalled in the Stanford speech ... In then end, Winfrey's dad would prove to be the winner of that argument. In 1987, Winfrey went back to Tennessee State University and completed her degree. Mark Zuckerberg holds an interesting spot on this list, as he's one of the few college dropout success stories who actually planned on going back to school.  , the Facebook co-founder and CEO recalled how he had been upfront with investor Peter Thiel about not wanting to drop out of Harvard. Thiel didn't believe him. In fact, Zuckerberg's own family didn't believe him -- they all thought he would drop out. As Zuckerberg commented during that same talk back in 2012: For Zuckerberg, at least in the early days, Facebook was just a hobby. Whereas Gates knew he was onto something big (e.g., consumer software) when he started running Microsoft out of his Harvard dorm room, Zuckerberg was a bit more skeptical when he launched the first iteration of Facebook. He even had a back up plan if this ""hobby"" didn't work out:  Of course, as Facebook began growing like wildfire,  , Zuckerberg inevitably realized that this side project of his had some serious potential. So in the fall of 2005, Zuckerberg left Harvard to focus on Facebook full-time. He'd return to Harvard a year later ... to recruit engineers. While Jay Z is perhaps best known as a rapper, he's also an accomplished entrepreneur. From founding his own record label (Roc-A-Fella) and talent agency (Roc Nation), to launching a clothing line (Rocawear), to re-launching a music streaming service (Tidal), Jay Z a.k.a. Shawn Carter has a diverse business portfolio. Something else you might not have known about Jay Z: He never finished high school. The Brooklyn native dropped out to focus on his job at the time ... dealing drugs.  , drug dealing ended up teaching him some valuable business skills, like budgeting. But at the same time, he always knew it wasn't a viable path forward: Fortunately for Jay Z, he had an exit strategy: Music.",Erik Devaney

Thankfully, there are plenty of email marketing geeks out there (ourselves included) that   think all of that's kind of fun. But these less glamorous aspects of email marketing -- though critical to your campaign's success -- don't paint the entire picture of what amazing email marketing really is. There are brands out there that have   figured out how to create emails that are pretty darn beautiful. While plain text or bare-bones emails can still be extremely effective, sometimes you want to amaze your subscribers with creative, captivating, or delightfully understated email design. If you're looking to dabble in something a little more adventurous for your next email marketing campaign, check out the examples below for inspiration. In design, red and yellow serve as  . While red is known to convey power or passion, yellow  Color aside, t lean divides to separate these blocks, while incorporating different textures -- like that crumpled paper -- to create a really compelling experience. This newsletter from Starbucks covers a lot of information: instructions for the pour-over method, a call-to-action to shop for a new product, recipes for summer floats, and so on. To make this more easily scannable, the folks at Starbucks paired these short descriptions with high quality images. (You can practically hear the coffee being poured over ice in the first image.) Like the Collaborative Fund example, they also used clear, horizontal divides to separate each topic. In addition, we really like how they incorporated the Pinterest logo and the Instagram logo alongside two of the calls-to-action. These logos support the text by setting the recipient's expectation up front. In other words, they know that clicking through to browse more recipes will ultimately direct them to Pinterest.  Here's a much more concise email from InVision, which includes a clean design and an eye-catching color. Thanks to that darker blue background, both the call-to-action and the white box near the bottom of the email really command attention.  Additionally, the fanned out product images help the recipient understand what the announcement entails before diving into the explainer copy.  This email from GrubHub is a great example of product promotion ... because it doesn't sound or feel like product promotion at all. Instead of saying, ""Hey, you like food. You should order it using our service!"", the email tells a story with the help of a really cool piece of interactive content: an ""Eat Map."" (See what they did there?) We especially love the colorful GIF they used to promote the piece of content, as it really commands the recipient's attention. (Want to learn how to create a GIF using Photoshop?  .)   We love this simple welcome email from Handy. The color scheme is  There's a nice balance between text and visuals here, and the tile design makes it easy to skim through. Finally, we love that they used   to represent their brand, which makes them more genuine and lovable from a consumer perspective. You might expect a beautiful email from a company that's announcing an email design conference -- and Litmus doesn't disappoint. The email starts out with a bold burst of color, which grabs readers' attention. Below this, you'll find a clean design that includes concise copy, whimsical illustrations, and a great use of white space. At the bottom of the email, you'll see a live Twitter feed showing tweets that use the conference's official hashtag. That social engagement factor is a really cool touch that we're willing to bet increased engagement, while simultaneously informing folks about how to stay connected at the event.  As marketers, we know that charts and graphs can serve as an  . But what about incorporating graphs into emails?  This email design from Uber skillfully demonstrates the power of data visualization through the use of simple graphs. Rather than relying on words to explain their lowered rates, Uber whipped up a few comparative visuals to do the job. Thanks to the bright blue color choice, it's easy for recipients to understand how the rates have shifted in just a quick glance.  Here's a product promotion email Cuyana sent to people who signed up for a new product's ""early access"" list. The email is centered entirely around showcasing the new product, but in this case, that's exactly what the folks who opted in to the ""early access"" list were looking for. The design of the email is clean and sophisticated, thanks to a brilliant use of negative space and attractive fonts. This approach is very true-to-brand for a women's apparel and accessories company. We love the use of consistent coloring -- especially the signature orange hue they chose for the call-to-action button at the bottom. (  This is an example of an email made using HubSpot.   from our library.) Sometimes, words can be overrated. Why not let a picture tell the story for you? That's what J.Crew did in this email, anyway. The email is promoting a sale, but you wouldn't know it right away: All you see is the copy, ""This is worth the scroll,"" along with a very long (and very scroll-worthy), high-definition picture of an ice cream cone. Yum.  If you make it to the bottom, you'll notice that the tip of the ice cream cone acts like a directional arrow, pointing recipients toward the call-to-action.  This holiday email from Apple balances white space with product displays to create a really interesting experience. While the products all share a similar color scheme, what's really compelling is their positioning. By strategically arranging the products, Apple was able to create visual patterns that alternate throughout the email.    In the ecommerce world, the quality of visuals in your emails can have a huge impact on whether recipients stick around to look through the whole email, or quickly hit the ""delete"" button. This email from Shwood & Stanley places a big emphasis on those high-quality visuals. We especially love the textured backgrounds, as well as the ways in which they play with list and shadows. For seasonal emails like this one from Harry's, you might consider  . To promote their winter gift set, the folks at Harry's cooled down their color scheme with traditional winter colors like green, blue, and brown. They also struck a nice balance between text and visuals, and helped to make their email easier to skim by using a simple tile design. Not to mention, those bright red calls-to-action look pretty clickable ... wouldn't you agree?",Lindsay Kolowich

Plus, it's a great way for businesses to humanize their brand, recruit future employees, showcase their product and content, and delight and engage customers. One particularly great thing about Instagram is that it isn't just for still photography. There's a lot of directions to go with each post, whether it's posting shots from behind-the-scenes, videos, animated GIFs, holiday-themed content, contests and giveaways, reposts of followers and employees ... the list goes on. Check out these 18 ideas for videos, photos, and other content you can post on Instagram. (And for more inspiration,  .) Instagram is a great platform for humanizing your brand, and giving your audience a sneak peek at what goes on behind the scenes is one way to do that. It's also a good way to show followers what it's like to work there, which is great for your recruiting efforts. Here's an example from the Boston Red Sox, showing what batting practice looks like close-up (with a really cool, fish-eye shot to boot). And here's one from a small brewery in Somerville, Massachusetts called Aeronaut Brewing. We love how this one shares the faces behind the brand, giving followers the chance to get to know who's on the inside. Some of the best photos on brands' Instagram accounts are curated from fans and followers. (In fact, FedEx's Instagram feed is  .) Check out the posts people have tagged you in, and if you love them, consider reposting them to your own followers. Not only does it make the original poster feel good, it also shows everyone that you're listening to your fans. Just be sure the photos you're reposting are really high quality, and that you @-mention the original poster in your caption. What do great examples of repost images and captions look like? Here's one from the folks at ASOS. Take note of how they write the caption: They write an entirely new caption, which includes a tidbit on how their followers can get featured on their Instagram page (by using the hashtag #AsSeenOnMe). Then, they credit the original poster using the camera emoji and the poster's username. And here are two painfully cute reposts from Cisco Brewers in Nantucket. Take note of how  write the captions, which is different from the way ASOS does it: First, they quote the original caption, followed by the camera emoji and the original poster's username. Then, they add their own hashtags, like #brewerydogs.   To repost a photo on Instagram, you can simply screenshot the photo and crop it. Or, you can use a reposting app like  , which is my personal favorite. There's a free version with (pretty inconspicuous) ads. Some people poke fun at the number of quotes out there on Instagram. But if you post them sparingly, they actually tend to encourage a lot of engagement. If the post speaks to your audience, people love to share them and tag their friends in the comments. Quotes are also a great opportunity to share the types of things your brand stands for, whether it's spiritual, inspiring, funny, or something else. To create a quote image, you'll want to download an app that lets you upload a photo and overlay it with text. Here are some good ones: Here are a few examples of quotes done well, starting with this one from TheSkimm. The key to this post's success is that it's hilarious to their specific audience -- and it also shows that the quote itself doesn't have to be fancy to delight people. Here's a more beautifully designed quote from activewear brand Lorna Jane, which carries an empowering message from their founder:     Want to play around with words and images? I found this really cool, $2 app called   that lets you turn your pictures into images  instead of just adding words on top of photos. Another cool way to overlay text on an image is by posting a statistic that resonates with your audience. Try using statistics from your own research, or finding some that are relevant to your message, your value proposition, and so on. ( .) Here's an example from Quarter For Your Crisis, a company with the mission of helping millennials reconnect with themselves, their faith, and their world. Here's another one from the meditation app Headspace, with a simple text box overlaying a colored, nondescript background. Is something cool happening in the world or the country where your target market lives? A specific holiday? National Puppy Day? Get in on the action by posting something delightful. Remember to use good judgment when newsjacking -- the last thing you want to do is publish inaccurate information or offend anyone. What are some examples of delightful, timely posts? Here's one from a Mediterranean restaurant called Cava Mezze Grill to celebrate Opening Day for baseball, as all of their locations are in the United States. And here's a fun example from Starbucks for National Croissant Day. If you can make your followers laugh, they'll likely enjoy your photo -- and may even share it with others. After all, sometimes the most memorable photos are the ones that make us laugh. ( Since people tend to be happier on Fridays,   posting funny or upbeat content to match your audience's mood.) Try posting photos and images that you think will make your own audience laugh, like Oreo did with this fake text message conversation with ""Milk."" Here's another example from BuzzFeed Parents, which goes to show how simple a super shareable post can be. And in this one from Pabst Blue Ribbon. All they did was dress up a dog in a hilarious outfit and then put a Pabst beer can in front of him ... and it worked like a charm. Have any artists on your team? One way to stand out in a sea of images is to post a really cool, compelling illustration. They don't even have to be super fancy -- check out this simple, black-and-white example from Oreo: Here's a more complex one from Pabst Blue Ribbon: Beautiful images are critical to your marketing strategy because they tell a story and draw people in. In fact,  So if you're creating a piece of compelling written content like a recipe, a report, or a blog post, why not use a visual platform like Instagram to promote it? Simply pair an interesting and relevant image with a caption that promotes the content, and then ask people to follow the link in your bio. (Again,  .) Here's an example from Staples, promoting a set of free, printable holiday-themed planners and gift tags: And here's an example from Nature's Path Organic, which shows off the finished product of a recipe that's linked to in their bio: Instagram isn't the place to be publishing product-centric posts every single day -- but that doesn't mean you can't use it to showcase products every once in a while.   on social media: 80% of the content you post to social media should be helpful and valuable to your audience, and 20% can be self-promotional. For Instagram, it's even more important to make that promotional content fun, compelling, and lovable. To highlight a specific product, post a picture or video about it, and then send people to the (trackable) link in your bio. Here's one example from the online clothing company ASOS. (Check out how casual and cool the caption is.) Here's another one from Frank Body, which uses an image and some humor in the caption to pique followers' interest in the product without being overly promotional. For the past few years, most of the social media world has been moving toward emphasizing video. In fact, by midway through 2015,   -- up 74% from 2014, and up a whopping 844% since 2012. It took Instagram a while to come around to video, but   they're rolling out the capability for users to record and upload videos up to 60 seconds long (whereas the max was 15 seconds previously). When executed well, videos are a great way for your Instagram content to stand out in the feed. You can either record a video from scratch (including  ), or you can upload a new video from your phone's library the same way you'd upload a normal photo.  By default, every Instagram video will start playing without sound -- after which viewers can choose whether or not to turn the sound on. Because of this, you'll either need to upload videos that don't  sound to be well understood, or you'll need to entice people to turn the sound in the first second or two. Here's a great video from Purina that delights viewers with some cute puppy love. Want to use video to stand out from the crowd while also solving for your followers' short attention spans? Try  . Hyperlapse is a free app by Instagram that condenses videos into brief, moving, hyper-speed videos. The videos end up looking pretty cool thanks to built-in stabilization technology that lets you film these time lapse videos without having to keep your hands still. (Want to make your own?  ) Here's one of my favorite examples, which comes from Starbucks. GIFs are everywhere nowadays, and people love them because they help accurately convey ideas, messages, thoughts, and feelings in a snackable (and often laughable) way. On Instagram, you can upload a GIF just like you would a video ( ). Check out the examples of GIFs on Instagram below for some inspiration. (And to create your own animated GIF using Photoshop,  .) Here's an example from Staples. And one from Starbucks. Trying to support the launch of a new product? Contests are one of the best ways to expand your reach and engage your community on Instagram. The network doesn't make it easy to capture leads and information from your followers, but a contest or giveaway is one way to do it. Just be sure to call your followers to take action by using the space in your caption to explain the contest and even guide them to a link in your bio. (  Be sure to make that link trackable so you can see how much traffic your Instagram post is driving. Learn how to add a trackable link to your Instagram bio  .) There are many, many different types of contests you can post on Instagram. Here are a few ideas, starting with the one below from Social Print Studio. Their call-to-action asks for comments on the post, from which they'll choose winners. Here's one from Rent the Runway asking people to enter a contest by following the link in their bio. Not many brands are using this tactic, but I've always found it to be a really cool, unique user experience. Not to mention, it's also a clever way to get users to go to your business' account page. You see, most of your followers won't be looking at your Instagram photos from your account page, as they'll typically look at them in their Instagram feed. But when I started scrolling through the images below from Cava Mezze Grill in my feed, it took me a second to figure out what was happening. I kept seeing snippets of ""New York,"" which had a cool teaser affect. This enticed me to go to Cava Mezze Grill's main account page, where I could see the full picture. While you technically  tag friends in posts on Facebook and Twitter, it happens most regularly on Instagram. There's a culture around tagging your friends if you see a post that resonates with you or reminds you of that person. This helps you both increase engagement and broaden your reach. If you want to encourage your followers to share the post with others, sometimes all you've got to do is ask. In the caption, include a call-to-action asking people to tag their friends, and give them a prompt to do so. For example, in the post below from Rent the Runway, they ask followers to ""Tag your BFF!"" In our post below from HubSpot, we asked followers to tag their office coffee buddy.   In this cute video from Headspace, they asked followers to tag someone they love to help celebrate Valentine's Day. Similar to asking your followers to tag a friend, you can also simply ask them to ""double-tap,"" which is how your followers can Like your photo or video. The common language for an ask like this is: ""Double-tap if..."" In the example below from Rent the Runway, they ask followers to double-tap if they want to wear the dress from the photo to their next wedding, which is a fun way to engage their fans. Reposting your employees is an awesome way to showcase what happens behind the scenes at your company, while really helping your followers ""bond"" with the people who work there. For example, the folks behind the Boston Red Sox's ""Fenway Park"" account often reposts photos and videos from their grounds crew. ASOS has a really cool approach: They repost Instagram content from their individual stylists, who function as brand lifestyle ambassadors with accounts specifically associated with ASOS, like   and  . While the main ASOS account posts mostly their own content, they often repost from their stylists, like in the image below. Cross promotion of other social media accounts on Instagram is a great way to let your Instagram followers know where else on social media they can find you. That way, you can get your Instagram followers to become your followers on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and so on. Pro Tip: If you have goals around increasing your following on Snapchat, post a picture of your  . A Snapcode is an image that looks like the Snapchat logo, but with a pattern of dots. To follow you on Snapchat, all users will have to do to is open the Snapchat app, take a photo of your Snapcode, and tap their screen. Here's an example from HubSpot's Instagram account. Finally, let your followers know you're hiring every once in a while by posting a simple call-to-action on your Instagram page, including a trackable link to your jobs page in your bio. Here's an example of a ""we're hiring"" post from WeWork: And here's a delightful one from Rent the Runway.",Lindsay Kolowich
2016-04-06,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/reasons-small-business-owners-adopt-ecommerce,5 Reasons Small Business Owners Adopt Ecommerce,"You can set your small business apart in several ways, from your brand to the quality of your products. Still, even if you’re the top small business in your city, your audience is limited. How can you grow beyond the borders of your town?  Now you’re probably considering an ecommerce option for your company. As with starting a business, adding online shopping is a whole new endeavor. Sure, you have your brand and your products taken care of, but there are a million new tasks to complete and even more things to learn. Why should you take the plunge? We touched on the potential for a larger customer base, but it’s important to realize just how large that base might become. With excellent inbound techniques, including stellar SEO, and a robust CMS, a small business could grow into a global powerhouse. Scaling for growth is important for small businesses that turn to ecommerce models, because the potential reach for online shops is unlimited. While there is never the promise your company will grow to Amazon-like greatness, the possibility is always there. The number of online shoppers has increased sharply within the past few years. Just three years ago,   completed their holiday shopping online. Last Christmas, that number jumped to 61%. Keep in mind, that’s only holiday shoppers that did all or most of their shopping online. If we study the number of people who’ve made at least one online purchase, the percentage would skyrocket.   who prefer stores will investigate prices and brands online before buying. A large percentage of shoppers,  , actually prefer local business who offer online shopping. These buyers want to find something unique that’s not available anywhere else, but they still want the convenience of online buying. Others like to buy online and pick up at their local retailer. Expanding your business could mean opening more retail spaces, which brings its own set of challenges and costs. Staff, rental, and inventory equals a lot of overhead. An online presence can help expand beyond your one location without the addition of staff or retail space. In addition, tax regulations are different for each state, so sales taxes and income taxes, while tricky, could add up to less than physical stores might incur.  Marketing and SEO play a huge part in growing an online presence. Think about it: you already provide better products and services than the big guys. Why wouldn’t a buyer choose you over the local chain mega-mart? Right now, they won’t choose you because they can’t find you. If they could find you… Well, you’d have those buyers locked down.  If you’re still on the fence, investigate the possibilities. There really is no better way to grow your small business into a true force of retail than opening an e-tail branch to serve your buyers’ needs.",Ted Ammon

2016-04-07,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-declining-organic-reach,Why Don't My Facebook Fans See My Posts? The Decline of Organic Facebook Reach,"If you've been managing a Facebook Page over the past few years, you've likely noticed a drop in how many of your fans have been viewing and interacting with your organic posts. This decline in organic Facebook reach came to a head in 2014, when marketers started picking up on (and complaining about) the situation in droves, prompting a response from Facebook's VP of Advertising Technology, Brian Boland. ""Over the past few months, I’ve read articles and answered questions from many people who are concerned about declines in organic reach for their Facebook Pages,""  . He continued, ""My colleagues and I at Facebook understand that this has been a pain point for many businesses, and we’re committed to helping you understand what’s driving this change ... "" The two main reasons Boland cited for the organic reach decline? First, there's simply too much content being published on Facebook, making visibility in the News Feed increasingly competitive. Second, Facebook is deliberately trying to show people the content that is most relevant to them, as opposed to surfacing all the content available. The good news in all of this is that there's a lot you can do to counteract these changes, like being more selective about what you publish and/or throwing some money behind your posts (a.k.a. ""boosting"" them). Before we dive deeper into how you can improve your Facebook Page's organic reach, let's explore exactly what happened during the Great Organic Reach Decline of 2014, and how Facebook decides what content gets surfaced nowadays.  as ""how many people you can reach for free on Facebook by posting to your Page."" Prior to 2012, that number used to be much, much higher than it is now. From the moment “Fan Pages” launched in 2007, anyone could create a Page for their company or organization, start collecting fans, and post unlimited messages to their fan bases with the assumption that they would see those messages. But when 2012 rolled around, Page managers learned that only a fraction of their Facebook fans --  -- were seeing their Page posts in their News Feeds. And that fraction has only gotten smaller and smaller since.   found that between February 2012 and March 2014, organic reach for the average Facebook Page dropped from 16% to 6.5%.  , meanwhile, suggests that for Pages with more than 500,000 Likes, organic reach could be as low as 2%. Based on the figures above, that means a Page with 10,000 fans could expect just 650 of them to actually see that Page's posts in their News Feeds. For a Page with 1 million fans, about 20,000 would end up seeing posts (based on the 2% figure). Fewer people seeing your Page's organic posts on Facebook means fewer clicks, comments, and shares. And having fewer of   interactions means fewer conversions, leads, and customers. Understandably, this has annoyed the crap out of many-a Facebook Page manager. So why would Facebook decide to decrease organic post visibility in the first place? I already touched on Facebook's official response to this question in the introduction: There are simply too many Pages producing too much content for too many fans, which means competition for visibility on the News Feed is high. What's more, Facebook is trying to make sure people are only seeing   content -- the stuff that is relevant to them.  But many in the marketing world suspect that Facebook had (and still has) an ulterior motive: To get people to start spending more on ads. As Facebook has evolved into more of a paid marketing platform than an organic one, Page managers are realizing they’re now expected to pay for ads yet again to reach those newly acquired Fans, even if those Fans have seemingly elected to see a brand’s posts by liking their Page in the first place. In  , James Del (who was the head of Gawker’s content studio at the time) summed up the general sentiment: Of course, Facebook has denied that this is the case. Boland even had a section in   titled, ""Is organic reach dropping because Facebook is trying to make more money?"" Boland's response: From Facebook's perspective, it’s simply not an ideal user experience to flood the News Feed with posts just because a Page has lots of Likes and is publishing prolifically. Nowadays, Facebook is encouraging marketers to look at their fan bases as a way to make paid advertising more effective rather than using it as a free broadcast channel. Additionally, Facebook says you should assume organic reach will eventually  . So, if you really want to reach your target audience on Facebook, you’ll need to supplement your organic efforts with some paid advertising. Additionally, Facebook advises marketers to expect things to keep changing, and often times  . Facebook has never been stagnant in terms of innovation, so no marketer can figure out a formula and then stick with it forever. That being said, knowing how Facebook currently surfaces organic content in the News Feed can be helpful for understanding the broader Facebook marketing ecosystem. When Facebook first launched News Feed back in 2006, the algorithm was pretty basic. Different post formats were assigned different point values -- so a post with just text might be worth one point, while a post with a link in it might be worth two points, and so on. By multiplying the post format point value by the number of people interacting with a given post, Facebook could generate a ranking system for determining the order in which posts would appear. As the years rolled on, the News Feed algorithm evolved to factor in the recency of posts, as well as the relationship between the person doing the posting and the person interacting with said post. This iteration of the algorithm was known as EdgeRank. But in 2011, Facebook abandoned EdgeRank for a more complex algorithm that incorporates machine learning. That machine learning-based algorithm is what's responsible for surfacing content on your News Feed today. Unlike its predecessors, which assigned generic point values to post formats, the current algorithm adapts to individual user preferences. So, for example, if you never, ever, interact with photos in your News Feed, Facebook's algorithm will pick up on that and show you fewer photos over time. Ultimately, there are thousands of factors that inform Facebook's algorithm, which range from using trigger words that indicate important events (e.g., ""congratulations"") to whether or not you've actually clicked a link in a post before liking it. Facebook's end goal here is to have its algorithm match News Feed content to the individual needs and interests of each and every user.  : Now that you've got a better understanding of how Facebook surfaces content, let's explore some tips for dealing with the decline in organic Page reach. Marketers have to switch gears from untargeted, frequent publishing to targeted, selective publishing. The goal is no longer to spray and pray -- it’s to get as much interaction from a single post as possible. Each post published to a brand Page can be targeted to a specific audience regardless of whether or not it’s sponsored, which may improve overall interaction with that post among other people who are likely to find it more interesting and relevant.  This can be as simple as adding a reminder to ""Please Like and share"" at the end of your posts. Since the only constant with Facebook (and the larger digital media landscape) is change, it’s always safest to focus on the digital   -- your website and blog. Spend the vast majority of your effort creating content (blog posts and long-form content such as ebooks, case studies, or videos) that will continue to garner inbound traffic, leads, and customers long after they’re first created. If you have time and budget, share those assets to Facebook for additional reach. If you’re going to pay-to-play, get your targeting right. Once you’ve built an audience of relevant fans, focus on advertising the content assets you’ve created -- blog posts, ebooks, etc. -- and use ads to amplify them to targeted users. Remember: It’s likely only a matter of time before organic reach hits zero, so you might as well hone your paid strategy now, which brings me to one final recommendation ... Facebook’s targeting capabilities have gotten considerably better over the past few years. You can now pay to reach your ideal persona based on demographics, interests, web behavior, and more. Additionally, there are a bunch of tools and features that can help you maximize the effectiveness of your campaigns, including ...

2016-04-08,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/completion-bias-productivity,The One Cognitive Bias That Could Be Derailing Your Productivity,"""Learn by doing."" It's a theory of productivity we're taught at a very young age, from the moment our parents make us sit down and practice the piano. Because practice makes perfect, right? Years later, the lesson doesn't change. We're taught time and time again that productivity equals practice, output, and action. That's why, in our working lives, we're often focused on activity. What can we do right now that we can get done pretty quickly? It can be easier for us to feel like we're making progress and being productive when we have completed actions to show for it, no matter how menial those actions are. Checking the boxes just feels so  That, my friends, is called ""completion bias"" -- and it may be preventing you from tackling your most important tasks and projects. You know that feeling of pleasure you get when you cross something off your to-do list? For many of us, that's a feeling we seek out multiple times a day. I'd been lying if I said I didn't add tasks to my to-do list after I'd already completed them just so I could check them off. Unfortunately, that pleasure can get us into trouble when it comes to productivity. Enter  ""Completing simple tasks, such as answering emails or posting updates on your Twitter account, takes little time and allows you to check off items on your to-do list,""  , a Harvard Business School professor who's been studying completion bias and its affects on productivity at work with Bradley Staats of the UNC's Kenan-Flagler Business School. The reason we lean toward those easier tasks is thanks in part to the psychological reward we feel when we complete things, and also in part thanks our natural bias for action. Completing a task is an easy way to show tangible progress, whether it's to your boss, to your coworkers, or to yourself. But in many circumstances, that can really backfire. In  , they looked at the completion bias of physicians in the emergency department (ED) of a busy hospital, where patients arrive without appointments. ""Using data from about 43,000 distinct patient encounters, we found that physicians exhibit a bias toward completing easy tasks when confronted with an increased workload due to an increase in the number of arriving At first, this might seem like a pretty solid strategy. By focusing on these less-sick patients, a doctor is ""more productive"" because these patients don't stay in the ED as long. But, according to Gino and Staats, there are at least two problems with this approach: How does this relate to an office setting? Think about the last time you were faced with a to-do list and decided to chip away at the smaller tasks first. For example, maybe you chose to spend the first two hours of your morning responding to mundane emails and ended up waiting until late morning to start on your most important to-do list item of the day. By the time you start working on that important item, you've already expended precious energy and willpower, which   that depletes throughout the day. In other words, you shouldn't always let the size of a task inform your prioritization strategy. Instead, try focusing on pertinence first.  , an award-winning psychology researcher, showed that this is more likely to happen before we start working on a big project. In an attempt to simulate real, productive work, our brains tend to focus on small, mindless tasks. So if you've ever thought the night before a big presentation was the best time to clean your room, respond to your friend's son's girlfriend's career question email, and tackle the pilot of   well ... that's why. In theory, it should be easy to fight the urge to tackle those smaller tasks. Just recognize which tasks are the most important, and prioritize them, already! But we all know that's easier said than done. Planning and triaging is one effective way to tackle our natural tendency for instant gratification. The key is creating a to-do list, and then spending some time   Go through each item on your list and rank them based on impact and effort. Then, rewrite your to-do list in order of importance. The last part of this exercise is the most important one:  That's going to be the item you want to start working on as soon as possible in the day. If you feel your natural completion bias surfacing -- or if you feel like you're just plain procrastinating -- catch yourself. The more self-aware you are, the more important items you'll get done. If time-sensitive tasks surface that need to take priority over that one single item you selected, do your best to get them done as quickly as possible. Then, refocus your attention back to the task at hand.  ""most important item"" is so complex that it'll take more than that day to complete, try HubSpot Co-Founder and CTO   he likes to ""'deconstruct' the large problem at hand into smaller, bite-sized chunks. Each of the individual, smaller things seem surmountable on their own, and it calms [him] to know that if [he] conquered all of those small things, [he's] essentially conquered the big thing."" Then, it's time to take a deep breath, hunker down, and just get started.",Lindsay Kolowich
2016-04-07,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inbound-sales-methodology-and-certification,Inbound Isn't Just for Marketing: Introducing HubSpot's Inbound Sales Methodology & Certification,"I’m a sales geek. I grew up in my career through the sales ranks. You see, the sales playbook I used back in 1996 worked like a charm. In fact, I largely built my entire career off getting good at it.   Well, that playbook doesn’t work anymore. Why? Good question. I think there are three major shifts that are changing everything for the sales professional of 2016 ... Back in 1996, everyone had phones on their desks ... but none of those phones had caller ID. Back then, I spent   Tuesday cold calling. I had a good connect rate, and I filled my funnel that way.   In 2016, far fewer people have phones on their desks. At HubSpot, I sit with the marketing department. Out of the 40 people that sit in my wing of the office, only four of them have phones on their desks -- including executives. And for the four that have phones, every one of them has caller ID. If they don't recognize the number, I'd suspect they don't answer. Call me crazy, but I think  prospecting is dead. Back in 1996, I had everything I needed to help my prospects make a decision: pricing sheets, product specs, connections with other customers, connections with the executives in my company, and so on. Every time I gave them a piece of information, I leveraged it to gain more control in the account.   In 2016, the prospect has ALL of that information -- from my website, from LinkedIn, from Quora ... the list goes on.  Call me crazy, but I think  account control is dead. Back in 1996, we lived in a ""buyer beware"" world. I used to sell a license to a software In 2016, we live in a ""seller beware"" world. These days, software is primarily sold as a subscription. If the buyer isn't satisfied after a period of time, they just stop paying.  As many businesses and industries move to a subscription model, we're beginning to see a shift in the burden of success -- from the buyer to the seller. And if the buyer has been misled, or the product is not good, there are an unlimited number of channels the buyer can use to express their dissatisfaction -- G2Crowd, Facebook, Twitter, etc. So now what? I've talked to a lot of companies, and my sense is that many of them still use a playbook that is awfully similar to the one I used back in 1996. I think it’s high time for a change. It’s time for a 2016 playbook.

From Twitter, to Google, LinkedIn, and even Bing, how do you keep track of it all? Fortunately, we have you covered with an extra set of eyes and ears. The work that we do here depends upon the success of the entire digital universe: we’re always up to speed on the biggest changes and opportunities in marketing as a result. Recently, Facebook has been undergoing some changes that will be of particular relevance to publishers. Here’s what the following two updates will mean for your audience-building strategies moving forward: In January of this year, Facebook  , an organic targeting tool that helps publishers reach and engage their target audiences. The tool allows Facebook page admins to improve the relevancy of their posts by indicating who’s most likely to engage with them. The tool gives publishers the following features: So what does all of this mean? In a world where audience attention spans are becoming increasingly fragmented, Facebook is giving publishers the tools that they need to build in-depth, substantive relationships with target audiences.  You can better . You’ll also have additional insight that you can use to optimize each of your posts and extend your publication’s reach. Early users of Facebook’s Audience Optimization tool have recognized considerable lifts in engagement, sparked discussions within unique groups, and provided stronger alignment between content and target audiences. Publishers will soon have the ability to  . This capability is big news. Why?  Similar to email, Facebook Messenger represents a channel for 1:1 communication. Instead of requiring audiences to come to your website or bombarding them with email newsletters, you can ping them with relevant information, in the moment. While this news is still speculative, meaning that Facebook neither confirms nor denies this upcoming feature release, the social media leader is suspected to be testing new features behind the public eye. For instance,   that Facebook had begun testing a tool for developers that allowed people to do things like request an Uber, directly within conversation threads. Given that Facebook Messenger  , the distribution potential for publishers would be massive. Rather than competing for attention spans over email and in search, media companies can more actively reach out to and engage with their target readers. And who knows what the future holds? In the future, publishers may be able to integrate Facebook Messenger into their sponsored content offerings. Facebook has yet to announce what’s planned. Facebook’s changes reflect a larger industry trend around personalization and the importance of building 1:1, personalized relationships.  It’s more critical than ever  . From email to social media, readers have more control than ever over the content that they see and the content with which they engage. Using audience optimization, publishers can better target their audiences on the aggregate level, learning about their needs and preferences along the way. Social media teams at media companies can then reinvest this information into 1:1 touchpoints over Facebook Messenger.  While it’s important to be vigilant and ahead of the curve in this ecosystem, it’s not necessarily the companies that are first to market that will come out ahead. It’s the ones who take the time and conduct their due diligence to understand their audiences in depth. And thanks to Facebook’s new updates, publishers can better engage with and learn about their target audiences across platforms. The best way to get started is with the segmentation framework and marketing database that you already have in place. Who are your highest value readers? How is Facebook currently operating as a referral traffic source for your company? Most likely, you already have the answers to these questions in your marketing database. What Facebook introduces is a mechanism to answer the question “why.” Why do certain audiences engage with your articles? Why are they gaining value from the resources that you’re publishing? Facebook is a treasure trove of psychographic data that can help you answer these questions.",Christian Mongillo

2016-04-08,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fall-in-love-with-writing,How to Fall in Love With Writing Again,"If you’ve ever thought -- or said -- those things about writing, you’re not alone I’ve experienced those thoughts. As someone who writes a lot I get it. After a while, you get sick and tired of writing.  You just want to quit. Is it that notorious condition known as   It could be, but in many cases it’s a little bit different. There are a few things going on: It’s time to figure out how to get your brain back on task. How do you get past the drudgery and enjoy writing again? Let's talk through a few tips. If you're feeling a little burnt out, it's probably a good idea to put some time and space between you and your writing. Depending on how much time you have, this might mean a 20-minute break or even a few days off. When you take a break from writing it gives you time to recharge mentally. And if you’re truly meant to be writing, it’s not going to be long before you’re chomping at the bit again. You’ll feel it. The need to start writing again will surface. If you’re really at rock bottom, I recommend taking a break longer than one week. Try two weeks ... or even longer. Of course. But do you need low-quality content for your blog? If you can’t write, you can’t write. Why force it? It’s better to take a break and come back with some good stuff, than to fry your brain and produce awful stuff. If you decide to take a break, but still need to produce content, here are some tips: Weird. I’m telling you to combat your lack of affection for writing by writing about how you feel about not feeling affectionate towards writing. Uh, why? Here’s the point of this exercise. It jogs the mind, and breaks you out of a funk. Some evidence, please?  published by the Academy of Management Journal researchers rounded up a study group comprised of people who were discouraged over their job loss. They divided subjects into three groups: The results? Read the abstract for yourself: When you ignore the feelings of dissatisfaction with writing, you’re just compounding the problem. The solution isn’t to ignore it and keep on truckin’. The solution is to stop, reflect, and face the feelings. Sure, getting sick of writing isn’t the same as losing your job. But if expressive writing helped people cope with a job loss, it’s likely that it will help you engage with writing again. Your writing environment -- the thoughts, habits, preparation, and place in which you work -- has a profound impact on how you write. If you make changes to your environment, it could spark changes in how you perceive and respond to the task of writing. Nate Krueter, writing for  He’s suggesting the same thing that I am: ”Try working in a new environment.” When I run into a brick wall with my writing, I typically do something totally different with my writing environment -- go outside with my laptop, go to a different room, write at a different time of day, whatever. Changes in environment can spark changes in your approach and attitude toward writing. What and how we read influences what and how we write. If you are sick and tired of writing, then what about reading? Again, the power of difference can be the catalyst. If you’re used to reading material that only discusses your industry, try reading something from a different industry. Better yet, take a novel from off the shelf -- something that you’ve been wanting to read for a while --  You might be surprised by what happens: When you hate writing, your brain is stuck. It’s stuck on the negativity of writing. How do you break the logjam of negativity? By doing  On purpose. How does this work? Neurologist Marcus Raichle conducted a study in which he analyzed MRI images of subjects completing various tasks. The study was innocuous enough in its hypotheses, but what Raichle discovered from the study was something he hadn't expected: During times of activity, the brain’s salience network and central-executive network were hard at work -- processing input, and exerting problem-solving skills. That’s not a bad thing, but because the activity was so intense, it crowded out what Raichle called the  The default work mode is a discrete brain system that is responsible for self-reflection and self-thought. The crazy thing is, the brain can only operate this way when you’re doing  In Raichle’s study, the subjects were in “quiet repose either with eyes closed or with simple visual fixation.” In other words, only by mental relaxation could the subjects prompt their brains to involuntarily process the thoughts, feelings, emotions, self-understanding, and presence that help to unlock creativity and greater insight. What’s the takeaway? Give your brain a break. Chill. Walk. Sit. Do nothing. Visualize. Meditate. Take a nap. Whatever you do, give your brain a chance to return to its “default mode network,” and you’ll discover a refreshing state of creativity that you didn’t realize you had. You don’t have to love writing in order to be good at it ... but it sure does help. When you  your writing, you tend to do it so much better. Readers can tell if the author enjoys her topic. Your writing is clearer, livelier, and way more interesting. But falling in love with writing is a tricky thing. You can’t  love -- especially love for something as inanimate and conceptual as writing. However, you can change a few things in your mindset, your habits, your environment, and your activities to spark a change. Who knows, you might come back with a passion for writing that makes your content even better than before.",Neil Patel
