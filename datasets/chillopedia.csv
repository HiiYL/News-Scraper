2016-05-05,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/best-space-movies/,15 Best Space Movies of All Time,"The human mind is always intrigued by the unexplored and what better way to become enthralled by seeing the mysterious universe in which we live in. Over the years, movies set in a distant galaxy have often been showcased as an innovation in the film industry and following are the 15 best space movies of all time: Long before Joss Whedon changed the entire landscape of superhero movies by Avengers, the director came up with Serenity. As a continuation of the director’s short-lived science fiction show Firefly, the movie takes place several events after the finale.Set in the distant future, the year is 2517 and the movie focuses upon Captain Malcolm “Mal” Reynolds and his crew who rely on smuggling after recently losing the Unification War. With nine original cast members returning, the movie is a delight to watch for anyone who was a fan of Firefly. Based upon the actual Apollo 13 lunar mission, the movie is a roller coaster of a mission as the spaceship’s oxygen tanks explode after leaving the Earth’s orbit. Fearing for their lives, the astronauts must do everything they can think of in order to return to their home alive.Starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton, Apollo 13 is a tale of real-life brave men. Nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture, the movie won two for Best Sound and Best Film Editing. Fresh from the mega success of Jaws, acclaimed director Steven Spielberg tried his luck on a space adventure and the product of his tireless efforts was Close Encounters of the Third Kind. A hit at the box office and receiving positive response, Spielberg was on the verge being one of the well-known film-makers he is today.Starring Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary, the Indiana electrical lineman sees an unidentified flying object and even suffers a sunburn from its bright lights. After the life-changing event, Neary embarks himself on a journey to find out the truth of UFOs. The only animated movie in the list was nothing short of amazing as the lovable robot WALL-E travelled throughout the galaxy with his companion EVE to entertain us with their space adventure.As the last robot on Earth, WALL-E spends his entire life cleaning up the Earth but eventually develops a personality and senses. As soon as EVE enters his life, a great love story centering upon robots marks its beginning. Unlike the rest of the entries in the list, Galaxy Quest has a touch of comedy and proves that a space adventure can be a great fun to watch if added with some laughs.After the stars of a sci-fi space show become washed up, they are beamed aboard an alien spaceship. Believing that their on-screen performances were real, the aliens request them to combat an oppressive regime that plagues their solar system.On a related note, if you are a fan of the recently deceased Alan Rickman and wish to see some of his work besides Harry Potter, then Galaxy Quest is definitely for you! With Hollywood mega-stars George Clooney and Sandra Bullock in the lead roles, the movie can very well reach beyond good expectations. That is exactly where the 2013 science fiction movie Gravity comes in.During their routine space walk, Medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky find themselves in trouble as their shuttle is destroyed. Realizing that there is no way to contact Earth and no chances to be rescued, the pair comes to terms with the only choice to endeavor further into space in order to get back to Earth. When it comes to cinematic universes set in space, Star Trek is one of the best ones out there. With several iconic characters coupled with a journey that makes the viewers’ jaw drop, very few movies set in space can compare their greatness with Star Trek.Based upon science fiction television series by Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek franchise has more than ten movies. If all of them had to be narrowed down to the best one, then it would definitely be Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Based on the 1979 best-selling book of the same name by Tom Wolfe, The Right Stuff is one of the most unique space movies but regrettably remains forgettable after its release more than three decades ago.The movie revolves around a team of astronauts who live in the planet Mercury after being victims of a great political turmoil. Facing several crises and enduring personal troubles, the movie excellently shows that NASA’s technological progresses come with heavy price.",Tayyab Khalil
2016-04-27,http://chillopedia.com/interesting/15-creepy-911-predictions-that-are-shockingly-accurate/,15 Creepy 9/11 Predictions That Are Shockingly Accurate,"The 9/11 terrorist attacks were one of the most tragic days United States of America had to endure. With thousands of lives lost, the incident truly deserves a moment of silence. However, not everyone can say that as they saw the attack coming thanks to several symbolism in television, movies and even predictions by individuals. The following are some of the creepy 9/11 predictions that are shockingly quite accurate and that might force you to wonder whether the entire tragedy was an inside job: With awesome visual effects and an out-of-the-box concept, The Matrix truly was ahead of its time. Stress on the “ahead of the time” bit and you will find out something really interesting related to the September 11 attacks.The passport of Thomas Anderson aka Neo has a really amazing expiry date. Out of all the days and out of all the particular dates to choose from, the passport states that its expiry date is September 11, 2001 – the date of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Loosely based upon the 1985 Nintendo video game of the same name, the existence of the movie adaption of Super Mario Bros. may surprise you but the bigger surprise is the fact that the movie predicted the 9/11 terrorist attacks seven years prior.In the movie, the World Trade Center is burnt and end up in a similar fashion the real-life buildings did by the September 11 attacks one being destroyed half destroyed while the second one having a hole in it. Talk about mother of all coincidences. Directed by John Carpenter, the 1981 dystopian action movie Escape From New York serves as one of the earliest predictions of the September 11 attacks in the form of a movie.Set in a distant future, the movie shows America drenched in crime and the island of Manhattan turned into a maximum security prison. At the very beginning of the movie, Air Force One strikes down one of the Twin Towers as it bursts into flames. Inside job? You be the judge. Professionally known as psychic twins, Terry and Linda Jamison have made astounding predictions but with slight inaccuracies. The identical twin sisters predicted Saddam Hussein would be killed in 2004 (he was executed in 2006), Pope John Paul II would die in 2004 (he died in 2005) and something really frightening about the World Trade Center.During an interview on Art Bell radio show, the twins predicted that there would be a terrorist attack on “federal buildings” and the “World Trade Center in 2002.” With slight errors, the prediction came true as the twin towers were attacked a year earlier. The first episode of The Simpsons’ ninth season had a few surprises of its own. Titled The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson, one particular scene is often associated with the 9/11 predictions by conspiracy theorists.Lisa holds a guidebook which has a $9 printed on it along with the twin towers at the back. The image clearly looks as if it is crying out to say “911”. Furthermore, the episode was taken off after the September 11 attacks but has recently returned into syndication. cried Baba Vanga while warning about the September 11 attacks or likely attempting to gain attention.The blind Bulgarian mystic has allegedly made several predictions throughout her life such as Europe being an Islamic caliphate in 2043, 44th President of the United States will be the last and the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final would be played between “two teams beginning with B.” Even Disney appears in the list as An Extremely Goofy Movie had a small but very suspicious scene. While Goofy and Max are studying, the friends of the latter throw a paper airplane at him to deliver a message.The message reads:No, that is not a typo as the word “appreciation” was not having an “n” but double I as if it was resembling the Twin Towers. The “911” further adds the suspicion as if Disney was part of the conspiracy as well. This one is a long shot but interesting to figure. The cover of the fourth album by Chicago-based rock band Wilco had a simple yet striking cover of two buildings side by side.Furthermore, the album hinted at the tragedy as it had the songs titled “War on War” and “Ashes of American Flag”. To top it all off, the album was being composed during 2001 and had a release date of just a week after the September 11 attacks.",Tayyab Khalil
2016-05-12,http://chillopedia.com/gaming/best-superhero-video-games/,15 Best Superhero Video Games of All Time,"While video games happen to be a yearly multi-billion dollar enterprise, superheroes are not always at the forefront of this media industry as they are featured much more in television and films for some reason. A good number of superhero themed games do get released here and there, but fail to dominate our home consoles the same way movies do. Here today we take a look at the best superhero video games of all time: Released in 2005, this video game from Treyarch is still the best Spiderman game released till date.The game features the most refined web-slinging experience ever, coupled with great spidey reflexes, storyline and combos. Founded by Irrational Games in 2002, Freedom Force features characters which are archetypes of Classic Marvel Heroes like Spider-man, Captain America and Iron Man etc.The game features an epic original plot and offers excellent RPG and strategy elements. It is surely one of the best superhero games for pc ever. This video game from Raven Software hit the market in May 2009 and shocked the gaming community with its detailed and glorified graphic content. Although X-Men Origins: Wolverine faces some challenges, but it manages to solve them by perfectly capturing Wolverine’s cruelty in combat.If you are into violent games then this game surely stands amongst the most violent video games ever. Featuring over 100 playable Marvel characters, LEGO is an open world game that has stood the test of time for a couple of years.LEGO Marvel Super Heroes has a rich environment for any LEGO games, while keeping the gameplay simple and fun. Also from Raven Software, Marvel Ultimate Alliance (MUA) which was released in 2006 is the first video game that found its way out from Xavier’s school for the mutants to make a grand landing in the Marvel Universe.Credit to earlier efforts by Raven’s, MUA turned out to be well polished with excellent gameplay and graphics. At one time, nearly every blockbuster had a video game tie-in, and perhaps Batman Returns for Super Nintendo was among the best. This action video game has side-scrolling features and became famous when it got featured in Tim Burton’s film.The characters and locations from the film have 16-bit renderings which are realized in a visually interesting manner. If you have been looking for a group of heroes that consistently have video games, look no further other than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.They have a wide range of games from poor to great, but “Turtles in Time” stands out amongst the others thanks to its setting where turtles are thrown out via a time loop and must find their way through pirate times, prehistoric times and wild west. X-Men Mutant Academy 2, is another superhero fighting game that emerged from the X-Men franchise and featured 18 playable characters and a host of different levels.It has a hidden “pool party” level and also comes with a unique web slinger as a secret character.",Heather Johnson
2016-05-02,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/best-giant-bug-movies/,17 Best Giant Bug Movies of All Time,"Humans have always been intimidated by species larger than themselves. Hence large aliens, dinosaurs and predators make some of the favourite features of sci-fi/horror genre. One of the lesser featured but equally creepy are giant bugs which come in many forms and sizes. Here we take a look at 17 best giant bug movies of all time that managed to intrigue us the most: Roger Corman’s idea of a horror/sci-fi involves a cosmetics queen turning into a giant wasp when her greed to look young turns on her. A very attractive Susan Cabot plays the lead star, as the owner of a cosmetic company, who falls for an untested serum which promises to make her look young again.It took Corman 5 days to produce this movie with a mysterious movie poster depicting a giant wasp woman clutching a frightened man which is not related to any scene in the movie. Perhaps alluding the trap of women, or their hold on men? We will let you decide. A cross between a comedy and a horror movie, Kyle Rankin has produced a bug movie that will keep you entertained for 90 minutes. The plot is somewhat predictable, in giant bug movie world giant bugs attack the city and our protagonist must save the day.Cooper (Chris Marquette) as a lazy worker and Sara (Brooke Nevin), his boss’ daughter, along with other survivors look to evade the bugs and find a solution. Love is indeed the most powerful emotion. Even in midst of flying giant bugs, Cooper and the super-attractive Sara fall for each other. An eccentric idea put forward by writer of Invasion of Bee Girls women can exhaust men sexually to the point of death. Lead actress Anitra Ford dons the role of a scientist, Dr. Susan, researching bees.Mysterious deaths lead to government agent Neil (William Smith) investigating the matter. He finds Dr. Susan has created monstrous women, who seduce men with their beauty and kill them. Eight Legged Freaks is written and directed by Ellory Elkayem as a sci-fi comedy with a simple plot, a spider fanatic’s blunder of causing all spider species to escape couple with a chemical spill that causes them to grow to the size of a small truck.David Arquette features as the lead in this movie, Chris McCormick, who returns to town after 10 years and still has a thing for the pretty sheriff. Together the sheriff (Kari Wuhrer) and Chris must lead in a struggle against the monstrous spiders. Our hatred for the buzzing, blood sucking nuisance of an insect, the mosquitoes, is universal. Imagine these annoying flying, malaria causing beings to become gigantic? Not a very pleasing thought.Writers Tom Chaney and Steve Hodge, and director Gary Jones play on your worst fears in this flick where an alien dump helps mosquitoes become vulture sized, human killing beasts. Lead stars Rachel Loiselle and Tim Lovelace along with others look to defeat these mutants. Remember how Ron Weasley follows the spiders into the woods only to find his worst nightmare in giant sizes and huge numbers (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets). Kingdom of Spiders, directed by John Cardos, has a similar story.Death of farm animals leads the vet Rack Hansen (William Shatner) along with Dr. Diane Ashley (Tiffany Bolling) to investigate the matter only to find that gigantic killer spiders have overrun the town. Here is a movie where instead of any bugs getting super-sized, the reverse happens and four kids are shrunk to nano-versions by an electromagnetic shrinking machine in a cartoon like blunder. Although Joe Johnston’s venture did not receive high rating from credible movie sites, it does have a good story line and applaudable special effects.The four shrunk kids’ adventure is amusing as they brave their way past routine things which become monstrous for them due to their miniature size. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids won the BAFTA film award. Director Guillermo Del Toro’s brilliant visual sense helps in putting Mimic ahead of its competitor movies with similar plots. The movie features a very attractive Mira Sorvino as an entomologist, Dr. Susan Tyler (Academy Award and Golden Globe winner for her role in Mighty Aphrodite).She comes up with a genetically engineered bug that mimics and kills cockroaches, which are spreading a plague causing deaths of children. Thought to be sterile, the bugs somehow evolve and start mimicking their new victim – humans. Starship troopers is based on Robert A. Heinlein’s science fiction novel with the same name. It projects a futuristic world where kids are sent for military training to fight the alien bugs in space, who are bent upon destroying human race.Leading roles in Paul Verhoeven’s venture are taken by Casper Van Dien who plays Johnny Rico and by a sultry American fashion model, Denise Richards, who plays Lt. Carmen Ibanez.Playing Johnny’s best friend with psychic powers is Neil Patrick (everyone’s favorite character, Barney Stinson from HIMYM). Starship Troopers was nominated for an Oscar in Best Visuals category and surely ranks amongst the most action packed giant insect monster movies ever.",Mohammad Salman Zaka

2016-04-21,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/15-greatest-face-reveal-scenes-of-all-time/,15 Greatest Face Reveal Scenes of All Time,"Adding a touch of mystery by a faceless character always does the trick of having the eyes of the audience glued to their television screens. With the ability of keeping the viewers guessing, the characters who are yet to be seen throughout the viewer engagement usually end up being the center of attention but eventually reveal themselves much to the delight of the audience. Take a look at some of the greatest face reveal scenes of all time: The movie starts out with five thugs hired by the Joker robbing a mob bank of Gotham and each of them wearing a clown mask. The unexpected happens when each of them gets killed one by one by fellow thugs, apparently by the order of the Clown Prince of Crime himself.When Happy and Bozo are the only remaining thugs, the latter speaks for the first time and lets his identity slip as his voice strongly resembled the Joker. Still, the audience are grabbed in a sense of mystery as they want to be sure.As expected, Bozo takes off his mask and reveals himself as none other than the Joker while speaking one of the greatest opening lines in movie history: The first non-human entry in the list is the fearsome dragon that exists in J. R. R. Tolkien’s novel The Hobbit. Described as “a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm”, Smaug is discussed a lot in the first installment of The Hobbit franchise.Though the audience can very well comprehend how dangerous the dragon is when the characters mention it throughout the movie, Smaug is not seen until the very last seconds of the movie as his head rises from the very treasure it guards.The terrifying dragon makes his complete appearance in the sequels The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of the Five Armies, dying in the latter by the iron arrow from Bard the Bowman. Though the apparently menacing James Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld appears in From Russia with Love and Thunderball, his face is never seen as the movies only show his lower body while he strokes his white cat.Portrayed by Czech actor Donald Pleasence, the baddie finally revealed his face in his third appearance in You Only Live Twice when he personally meets Bond in his layer. Though the traditional unmasking scene doesn’t happen in this horror movie, the revelation is still as dramatic as any other entry in the list.Carrying out several murders while wearing the iconic scream mask, Sidney Prescott is left in a state of shock after realizing that Ghost face is her very own boyfriend Billy Loomis. Set during the Vietnam War, Apocalypse Now stars Marlon Brando as the renegade and insane Colonel Walter E. Kurtz though he hardly appears in the movie. Worshipped as a demi-god by his personal Montagnard troops in Cambodia, Kurtz is mentioned throughout the movie but never seen.Making his first appearance in the last quarter of the movie, Kurtz is shown talking but his face is covered by shadows. Despite knowing very well that the character looks like Brando, the viewers still cannot help themselves from seeing his face as it was revealed to be looking exactly like you guessed it Brando. Failing to save Jason Todd, the second Robin, from being killed by the Joker, Batman called the incident as his greatest failure. Years later, Gotham had a new vigilante going by the name of Red Hood.Bent on controlling crime, Red Hood was very well aware about Batman to the point of his secret identity, leading the Dark Knight to believe that he is battling someone he personally knows. As it turned out, Red Hood took off his helmet and revealed himself to be Jason Todd, resurrected by Ra’s al Ghul. Arguably one of the greatest movies to magnificently incorporate the elements of suspense and thriller, Psycho adds a double twist to the unmasking scene.Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the face of the apparent killer Norma Bates is eventually shown near the end of the movie but it soon turns out that it was actually her son Norman dressed like her. Fans of professional wrestling are well aware of the mystery that surrounded Kane’s face. After having his face physically burnt from the house fire that left parents dead but his brother Undertaker narrowly escaped, Kane became obsessed with guarding his face from a mask he always wore.With the aim of creating history, Kane wrestled against Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship on the line along with the stipulation being the former removing his mask if he lost. Due to the outside interference by Evolution, Kane was defeated and took off his mask for the very first time on WWE’s flagship show Raw.",Tayyab Khalil

Tom Hardy, Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon played their roles with the utmost exception.In this movie we get to see the romantic and cool side of Hardy, which literally makes everyone fall in love with him. This movie was not a major hit, but it was the second movie after Hardy’s debut. He didn’t get instant fame but was recognized over the passage of time.And, did we mention, Tom Hardy played the role of an antagonist here. Tom Hardy’s debut movie, Black Hawk Down didn’t gain him popularity but it did get him noticed in the film industry.Hardy nailed the fresh face supporting role in this movie. Not so popular movie, but Child 44 was one of the most diverse roles played by Hardy where he got to speak a lot of dialogues as compared to his other action movies. Lawless is another gangster movie, in which Hardy gets to play the Alpha male and once again Hardy doesn’t leaves his audiences disappointed. Drop is another classic movie of Hardy where he finds himself trapped in a crime situation. The Drop has a strong cast which plays their role well in this gangster crime movie. One of the best movies of Tom Hardy, the post-apocalyptic movie was full of action packed sequences, though there weren’t much dialogues of Hardy in the film and most of the times all you could hear was him grunting and screaming.However, still the movie turned out to be a major hit and this movie is a best watch to judge Hardy’s skill even when there is not lot to say. You will also get to see Hardy acting in the movie Revenant though it was hard to make out first that it was him due to his appearance and accent, but well he was there and like always his acting was phenomenon.This probably is Hardy’s best performance in a negative role till date and rightfully earned him a Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.",Heather Johnson

2016-04-18,http://chillopedia.com/interesting/15-biggest-controversial-moments-in-cartoons/,15 Biggest Controversial Moments in Cartoons,"What is aimed for children can be a tool for erupting controversies and outrage. As a kid, watching cartoon shows was a big deal as a source of entertainment but it is certainly intriguing to wonder what on earth their production studios were thinking while including questionable content for minor viewers. Take a look the 15 biggest controversial moments in cartoons: Featured as short segments of Dexter’s Laboratory, Dial M for Monkey focused upon Dexter’s pet monkey’s alter ego as a superhero who fights crime and saves the world.The episode Barbequor was met with criticism because of the depiction of stereotypical gay men by a character named Silver Spooner and the state of being hangover and vomiting by another character called Krunk.After airing for a few years, the episode was deemed offensive and later removed from broadcast. Replaced by a segment from the second season, Barbequor was not even featured in Season One DVD of Dexter’s Laboratory. Not a stranger to criticism, The Simpsons is one of the most watched television shows of all time despite several inappropriate instances in it. In this episode, the family goes to Rio de Janeiro to find a Brazilian orphan named Ronaldo. During the course of their visit, the city is ridiculed by several stereotypes which damaged its image.Showing significant kidnappings, crime, rat infestation and slums, the tourist board of Rio de Janeiro feared that the show will be responsible for a decline in their tourism business and planned to sue Fox. All was forgiven when executive producer of the show James L. Brooks apologized to the city for screening a negative portrayal. Set in post-Civil War South, the movie stars James Baskett as Uncle Remus – an implied former slave. With a racist tone, the movie was branded as an “insult to American minorities [and] everything that America as a whole stands for” by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., a congressman from Harlem.The film caused one of the biggest controversial moments in cartoons and after facing a severe backlash and immense criticism, it was never released on home video. However, its song “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah” won an Academy Award for Best Song while Baskett achieved an honorary Academy Award because of his portrayal of storyteller Uncle Remus; making him the very first male African-American actor to win an Oscar. As one of Disney’s most loved creations, Aladdin found itself in a heap of trouble due to its offensive lyrics in the Arabian Nights theme that demeaned Arabs. The opening lyrics state:Unbelievable how such cruel content can be featured in a product aimed at children. After protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, Disney altered the lyrics from the home-video and CD versions of the movie to:On an interesting note, the New York Times addressed the issue with an editorial titled “It’s Racist, But Hey, It’s Disney” and stated: After being fired from the KrustyKrab, SpongeBob fells into depression but his friend Patrick tries to encourage him by showing the benefits of unemployment. Referring it as “fun employment”, the episode became a topic of political debate and much controversy for its irresponsible depiction of unemployment.The episode also mocked how unemployed people rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Referred as a “symbolic of a harsh economic climate”, the plot of the episode was met with overwhelming criticism. Underage drinking is never a good idea but in order to teach that lesson to the kids, this particular episode of Tiny Toon Adventures showed exactly that: underage drinking, in one of the most controversial cartoon episodes ever. When Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig drink beer, things only get complicated.The alcohol content was taken to a whole new level when the drunk trio steal a police car and drive under the influence. Though they managed to learn the “evils of alcohol” by the end of the episode, the segment was quickly banned after it aired. The surprise military attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy on the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor added fuel to the fire between the two countries’ already crude relations.The Disney animated series TaleSpin recreated the entire event in the episode Last Horizons when Baloo visits Panda-La – a mystical place occupied by Pandas with Japanese depictions.The entire scenario is a setup as Panda-La’s emperor Wan Lo is on the verge of invading Baloo’scity Cape Suzette. The offensive East Asian stereotypes and the aggressive World War II depictions featured in the segment lead to a temporarily ban of the episode. The list cannot be completed without the inclusion of Family Guy. Do not let the name fool you! The show is not at all meant for a family viewing. In the episode When You Wish Upon a Weinstein, Peter Griffin aims to hire a Jew so he can earn money.The episode pokes fun at the Jews more than often and was chosen not to air on television because of its anti-Semitic nature. Furthermore, the song featured in the episode When You Wish Upon a Jew parodies the popular Disney song When You Wish Upon a Star with demeaning Jewish lyrics.",Tayyab Khalil
2016-04-11,http://chillopedia.com/celebs/celebrities-who-have-survived-suicide-attempts/,15 Celebrities Who Have Survived Suicide Attempts,"Whether they die a natural death or by a disease or even by their own hands, celebrities often fail to overcome their personal demons that come along fame and fortune. Take a look at 15 celebrities who have survived suicide attempts: Best known for Wedding Crashers, Shanghai Knights and Midnight in Paris, Owen Wilson proved that even comedy stars can have a bad day or two. In 2007, the actor was rushed to St. John’s Health Center following a suicide attempt.Santa Monica police received a phone call from Owen’s residence about the suicide attempt as the actor had taken an overdose of pills and slit his wrist. The actor underwent treatment for depression and it cost him his role in Tropic Thunder, which was directed, produced and starred his most frequent collaborator, Ben Stiller. As the only woman of color to win the Academy Award for Best Actress to date, Halle Berry made history in the movie industry but that almost did not happen as the actress once revealed that she attempted suicide.Opening up to People magazine, the actress stated,Nothing short of an inspiration, Barry’s mother raised her on her own after getting divorced when the actress was just four years old. With an illustrious career that has spanned more than fifty years, Elton John has sold more than 300 million records and made a Knight Bachelor by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to music and charitable amenities.Despite all that, even the British musician once attempted suicide as his longtime song writing partner Bernie Taupin once found him sticking his head in a gas stove to inhale its toxic gas.Saving him before the damage could be done, the two musicians – not so surprisingly – wrote and produced a song about the whole incident titled “Someone Saved My Life Tonight.” Unlike the rest of the entries in the list, the Two and a Half Men star never actually attempted suicide but contemplated committing it so he could donate his heart to save his brother who needed one for a transplant.Considering to jump from the balcony of Cedar Rapids hospital, the doctors announced that a donor was found from an accident victim in another state and Kutcher did not have to think about sacrificing his heart again. Lead vocalist of post-grunge band Creed was on the verge of contemplating suicide after drinking a bottle of Jack Daniel’s whiskey. Scott Stapp went as far as retrieving two MP5 submachine guns and shooting his head off but stopped after looking at the picture of his son.admits the rockstar who thought that his death would not only increase record sales but also make him a “Kurt Cobain martyr-type”. Speaking of Kurt Cobain, the Nirvana front man allegedly died by a suicide attempt but it is definitely interesting to note that he tried it a month before his death. While in Rome with his wife Courtney Love, Cobain had overdosed on a combination of Rohypnol and champagne.The rockstar was immediately rushed to a hospital where he remained unconscious for the entire day and released after five days. According to Love, the motive behind the act was definitely a “suicidal urge.”Due to the mysteries surrounding Cobain’s death which is officially ruled as a suicide, it is interesting to note that the rockstar would often record movies in his youth with his Super-8 camera. One scene in particular depicts Cobain committing suicide. Long before becoming a billionaire, being synonymous with power and standing as a hope for women all over the globe, Oprah Winfrey had to face a devastating childhood as her family was drenched in poverty.Pregnant at 14, Oprah decided to end her life and her baby’s by drinking a detergent. Oprah survived as obviously, fate certainly had much bigger plans for her in the future. Starring in a dog food commercial when she was just 11 months and starting her film career at the age of five, Drew Barrymore entered the rebellious phase at a very young age because of the tremendous fame.Smoking at the age of nine, drinking at the age of eleven, smoking marijuana at the age of twelve and snorting cocaine at the age of thirteen became responsible of her appearing at the headlines instead of her movies.Entering rehab at the age of fourteen, all seemed fine when Barrymore departed but soon slit her wrist with a kitchen knife as a suicide attempt. The actress survived and was strong enough to leave her drug habits aside.",Tayyab Khalil
2016-03-24,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/best-johnny-depp-movies-of-all-time/,17 Best Johnny Depp Movies Of All Time,"Arguably the most versatile actor of all time, Johnny Depp is a name familiar and loved by every movie goer today. Known for “larger-than-life” roles with the ability to leave the audience mystified, the Hollywood A-lister is undoubtedly one of the best actors alive today and his box office successes justify it. Take a look at the 17 best Johnny Depp movies of all time: The famous tale by Lewis Carroll is well-known and has been countlessly told and retold from one generation to another by means of several media adaptions. The story got another kick start as director Tim Burton and his frequent collaborator Johnny Depp shook things up with Alice in Wonderland.With the result being one of the highest grossing fantasy movies of all time, it was a thrill to see Depp as the eccentric Mad Hatter and the fans would not have it any other way. On an interesting note, the actor reprises his role for the sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass aimed to release this year. The action western film starred Armie Hammer as lawyer-turned-ranger John Reid but all eyes were on Johnny Depp as Comanche Native American Tonto, who stole the entire spotlight. That says a lot about the actor’s credibility.Revolving around greed, power and heroic antics, The Lone Ranger is truly an underrated movie and it is a shame that it failed to get the recognition it deserved but still, it is one hell of an action western flick. Based on the novel of the same name and a remake of the 1971 movie starring Gene Wilder, Tim Burton’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was the perfect retelling of the classic story penned by Roald Dahl and the movie received positive reviews.The same could be said about Johnny Depp of course as his performance of the lovable chocolatiers Willy Wonka was the tip of the iceberg. However, Wilder – the man behind Wonka character from the original film – was dissatisfied with the movie and called it “an insult”. As one of the most feared criminals of his generation, Whitey Bulger was an organized crime mogul and the head of the Boston Irish Mob crew called the Winter Hill Gang. When a biopic was planned, Hollywood A-lister Johnny Depp was the right man for the job.As an addition of excitement, Black Mass features an ensemble cast of Depp along with Benedict Cumberbatch, Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard, Jesse Plemons and Dakota Johnson. Set during the Great Depression, Public Enemies chronicles the last years of infamous bank robber John Dillinger, played by none other than Johnny Depp.Surely not the first bad guy the talented actor has portrayed but Depp once again proves by his acting abilities that it is perfectly fine to root for the bad guy in the movie. As the only animated movie on the entire list, it would be injustice to ignore action comedy western film Rango. Though Johnny Depp has done a few voice roles throughout his career, Rango is definitely the best one out there to the point of winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.After accidentally entering the town of Dirt, Rango the chameleon masquerades as a tough drifter and eventually becomes the sheriff only to realize how dangerous his job would be while facing Rattlesnake Jake. Undoubtedly groundbreaking when it comes to cinematography and visual styles, Sleepy Hollow was indeed a unique movie. After all, how often Johnny Depp works in a horror movie?Following a series of murders by the mysterious Headless Horseman, Depp as New York police constable Ichabod Crane must investigate them and put a stop to the madness. When Vianne Rocher and her daughter Victoire Thivisol move into the French village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes to open a chocolate shop, things only get complicated when Roux – portrayed by Johnny Depp enters their lives. Perhaps the best example of the displaying versatility the actor is best known for, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a master piece of acclaimed actor-director duo of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.As a combination of a barber and a singer, Depp was absolutely mesmerizing with his role of Benjamin Baker aka Sweeny Todd and even earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor while the movie was nominated for two more, and winning one for Best Art Direction. The cocaine trade remains one of the most ground-shaking smuggling crimes in United States of America and George Jung was the mastermind behind the entire scheme. Surely the life of the smuggler seems interesting enough to be documented in a movie.As a matter of fact, a biopic based on the smuggling adventures and arrest of Boston George was made and to top it all off, the leading man was none other than Johnny Depp.",Tayyab Khalil

2016-02-25,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/15-best-edward-norton-movies-of-all-time/,15 Best Edward Norton Movies of All Time,"With a passion to act and the will to leave audience wanting for more, Edward Norton is one of the best actors in Hollywood today. Though Norton graduated with a Bachelor in Arts of History from Yale University, it was the profession of acting that has always been his true calling. Arguably among the best actors who have never won an Academy Award, take a look at the 15 best Edward Norton movies of all time: While handling a role is hard enough, Norton had the responsibility of two of them in the 2009 comedy-drama movie Leaves of Grass. Starring as identical twins, Bill Kincaid is a laudable lecturer at Brown University while Brady Kincaid is a marijuana seller.Though the movie received mixed reviews, it made clear that Norton is one hell of an actor. Pulling off not one but two roles magnificently is just a glimpse how capable Norton is as an actor because the list has just started. Everyone loves a heist movie and Edward Norton is the tip of the iceberg if starring in it. As a remake of the 1969 British movie of the same name, The Italian Job revolves around a team of thieves who intend to steal gold from a former comrade who double crossed them.With several twists and turns, the movie excellently convinces the audience to think twice when it comes to trusting anyone. Despite having a cast of Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, Seth Green and Donald Sutherland, it is Norton who is nothing short of a scene-stealer. Based on the real-life United States Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, the movie stars Woody Harrelson as the pornographic magazine publisher Larry Flynt and Edward Norton as his lawyer Alan Isaacman.Isaacman must bear the bad boy antics of his client and must do everything in his hands to make sure that the court rules in favor of Flynt. With intense speeches and credible acting ability, Norton is absolutely brilliant in the movie.As unbelievable as it may sound, it was Norton’s third movie of his career and won several awards for his role including Best Supporting Awards by Boston Society of Film Critics, Florida Film Critics Circle and Society of Texas Film Critics. For the very first time in his career, Edward Norton played a superhero from Marvel Comics. As Dr. Bruce Banner, the Hulk had to face another threat besides General Ross as Abomination is prepared to prove that the city is not big enough for two monsters.Unfortunately, it was the last time the actor portrayed the green-colored monster with anger issues. Due to Norton’s writing conflicts, the actor did not even promote his own movie. As a consequence, the role of the Hulk was recasted as Mark Ruffalo replaced Norton in The Avengers and future movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The crime thriller movie had two bankable and great stars Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro. Along for the ride was none other than Edward Norton as a clever robber who pretends to be an intellectually damaged janitor.Costarring with mega-stars such as De Niro and Brando is enough for any actor to feel confident about making it big in the film industry but Norton was taken to one step further. As the movie being a “passing of the torch” for Norton, the actor was established as the next big thing in Hollywood. From the director of Gladiator, Ridley Scott delivers another epic historical drama movie with a star-studded cast of Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson and of course Edward Norton.With everyone featured as fictionalized versions of historical figures, Norton dons the role of King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem. Also known as the Leper, the actor was absolutely convincing with the role of royalty. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter is one of the most iconic movie characters of all time. Add Edward Norton to the mix and you got yourself one hell of a movie.Based upon the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris, Red Dragon featured Norton as Detective Will Graham who charged Lecter with cannibalism and put him behind bars.Equipped with the ability to think like criminals and recreate their horrendous activities in his mind, Graham must face another serial killer who goes by the name of “The Tooth Fairy”. Edward Norton gives a glimpse of a humanized Bugs Bunny by starring as Lester “Worm” Murphy in the 1998 drama movie Rounders.Retired from the world of gambling, Murphy must return to the life of betting in order to help a friend pay off his loan.Directed by John Dahl, the success of the movie owes a great deal to the cringe-worthy chemistry between the edgy and crude Norton and clean-cut Matt Damon.",Tayyab Khalil
2016-04-04,http://chillopedia.com/celebs/heres-why-celebrities-are-crazy-about-segway-personal-transporter/,Here’s Why Celebrities Are Crazy About Segway Personal Transporter,"It absolutely crazy how advanced our world has gotten in the 21st century. Mobile phones, face recognition software, Skype, programs like Siri, and hand-held tablets were only things of the future that people saw at the movie theaters. We don’t have flying cars like in The Fifth Element just yet, but it doesn’t completely seem out of reach with modern day technology. Who knew that these “unrealistic” technological items from past Sci-fi films could actually predict the future? Or, did huge corporations like Google and Apple see potential in these life-changing technological advances and replicated what they saw on the big screen?Either way, the world we have now is constantly evolving. And, of course, celebrities are all over the trendiest technological gadget on the market. Unlike the bulky Segway PT, hoverboard scooters are the future of transportation, smaller in size, and hands-free! No wonder why celebs are obsessed with them. Here we explore why celebrities are crazy about Segway Personal Transporter: Since before 1903, the year The Wright brothers Wilbur and Orville invented the very first aircraft, people have always dreamed of flying. But, what really inspired our newest tech gadgets? Well, movies of course!Think about it, how mind-blowing is it to think that we are that much closer to riding hoverboards like Marty from Back to the Future Part ll? In a way, the current hoverboards make you feel like you are flying by allowing you to effortlessly and swiftly maneuver around. These scooters resemble hover boards from the movie, but aren’t quite there yet.  Although, Lexus has revealed a prototype for a real-life hoverboard (too bad they only work on magnetic tracks).With movies like Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report predicting future technologies like face recognition software, touchscreens, and self-driving cars, screenwriters and filmmakers are continuously trying their best to predict future high-tech tools. Before 2001: A Space Odyssey hit the big screens, most people never thought that computers would actually be able to talk to us or even let us have the software to talk face to face with people through portable devices. Nowadays, people can’t imagine their life without Siri or Skype. Celebrities have become increasingly infatuated with the evolution of the Segway hoverboards. Here are just a few examples of your favorite celebs loving their hoverboards.Justin Bieber loves his electronic scooter so much that he literally uses it everywhere, even on airplanes:Wiz Khalifa posted several photos and videos on social media of him riding his PhunkeeDuck hoverboard all over the place at the airport (which is actually illegal and he got arrested at LAX!), at his house, and even shopping at the grocery store.We all know that Chris Brown loves showing off. While riding his Segway hoverboard, he still manages to display a smooth demeanor and swift dance moves.Mike Tyson VS Hoverboard! I must admit, I did chuckle a bit when Mike Tyson screamed and fell to the floor after making the wrong movements on his daughter’s hoverboard. If you want to add a quick laugh to your day, there’s nothing funnier than a former heavyweight champion being taken down by an electronic scooter.The development of modern day technology is only getting more awesome from here. Once upon a time, Skype, Siri, iPads, tablets, touchscreens, and hoverboards were all just fictional things that writers and filmmakers dreamed of.But, these days, we can’t visualize living without them. Movies truly influence and inspire people in multiple ways. Luckily for us, movies like Back to the Future Part ll inspired people to completely change the way we commute. Walking is a thing of the past, didn’t you know?  Just imagine what amazing gadgets the future will hold; only time will tell.",Heather Johnson
2016-04-04,http://chillopedia.com/celebs/15-good-guy-actors-who-portrayed-great-villains/,15 Good Guy Actors Who Portrayed Great Villains,"Movie villains are often type casted by actors who have a knack for making the audience utterly hate them. However, there have been some rare instances where Hollywood dared to make a change by selecting typical nice guy actors that play villains. Despite well-known for portraying people with a heart of gold, the following are the 15 good guy actors who portrayed great villains: Christopher Nolan loves to experiment in his movies and Robin Williams was his test subject in his very first feature film Insomnia. As one of the most loved performers of his generation, the movie showcased a never-before-seen side of the actor as a villain.As the prime-suspect in the murder of a 17-year-old girl, Walter Finch must escape the wrath of LAPD detectives. Unlike the previously cheerful and jolly roles he is famous for, Williams brilliantly portrayed the silent and cold-hearted killer to the point of director Nolan calling it a “flawless performance.” Who would have thought that the man who saved the entire world by throwing the One Ring in Mount Doom would one day become a cannibalistic serial killer? A strong contrast from Elijah Wood’s iconic hobbit role.It just so happened that The Lord of the Rings star played such a ruthless villain in the 2005 film adaption of Sin City. Do not let his unassuming look fool you as one of his victims revealed that Kevin ate her hand right in front of her. You might remember the Australian actor fighting vampires in Van Helsing and mutant oppression in the X-Men franchise, but Hugh Jackman excellently served as the villain Robert Angier in Christopher Nolan’s The Prestige.As a magician competing against rival Alfred Borden, things got too personal. It was not about performing better tricks anymore, it was about destroying the other and Angier succeeded.In fact, Angier definitely had the audience repulse him as he got Borden arrested for his apparent murder, got him executed for the crime he did not commit and even took his daughter as an adopted child. He is an actor who needs no introduction and has inspired millions of people with his heroic roles in Top Gun, Legend and of course, the Mission Impossible installments. A role of a villain may sound unsuitable for Tom Cruise but the actor took it as a challenge and nailed it perfectly.As a professional hitman hired to kill four witnesses, Cruise immersed himself as Vincent in the psychological crime thriller Collateral and proved that he can make any role great thrown in front of him. The movie received positive reviews and so did Cruise for his villainous role. Known for his clean-cut roles, the attractive Matt Damon is one of the most loved and idolized actors in Hollywood so the role of a villain was met with hesitation. Nonetheless, the actor accepted and the fans never looked Damon with the same feelings again.As Tom Ripley in The Talented Mr. Ripley, the character hid his cruelness beneath his handsome looks and killed people who got in the way of what he desired. Purely a monster, it was incredible to see Damon doing work unlike never before. Among the several great actors known for their attachment with comedic work, Bill Murray is one of them. It was unlikely that the man who saved New York from ghosts (twice) as Peter Venkman would one day star as a villain in the future.With a star-studded cast of Robert De Niro and Uma Thurman, Mad Dog and Glory received positive reviews and owes a great deal to Bill Murray. As Frank Milo, it was definitely interesting to see Murray executing his acting skills by terrifying the audience by portraying the villain. With all honesty, Denzel Washington proved that he can pull off villainous roles as good as he does with heroic ones when he portrayed the corrupt narcotics officer Alonzo Harris in Training Day.Regarded as one of his best movie performances, Washington was absolutely convincing as the bad guy and even won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. Starring as a happy-go-lucky character in dozens of movies throughout his career, Jim Carrey has made countless people laugh with his funny antics in several comedy movies.As a great actor that he is, Carrey was able to utilize his knack for comedy to make the audience hate him when he starred as Edward Nygma aka Riddler in Joel Schumacher’s Batman Forever.Deducing the Dark Knight’s secret identity of Bruce Wayne, kidnapping his side-kick Robin and destroying the Batcave, Carrey served as Batman’s worst nightmare in the movie.",Tayyab Khalil

2016-02-29,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/17-best-arnold-schwarzenegger-movies-of-all-time/,17 Best Arnold Schwarzenegger Movies of All Time,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is not just a name, but it is also an attractive brand in the Hollywood industry. The man has achieved the iconic status through immense hard work, and today we will be looking at 17 best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of all time: This is definitely one of Arnold’s best comedies as Arnold and Danny DeVito complement each other in this fish out water-buddy comedy.The story revolves around the main character, Arnold, seeking out his lost twin brother, Danny. Thus, hijinks ensues. At first sight, this film seems like a fairly generic action flick, and towards the end it does sort of turn in to that. However, the first two-thirds of the film are actually surprisingly some-what thought provoking.It’s plot is basically about a man who meets a clone of himself and gets caught up in an entire conspiracy involving clones dominating the world. Another hilarious film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, provided if you actually enjoy a lot of loony toons style slapstick comedy with quite a few humorous one-liners from Arnold, himself.The story is set in a western environment and at times feels like sort of a satire of many of the westerns of the past. Though the star of this film is definitely Maggie, played by Abigail Breslin, but this is pretty much the best performance Arnold has given since his return to the film industry.The story is about a girl who is infected by a zombie virus, during the zombie apocalypse, and her loving father stays by her side as they try to survive. This is one of those movies where the concept for the movie alone makes me laugh out loud. A tough cop, played by Arnold, has to infiltrate a school as a kindergarten teacher in search of a drug dealer.The famous “SHUT UP!” scene has got to be the most hilariously iconic scenes in movie history. The long overdue team up of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. If this film had come out like in the 80s or 90s, everyone would have lost their minds. But sadly, the novelty of witnessing these actors on screen just isn’t the same.However, the entertainment to be found here is very nostalgic and fun. The plot is about both Arnold and Sylvester breaking out of a super security prison and then some extremely gratifying sequences occur. A fun cop action/buddy comedy about a tough Russian policeman who has to partner up with a cocky Chicago policeman and stop a drug lord who fled from the country.As you would expect, it has really well done action sequences, memorable one-liners, and hilarious comedic scenes. One of the best dramatic films that Arnold has ever done. The emotion oozes off screen as we witness the tragedy of Conan’s back story and why he vows vengeance against the evil wizard who had done him wrong.A classic, that is true to its name and holds up quite well even for today’s standards. The Expendable movies are nothing more than the old action stars of the 80s just celebrating their awesomeness. They’re dumb, silly, and filled with clichéd and re-used one-liners from their old movies.Despite all that, they’re still spectacular films, filled with a complete acknowledgement of how silly it all is. Probably the most reserved movie amongst all of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies on this list. The story is about a drug cartel speeding to the Mexican border with only a Sheriff, played by Arnold, and his inexperienced staff left to stop them in their tracks.The film has a very intense build-up as you are introduced to the characters and their personalities and you see them get ready for the havoc that is sure to happen.",Fajar Lodhi
2016-03-07,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/17-best-liam-neeson-movies-of-all-time/,17 Best Liam Neeson Movies Of All Time,"Ranked among 100 Sexiest Stars in Film Industry and The Top 100 Movie Stars of all time, Liam John Neeson needs no introduction. The graceful Irish actor, who has girls drooling over him, gets sexier and better looking as he ages. With his charming demeanor and his ability to play any character flawlessly, Liam Neeson has played many roles to near perfection. In fact, his performance as Ra’s Al Ghul (and many others) is so splendid, we cannot imagine another actor in that role. While many of his movies are worth watching, here are the 17 best Liam Neeson movies of all time: Director David Von Ancken’s debut features two great stars in a movie set in post American civil war time. We all know a vengeful Liam Neeson is a determined and dangerous one.

This action thriller directed by Jaume Collet Serra shows Liam Neeson as an air marshal, named Bill Marks, on board a plane where one of the passengers is threatening to detonate the bomb unless a huge amount of money is transferred to an off shore account.With some popcorn and soda, this more than a 100 minutes of Liam Neeson’s heroics makes this movie a great watch. The role of a protector/savior is perhaps best suited to Liam Neeson. In one of his more recent works, he plays a professional hitman, named Jimmy Conlon who has earned the title of ‘Gravedigger’.Jimmy is best friends with his boss, Sean Maguire (Ed Harris), but he is ready to go up against him and all mobsters when his estranged son Mike’s name pops up on the hit list.With Liam Neeson in lead role, running from rogue policemen and his own mob’s hitmen to protect his son and survive the night, Run All Night makes a good crime action movie. Another venture with Jaume Collet-Serra, starring Liam Neeson as a biochemist named Dr. Martin Harris, Unknown has a surprising plot twist for you. Starring opposite Liam Neeson are two stunning fashion models the American January Jones, as his wife Elizabeth, and the German Diane Kruger, the cab driver and his aide.Arriving in Berlin for a biotechnology conference, an accident leaves Martin in coma for 4 days. On coming back to the real world, he finds his identity gone. With even his wife refusing to recognize him, Dr. Martin sets out to unravel these strange happenings, as hitmen try to kill him. Liam Neeson takes the stage as Matthew Scudder, a retired police officer now working as a private detective.

This adaption of Lawrence’s novel shows Matthews being approached by a drug dealer whose wife was kidnapped and killed.As Matthews investigates deeper, he finds that this was not merely a revenge, but a routine operation of an evil organization.

2016-03-28,http://chillopedia.com/celebs/15-actors-who-portrayed-two-superheroes/,15 Actors Who Portrayed Two Superheroes,"As one of the most dominant genres in Hollywood, superhero movies have established themselves as money making machines and a grand source of amazement. Like any movie, the leading star is a pivotal role and careful consideration takes place as far as casting the crime fighter is concerned. Though there are dozens of actors who have played a superhero, take a look 15 actors who portrayed two superheroes: Ray Stevenson not only portrayed Frank Castle aka The Punisher in the movie Punisher: War Zone but also voiced the character in the animated series The Super Hero Squad Show.Recently, the actor played another comic book superhero from Marvel. As one of god of thunder Thor’s most trusted allies, Stevenson played Volstagg in Thor and its sequel Thor: The Dark World. The Canadian actor could not have been happier when he landed the role of DC superhero Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow on The CW’s Arrow. Running for four seasons and counting, the show brings you to the edge of your seats.The actor got the opportunity to play another superhero with no powers in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. Donning a hockey mask and wielding a hockey stick as Casey Jones, Amell will help the pizza-eating heroes in a half-shell in their crime fighting adventures. Actors Doug Jones is best known for playing unrecognizable roles and as fate would have it, the two superheroes he portrayed in his career both fall into the category.Appearing in Hellboy and Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Jones played the psychic alien superhero Abe Sapien and portrayed another alien known as the Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Despite being one of the greatest actors alive today, Will Smith’s first ever superhero movie Hancock received mixed reviews. Hopefully the same will not be said about Suicide Squad in which the actor portrays antihero Deadshot.On an interesting note, Smith was once offered the role of Super-Man but wisely turned it down as he stated: A superhero in his own right, Wesley Gibson is possibly the most exciting character of Top Cow comics. Scottish actor James McAvoy portrayed the self-righteous assassin in the 2008 movie-adaption Wanted.Three years later, the actor portrayed the father-figure of mutants, Charles Xavier aka Professor X in X-Men: First Class and its sequel X-Men: Days of Future Past. Speaking of X-Men, Ellen Page played the youngest member of the team. The walking-through-walls super heroine has been one of the most exciting things to watch in the franchise.As a total contrast to her esteemed superhero portrayal of Kitty Pryde, Page played Boltie, the “kid sidekick” of The Crimson Bolt in the 2010 dark comedy-drama film Super.Wearing a sexually suggestive costume and having superhero, the performance of the actress as the so-called superhero Boltie was more of a joke than comedy and even got herself killed in crime-fighting. Starting off the article with an actor whose superhero roles were quite frankly forgettable seems an excellent way to make you aware of how crucial casting choices can be. Michael Jai White is a man of limited success yet he portrayed not one but two superheroes.There are not many superheroes as impressive as the ones in DC and Marvel Comics yet the anti-hero Spawn is one of them. White played the supernatural anti-hero in the 1997 movie Spawn but received negative reviews. Currently, the actor portrays Bronze Tiger in The CW’s television series Arrow. Throughout his career, Nicolas Cage has portrayed tremendous roles with multiple magnetism and that includes the superhero Big Daddy in Kick-Ass series and of course Ghost Rider in the movie of the same name and its sequel.On an interesting note, Cage was close to playing another superhero on film. None other than Super-Man in a project assigned to director Tim Burton. The actor even went as far as wearing Super-Man’s costume for screen tests but thankfully, the production was cancelled.",Tayyab Khalil
2016-02-25,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/30-best-sci-fi-horror-movies-of-all-time/,30 Best Sci Fi Horror Movies of All Time,"Every genre brings something different to the table, but sci-fi horrors will always intrigue people around for bringing the spotlight on to the much needed scary element. Down the years many films have horrified yet attracted viewers from all over the globe. We will countdown to a compiled list of top 30 best sci fi horror movies of all time: This movie surrounds a not too distant future, the government has established a yearly 12-hour period in which all crime is legalized.It is a very intriguing flick with a pretty fascinating concept, yet does have some underwhelming execution as the story primarily focuses on a single family going through this horrifying event. An odd concept for a film, as some Aliens bring human beings back from the dead into zombies and vampires, in order to stop humanity from building a bomb that is powered by the sun. It’s definitely a very interesting film to view though. A space transport vessel and its crew are left stranded on a planet where there are dangerous monsters who only come out during the night to feast on their prey.The situation seemed hopeless until the crew finds Riddick, played by Vin Diesel, to be their last hope of survival. A very intense horror Sci-fi with certain action set pieces thrown here and there. A group of vampires, from space, who arrive in London and start infecting the local population and transform them into zombies.The concept alone should peak your interest, but it is supported by the over the top horrific elements that are seen. A team of commandos are on a rescue mission in the South American Jungle, where a helicopter crashed. However, the team finds itself under attack by a strange extra-terrestrial creature that started hunting them down and murdering them one by one.Starring a pretty bad-ass cast of characters played by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers, it includes a lot of action that is complimented by a very vigorous atmosphere. An alien jelly-like creature that keeps on growing as it consumes everything in its path. An extremely horrific experience as the mere presence of this faceless creature, that seems to have no weakness, eats everyone and everything in its way.It’s definitely one of the most scary sci fi movies from the 80s. Directed by Peter Jackson, the filmmaker who also directed The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogy, the entire population of a small village is eradicated and replaced by literally big-headed aliens who search for human flesh for their intergalactic fast food chain.Very goofy in terms of looks but does tend to give a vibe as something dark and sinister. Due to an alien experiment, these alien brain parasites are created that try to turn their hosts into mindless zombies and spread the infection further.Very basic in concept but executed well in terms of expressing the horrors of the situation. A construction worker comes across a pair of sunglasses that, in a manner of speaking, help him see the truth in the world.What is the truth? Well that is something that I feel like you should watch the film to find out as it leads to very horrific events and even some mild satire of the world as we know it even now. A game designer, who is targeted by a group of assassins, is forced to test her virtual reality game to observe whether the game is damaged or not. Some scientists develop the resonator, which is a device that can help humans witness essentially what is beyond their visible reality.However, things take a turn for the worst as they are attacked by these unknown life forms after the experiment succeeds. You can have a lot of entertainment from a story like this and it does pull its punches when it comes to the scares.",Fajar Lodhi
2016-03-21,http://chillopedia.com/kids-section/how-smartphone-light-affects-your-childs-brain-and-body/,How Smartphone Light Affects Your Child’s Brain and Body,"In a world where the influence of technology plays a vital role in almost every aspect of life, it is only natural that the general population is equipped with digital gadgets to help run their lives. Smartphones have become such an essential item for every individual that they simply cannot survive without it. Other than offering basic services such as instant telecommunications and messaging, it also serves as a personalized link to the vast virtual world. Smartphones allow people to stay connected to each other and get updated on the latest happenings around the world.Statistics show that smartphone users have been rapidly increasing on a yearly basis ever since its introduction to the public, with the current value hovering around the 2 billion mark. Analysts forecast that by the year 2019, the total number of smartphone holders will exceed 2.6 billion. With this booming usage and vast range of attractions that a smartphone offers to teenagers, its very common to see your kids getting addicted to their smartphones. Being a parent, you must have thought about how smartphone light affects your child’s brain and body and this is exactly what we are going to analyze today. Smartphones are not only limited to serving the working population, but the younger generations have also jumped on the bandwagon. They are no longer satisfied with Barbie Dolls or Legos; they demand to have their smartphones to connect with their friends and to play the latest games available on the virtual market. In the past where kids used to sleep with their favorite toys, they are now going to bed with the latest smartphone model instead.Based on a survey conducted in the United States, 63% of the participants admitted keeping their phones nearby even during their sleeping hours. Most people might argue that this is a necessity given that their smartphones function as they personal alarm system as well. Others seemingly brush it off as a matter of convenience, to check their phones for the latest technology news right before they head to bed and to be alerted of any new notifications the moment they wake up.Regardless of the reasons, scientists have released new findings that show the harmful effects of this obsessive behavior towards smartphones. While these effects affect the general population, its impact is magnified when applied to adolescents are more vulnerable to external factors that affect their health condition. In research conducted by the Department of Psychology, University of Basel, Switzerland, scientists established that excessive use of smartphones at night increases the risk of depression and disturbed sleep patterns in adolescents. The participant pool consisted of the following:Naturally, those who owned smartphones recorded higher usage of these electronic devices and led to delayed sleeping hours. More notably, scientists discovered a strong relationship between electronic use, sleep difficulty and depression symptoms. Those who spend their last conscious moments on their smartphones recorded shorter sleep duration but increased difficulties in falling asleep. This association led to the development of depressive symptoms.A separate study conducted by the Warrington College of Business Administration, University of Florida, United States also echoed similar findings. The authors found that people who utilize their smartphones late into the night recorded lower levels of productivity the next morning. According to the Lighting Research Center at the Rensselaer Institute, this phenomenon is due to the short wavelengths of optical radiations that are emitted by the smartphones. These wavelengths suppress melatonin levels that cause a disruption in the normal sleep cycle. To accurately identify the effects of these radiated wavelengths, a small pool of 13 participants were tasked to use their electronic devices in the following 3 ways:At the end of the experiment, participants who were fitted with the orange tinted goggles recorded higher levels of melatonin in their body. This means that even though all participants had used electronic devices for the same amount of time, filtering out the harmful wavelengths can help to eliminate the suppression of melatonin and help to restore normal sleep patterns. This theory was further established by the Harvard Medical School. The ever-decreasing age of smartphone users has made quite a few world news headlines in the recent past. Most traditional adults view it as an unnecessary equipment for the younger generation and believe that parents are only spoiling their kids by giving in to their demands.Other than being obscenely expensive, parents now have a more urgent reason to deny their children of this privilege. Scientists have discovered that the glare from smartphones suppresses melatonin levels in the body and can adversely affect a child’s sleep cycle and lead to the prevalence of depression symptoms. While this can be prevented by actively controlling their usage hours, it is more prudent to deny simply them of this luxury. Ultimately, the health consequences far outweigh the short-term gratitude from the child.",Margaux Diaz
2016-03-10,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/15-great-movies-almost-made-by-a-different-director/,15 Great Movies Almost Made by a Different Director,"The entire landscape of any movie lies on the shoulders of the director. Despite being the most unnoticeable contributor of the project, it is the director’s brilliance that can catapult a movie from ashes to glory. Take a look at the following 15 great movies almost made by a different director: Best known for dark and gothic movies such as Sleepy Hollow and Corpse Bride, the very idea of Jurassic Park being directed by Tim Burton is bizarre. No disrespect to the director, but the last thing a dinosaur flick needs is the traditional horror elements that Burton is so famous for adding in his movies.Had Burton availed the opportunity, he would probably would have his best buddy Johnny Depp star as Alan Grant. Things certainly happened for the best when Universal Studios granted Steven Spielberg with the task as the movie won three Academy Awards and established itself as one for the ages. It is hard to imagine Good Will Hunting being directed by someone else than Gus Van Sant. The artistic beauty of the film was magnificently captured to the point of nine Academy Award nominations and two wins.Back then, Mel Gibson was at the top of his game as a director. Having won an Academy Award for Best Picture by directing Braveheart (1995), the actor-turned-director was the top contender for director the movie but unfortunately, things did not turn out. A director the world has never seen before or since, everything Stanley Kubrick did was visionary. Throughout his illustrious career, the American film-maker has touched many subjects but never a western movie.He finally had the opportunity to do so when none other than Marlon Brando discussed the idea of a film-adaption of The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones. With tensions rising while they worked on the script for six months, Kubrick distanced himself from the project and Brando promoted himself as the director only to receive mixed reviews. It was then 26-year-old Steven Spielberg’s career defining movie but things could have been much different if Dick Richards successfully directed the most iconic shark movie of all time, Jaws.Producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown were very much interested in him but became irritated by his constant referring to shark as a whale.After booting Richards off the project, the young but ambitious Spielberg was given the responsibility of the director and he pulled it off amazingly. As observed from the awful Superman Returns, welcoming back the Son of Krypton as a movie icon was no easy matter. When Man of Steel was on the verge of being the first movie for the DC Extended Universe, Darren Aronofsky almost handled the project.Best known for Noah and Black Swan, Aronofsky probably would have made the project great considering the fact that the director has a knack for presenting broken-hearted characters as heroic idols with absolute perfection. However, director Zack Snyder of Watchmen and 300 fame was hired and came up with the most critically praised Super-Man movie ever. For sure everyone would want the acclaimed director Steven Spielberg to be the director of Harry Potter. However, they would change their mind after knowing that Spielberg wanted to make it an animated film which included elements from the follow-up novels.If that happened, the world would have been robbed from one of the greatest movie franchises of all time. Not reaching to an agreement, Spielberg soon declined and recalled the project as “shooting ducks in a barrel.” As the director of two of the highest grossing movies of all time Titanic and Avatar it would certainly be interesting to see how James Cameron would have handled Spider-Man.Just imagine the web-slinging superhero taking off his mask and revealing himself as Edward Furlong. That does not sound good but believe it or not, the drug addicted actor was the ideal leading choice by Cameron.Though the director went as far as writing a screenplay for the movie, the project was stuck in development hell for several years and almost abandoned. When Cameron left, his script was entirely rewritten and gave Sam Raimi the chance to make Spider-Man a household name again. Alfred Hitchcock has an impeccable record when it comes to making films which are a financial and critical success but it can be safely assumed that making a movie about the Titanic disaster was not his cup of tea.When Hitchcock was just a rookie in the movie industry, the director aimed to make a movie upon the infamous incident but plans fell apart and made Rebecca instead.",Tayyab Khalil
2016-02-22,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/15-movie-adaptions-which-missed-important-stuff/,15 Movie Adaptions Which Missed Important Stuff,"The translation of a best-selling novel to film adaptation is not always an easy task. Hungry for ratings while making sure that only the essential stuff is packed in the movie, the original work is not always served with justice when it comes to making films. The following are the 15 movie adaptions which missed important stuff: Call him a freedom fighter or an anarchist, V is one anti-hero that the moviegoers and comic book readers adore too much. Perhaps the finest character of Vertigo Comics, his 2006 political thriller movie V For Vendetta was based upon the graphic novel of the same name.The movie made several changes from the novel with the most notable one being Inspector Finch finding out V’s plans by trying out LSD in a concentration camp while in the movie, the law-men sympathizes with the criminal and even helps him. After President Abraham Lincoln leaves for Ford’s Theatre, the movie leaps forward to present time and ends right there. However, the novel Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter had much more interesting to offer. After leaving for Ford’s Theatre, Lincoln is assassinated.Unlike the movie, the novel leaps a century later where Henry Sturges and Lincoln attend Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial. The President did die but was resurrected as a vampire by Henry who believed that “some men are just too interesting to die”. The movie ends with Alex in a hospital being de-conditioned but there is more to the story in the novel written by Anthony Burgess.The final chapter reveals that the sociopath was not really cured but became tired of his violent and reckless ways as he grew older. In fact, Alex desired to be a productive member of the society and start a family. Directed by David Fincher, Fight Club ended with the narrator shooting through his cheek in order to kill Tyler Durden and sees the buildings collapsing while holding Marla Singer’s hand.Nothing like that happens in the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. After he shoots himself, the narrator wakes up in a hospital and sees the staff. They reveal themselves to be the members of Project Mayhem who are expecting Tyler to return. Directed by Spike Lee, the 1992 biographical film Malcolm X was a great presentation of the African-American human rights activist. Starring Denzel Washington as the title role, it was arguably his greatest performance ever.Based upon The Autobiography of Malcolm X, the movie missed the part how the Muslim Minister took the underdog boxer Cassius Clay – who would later become Muhammad Ali and win the World Heavyweight Championship under his wing and convinced him to join the Nation of Islam. Receiving critical acclaim and making a ton of money, The Avengers was an innovation in superhero movies as it teamed up some of the greatest Marvel Comics superhero of all time: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow.Believe it or not, not all of them were the first recruits of the superhero team in the comics as Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow were not in it. Ant-Man and Wasp were. Due to being overshadowed by the ones shown in the movie, Marvel Studios made the right choice to snub them from the team. Unlike the rest of the entries, The Silence of the Lambs is known for its great accuracy for its translation from novel to movie so why is it even in the list? Because of a slightly altered yet iconic quote said by Dr. Hannibal Lecter.When Agent Clarice Starling visits the cannibal in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Lecter states,However, Lecter never says chianti in the novel. Instead, he says Amarone. Beginning to stale, the X-Men franchise needed a savior and luckily, director Bryan Singer arrived to save the day and came up with an awesome film adaptation of the comic book storyline X-Men: Days of Future Past.Wolverine goes in the past to confront familiar young mutants including arch-rivals Professor X and Magneto and convinces to work together in order to prevent the extinction of their species.However, in the comic book, Wolverine never went back in time. Kitty Pryde did. So why was Hugh Jackman chosen to carry out the duties intended for Ellen Page? Probably because the muscular and dramatic Jackman can sell more tickets than the short and innocent Page.",Tayyab Khalil

They have come up with a great product placements Oscars infographic that highlights the brands used in the few blockbusters in recent years: Quentin Tarantino one of the most celebrated directors of our generation, came up with the cool idea of product placement in movies, when he ventured into this business, he invented his own brand of products that he uses in all his movies, like Red apple cigarettes in “Reservoir Dogs”, Big Kahuna Burger joint in “Pulp Fiction”, and ”From Dusk till Dawn”, but we aren’t talking about fictitious brands, sorry Quentin, if it was the case you were the sure shot winner. So get ready for the first category of awards, ‘The Michael Bay Award’ (for the most products placements in a single movie), and this award is named after Michael Bay because of his long history with brand placements in all his movies.The nominees were ‘Entourage’, ‘Transformers: Age of Extinction’ (directed by Michael Bay), ‘Furious 7’, and ‘San Andreas’, and the winner in this category was ‘Entourage’ with 65 product placements, beating the guy, that we named our award after. Entourage is the king of product placements, ranging from categories like Caps, Foods, Drinks, Watches, Mobile Phones, Cars, T-shirts and Sunglasses, and much more.Then we have hardest working brand in movies, we have done some research and found out which brand works hard, and is visible in most of the blockbusters. The nominees were, Samsung, Apple, BMW. The award was given on the basis of screen time, BMW finished last with 8.20 mins, Apple finished second with 11.17 mins of screen time, and the winner was Samsung with whopping 14.17 mins of screen time in last year’s seven blockbusters.Best watch product placement nominees were, ‘Spectre’ starring Daniel Craig as James Bond which used Omega watch, ‘Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation’ starring Tom Cruise which used Tissot watch, and third was ‘The Martian’ starring Matt Damon which used Hamilton watches. And last but not the least, best tech and communications product placement nominees being Samsung and Apple, and yet again Samsung was the winner.We are proud of the winners and equally proud of the nominees. Brand placement is a great marketing strategy, but we just don’t want it to overshadow the movie itself. The placements need to be done in a way that it doesn’t affect the movie. We hope you like our product placement Oscars infographic featured today:",Heather Johnson
2016-02-01,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/35-best-revenge-movies-of-all-time/,35 Best Revenge Movies of All Time,"Nothing beats a good revenge movie, you know why most people like movies about revenge? That’s because we all have some kind of grudge in the back of our mind, whether it be a betrayal or broken heart, we all have, for at least once in our life, thought of seeking revenge from someone. Sometimes all we want in a movie is to see someone beating the hell out of someone you don’t like, as the saying goes “Revenge is Best Served Cold”. So without further ado, here is a list of 35 best revenge movies of all time: Not many people talk about Payback these days which actually is a disgrace, truly, given that actor Mel Gibson’s (as Porter) action flick is seen at the top of his acting career, whose acting seems to be more appealing, badass and of course out for some serious revenge.The movie was the directorial debut for Brian Helgeland and was based on the novel The Hunter by Donald E. Westlake. The plot revolves around Porter, who sets out seeking revenge on those who had betrayed him after a heist had gone wrong. Payback is the very definition of a vengeance flick of the underestimated kind. Certainly one of the best revenge films from the British shores, directed by Shane Meadows it is an immeasurably depressing  and hard to ignore kitchen sink drama-like story of an ex-soldier’s mission to seek vengeance on those who had wronged his disabled brother.The performance of lead actor Paddy Considine (as Richard) is what really makes the movie what it is. He brilliantly portrays a man who is completely possessed by his desire to give what is owed to those who had victimized his family. It is by far one of the greatest, most thoroughly amusing example of bloodthirsty 80’s action, revenge filled stories directed by Mark L. Lester and starring the one and only Arnold Schwarzenegger as John Matrix. This movie was the 7th highest-grossing R-Rated film of 1985 worldwide. Its considered a cult classic when it comes to the best revenge movies and one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of all time.When John Matrix’s, a retired elite Black Ops Commando, daughter is kidnapped by a group of South American criminals to blackmail him into starting a revolution to allow an exiled dictator to regain power, he launches a one man war against them. It’s one of the most successful and well-known revenge movie in the film industry which sparked four sequels. Based on the novel Death Wish by Brian Garfield, it is an American vigilante action film directed by Michael Winner starring Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey, who previously being a liberal turns into a vigilante after his wife gets murdered and his daughter gets raped during a home invasion.When this movie was released it was attacked by many film critics as it supported vigilantism, but nevertheless, the film was a commercial success and has been considered as a cult film and generated a strong following amongst vigilante films fans, who honor it as the first film to present the idea of “pedestrian” vigilante. Dogville is a Danish innovative drama film by Lars Von Trier, starring Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany. It is a story that uses and extremely insignificant, stage-like set to tell the tale of Grace Mulligan (Kidman), a woman hiding from gangsters, who happens to arrive in a small town of Dogville, Colorado, and is provided shelter in return for her physical labor.This movie was in competition for the ‘Palme d’Or’ at Cannes Film Festival 2003 but eventually lost to Gus Van Sant’s ‘Elephant’. In the sight & sound polls 2012, six critics and three directors named Dogville as one of the best movies ever made. This is an American dramatized historical film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring the Legendary ‘Leonardo di Caprio’ as Amsterdam Vallon. It was nominated for many awards, including Academy award for Best Picture.It revolves around Amsterdam Vallon, who in order to seek revenge for his father’s death against Bill ‘The Butcher’, returns to New York. Daniel Day Lewis’ relentless and vicious acting as Bill, might be one of the best movie villains of all time. Ridley’s Scott’s inspiring sword and heroic movie, Gladiator is a vengeance flick of the highest order starring Russel Crowe as Maximus. It is somewhat of a B-movie disguised as an ancient epic and the lines between fiction and fact get blurred amongst the dreadful violence where Maximus’s rage shows no bound.The sum of the movie guarantees that maximus quest for vengeance from the people who murdered his family will end in bloody satisfaction. This is an adventurous dramatic movie directed by Kevin Reynolds and is taken from the book of the same name by Alexandre Dumas, starring Jim Caviezel as Edmond who was deceived and thrown into prison on wrong accusations by the dreadful traitor Fernand (played by Guy Pearce).This movie has no bad-ass one-liners, no gun battles, no kidnapped daughters or murdered partners, rather its the story of a man deceived by everyone he loved and he rebuilds his entire life’s purpose on one thing, Vengeance. Mad Max illustrates a dreadful form of Australia in which biker gangs’ intent on destroying and burning the hell out of what is left of humanity. Mel Gibson plays as Max, a man who finds himself drawn into the path of revenge when his wife, best friend and daughter are murdered. The pursuit for vengeance devours every inch of his being.Gibson’s performance as Max is by turns, overwhelming, unhinged and dramatic. The film itself, directed by George Miller, holds up to this day. As much as vengeance and its associated madness is concerned, Mad Max is hard to beat. If you’re looking for a quiet and understanding film that goes into revenge, disgrace and honor, then this is the movie for you. Directed by Takashi Miike, it is a 3D remake of the film Hara-kiri (1962).It tells the story of a poor Samurai, who asks for an honorable death by ritual suicide from his lord, but gets threatened in return which leads to some extraordinary fearsome sword fights. This was the first movie to be shown in 3D at the Cannes Film Festival (2011).",Daniyal Ahmed

Gaining popularity in the movie industry day by day, nothing beats the stealth and precision in the adored but lethal weapon. Though there are dozens of movies featuring some amazing sniper stories and the sniper weapon, but its quite difficult to find stories based on true events. Take a look at the 7 best sniper movies based on true stories: For a television movie, D.C. Sniper: 23 Days of Fear packs quite a punch. Director of Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives Dave Erickson reminds the audience how dreadful were the 2002 Beltway sniper attacks.Holding Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. in a “grip of terror”, murderers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo engage in a killing spree and leave the citizens in a state of shock.After tireless efforts of Chief Charles Moose of the Montgomery County Police Department bear fruit, the two criminals are brought to justice despite being the archetypal “least likely suspects”. In his directional debut, John Moore starts with a bang as he came up with Behind Enemy Lines. Loosely based upon the Mrkonjić Grad incident that happened during the war in Bosnia in 1995, comedy actor Owen Wilson dons a serious role for a change by starring as Lieutenant Chris “Longhorn” Burnett.After poking his nose where it did not belong, Burnett gets shot down on his helicopter and must outrun a pursuing army lead by a hardcore Serbian sniper who will stop at nothing to find him. With his rescue operation being constrained by internal politics, the chances of Burnett are extremely minimal.With all honesty, Behind Enemy Lines generally received negative reviews because of the cliché ridden script, less than credible plot and abundance of action scenes that resembled an action video game but earned nearly $92 million from a budget of $40 million and even spawned three sequels. Based upon U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford’s memoir of the same name, the 2005 biographical drama military movie Jarhead perfectly showcases how difficult the life of a sniper can be. Starring none other than Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford, the U.S. Marine dreams of being a sniper are fulfilled only to face the nightmares that come along with it.Struck with boredom, Swofford gets the chance at horrific sights such as demolition, storms, war, casualties, burnt bodies and all that jazz during the First Persian Gulf War of 1991. Almost losing it when he nearly kills a man, Swofford must accept the arduous life that comes with being a man of the military. The story of Lyudmila Pavlichenko is a unique one as not many women can proudly call themselves a sniper. The Soviet female warrior joined the Red Army in order to battle the Nazi invasion of the USSR and became one of the deadliest snipers during World War II.The joint Russian-Ukrainian biographical movie Battle for Sevastopol is a magnificent display of her bravery and patriotism but leading actress Yulia Peresild serves as the real deal for the portrayal. With more than 160 officially confirmed kills by the Department of Defense, United States Navy SEAL Chris Kyle is regarded as the most lethal sniper in U.S. Military history. Life of the decorated sniper was the concern of the biographical war movie American Sniper.Directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, the movie was based upon the most popular sniper stories from Iraq War and upon the memoir American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. From being taught by his father how to shoot a rifle and hunt deer to his death by the hands of a veteran he “was trying to help”, the movie might be the most accurate if not the best sniper movie based on actual events.As one of the most talked-about movies of its time, American Sniper was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor but only managed to win one for Best Sound Editing. Starring Mark Wahlberg, Lone Survivor proves that messing with Taliban is not an easy pickle at all. Set in war in Afghanistan and showcasing the dreadful failure of United States Navy SEALs counter-insurgent mission Operation Red Wings, it shows that even America faces defeat once in a while.With the mission to track down and kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah, Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell and his sniper team are prepared to face the humanity-threatening outlaw with the aid of state-of-the-art warfare gadgets only to fail miserably.Despite having a limited release, Lone Survivor had a strong financial success and earned positive responses from critics alike to the point of Academy Award nominations for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing. Even after fifteen years of its release, Enemy at the Gates continues to inspire and enthrall every movie goer who searches for entertainment in not just sniper movies but also war movies.The movie chronicles the events of a Soviet sniper and a Hero of the Soviet Union Vasily Zaytsev. Set in World War II, Vasly is a nightmare for the Germans and does not even spare some time for second thoughts before taking them out one by one.Not an ordinary war movie, things get complicated when the Soviet Hero and Commisar Danilov fell in love with the same female solider Tania Chernova. Though filled with a few historical inaccuracies, Enemy at the Gates stands out as the best sniper movie ever that is based on true events. Did you like our list of the best sniper movies based on true stories?

2016-02-11,http://chillopedia.com/technology/how-to-spot-a-fake-apple-watch-infographic/,How To Spot A Fake Apple Watch [Infographic],"Top brand products throughout the world are being faked all the time these days, however, there are some very obvious tell-tale signs of replicas when you know what to look for. Apple product replicas are nothing new and have been around for quite a while now. And, with booming replica industry its no big deal to come across an unethical vendor that tries to sell a replica product as the original. Lets find out how to spot a fake Apple Watch: From a distance a clone may look impressive, but on closer inspection you will find that the design and functions may be similar, however, when it comes to performance and quality they are miles apart. Size matters when it comes to spotting a fake. Counterpart watches are typically bulkier, heavier and bigger than the genuine article. Turn the watch over and you will see that clone watches do not have heart rate sensors, two line speaker or a microphone. The sides of the fakes usually have cheap crowns, often not digital, and they may even be on the wrong side. The front display screen will also give you an indication as to authenticity. The clone watch displays are often more reflective off screen, they have poor resolution and the Apple image are merely static photos. Open the back of the watch and it will be blatantly obvious whether you are looking at the real deal. Fake watches have a tendency to look messy, not Apple slick. They have a normal battery and no Apple branding. The wristband is also an area to examine. A real Apple watch has an interchangeable band with a chrome radial finish, whereas you will be unable to change the band on a clone and it looks cheap and tinny. There are lots of ways to spot a clone Apple Watch, apart from the lower price, once you know what to look for. Our featured infographic today shows exactly how to spot a genuine Apple Watch from a clone. Take a look:",Heather Johnson
2016-02-08,http://chillopedia.com/interesting/where-are-the-biggest-data-centers-in-the-world-located-infographic/,Where Are The Largest Data Centers In The World Located ? [Infographic],"At this point, even larger companies, with their own private data centers or in-house server setups, are starting to move more and more of their computing and their websites to third-party data centers; what some are calling the migration to the cloud. The result? A huge upsurge in the size and number of data centers the world over. And with the total number of websites expected to exceed 1 billion in the coming year, anyone can see why the quantity of data centers is not only growing, but the centers themselves are becoming massive. Here today we take a look at the geographical location of the largest data centers in the world: Some of the largest data centers in the world, and those that are just being built, house a complex maze of cooling and networking systems, beyond the hundreds (or thousands) of servers alone.For example, the data centers that are being built over the next few years make the current largest data centers seem small. Facilities like the Lakeside Technology Center in Chicago, Illinois and the SUPERNAP facility in Las Vegas, Nevada touted being the largest data centers in the world with more than 1 million square feet a piece. Their nearest competitor usually only came in at around 400,000 – 600,000 square feet, which is still pretty impressive.These days, though, data center companies with less than a million square feet don’t even make for being called ‘big’. There are data centers now in the works that will involve campuses of buildings with square feet totaling in the millions and they will have the flexibility to add more space as needs increase and more servers are added. By next year, centers with only 1-2 million square feet will likely have dropped off the lists of the world’s largest data centers.But that’s not all. The map doesn’t give us an idea of places like the Data Center Alley in Loudon County, VA. According to Loudoun County’s Office of Economic Development, as much as 70 percent of the internet traffic, from all over the world, flows through their data centers every day. This might seem a tad unbelievable at first, but it becomes a little more so when you realize that traffic hogs like Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon all rent or own some major data real estate in the area, along with about 3,000 other tech companies. And Loudoun isn’t the only place like this. Hohhot, Inner Mongolia has a facility similar to the Digital Realty Ashburn Campus and the DuPont Fabros Ashburn Corporate Center (ACC), which are among some of the largest data centers in the world with huge storage and processing capabilities, right now.With all of these data center edens springing up, Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) will almost inevitably begin to dominate the market by the end of this decade, making data centers the lifeblood of business as we know it. So, in this day and age, where your website can be your entire livelihood, it is now more important than ever to be able to identify a reliable website host and stay informed about how their infrastructure works and how they’re measuring up.The map below shows us some of the largest data centers in the world, who owns them, and how big they are in size, but it’s more than just that. You see, most small website owners and small businesses don’t choose to run their own servers due to the hassle and expense of purchasing, setting up, and managing them. It’s more cost effective — not to mention convenient — to find a data center or web hosting company that is already running a farm of these machines and the networks we need for our sites:",Heather Johnson
2016-01-25,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/15-questions-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-better-answer/,15 Questions Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Better Answer,"God vs. Man. Night vs. Day. The Son of Krypton vs. Batman of Gotham. It is the most debated question among die-hard comic book readers and involves two of the greatest superheroes of all time. Surely Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is the most anticipated movie in a really long while and will hit theaters next year. With two trailers released so far, numerous questions have been asked which will hopefully be answered with the release of the movie. The following are the 15 questions Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice better answer: Unlike several villains and even sidekicks, Commissioner Jim Gordon is a very vital component of the Batman mythos. As a non-superhero supporting character of the Dark Knight, the importance of Gordon ranks almost equal to the faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth.Gordon has appeared in all of Batman film adaptions and even has its own show Gotham. As it turns out, the character will not be in Batman v Superman but his absence must be addressed regardless of being alive or dead in the DC Extended Universe. Even a casual fan of Batman can recognize that Robin’s costume was shown in the trailer with the words “HA HAHA Jokes On You Batman” written on it. The first look may give the idea that the Joker had something to do with the beloved sidekick.If that is true, that makes Boy Wonder and the Clown Prince of Crimes essentially important to the story. The movie might involve the part of the storyline Batman: Death in the Family in which Joker severely beats Jason Todd to death but that is just a possibility. When the sneak peek was released, it showed an angry Superman taking the mask off Batman somewhere in the desert.Fans have speculated that the whole thing was just a dream sequence since the soldiers had the ‘S’ logo on their arms. It is no secret that the Dark Knight is a man of many enemies. Since the trailers have not given even a slight hint on who sent Bruce Wayne the “You Let Your Family Die’ message, it is possible for director Zack Snyder to introduce a surprise villain.It cannot be Lex Luthor since he does not hold any beef against the Billionaire Playboy nor it can be Clark Kent. Such a thing seems too cruel for Superman to do. What are the odds of Jason Todd – the fourth Robin – sending that message? It seems likely and connects with the Robin costume shown in the trailer. Apart from the epic superhero battle, Batman v Superman promises to plant the seeds of Justice League. Apart from Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Aquaman will join the band.With two trailers released, the King of the Seven Seas is nowhere to be seen. So where is Aquaman and from where will he come from? How does the Marine Marvel fit in the DC Extended Universe? Has not Batman seen enough freaks for one day?Speaking of Aquaman, it is speculated that the superhero played a major role in Man of Steel and nobody noticed it! Remember Clark Kent being taken to the shores by whales? It is a strong possibility that Aquaman – who can communicate with sea animals – ordered the whales to take Kent safely to the shores and it is even a stronger possibility that the two superheroes already got to know each other off-screen. Speaking of Justice League, Aquaman is not the only member being added to the group. So is Victor Stone aka Cyborg. However, the character was also not spotted in the two trailers of the movie.Portrayed by Ray Fisher, Cyborg will not only appear in Batman v Superman but will be a vital part of the DC Extended Universe by appearing in both Justice League films and a standalone movie of his own. If there is one thing that can make Superman worry and feeble, it is the green, glowing space rock known as Kryptonite – The Man of Steel’s one weakness.Utilized by several foes and even Batman to take down the superhero in comics, it is interesting to see the presence of the rock in the movie.The second movie trailer shows Kryptonite for a slight instance as a commodity of Lex Luthor but how did he get it in the first place? In Man of Steel, Superman made it clear to the United States of America that he was not the enemy but their savior. With that said and done, what obliges the superhero to appear in a court as shown in the trailer?Did Superman commit a crime? Or is he being ordered to take down the masked vigilante? Or perhaps something much worse?",Tayyab Khalil

Take a look at the 15 best Al Pacino movies of all time: When Christopher Nolan sits in the director’s chair, the fans know that they are definitely in for something special and if Al Pacino is his leading star, then that is surely icing to the cake.When a 17-year old girl is found murdered in Nightmute, Alaska, it is up to two detectives from Los Angeles Police Department to solve the case only to find out more than what they expected.Though Pacino did not appear in any of the future movies of Nolan unlike many actors who are frequently employed for his projects, it was unprecedented to see the great actor and director teaming up together for the psychological thriller movie. Even after passing his prime, Al Pacino manages to steal the spotlight despite having an ensemble cast of Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quad, James Woods, Aaron Eckhart, Marty Wright, LL Cool J, Ann-Margret, Matthew Modine and Elizabeth Berkley.Portraying Tony D’Amato, Head Coach of the Miami Sharks, the actor gives a tremendous performance as the instructor who dedicates his time so much for the team that he gets estranged with his own family. At age 70, Al Pacino starred in television movie You Don’t Know Jack.

In The Devil’s Advocate, the actor takes the cake as plays none other than Satan himself.Directed by Taylor Hackford, the movie stars Matrix star Keanu Reeves as a defense attorney who sees his life drastically turning over after he unknowingly makes the deal with the devil. Honesty is the best policy and Serpico shows exactly that. Starring Al Pacino as the real-life New York Police Department officer Frank Serpico, the character blows the whistle on the police corruption.The crime drama film Serpico received two Academy Awards nominations including one for Best Actor for Pacino. Though the actor failed to win it, he won his first Golden Globe award for Best Actor. Based on the novels Carlito’s Way and After Hours by Judge Edwin Torres, the movie revolves around Carlito Brigante, a criminal released from prison after vowing to turn over a new leaf and leaving the life of crime.The criminal finds himself unable to do so and eventually gets dragged back to the same felonious activities that got him locked up in prison the first place.

2016-01-24,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/15-recasts-better-than-the-original/,15 Recasts Better Than The Original,"The entire weight of a movie lies on the shoulders of the actors and hiring them for roles can be a difficult task. Whether it is because of hectic schedules, backstage politics or even drained performances, Hollywood has seen making considerable decisions of recasting actors. Though most of them do not work out, the following are the 15 recasts better than the original: Making his first appearance as a hologram in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Sidious was ironically portrayed by a female actor Elaine Baker and voiced by Clive Revill.Not so surprisingly, when the paled-face emperor of the Galactic Empire was required for a larger role in the sequel Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, the Scottish actor Ian McDiarmid was hired and gave a terrific performance.In fact, the actor reprised the role again three times for the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Due to being one of the best characters of the trilogy, director and creator of the franchise George Lucas digitally inserted the actor as Darth Sidious in the DVDs of The Empire Strikes Back. The 1992 comedy horror film Buffy the Vampire Slayer starred Kristy Swanson as Buffy Summers, a cheerleaders who learns about her fate of being a vampire hunter. Receiving mixed to negative reviews, the movie was anything but good and writer Joss Whedon recreated the movie as a television show with a much darker theme.Among the changes he made, Whedon dared to recast the lead role of Buffy which landed to Sarah Michelle Gellar. Running for seven seasons, the show was met with critical acclaim and made Gellar a household name. Portrayed by seven different actors, James Bond is one of the most iconic characters in Hollywood and it has never been an easy task to find the right man for the job. With Die Another Day receiving insanely terrible reviews, Pierce Brosnan had no choice but to step down as Agent 007.Aiming to find someone who could fill Bond’s shoes, Daniel Craig was hired and the fans expressed their negativity with great backlash. On the contrary, Craig made everyone eat their words as he not only become a better casting choice but also the highest paid actor to portray James Bond and reprised the role three more times. Edward Norton is one of the most revered actors today and his casting as Dr. Bruce Banner aka The Hulk was thought to be one of the wisest casting decisions by Marvel Studios. However, when The Avengers was on the verge of being released, Norton was replaced by Mark Ruffalo.Constantly insisting to rewrite scripts of The Incredible Hulk, the studio was forced to remove their leading star. No doubt that Norton is a much better actor and his intensity is amazing when it comes to dramatic roles, but the role of the Hulk did not suit him at all. Amazingly enough, Ruffalo surpassed Norton as the Hulk and a vital component of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tim Burton’s Batman and Batman Returns starring Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader were met with positive response but were criticized for their dark portrayal of the franchise.When Joel Schumacher was called to make the sequel with a lighter tone, Keaton left the project and Val Kilmer was hired to fill the void. While the actor portrayed Batman as good as Keaton, he certainly portrayed a better Bruce Wayne than. Professional Wrestling is a lot like action movies. Both involve a hero, villain, storylines and of course fight scenes. Furthermore, wrestling has its fair share of recasts as well. One in particular is Hunico as the high-flying WWE superstar Sin Cara.Originally portrayed by Mexican wrestler Místico, the character was the hottest induction of WWE but proved to be a major mistake because of continuously botching during his matches. After eventually being fired, WWE stuck with the character and gave Hunico the chance that Místico never successfully capitalized.Handling the character with great responsibility and athleticism, Hunico’s Sin Cara continues to wrestle in WWE to this day as a part of the high-flying team Lucha Dragons. War Machine is one of the best supporting characters of Iron Man and it is a great surprise how Terrence Howard casually handled the role in the 2008 Iron Man movie.For the sequel, Rhodey was recasted as Don Cheadle being a comic book fan accepted the role within hours despite not even knowing what the character would do. Sabretooth is an arch-nemesis of the X-Men and it was terrible to see the character as Magneto’s hired muscle in X2: X-Men United. In fact, the comic book villain was portrayed by a mere stuntman named Tyler Mane.When X-Men Origins: Wolverine was announced, everyone knew Sabretooth will return to the silver screen. While the character did, Mane did not return as Liev Schreiber portrayed Victor Creed.Though the movie was met with mixed to negative reviews, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was able to do a few things right and casting Schreiber as Sabretooth was one of them.",Tayyab Khalil
2016-01-21,http://chillopedia.com/technology/5-things-to-be-kept-in-mind-while-buying-apple-gadgets/,5 Things to be Kept in Mind While Buying Apple Gadgets,"Although the Cupertino based tech giant has a very successful line of gadgets that are usually way ahead of their competition but it’s also a very established fact that Apple’s products are relatively expensive. Here today we are going to discuss some points that you should keep in mind while buying Apple gadgets: All that initial enthusiasm over the first iPhone has rapidly given way to what experts are dubbing “upgrade weakness”, with even Apple’s most reliable customers upset about the stable stream of fresher models. When people purchase Apple’s latest gadgets, the company is usually already making its replacement, says latest technology news.Everything a customer purchases from Apple is technically already out of date as its newer version is already on its way. Obviously, newer models have their advantages: They’re usually thinner, faster and have extra features like better cameras and better screen quality.However, that isn’t sufficient to please some cash-strapped customers. Nearly 50% of customers say they’re increasingly reluctant to buy new products for the panic that they will be rendered outmoded by even newer versions, as said by a recent survey of thousands of people by Marketing Magazine in the United Kingdom. Checking a random Facebook update through iPhone during the feast is the least of some couple’s fears. One in five-people reach for their phone as a 21st Century substitute for the post-coital fag, according to a fresh report from mobile safety company LookOut.It’s one more thrilling example of how the smartphone has turned into a third wheel in relations. People find all kinds of ways to get back to their private space. But obviously, it’s a problem if someone desires to check their iPhone in the bedroom. Not only do Apple’s gadgets tend to run costlier than those of rivals, but people also spend more using them. The normal iPhone owner, for instance, spends over 10 percent more on their monthly bills than other pre-paid smartphone customers as stated by estimates by CIRP.Holders of iPads also tend to use more at e-commerce places than other tablet users. iPad venders use $158 per order, the maximum order of any device vs. $105 by people on other mobile phone devices, according to a recent research by a personalized product reference company. Upgrading fatigue isn’t the only item critics dislike round Apple’s product rollouts; more or less say the new products aren’t fresh enough. Stockholders are growing impatient with Apple’s channel and calling for another technical revolution. It’s time for Apple to surprise victory the mobile market once more.Research says a totally new Apple phone that prices less than the $649 starting trade price for the iPhone 5S would be a decent start. Other deep-pinched tech companies are also dignified to compete with the iPhone along with their smartphones. Facebook is also supposedly considering designing its phone and Google, which took hold on Motorola’s patents even after selling it to Lenovo, is looking forward to some exciting Android powered Lenovo devices.Apple still has solid iPhone sales. However, no company should be so reliant on one mobile phone. The iPhone marketplace makes up over 50% of Apple’s trades, according to a study. Summon up when Nokia, Motorola and RIM commanded the mobile phone marketplace? Market share can alter very quickly.Another cause for a phone that concentrates the lower end of the marketplace: the days of carriers proposing massive subsidies to customers are numbered. If and when that occurs, the lot of people won’t pay $600 for a mobile phone. Apple disagrees. A corporation spokeswoman researched in February that despite its billing tag, iPhone 5S has been an unbelievable hit with consumers around the world. Smurfberries, that cybernetic red fruit that’s the main source of nourishment for Smurfs, may sound like cheap entertainment, but prices can add up. Madison Kay, an eight-year-old from Rockville consumed $1,400 purchasing Smurfberries while playing the particular game “Smurfs’ Village” on the household iPad, the Washington Post stated. As soon after complaining, her mom received a one-time repayment.These games are accessible in the App Store and stated to as free. They’re totally free to play, but only for a specific amount of time or before getting a certain level. Under the invigilation of Papa Smurf, folks like Madison are given the choice to buy Smurfberries to crack Smurfs and growth methods to construct their own Smurf Village. This can easily go out of hand if not monitored properly. What do you think should be kept in mind while buying Apple gadgets?

2016-01-17,http://chillopedia.com/celebs/15-most-perfect-comic-book-movie-castings-till-date/,15 Most Perfect Comic Book Movie Castings Till Date,"Movie adaption of comic books are the biggest money-making machines of Hollywood these days. It is not easy to translate the comic book stories into films unless careful casting decisions are done to make sure the characters are portrayed with justice. The following are the 15 most perfect comic book movie castings till date: Before comic book film adaptations were a big thing, Wesley Snipes was already starring as the vampire hunting superhero known as Blade. With an intimidating look and martial arts, the actor convincingly played the Marvel Comics superhero.While the first installment was great work of action, the same could not be said about the sequel and the third part was an overall disaster which killed the acting career of Snipes. Arrogant, smart, cocky and full of himself. These are some of the words that perfectly describe Tony Stark. Not only that, they are a perfect description of Hollywood A-lister Robert Downey, Jr. as well.So it made perfect sense that the actor was fit to play the part of Iron Man. The casting was great decision as Downey, Jr. received universal acclaim for the role and has proved himself as the most important piece of the puzzle known as Marvel Cinematic Universe. Dark Horse Comics is a home to many of the strangest characters ever and Marv is definitely one of them. Created by Frank Miller for the graphic novel series Sin City, the character is not someone anyone would like to meet in a dark alley.In the 2005 film adaptation and its 2014 sequel, Academy Award nominated actor Mickey Rourke played the menacing madman to the point of receiving appraisal for not only being a great comic book character but also a film character. After being cast as Johnny Storm aka The Human Torch in not one but two Fantastic Four disasters, one might think that Chris Evan would have chosen to say no to comic book roles in the future.On the contrary, he did exactly the opposite when offered the role of the most patriotic superhero of all time: Steve Rogers aka Captain America. Fans considered him a miscast but Evans made everyone eat their words as he magnificently portrayed the first Avenger.Exactly like his comic book counterpart, the actor beautifully showed how a weak but brave kid from Brooklyn enrolled in the Army and became the test subject of super soldier serum to become a superhero. For her first ever live-action appearance, Harley Quinn will debut in Suicide Squad portrayed by Margot Robbie. Incorporating the sweetness yet psychotic nature of the female adversary of Batman, the actress is the perfect choice for the Joker’s girlfriend.Though the movie version of Harley Quinn does not feature her in her much familiar red and black jester costume, it showcases her New 52 attire to give a realistic touch to the character. If you take a look at Anungun Rama aka Hellboy and then take a look at Ron Perlman. If you did n’t instantly think that the actor was born to play that devilish character then there is something seriously wrong with you.It was the role that defined a turning point in Perlman’s career and made it clear that the actor not only plays a good supporting character but can take a strong tone when given the task to take the lead role.Starring as the supernatural creature in Hellboy and its sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Perlman has continuously expressed interest in a possible third film but nothing is confirmed yet. Before Heath Ledger fan boys get a minor heart attack for the blasphemous entry, it should be reminded that the article showcases the actors who portrayed comic book characters with absolute accuracy.While Heath Ledger’s Joker was face-painted terrorist given a touch of realism, Jack Nicholson’s Joker was a criminal who fell into a vat of chemicals and emerged with bleached white skin, green hair and a permanent smile with red lips – exactly like the Clown Prince of Crime in the comics.From the origin story to the comedic nature of the deranged character, Nicholson was undoubtedly the perfect choice to portray the Joker during the production of the 1989 Batman movie. Unlike almost everyone in the list, Dennis Mitchel does not belong to a world of superheroes but still can be a handful for them if he becomes a bad guy. Dubbed as Dennis the Menace for a very good reason, the boy is one of the most famous comic strip characters of all time.The character has been portrayed by three different actors in three different live-action movies but it was Justin Cooper’s performance in Dennis the Menace Strikes Again the most convincingly perfect one.",Tayyab Khalil
2016-01-14,http://chillopedia.com/celebs/15-unrecognizable-movie-roles-of-famous-actors/,15 Unrecognizable Movie Roles of Famous Actors,"There really is no business like show business. Unlike a white-collar job, the professionals do not necessarily have to wear suits and ties for their day of work but have to dress as the characters they portray on film. Sometimes the character takes an odd tone and the actor’s transformation to the role is beyond recognition. Following are the 15 unrecognizable movie roles of famous actors that you should definitely checkout: With comedy in his blood, Eddie Murphy pulled off a terrific performance as Professor Sherman Klump, a morbidly obese research scientist who concocts a weight-loss pharmaceutical in The Nutty Professor.That was not the only unrecognizable role Murphy played onscreen as he also portrayed the Klump’s own father, mother, brother and grandmother. Like his main role of Klump, every other mentioned role too was unrecognizable! A veteran in the business, Gary Oldman nails all of his roles to perfection to the point of countless awards including one Academy Award nomination. Though the actor was nearly unrecognizable when he portrayed an old Count Dracula in Francis Ford Coppola’s Dracula, but it is his role of Mason Verger in Hannibal that caught the audience by surprise.Left paralyzed and savagely disfigured by Dr. Hannibal Lecter during a therapy session, Verger has a face not even a mother could love. Having no lips, eyelids or cheeks, even the makeup artist Greg Cannom called it “really disgusting.” The role of the Grinch portrayed by Jim Carrey is a fine example of how the power of makeup and costumes can transform an actor into something beyond recognition.Though the movie failed to get positive reviews, it was nominated for three Academy Awards and won one for Best Makeup that it so richly deserved. Carrey’s performance was well praised and won the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Comedy Actor. William Fichtner’s acting skills were put to test once again when he portrayed the ruthless and somewhat cannibalistic outlaw named Butch Cavindish in The Lone Ranger. Add Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer to the mix and you got one hell of an action western movie.With a torn lip, wig, raw accent and dirt all over the face, it was hard to differentiate between Fichtner playing Cavendish or just some scumbag cowboy from the west. Mary Shelley’s horror novel Frankenstein has been adapted into many movies and Kenneth Branagh’s Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is one of them. Starring Hollywood legend Robert De Niro as the monster created by Victor Frankenstein, it was amusing as well as scary to see the actor playing a role so much different from the ones he portrayed before.Though the movie received anything but positive reviews, it was De Niro’s enigmatic performance that served as the saving grace of the entire two-hour flick. In fact, journalist Janet Maslin stated that the actor’s version of the monster can be a “dandy guest on any daytime television talk show.” The X-Men franchise is home to many of the most unique characters in comic books and the same can be said about its movie adaptions. X2: X-Men United was the most celebrated superhero movie of its time and the audience were glued to their screens after being amazed by one very significant addition: Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler.The character’s makeup design took four hours to apply but it was worth the wait due to Cumming’s extraordinary performance as the blue mutant with the ability to teleport. In fact, Cumming studied the character from Marvel Comics and illustrations to play the role with justice. Based on Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat, comedy star Mike Myers portrays the wise-cracking cat of the same name. Employing a Brooklyn accent and fur all over him, it was hard to realize that it was actually Myers portraying the huge, anthropomorphic cat.The cat costume was made of human hair and angora. Proving to be too hot for Myers, a cooling system was fitted inside the costume for the actor. On an interesting note, Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat was the first book Myers ever read. Undoubtedly the greatest comic book villain of all time, the role of The Joker is not something that can be given without any serious consideration. That is why Jared Leto is next in line to play the iconic character in the upcoming Suicide Squad film.The actor is prepared to take the role to a whole new level unlike the ones played previously onscreen by Ceaser Romero, Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger as Leto shaved his beard and even eyebrows along with a new haircut to portray the Clown Prince of Crime.",Tayyab Khalil

Just like many ordinary Americans, many celebrities also have questions in their mind for the government to answer regarding what exactly happened on September 11, 2001 that the 9/11 Commission failed to answer. 9/11 Truth campaign was also established by those who don’t agree with the Government version of September attacks. Today, we have managed to compile a list of 15 celebrities that believe 9-11 was an inside job and have quite convincing opinions that can answer a number of questions for those who still have the basic questions like, Why was 9 11 An Inside Job? Was 9 11 Planned by the Government? Alex Jones, the extremely popular radio host, gave very convincing points to prove that 9/11 was an inside job: The American actor Ramon Antonio better known as Martin Sheen questioned the investigation being done for 9/11 and said in an interview: The American film actress Janeane Garofalo expressed her feelings when asked about her thoughts on 9/11: Willie Nelson shared his point of view on the incident of 911 and said: Once questioned about his thoughts on 911, the Cheers famed actor, Harrelson answered: According to Rescue Me famed actor Daniel Sunjata, 9/11 was an inside job: By commenting on 9/11 incident, Jesse, who is a former Navy Seal, professional wrestler, author and actor, he shared his belief that the government was involved in 9/11.

2016-01-07,http://chillopedia.com/celebs/15-most-difficult-actors-to-work-with-ever/,15 Most Difficult Actors to Work With Ever,"Hollywood actors really are a master of deception because the characters they portray on camera are totally different from their real-life personas. While die-hard fans will do anything to hang out or even have a date with them, it will really be shocking for them to know how those stars behave off-screen. Take a look at the 15 most difficult actors to work with ever: The Die Hard star has starred in many action comedy movies but in real-life, Bruce Willis spends more time on action than comedy. The actor has constantly been a jerk off-screen during the shoots of his own movies and to several journalists. Willis refused to stand with director Kevin Smith while promoting their film Cop Out.Recently, the actor had shared strong words with none other than the legendary actor Sylvester Stallone. Willis was extremely difficult to negotiate during his contract discussions for Expendables which prompted him not to appear in the third installment.In fact, Stallone took his frustrations out on Twitter and called him “greedy and lazy” his attitude “a sure formula for career failure.” Being the female lead of Desperate Housewives came with a heavy price as creator Marc Cherry called Teri Hatcher “the meanest woman anywhere in the world.”When the main cast of the show were called for a shoot for the cover of Vanity Fair, the ABC executives warned them about Hatcher who, expectedly, made the experience really uncomfortable for everyone. Best known for comedy movies such as Wayne’s World and Austin Powers, Mike Myers has proved that funny people may not be the best people to work with. The actor is a temperamental control freak and even got someone fired for looking him in the eye. The actor once walked off the set of Wayne’s World because there was no margarine in his bagel.The biggest fiasco Myers got himself stuck in was when he kept on refusing to shoot the Saturday Night Live film adaptation during its mid-production because he did not like the script. Ironically, the script was written by Myers himself and was sued for costing millions of dollars. The lawsuit even stated that the actor practices: There are many words that can describe Charlie Sheen but hardly any of them can be positive. Once an actor of great potential and reputation, Sheen flushed it all down the toilet and is known as a loose cannon in the business.At the height of his career, the actor was not only the star of the critically acclaimed show Two and a Half Men but was also the highest paid television actor. Due to his demands for a further raise, partying ways and causing several shooting delays because of his frequent rehabs, the studio had no choice to fire their biggest star.The actor soon found work in Anger Management but his antics did not stop there. After finding out that his co-star Selma Blair complained that he was a “menace”, Sheen became so angry that he refused to show up for work unless she was fired. He surely stands among the most difficult people in Hollywood. The 29-year old actor was fired from the Broadway play Orphans because he got in a fight with director Daniel Sullivan and co-star Alec Baldwin.Shia LaBeouf is well-known for being brutally honest in his interviews as he says pretty mean stuff about the studios he has worked in. Exceptionally vocal against her co-workers and own projects, Katherine Heigl could have been one of the big leagues but her attitude got the best of her. The actress called Knocked Up – the movie that made her a star – “sexist” and once decided not to accept her possible Emmy Award victory for Grey’s Anatomy because she felt its writing weak.Because of her rude behavior, refusing to come out of her trailer, spending too much time on makeup, high salary demands, insisting to change the script, the actress has found her career in a declining state. Drunken fights, insulting people on Twitter and walking off the set are just part of the day job of Russell Crowe. The actor certainly made a big name for himself and even earned an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Gladiator but it was not such a great experience for his co-workers.Feeling that his assistants were not getting enough pay, the actor threatened to kill producer Branko Lustig with his bare hands. Crowe made the production of Gladiator immensely difficult as once angrily stated:",Tayyab Khalil

If history has taught the people anything at all, it is that death waits for no man and that includes celebrities. No matter how big of a house you live in and no matter how vast your bank account is, death truly waits for no one. Here we take a look at the 15 celebrities we lost in 2015: Among one of the many examples of talented celebrities who have died young, Scott Weiland is one of them. As the lead vocalist of Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver, the musician was a certified rock star but his partying ways lead to his demise.During his last years, the musician spent a lot of a time as a solo artist and as a band member of The Wildabouts. Struggling with heroin addiction and substance abuse, Weiland died at the age of 48 because of accidental overdose of cocaine, ethanol, and methylenedioxyamphetamine. Baseball is one of the most cherished sports in America and that is exactly why Yogi Berra is a legend in the country. Playing 19 seasons in Major League Baseball, the sportsman was an 18-time All-Star and 10-time World Series champion as a player.Berra, who left school after the eighth grade, was well-known for his comedic quotes such as “It ain’t over ’til it’s over,” and “I really didn’t say everything I said,” while addressing reporters. Despite starring in many movies, the fans will always remember Leonard Nimoy for portraying Spock from Star Trek. The role was simply synonymous with the actor as Nimoy even portrayed Spock Prime as a cameo role in the 2013 movie Star Trek into Darkness.Dying at the age of 83, his wife Susan Bay Nimoy revealed that the actor died because of “end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.”His death was acknowledged by several friends, costars and even the sitcom The Big Bang Theory who shared a shot of the actor during the credits and stating, Speaking of Star Trek, Leonard Nimoy was not the only actor from the franchise to die this year. With a career spanning six decades and numerous movies, Grace Lee Whitney was specially recognized with the role of Janice Rand.Portraying the Lieutenant Commander in the Star Trek television series and movies, Whitney owes her success to the iconic role. At age 85, the actress died due to natural causes. People might remember him as the co-creator of The Simpsons but Sam Simon was much more than that. As an animal rights activist and philanthropist, Simon intended to make the world a better place.Diagnosed with colon cancer in 2012 and told to have just six months to live, Simon made great contributions to the people and animals around him. In fact, he promised to leave his $100 million fortune to charity before his death. The Icelandic-born American actor has been featured in dozens of movies but his fame is attributed to only one movie. Gunnar Hansen portrayed the iconic villain Leatherface in the very first installment of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre way back in 1974.In fact, it was his very first movie role. Though the actor did not reprise the antagonist role in the sequel nor any of the future installments of the franchise, Hansen cemented his fame as the original Leatherface. Wrestling fans around the globe had their hearts broken after finding out that “The American Dream” Dusty Rhodes passed away. With charisma oozing from his skin, the wrestler is best known for his time spent in WCW and WWE. After retiring from in-ring competition, Rhodes worked as a booker and producer in NXT.At age 69, stomach cancer pulled the life out of the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion.

2016-01-11,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/15-disney-adaptations-which-actually-had-horrible-endings/,15 Disney Adaptations Which Actually Had Horrible Endings,"Releasing dozens of memorable animated movies, one might think that The Walt Disney Company is responsible for making our childhood comfortable but as a matter of fact, Disney had us all fooled! Convincing us that every story has a happy ending, it is shocking to know how the company converted tragic stories into fairy tales. Get ready to ruin your childhood and see some of the 15 Disney adaptations which actually had horrible endings: Did you really think that Jane would leave her entire life behind in London to stay in a jungle with the ape-man who has fallen in love with her? Of course not! In the original book written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan and Jane never get hitched.In fact, Jane marries Clayton the villain from the Disney animated movie but she did fell in love with Tarzan. Oddly enough, Tarzan and Clayton are biological cousins with the former being the heir to the entire family fortune. But seeing that Jane would be much happier with Clayton, Tarzan decides to leave things as they are. Based upon the 1967 novel by Daniel P. Mannix, the Disney adaptation of The Fox and the Hound hardly has any similarities. Believe it or not, the fox and the hound never even become friends in the novel.Both title characters die in the novel as opposed to staying alive in the animated movie. Copper the dog died due to exhaustion after being chased too much while Tod the fox died by getting shot because he got too old. The 1997 animated musical fantasy movie was one of Disney’s finest works at the time and ended with Hercules marrying the love of his life, Megara. Disney made a smart move by ending the story right there because things actually got worse from there.According to Greek Mythology, after marrying Megara and having children together, Hercules killed them. This was due to being infused with madness by goddess Hera wife of Zeus and mother of Hercules. According to some Greek accounts, Hercules killed Megara too. The puppet was even naughtier in Italian author Carlo Collodi’s The Adventures of Pinocchio. However, the puppet eventually turned into a real boy in the original story but after a ton of difficult times.Dying by hanging, resurrection, drowning and getting his flesh eaten by fish are few of the many things that Disney chose not to include in the animated adaptation of the fairy tale.On a side note, Pinocchio’s lovable mentor Jimini Cricket died by the hands of none other than Pinocchio but returned as a ghost to keep on advising him. The 2009 Disney adaptation of the fairy tale The Frog Prince takes a big twist by converting Princess Tiana into a frog as well.Though the couple do end up back as their human forms by sharing a kiss but such a thing never occurred in the original story.As ridiculous as it may sound, the Prince returned in his human form when the princess threw him against the wall as an act of disgust. Disney made a pretty accurate depiction of the German fairy tale Snow White in the 1937 animated film but made a few changes at the end.She never revives from the prince’s kiss but by the poisoned apple dislodging from her throat when her coffin tripped while being carried by the dwarves.As a punishment for an attempted murder, the Queen is forced to wear burning shoes and dance until she drops dead. Loosely based upon the German fairy tale Rapunzel, the musical comedy movie Tangled is nowhere near the horrific original story.After Mother Gothel found out about Rapunzel’s affair with a prince, she cut off her hair and left her in wilderness and made the prince blind by throwing her into thorns.The two eventually reunite, raise a family and the Prince even got his sight restored once he embraced with Rapunzel. Surprisingly, a happy ending was achieved among the two lovers but they had to go through hell in order to make their heaven.",Tayyab Khalil

He was half-way through. Gaining knowledge without school is common amongst entrepreneurs. There is a massive list of famous entrepreneurs without college degree.Michael Dell – dropped out of the University of Texas at Austin after his first year. He didn’t inform his parents about this.Larry Ellison dropped out two times after the death of his mother.Bill Gates stayed 3 years at Harvard. He took enough courses to graduate. But he didn’t. He decided to drop out after going through a magazine about the new computer. He said:He later got his Harvard degree (honorary).Most people don’t drop out to begin a great company the next day. So many people had no plan. Steve Jobs, for instance. Steve Jobs dropped out of school because it was expensive. As soon as he left school, he “dropped in’ on classes for free. This is the way he learnt calligraphy, for instance. Steve’s adoptive parents promised his biological parents that Steve would graduate from college. As it turned out, it wasn’t necessary for Steve.Several parents anticipate their kids dropping out of college. Doctor Zuckerberg is an example. He was certain about his son dropping out.As of today, a college degree is worth $365,000 for the average American man after subtracting all his indirect and direct expenses over a lifetime. For a woman — who have a high probability of earning less than men — it is worth $185,000.

2015-12-14,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/15-best-jim-carrey-movies-of-all-time/,15 Best Jim Carrey Movies of All Time,"Born to a homemaker and an accountant in Canada, the very thought of Jim Carrey being one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood is something that his parents never even imagined. Facing poverty and hardships at a young age, Carrey was able to put it all aside to leave his mark as one of the best faces of comedy to date. Take a look at the 15 best Jim Carrey movies of all time: After his company goes bankrupt, Richard “Dick” Harper is forced to pursue a life of crime with his wife Jane to make ends meet.As a remake of the 1977 comedy movie of the same name, Fun with Dick and Jane stars Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni as an upper-middle-class couple.Despite receiving mixed to negative reviews, the movie was able to earn $202 million at the global box office and owes it all to none other than the comedic versatility of Carrey. With Ben Stiller as the director and Jim Carrey as the leading star, the movie will undoubtedly be one for the ages. Crossing $100 million at the box office, The Cable Guy is a satirical black comedy best known as the darkest movie starring Carrey.Raised by television, Ernie “Chip” Douglas is a disturbed and lonely cable guy who is on a quest to find a best friend only to face dire consequences. The movie is also notable for featuring the early roles of future stars such as Owen Wilson, Leslie Mann and Jack Black. Directed by Brad Silberling and based upon Lemony Snicket’s first three novels of A Series of Unfortunate Events, the movie was one of the most unique pieces of dark comedy fantasy and featured Jim Carrey in an extremely unrecognizable role.After their parents are killed in a massive fire, three children are given to the custody of their cousin Count Olaf. However, their welcome is anything but friendly since Olaf plans to steal the fortune of the orphans’ parents. The Farrelly Brothers reunite with Jim Carrey to bring Me, Myself & Irene to the silver screen. The actor portrays a cop with a serious personality disorder after years of abuse and must protect a woman on the run from her ex-boyfriend.Though the movie had a tiring plot, it was Carrey’s marvelous acting as Charlie Baileygates and Hank Evans that picked the movie’s entire weight on the shoulders and took it to box office success. As one of the most underrated movies starring Jim Carrey (and a surprising role if you happen to watch Jim Carrey movies for laughs only), The Majestic showcases the tale of Peter Appleton, a notorious Hollywood screenwriter who loses his memory in a car accident.Appleton then moves in a small town to start a whole new life as he gets mistaken for a long-lost son. Despite being a forgettable movie, it manages to prove that Carrey can do a serious role too when required. Starring Jim Carrey in one of his most unlikely roles, the actor portrays the real-life con-artist Steven Jay Russell. Based upon I Love You Phillip Morris: A True Story of Life, Love and Prison Breaks, the movie revolves around a gay prisoner.Once he falls in love with his fellow inmate Phillip Morris, Russell feels his luck to grow only to see him get released soon. Willing to anything to be reunited with his lover, Russell escapes from prison four times to meet him. After getting angry over his life, recently fired television news reporter Bruce Nolan blames God for his frequent downfalls. Interestingly enough, God portrayed by Morgan Freeman meets Bruce and gives him his powers to show how hard it is to have the duties of a divine being.Performing exceptionally well for a comedy movie, Bruce Almighty beat The Matrix Reloaded after its first week of release and took the number one spot at the box office. It’s one of the highest grossing Jim Carrey movies till date. The introvert Carl Allen gets enlightenment when he attends a seminar which encourages the people in attendance to say “yes” to every opportunity thrown in front of them.Wrongly interpreting the message, Carl begins to give positive responses to literally everything he comes across to which starts a roller coaster of melodramatic events in his life.Seeing how his life turns around for the better, Carl begins to adopt the new technique wholeheartedly until his new girlfriend Allison portrayed by Zooey Deschanel finds out that their relationship is merely based upon a seminar program.",Tayyab Khalil
2015-12-17,http://chillopedia.com/interesting/15-greatest-female-superheroes-of-all-time/,15 Greatest Female Superheroes of All Time,"Everybody admires superheroes. They stand as a symbol of bravery, justice and freedom. With the rise of superhero films in modern day Hollywood, it is interesting to see how many crime fighters from the comic books have been adapted to the silver screen. Though many of them are male, let’s flip the page and see their female counterparts. The following are the 15 greatest female superheroes of all time (and yes we agree, there aren’t much women superheroes after all): Katherine Anne “Kitty Pryde” is one of the most distinctive members of the superhero team X-Men. In fact, she is the youngest member of the team. With incredible powers of intangibility, the female superhero film has always served as a worthy opponent for the bad guys.Though superheroes are famous for their code names, Pryde is unique in the sense that she prefers to be known by her real birth name despite having a superhero code name Shadowcat. Due to her unbelievable superpowers, she has not only served as a dynamic member of X-Men but also S.H.I.E.L.D. and Guardians of the Galaxy. Dinah Drake does not possess any superpowers like the traditional superheroes but still manages to have a reputation of one because of her excellent hand-to-hand combat and gymnastic skills.Taking the alias of Black Canary and the image of a biker chick, Drake was one of the earliest DC super heroines and has frequently served as a professional ally and love interest of fellow superhero Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow.Often showcased as a strong independent woman, Black Canary has also served as a supporting character to many famous male superheroes and has been part of early DC superhero teams such as Justice Society of America and Birds of Prey. There are not many non-comic book female superheroes but the Powerpuff Girls are definitely among them. Created by veteran animator Craig McCracken, the superhero trio have saved the City of Townsville countless times and even the world on several occasions.Not getting enough credit for their rescues, it is astonishing to know that the Powerpuff Girls are possibly the youngest female superheroes of all time. In fact, they are just mere children gifted with superpowers. Running on Cartoon Network for six seasons, the series is getting ready to be rebooted in 2016. Because of month of uranium exposure, Jessica Drew becomes gravely ill and the only way to save her is by injecting an experimental serum made by spider blood. Not only she survives, she gains spider-like powers and shows the world that there is another web-slinging superhero in town.Along with superhuman strength, speed, spider senses, durability, Drew is a master tactician and an amazing spy. In addition to all those powers, Spider Woman has vast intelligence as well which makes her one of the best female superheroes.Interestingly enough, Spider Woman has on a few occasions not only teamed up but also fought against none other than Peter Parker aka Spider-Man as well. As one of the cousins of Super-Man, Kara Zor-L is from an alternative universe in the fictional DC multiverse. Despite being quite similar to Super-Man in terms of powers, Power Girl has a league of her own.Sporting a much different costume than the rest of her family members despite having the traditional red and blue colours, Power Girl does not even uses the iconic “S” logo as an attempt to gain recognition. Rather, she prefers to have her own distinct identity and that is what makes the beautiful superhero so special. Born as a tribal princess in Kenya, Ororo Munroe was gifted with unique superpowers that allowed her to control and manipulate weather at will. Bent on using her powers to keep her mutant species safe, Munroe took on the alias of Storm and joined the X-Men.Being exceptionally powerful, Munroe might be more remembered as a strong member of the X-Men but her powers catapulted her to several other affiliations with many superhero teams such as Avengers, Fantastic Four, Lady Liberators etc. Turns out that Kal-El aka Super-Man was not the only one sent from the planet Krypton to planet Earth. His cousin Kara Zor-El was also sent by her family to the same planet. Once the two long-lost cousins met, the two eventually teamed up.Much like her cousin, Supergirl has a variety of superpowers such as superhuman strength, flight, invulnerability, super speed and advanced hand-to-hand combat. When Jennifer Walters needed an emergency blood transfusion after being wounded, her cousin Dr. Bruce Banner aka The Hulk was happy to obliged and helped her relative in the time of need.It was not long enough that his gamma rays infected blood caused her to become a female version of the bulky superhero. Unlike her cousin, Walters remains in her senses with her intelligence intact when she becomes She-Hulk.Able to transform into her alter-ego at will, her transformation became permanent later. Apart from being a crime fighter, Walters is a lawyer by profession and has served as a legal counsel to countless superheroes in the Marvel universe.",Tayyab Khalil
2015-12-10,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/17-best-movies-of-2015/,17 Best Movies of 2015,"Dozens of movies are produced each year but only a few are worthy of your time and even fewer which merit money to be spent on by watching them in cinemas. 2015 is a year of sequels in many ways. From the successful Hunger Games second installment to the return of the Terminator series after 6 years. From the fifth installment of Mission Impossible to the seventh installment of the popular Fast and Furious saga and so many more, 2015 has also seen the return of many popular movie franchises. Here, we take a look at the 17 best movies of 2015 that had to offer and which should definitely make it to your movies-to-watch list: Brilliantly shot by Robbie Ryan, Slow West is John Maclean’s idea of a Western. The Scottish musician has used New Zealand’s landscape to depict the 1800s Colorado, when gun ruled and there was little regard for human life.The hard-featured German, Michael Fassbender, plays Silas who is a bounty hunter disguised as a protector of the young Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Jay is in pursuit of his love Rose (Caren Pistorius) and her father (Rory McCann, famous as The Hound in Game of Thrones), who are both outlaws. Artificial intelligence in the form of a hot female body definitely peaks the interest of many. Much like a terminator but without its one point agenda of Kill-John-Conner, Ex Machina is much closer to reality and shows the possible danger of artificial intelligence fused with freewill.Winning a coding contest lands Caleb Smith a week at Nathan’s private estate, the company’s CEO that Caleb works for. Nathan introduces Caleb to a humanoid, a dashing Ava (Alicia Vikander), in order to test her consciousness. The experiment is successful but with a tragic ending. After nine years, director Todd Haynes is back in business with an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel, The Price of Salt. Having a knack of making movies that show hidden desires of humans, Carol was certainly a good pick.Set in 1950s, a time when American society was much less tolerant and the subject was taboo, Carol is about two lesbian lovers who give in to their attraction. It shows the emotional battle of desires versus shackles of society and marriage. For any rock music fan, “Smells Like Teen Spirit” is an evergreen song. A treat for rock fans, Brett Morgen has done a splendid job to produce an authorized music documentary on the celebrated Kurt Cobain, lead singer and guitarist in rock band, Nirvana.It follows Cobain’s early childhood, his rise to success in music industry followed by his early demise. The director has used material from Cobain’s personal archives. The growing trend of animation genre and its rising popularity is matched by an increase in animated movies. Produced by Aardman Animations, Shaun the Sheep is a comedy which uses character expressions and situations to entertain the audience rather than dialogues.A sheep that walks on two legs, Shaun, along with its flock looks to set things right after their plan of putting their master to sleep and getting out of work backfires. Asif Kapadia has produced an emotional roller coaster for Amy Winehouse fans. A look into Amy’s personal life in her own words, archival footage, family interviews and more, it is heart rending to see her sing her struggles away and die so young.The depth behind the lyrics and a family oblivious to her emotional traumas, Amy shies away from society and finds solace in drugs, a side unexplored here. Love is a game will feel more like a lament than a song after watching Amy. Matt Damon has become an astronaut figure lately, The Martian being his third adventure in space. We have seen movies with survival themes like Into the Wild and Robinson Crusoe, but survival on a hostile and foreign planet is however new.Assumed dead and left alone on Mars with no supplies, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) must contact NASA on Earth and find means to stay alive. Predictable and yet captivating, Ridley Scott has produced another sci-fi that has already made it to IMDb top 250 movies of all time. Set in WWII time in a concentration camp, Auschwitz, Son of Saul is director Laszlo Nemes’ debut. Nemes has given a physical form to the heinous inhumanity conceived by Nazis, making Hungarian Jews kill their own by putting them in gas chambers.Saul is one such Sonderkommando member whose moral awakening forces him to find a rabbi to bury a child against all odds. What do you do when your government bans you from film-making? If you are anything like the Iranian director Jafar Panahi, you defy the authorities and continue making movies covertly.Panahi’s third clandestine venture, after This is Not A Film and Closed Curtain, is shot from a taxi’s dashboard featuring the passengers he picks up as he drives around Tehran. It is an honest attempt by Panahi to show his own predicament and present day Iran. Most romantic flicks feature pre-marriage young love. Andrew Haigh however has produced here a movie on a couple married for almost half a century, all set to celebrate their 45th anniversary, when a letter reminding Geoff Mercer (Tom Courtenay) of his first love arrives and builds a wall of resentment between him and his wife Kate Mercer (Charlotte Rampling).It is no comedy but a serious reality check, a splash of water to wake up the happily ever after believers of marriage.",Mohammad Salman Zaka
2015-12-22,http://chillopedia.com/movies-section/25-worst-movies-of-2015/,25 Worst Movies of 2015,"Although from a personal standpoint I don’t believe in highlighting negativity in movies as it feels like disrespecting all the effort and hard work that the whole cast and backroom staff has put in the project. But, there are just some movies that you can’t stop yourself from having a go at, mainly due to the lethargic and unplanned execution of the project. We will therefore focus and analyze 25 worst movies of 2015 so far that probably shouldn’t have been made: Coming first in our list of the worst films of 2015, Captive is based on a true story, it stars the extremely talented Kate Mara and David Oyelowo. It revolves around the story of a man, who escapes from prison and takes a drug addict woman hostage in her own apartment.Despite the compelling performances given by our leads, the film falls flat as the execution of the film is very below par. A reboot of a classic comedy from the 80’s, with the comical Ed Helms leading the charge. So, how is it? Sadly, not very good.Though some might enjoy the poor attempts at mean spirited slapstick comedy and effortless poop jokes, the vast majority will probably sit silent as their souls get devoured by this literal joke of a movie. After the Matrix, the Wachowski brothers just haven’t been able to get their mojo back ever since. This is clearly evident in their latest film, Jupiter Ascending. It is commendable that in this world overrun with reboots and sequels, they attempt to give us a completely original story.Aside from the beautiful visuals and thorough world-building, there is nothing much to write about this flick. Moreover, the characters are all bland, the story is un-interesting, and the writing is un-inspired and lazy. An extremely mediocre flick about a woman going through a similar mental struggle as her father endured 27 years ago. In concept it feels like it could be an Oscar-contender, but the film inputs the concept in such a boring fashion that you’ll probably fall asleep half-way through.Even the adept cast of Russell Crow, Aaron Paul, and Amanda Seyfried could not save this snore-fest. A comedic drama starring Mathew Broderick and Alice Eve. Dirty Weekend is very slow-paced and it tries hard to make you ask questions about the actions of the characters as it moves along.However, the characters are not interesting enough for you to care about what they do, which makes it an extremely tedious viewing experience. A family moves to a new house, which turns out to be haunted. Heard that story anywhere before? It is probably one of the most recycled plot lines in Hollywood history.Though this film is well done from a technical standpoint with some good pacing and well done cinematography but the actual horror element is where it falls apart, as the scares in the movie are nothing more than cheap and thoughtless jump scares that mildly startle you. I would like to remind everyone that this piece of cinematic garbage was based of a book that was initially written to be a fan-fiction of Twilight. The story behind this film notwithstanding, a movie should always be judged on its own merits.So on that note, this film is still poisonous to the mind. The characters are all unlikable, story is non-existent, performances are extremely bland, and the writing is atrocious. The problem with Vin Diesel is that as an actor, he lacks range. Therefore, in every movie he’s in, he looks and feels like the same guy. This is no exception in this film.A fantasy adventure film about an immortal hunter who hunts down witches, filled with clichés and cheesy but admittedly fun action. Overall, it is at least a watchable flick. A very cheesy and sappy animated film with oddly placed moments where characters break into song out of nowhere.The humor can be surprisingly intelligent at times but it’s not exactly adult friendly, as many Pixar films go in comparison. An ex-fighter seeks closure for his troubled past, as he is filled with resentment. Starring Sean Bean and some other talented actors, all of which who just clearly came in for an easy pay-check.Everything about this film is below average, predictable, and times even unnecessary. A mother and her children hide in a house from her abusive husband. As a sequel to the brilliant previous film, this movie is definitely not a worthy successor.The child actors are downright horrible, the atmosphere is nowhere near scary as it was in the last film, many of the brilliant storytelling devices from the last film were used here again; only executed poorly, and overall it was just an incoherent mess. Starring the hilarious Simon Pegg, as a professional Hit-man who screws up one contract assignment that plunges him into a story of murder, vengeance, and blackmail.A very dark comedy, where not all the jokes land and the few that do sort of feel a bit too whacky for the tone they were going for. Regardless of the fun and exciting notion of seeing your favorite 80’s video game characters come to life and fight against the human race, this film sucked all the possible joy out of that immensely creative circumstance. Adam Sandler and his band of so-called fellow comedians do it again, as they give us yet another lazy attempt at making a movie.The movie even wastes the extremely talented, Peter Dinklage, as he is given nothing to work with and was clearly given no direction whatsoever. The only effort put into the movie was by the special effects artists, so all positive credit should really be given to them.",Fajar Lodhi
2015-12-26,http://chillopedia.com/gaming/30-best-games-of-2015/,30 Best Games of 2015,"The gaming industry witnesses many releases annually. But with the introduction of next generation consoles, the ever increasing competition between game franchises and high expectations from the fans, each game released is now thoroughly tested and scrutinized. Very few make it to gamers’ favorites collection. Here today we share with you the best games of 2015 that we believe you should definitely check out: Developers Capcom have fine-tuned their gem of a fighting game to near perfection. By adding options of offline match recording and training as you wait for opponents online, all the requests made by the players have been met.Tweaking around with almost all ninja warriors to close the gap between their skills, the game is all set to hit big in high level tournaments. Perhaps like the concept of alternate realm shown in Christopher Nolan’s Inception, Limbo is a different, no mercy world. Developed and published by Playdead, it was initially released in 2010 for Xbox 360 and later this year for PS4. But it still evades explaining the concept behind this dark world.You step in the shows of a young boy and look to solve puzzles to avoid getting killed in horrid ways. The game is set in gothic theme with black, white and grey shades. It takes a lot of time and deaths to solve the clever puzzles. Limbo has won VGX award for Best Independent Game. If blowing up things drives you, Just Cause 3 is a must try. For all passive aggressive gamers out there, think of any new creative way of destruction and this game will let you execute it. Why shoot an enemy helicopter when you can simply knock out the pilot and take control yourself?The open-ended liberty given to the protagonist in this game, Rico Rodriguez, is what makes it so different from other conventional games.The plot of this game, developed by Avalanche Studios, is mainly to liberate the fictional Republic of Medici from a dictator named Sebastiano Di Ravello. However, in no way does the story restrict you from having your own fun. Treyarch and Mercenary Technology’s Call of Duty – Black Ops 3 successfully meets the high bar of expectations it has set with its previous versions.It’s a military science fiction game that features celebrated Jeff Goldblum as a magician in zombies co-op mode, Shadows of Evil, as one of the many new additions in this latest installment.One of the best new features is the introduction of specialists in multiplayer that gives each specialist a unique skill set rather than being a jack of all. With futuristic new weapons, increased precision and specialized abilities, this first person shooter game is better than ever before. Battling monsters in games is not only fun but mainstream. Battling monsters in a group of 4 is definitely better. But what Turtle Rock Studio have brought in Evolve is that the monster is also controlled by a player. Now that is something new and worth a shot.This first person shooter game, published by 2K Games, involves a team of 4 specialized humans (assault, medic and support), called hunters, dropped in a jungle to track and destroy the monster. The monster can devour wildlife, level up and ‘evolve’, making it extremely hard to kill with time. Developed and published by Nintendo for Wii U, Splatoon is a whole new concept, full of innovative guns and arsenal for intense battles with paint!Without all bloodshed and violence but equally engaging and gratifying, Splatoon even has online battles in teams where the winner is decided on the basis of which team paints more area. Get your artist gear on and mess around with paint as much as you want. Much like many sci-fi movie themes where the resources on earth are exhausted and earthlings look to shift their life on another planet, with a lot of freedom and the aim to survive in a hostile environment with a large variety of beasts in different sizes, Xenoblade Chronicles X takes you to the tumultuous planet of Mira.Released by Nintendo for Wii U, this game will impress you with its immensely detailed and catchy landscape. Developed by Rocksteady Studios, based on arguably the most revered superhero of all time, Batman Arkham Knight is a must try thriller. The plot twists and narratives are absorbing enough to force you not to skip them.With a fresh, new experience, the Batmobile lets you cruise through Gotham and engage in fights using its variety of gadgets in missions that unfold simultaneously on many fronts and test your detective and combat skills. After the series reboot in 2011, Mortal Kombat X has a lot to offer its fans. NetherRealm studio’s venture has brought in new characters including Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade’s daughter, Cassie, Takashi (Kenshi’s son) and more.The game has gone one step ahead in terms of complexity with introduction of fighting styles and stamina meter. Fatalities and new moves have only increased the goriness, which will probably settle well with the hardcore fighting genre fans. Ever felt like the city management is not doing enough? Or problems you think you can handle better than the city administration? Well, here is your chance. Developed by Colossal Order and published by Paradox Interactive, Cities: Skylines lets you do just that.It lets you build your own city, manage funds, specialize sectors, connect them using different transit modes and more. Everything you wished to do in your city, try it out in this city simulation game (and yes its way way better than the shitty SimCity 2013).",Mohammad Salman Zaka
2015-11-26,http://chillopedia.com/gaming/17-best-star-wars-games-of-all-time/,17 Best Star Wars Games of All Time,"Gaming has exceptionally evolved since the past decade, which is quite evident in the game-plays, graphics and the story, but still some of the older games have succeeded to hold up pretty good over the years. There has been so many Star Wars games in the past 25 years on pretty much every platform. Let’s take a look at the 17 best star wars games of all time: X-Wing vs TIE Fighter is the third installment in the game series and includes a tough multiplayer option, permitting eight player free-for-all, cooperative and team-based play modes. It is close to being a flight simulator for both X-Wing and a TIE Fighter. The gamer is provided with a great deal of choices in this game. You can even craft and select your own squadron for each mission. The game bonds the two Star Wars trilogies and opens up a new chapter in the Star Wars Story line where Darth Vader raises an apprentice to rule the galaxy. The player gets to use a Light saber and the Force (ability to push things around) in third person action.It has an extremely persuasive story, robust physics, remarkable soundtrack and art. It remains as one of fastest-selling Star Wars game. LEGO Star Wars manages to achieve three discrete goals that, at first glance, would appear to be at complete odds with one another. Firstly, it’s a fun action game that manages to push all the right game-play buttons, including killer co-op.Secondly, the Star Wars license is used perfectly for its targeted audience (young ones) and lastly it absolutely nails the creative, appealing side of the Star Wars vibe. The Jedi Knight lets players humiliate and assassinate un-suspicious enemies with mixed use of light saber slashes and Force powers. Jedi Outcast’s graphics and game-play were standout features at the time of its release.This game lets you disarm enemies, crush them against walls, choke them in midair and then drop them into pits. On one hand, it’s an imitative real-time strategy game, but on the other, it is an organized little bundle of entertainment that’s perfect for gamers raised on Star Wars. It looks more as if you take Age of Empires 2 and add Star Wars in it, which didn’t feel as much like a Star Wars game as it should have. A multi-platform action-adventure game which is based on the Star Wars Movie ‘A New Hope’. This is the best Lego game of this series. Is funny, yet entertaining. It was commercially and critically a success and has sold over 8.2 million copies around the world. If you love Star Wars or Lego, this is a Must buy game for you. This game was every nerds dream, magnificently taking the side-scrolling,perfected by Super Mario Bros. games and mixing them with locations and characters from the Star Wars movie ‘A New Hope’.This game was a pure revelation in 1992 and it was merciless, too. Without having the save system, you needed lightning-thumbs to go through the final showdown. This game has massively improved over its predecessor and uses live acting and sets in its cut scenes, in the same manner as in Rebel Assault 2. This game still offers tough and entertaining missions and the story is extremely good. It also has one of the best Dark side endings in a game. This is a superb game that combines both LEGO Star Wars and LEGO Star Wars 2 in a complete package. This was released in 2007 and offers much higher graphics than its predecessor, as well as classic sound effects and a hilarious amount of exceptional LEGO humor.",Daniyal Ahmed
