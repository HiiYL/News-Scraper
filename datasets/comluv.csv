It can give anyone peace of mind, especially to those who truly value their investments. For businesses, it is a critical component for long-term security which could save you thousands of dollars down the road. For startup owners, you might feel like you would rather save your budget for other areas of your business that can help it grow. This might initially sound like a good idea, but it is only a matter of time before youâ€™d wish you bought insurance. Moreover, to avoid this fatal mistake, below are the best insurance resources for businesses on a tight budget. The best way to get started with insurance is to educate yourself. Whether you are self-employed or a small business, eHealthInsuranceâ€™s Buyerâ€™s Guide for Entrepreneurs is a comprehensive resource that can help you understand the fundamental challenges, benefits, and steps for buying health insurance. It covers everything small businesses need to know â€“ from understanding the companyâ€™s needs to enrollment. eHealthInsuranceâ€™s Buyerâ€™s Guide also introduces five key criteria that can help businesses make the best decision. These are the health benefits, costs, brand, industry ratings, and coverage add-ons. It also offers a step-by-step guide on the application process, including a checklist of things to do after purchasing a plan. Lastly, you can find a glossary of terms from by the end to further improve your knowledge of insurance plans. If your business relies on employees to drive company vehicles, then you should consider getting car insurance.

It can help you understand the entire car insurance vocabulary, including but not limited to liability insurance, collision insurance, and no-fault insurance. More importantly, The Zebra compiles a list of popular car insurance discounts that can help small businesses save much money. They also include top carriers that offer these discounts to point companies in the right direction. Buying You can refer to Frommerâ€™s guide on travel insurance to help you get started. This guide will help you understand the basic concepts as well as why you need travel insurance. It also includes a guide on when to buy insurance â€“ both for medical and trip cancellation. If your business needs travel insurance, then you should refer to this resource because it offers an in-depth guide that will help you avoid loopholes, which may lead to denied claims. In addition to practical information, it also includes links to useful articles that can help you find the best travel insurance plan for your business. Business insurance requires much research, in particular for startups that never purchased one before. However, since time is precious for a growing startup, it is best to have a single location that can answer all of your business insurance questions. Thankfully, The Hartford has compiled a list of business insurance guides in their Business Ownerâ€™s Playbook resource. This guide is tailored specifically for startups who wants to buy business insurance â€“ covering everything from flood to liability insurances in great detail. As a startup, it is advised to begin with the basics to understand concepts like workersâ€™ compensation insurance, commercial umbrella insurance, and business income insurance.

Business 2 Communityâ€™s article is a good place to start if you need to learn more about the six types of liability insurance. Again, startups need comprehensive knowledge to help find the most suitable coverage for their business. SaaS startups, for example, need to take their customersâ€™ online safety and privacy seriously.

If you own a startup or a small business, you may feel the need to save every dollar you have to support your growing enterprise. However, remember that no matter how careful you are in planning the course of your business, there will always be things outside of your control. Buying insurance adds that extra layer of protection that can ensure the survival of your company through tough times.",Christopher Jan Benitez

29/04/2016,http://comluv.com/everything-need-know-structured-settlement-payments/,Everything You Need to Know about Structured Settlement Payments - ComLuv,"Structured settlements are very powerful financial tools in cases of personal injury lawsuits. They can provide a person with a considerable amount of money for a long period of time, if the lawsuit turns out to be successful. Receiving structured settlements can be very beneficial, since they are all about the taxes. They are extremely tax-efficient, which is why many people opt for them, instead of receiving a cash settlement. Read on to learn everything about structured settlement payments, as well as what you would need to do if you decided to sell them. Â   is a legal settlement that provides the injured victim, who claims the personal injury lawsuit, with a certain amount of money for a fixed period of time. The claimant receives a tax-free annuity payment, instead of receiving a lump sum of money. For instance, if you have been injured in a car accident and received a cash settlement from the other driver or the insurance company, that amount of money is tax-free. However, if you decide to invest it, the earnings of your investment will be taxable. On the other hand, if you receive a structured settlement instead of cash, you will get payments for either a fixed period of time or your lifetime, which is up to you, and each of those payments will be completely tax-free. Therefore, your after-tax earnings will successfully convert into a tax-free return. That is the main reason why many people opt for structured settlement payments, as it offers them greater benefit than a lump sum of money they would have received otherwise. Â  There are several main  , including Life Annuity, Temporary Life Annuity, Lump Sum Annuity, Life Contingent Lump Sum Annuity, Life Only Annuity and Joint Survivor Annuity, all of which slightly differ from one another. Apart from those, there are two different methods of payment regarding structured settlements, namely the buy-and-hold method of payment and the assigned method of payment. If the party that Â  If you happen to be in a situation in which the amount of money you are receiving by the means of structured settlement payments is not enough for you to cover your expenses, you can decide to sell your payments. Many people choose that option when their financial needs change and they need additional capital for emergency situations. Itâ€™s important to know that you can sell either a portion or all of your future settlement payments. That means that you can either sell all of your remaining payments for a lump sum of money or sell a portion of each of your payments, for which you will get a lump sum of money, and still receive part of your payments on a regular basis. There are several steps you need to take in order to successfully  . You need to thoroughly research structured settlement companies to find the one that best suits your needs. It should be a reputable company that will offer you the best deal with the lowest discount rate. Once you choose the buyer of your payments, you need to take care of all the legal paperwork (your ID, application, your annuity policy, the settlement agreement for the verification of your payments), before you file it with the court for the sale approval. When the judge approves the sale, you can get your lump sum of money. Â  Structured settlement payments can offer great benefits and can provide you real comfort for a long period of time, but if you happen to need liquid assets to take care of your financial situation, you can always choose to sell them. It is crucial that you gather all the information you need before you make your final decision about selling your structured settlement payments, regardless of whether you sell them in entirety or you sell just a portion of them. If you do decide to sell, you need to be absolutely sure that it is the right decision for you and that it will help you with your current financial situation.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

20/04/2016,http://comluv.com/threat-real-extra-security-tools-protect-site-hackers/,Extra Security Tools to Protect Your Site from Hackers,"2015 was a tough year for companies and government employees. It was the year when millions of unsuspecting users lay victims to hackers. The most notable of these hacking incidents is that of Ashley Madisonâ€™s, where the Impact Team hacked the accounts of 32 million users of the site.  , Ashley Madisonâ€™s parent company, offered $500,000 to anyone who could capture the culprits. Other   were too notorious to be ignored â€” with the nude photos of celebrities leaking over the net as one of the most shocking news. In other reports, North Korea allegedly hacked technology giant Sony. Even Kaspersky Lab, a Russian security firm, was reportedly hacked by government-sponsored hackers. That same year, hundreds of personal and confidential data from government employees and White House correspondents were leaked online. With hackers breaching even the most protected websites, reinforcing online security for your site is no longer an option. You need to deploy the right security tools that can ensure your website is protected from hackers and malware. BelowÂ are some of the best tools you should consider. For regular users, a hacker attack could mean a stolen identity or credit card number. However, for online enterprises, it could mean so much more. This is why online businesses see to it that their web host offers sound security solutions, especially with threats such as Distributed Denial of Service or DDoS attacks. The idea behind DDoS is to put your website offline. When successful, a DDoS attack consumes the entire bandwidth allocation. The attack renders your site along with other sites within the whole server and maybe even the whole network, depending on the setup, inaccessible to real users. This is a major blow to the experience of your users. Without the necessary damage control protocols, a DDoS attack may last for several days. This, in turn, may also negatively affect your search engine rankings. The only way to protect against DDoS attacks is to use DDoS mitigation provider. Unfortunately most of them cost thousands of dollars per month or donâ€™t work. However there is one option that is working really well and costs only 29.90 EUR a month. That is OrangeWebsite DDoS mitigation service. You can protect your valuable information and prevent DDoS attacks with OrangeWebsiteâ€™s   solutions. It can protect your site from ALL types of threats, including Layer 7 (an application attack), protocol and volume-based attacks. OrangeWebsite uses hardware and cloud-based mitigation systems to filter your databases and track down foreign or unknown parties â€“ preventing them from stealing your information. It has Unlike most consumer security apps, SaaS or â€œSoftware as a Serviceâ€ù security tools can easily be integrated with any network â€“ usually for a website. You no longer have to install your something from a disc or the internet. Everything is cloud-based, meaning you can have your site protected with a click of a button. This is perfect for small businesses that do not have an in-house security team to set everything up. SaaS security tools specialise in online security. They cover everything â€“ from your databases to other cloud applications like Google Analytics to Salesforce. Most of them also offer comprehensive malware solutions that can help you with detection and removal. If you are running an e-commerce store, a network of affiliate websites, or simply your blog, using SaaS security tools is an excellent way to secure your digital extensions. One example is Qualys â€“ a  . By analysing data on existing security threats, Qualys deploys a wall that filters everything that travels to your system. Qualys also offers malware detection as well as clean-up solutions to keep your systems safe. Whether it is a web app you use or a piece of software you download â€“ Qualys has got you covered. Some of its key features include continuous monitoring, vulnerability management, web app scanning, and a cloud-based firewall. If you are serious about security, then you should always have a failsafe in case things go wrong. Furthermore, self-inflicted malfunctions through bad coding or the installation of faulty plugins are also entirely possible. Remember that even with an efficient clean-up, there still could be irreversible damages to your site. You may have several free options when it comes to backup plugins, especially if you are maintaining a WordPress site. However, if you have big databases that require secure backups along with other features such as performance reports and site migration, then you should opt for   such as DropMySite. Another critical data that can be compromised by hacker attacks is your email list. Donâ€™t forget that it takes a long time to build a subscriber list and increase your reputation as an information provider. This is why you should also   using services like DropMyEmail â€“ the email counterpart of DropMySite. It can be integrated with major email services such as Hotmail, Â  Gmail, and Yahoo! Mail. With a proactive approach, you can easily protect yourself from malicious entities that threaten your online security and privacy.

19/04/2016,http://comluv.com/treat-blog-like-princess-4-ways-make-blog-feel-special/,4 Ways to Make Your Blog Feel Special like a Princess,"Your blog is the virtual extension of yourself. It pertains to your personal tastes and views while also serving as the worldâ€™s window to your creative mind. This is what the online audience can relate to. They desire the insightful words of someone who is truly passionate and genuine â€“ someone who enjoys what they are doing. This is why you need to nurture and pamper your blog just like you would a damsel in distress. Give it all the necessary attention and it will soon accumulate readership, subscribers, and even customers. Here are four of the best ways to personalise and treat your blog like a princess: One of the joys of owning a blog is having the freedom to style it as you see fit. Choosing a theme that suits your personal style is just like how a dress worn by a woman speaks volumes of her temperament at the moment. You must also pay attention to every single detail and make sure every visual element contributes something to the readerâ€™s experience. If you are setting up your blog for the first time, the best way to go is to use WordPress as your Content Management System. First of all, there are countless themes and design schemes to choose from. These are available from the WordPress theme directory or third-party resources like  . After applying a theme, donâ€™t forget to modify the layout basics such as colours, logos, and menus. You can access these settings by going to your WordPress dashboard ïƒ    ïƒ   . Apart from this, it also has the flexibility needed in case you choose to transition your blog into a business website, affiliate site, or online store. It is also robust enough to incorporate all sorts of interactivity with its host of useful plugins. This leads to the next thing you should do for your blog. With  , you can incorporate just about any functionality you need to improve your visitorsâ€™ experience. For a blog, you should not need anything too fancy to please your readers. A contact form A rule of thumb when using WP plugins: do not keep a plugin that you do not use. Remember that using too many plugins in one page can slow down your siteâ€™s loading speed. Furthermore, certain plugins may conflict with other incompatible plugins and lead to problems such as crashes, slowdowns, and security issues. Donâ€™t forget that you should treat your blog with extra care and nurture. Do not neglect your blog too long and keep up with an  . Not only will this make sure regular posts are published, but it will also help you develop a strategy and plan topics that will attract the most readers and maximise engagement. Remember that you should not rush articles and write about anything that could be irrelevant to your niche. Focus on providing value for your readers by offering actionable tips and avoiding fluff. Writing about recent news and updates is also a good idea to attract new users, but you should also write about evergreen topics from time to time. Remember that consistent updates will not only make your site more visible to search engines. It will also keep your readers happy and build a much bigger following. Any visitor can detect if a blog has been deserted for a while. This means the siteâ€™s content could be outdated, or the blogger is inactive and unavailable for contact. As a blogger, it is your job to play knight in shining armor by making sure all your digital assets are safe from harm. There are several threats out there that could compromise the integrity of your beloved blog, and this is not limited to just security issues (hackers, dirty competitors, and malware). First of all, make sure you employ the   for your blog, including the installation of security plugins. The   plugin is one of the most popular options for bloggers. It covers all the essential security of your sites â€“ from protection against â€œBrute Force Login Attacksâ€ù to file system security. As a failsafe, you should also create secure backups of your blog. Most security plugins offer automatic backups as an add-on, but it is better to plan your backups using the necessary tools. Apart from plugins, remember that you can also count on comprehensive online security solutions such as   and  . A blog takes more than just writing skills to be made successful. You need genuine passion, gallant effort, and the right toolset to get every job done. Today, WordPress has all the resources that bloggers need to check all these prerequisites.

Any successful entrepreneur will tell you that the key to success is getting (the right) things done. Productivity is a combination of technique, self-discipline and sheer will that entrepreneurs must master if they want to reach their goals. Every entrepreneur has had days where they just canâ€™t seem to get anything done. Not only is this frustrating, but it can also be debilitating to your business!    This article will help you find the motivation to peel yourself off the couch when you know you should be working. Weâ€™ll discuss eliminating distractions, how to handle breaks and why you should wake up early. Weâ€™ll also teach you how to say no, the importance of doing one thing at a time and how to prioritize your tasks. Follow this article throughout the day when you start to feel overwhelmed!  Â  This is basic but too important to be ignored. Email, social media, and your phone are sinkholes for your time. If you want to be more productive, youâ€™ll have to remove these distractions. The best way to do this, at first, is by taking drastic measures. If you find your phone to be a distraction, leave it in a different room while you work. If you find social media sites addicting, download add-onâ€™s that block them for you. While distractions can be addicting, itâ€™s important to remember the power is 100% in your hands. You have complete control over whether or not youâ€™ll be distracted by these things. In the following section, weâ€™ll discuss the importance of breaks, which will help you reduce distractions.  Â  Entrepreneurs have to work hard, and itâ€™s easy to forget to take breaks. Taking a break will help you mentally reset and give you more energy when you return to work. Taking regular, short breaks will help keep your mind fresh and make it easier to concentrate. It takes discipline to take regular breaks; you wonâ€™t have anyone telling you when itâ€™s time to get back to work. When used properly, breaks will help  . Another reason we need to take breaks is because sitting for long periods causes levels of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to plummet. When this happens fat, cells build up which increases your risk of having heart complications. Sitting for extended periods of time zaps our energy and sacrifices our health. Remember that productivity doesnâ€™t translate to how many hours you spent sitting at your desk. Productivity is all about getting things done. Taking breaks will help you approach your work with a renewed focus that will help you complete tasks.  Â  I know itâ€™s painful, but waking up early can double or even triple your productivity. An early rise allows you to seize control of the day, provided you use your time well. The solitude of the early morning is the perfect time to take a look at your long-term goals as well as plan your day. Youâ€™ll find yourself better able to manage your time and feel less overwhelmed by little tasks that interrupt your day. Waking up early is the perfect time to fuel your body and help it give you the brainpower you need to excel at your work. Eating a complete breakfast and working out in the morning benefits both your body and your The key to making waking up early as painless as possible starts with changing your mindset. Itâ€™s not as bad as you think and the benefits far outweigh the consequences. After about a month you wonâ€™t even struggle with waking up. Gradually getting up earlier each day is a good way to prevent yourself from getting overwhelmed by sudden change. Get up earlier by an hour every day this week and watch how productive you get!  Â  Entrepreneurs need to protect their time. Successful entrepreneurs need to treat time as their most valued asset. The alternative is can have severe  . Learning to say no is different from saying   These responses clearly leave the possibility of you saying yes open in the attempt of softening a no. Saying no requires you to be a bit selfish, but itâ€™s something you have to do. You shouldnâ€™t feel bad or awkward about respectfully saying no or declining requests. You canâ€™t say yes to everyone, especially when you run your own business. As an entrepreneur is basically up to you how much time you want to spend on your business. Remember that being generous with your time is counterproductive to achieving your business goals. The choice is 100% up to where you want to put your time.  Â  Being an entrepreneur is always going to be overwhelming. Your success lies in how you choose to handle all of whatâ€™s required of you. Youâ€™re only one person, and you need your rest. Multitasking is a trap we fall into when we try and get more out of ourselves. Multitasking makes everything frenetic and disrupts our ability to focus. We can use more of our brainpower when focusing on one task at a time. Instead of multitasking, focus on switching tasks. Focusing on one thing at a time helps you get things were done, and youâ€™ll feel less overwhelmed. If you can master switching your focus from one task to another, youâ€™ll be surprised at how productive you can be throughout the day.  Â  Be honest with yourself. With every task you work on, you need to ask yourself if itâ€™s truly moving your business forward. As an entrepreneur, there is  , so youâ€™ll need to practice the art of prioritizing. Part of prioritizing is setting a difference between urgent and important tasks. Youâ€™ll need to set deadlines and schedule your work in a way that allows you to complete all tasks on time. Itâ€™s also important to understand the value that working on certain tasks bring to your business. Creating and organizing invoices and doing your taxes, are important because your business cannot run properly without them. However, time needs to be spent on urgent tasks like finishing client work or finding new business. Prioritizing is a balancing act between these two types of tasks. Becoming a productive entrepreneur wonâ€™t come to you overnight. Itâ€™s going to take some time and some off days before you master the art of running your business. A productive day will give you a sense of pride in both your business and yourself. Remember that itâ€™s up to you to remove distractions and try new techniques until you find something that helps you be consistent with your work. How will you choose to manage your team?

They offer all theÂ high-end features a small business needs, such as autoresponders, A/B testing, email deliverability, newsletters and a tons of third-party integrations (one of the most interesting one is with WordPress â€“ their WP plugin lets you easily integrate email sign up forms in your blog with just a few clicks). There is an easy-to-use interface and you can choose from many beautiful templates available. The segmentation capability is something that advanced users are going to love. However, their pricing plan is hard to digest. Starting at $19/mo for 500 subscribers, increasing to $29 for up to 2500 or $49 for up to 5000. AWeber also charges for the unsubscribes (a fact that lots of users arenâ€™t aware of). It may happen that you are going to payÂ $29 Â   is another popular email marketing solution (counting more than seven million customers around the globe). They provide lots of templates and different ways to edit your campaigns. You can easily send and track your newsletter, check analytics and build autoresponders. I like the simple WordPress integration with the MailChimp plugin. Just grab your API key and you are ready to go. Their free plan (supporting up to 2000 users and 12,000 emails/mo) gives the option to connect with third-party integration and if you are just starting out, you can study the wide help material available. The paid plan starts at $15/mo (scaling up to $240) depending on your size list. I love the integration with mobile with the nice apps for Android and iPhone. MailChimp is really good for small businesses that are just starting email marketing, because itâ€™s simple to set up and the free plan is really interesting. However, features like spam filtering,Â analytics toolsÂ and auto-responding options are just included in the paid plans. Does MailChimp charge for unsubscribes? The answer is a sweet no. Â  Like the previously mentioned platforms, alsoÂ  Â offers a list of email marketing features and provides lots of templates businesses can use to create a professional newsletter. Whether you need autoresponders, list management, spamcheck, reports and analytics, social media sharing and email creation, with iContact you have it. Good to mention that they offer a free live setup help if you are not an expert. Thereâ€™s also a personal coaching service to guide you through the creation of a perfect email marketing campaign. How about prices? The basic plan costs $14/mo and increases up to $99/mo for extra features.Â Free trial with no credit card required. A good point for iContact: they do not charge for unsubscribes. Â  Â is the largest email marketing platform in terms of number of clients, counting more than 500,000 customers. Thereâ€™s a simple drag and drop editor to createÂ professional emails using one of the many templates available. The autoresponder feature lets you build a series of messages or send specific emails at the desired time (e.g. for a birthday or anniversary). You can easily upload your list from Excel, Outlook or Gmail and the tracking reports are precise. There is also a list of useful mobile and social media features. Their customer support is excellent. Pricing stars from $20 for their â€œemailâ€ù plan or $45/month for the â€œemail PLUSâ€ù. Free 60-days trial with no credit card required. Â   can be a powerful weapon, if used the right way. Be sure to choose the right service provider, by reading the information offered in this post. If you want to hear my opinion, Iâ€™d go with GetResponse, not just because their pricing plans are the most competitive, but also for the high-end features they offer, some of them â€“ webinars and landing page editor â€“ are really a plus. Â  And you? Are you running a mailing list? What platform are you using? Do you have experience with any of the tools mentioned above?

Therefore, donâ€™t improvise, but plan your meeting well and follow the rules. The participants have probably organized themselves according the time you suggested in the e-mail. So, donâ€™t hold your meeting longer than necessary, and stay on schedule. Begin and finish your meeting on time. If you spend too much time on one topic, you might have less time for some other, equally important one. Moreover, the usual reason why meetings become long and boring, and not effective at all, is because people tend to start talking off topic. Usually, the person who holds the meeting can get lost, they can digress, which will confuse everyone. This leads to discussing unimportant things and wasting precious time. Therefore, stay on topic and follow your points in order to cover everything. Almost every meeting should ban the usage of smartphones However, this doesnâ€™t mean that you shouldnâ€™t use tech to make your meeting more effective. Use presentations and a projector. During the meeting, there should be something on the screen. Donâ€™t write too many things, since theyâ€™ll spend too much time reading, and not listening. Become creative and innovative, and make a professional-looking video by yourself. According to , you can be sure that you will easily create the best possible video, which will catch the eye of participants and make them more engaged. During the business meeting, itâ€™s not about one person speaking, and others just listening. There needs to be feedback, and everyone should be involved. Ask them questions and make sure everyone suggests something. As you have sent them the agenda before the meeting, they will already have some questions to ask and something to say something about the matter. However, many times, it happens that only one person talks all the time, and others cannot say anything. If that happens, thank the person and ask for someone elseâ€™s opinion. Make sure that  . If there is something to be discussed and itâ€™s not comfortable speaking up about that, ask them to write their thoughts on a piece of paper at the end of the meeting. Many people get out of the meeting not knowing what the outcome was. Donâ€™t let this happen, but 24 hours after the meeting, send everyone a memo containing everything that was discussed and the solutions you came up with. In this manner, everyone will be informed and on the same page.",Ivan Dimitrijevic
12/03/2016,http://comluv.com/13-anticipated-motorbikes-2016/,13 Most Anticipated Motorbikes of 2016,"Packed with exciting and unique motorcycles, 2016 brings you a horde of new models to enjoy. From adventure tourers and cruisers to scooters and sports motorbikes, there are going to be a lot of tough choices that bikers will have to make this year, considering the variety at their disposal. Here are some of the most anticipated motorbikes of 2016 that we canâ€™t wait to throw a leg over: We have been waiting for a long time to see Suzuki make a proper effort for getting back on top just like it did in 2001 with the original K1 and in 2005 with the K5. From then on, there was a slump due to heavy competition, but the GSX-R1000 seems to be turning the game around as it is introducing the variable   and this technology could turn out to be very transformative if it works properly. This is basically a stripped down version of YZF-R1. In order to provide performance thatâ€™s more suitable for street riding, some reworking has been done in the cross plane crack engine. This machine is going to offer you the excitement you have come to expect from all Yamaha superbikes. While this bike may not be used that much off-road, it is bound to be much more capable and fun. The Multistrada is a small step into the world of adventure touring and is both compact in size and lightweight. It also boasts the highest level of electronic adjustment and comes with a long travel suspension. You will change your outlook of an adventure-tourer once you try out the Multristrada Enduro. With the launch of the DiavelX, Ducati dipped their toe in the cruiser market, but this was only half a step as it is less a cruiser and more a muscle bike. As it has a relaxed riding position, it does function as a true cruiser and also has an imposing styling and torquey bottom-end performance. There is a new 1262cc,  , which gives the machine about 117kW power and at 5000rpm around 130Nm of torque. It also has a number of electronic controls and a belt final drive. TVS in India and BMW have teamed up together for producing a range of sub-500cc motorcycles and the first one off this rank is the G310R. TVS is providing high-volume production capability and low production costs and this will be combined with the technological know-how of BMW. This is bound to be a great machine and at a very reasonable price as well. Triumph seems to have another winner at its hand with the Thruxton R. It has successfully managed to combine the old and new in this machine. The old-school looks are apparent in the 1200cc two-cylinder engine whereas features such as Ohlinâ€™s suspension Take the most gnarly naked bike you can find, add on a wide handlebar and fairing and you have got yourself a tourer that also boasts a fun factor. A semi-active suspension is the ideal feature as it helps the machine work as a tourer and it is also friendly due to mapping and new heads. The KTM Super Duke GT is an excellent addition because it is a bike that you can ride on the track or on the road while enjoying the same level of fun and comfort. This is a limited edition machine, which is uniquely styled and also technology advanced. It has become a part of the cruiser market and is also referred to as the Flying Fortress. The MGX-21 simply drips carbon fiber and also carries a 21-inch front wheel. Its parts can be more expensive than other motorbikes, but websites like   can help you get parts for the bike without spending too much. The Brutale 800 is already gorgeous, but the 2016 model has been made even sexier by the fashion-conscious engineers at Varese. Furthermore, the new looks of the bike have been combined with the favorite three cylinder engines that have helped the bike hit all the marks. There isnâ€™t much known about this Victory introduction even though the company has created a lot of hype about their new production engine. Working with three renowned customizers  ,   and  , three concept motorbikes have been built, but it is yet to be seen which bike will use this engine. It will be something if it is anything like the concept machines. The biggest success story for Ducaty last year was the Scrambler and became the companyâ€™s best-seller in Australia after being on sale for just eight months. With a 400cc engine, the Sixty2 is now learner legal, which means everyone gets the opportunity to ride it. It has the handling and the looks and as long as the engine works well, it is going to be a hit. The legendary off-roader by Honda has made a return and it is brimming with a host of features that are every bikerâ€™s dream. The Africa twin boasts good handling, is light weight and has the right power characteristics to make it a highly capable and enjoyable machine for fulfilling all your off-roading adventures. Over the years, Benelli has gotten a lot of criticism and not all has been undeserved. Nonetheless, the companyâ€™s name is coming back to the forefront with the latest small-capacity machines. Yes, it is made in China, but the designs are mostly Italian and the Leoncino is an amazing piece. Even though it is another scrambler, it is quite stunning and as long as it is released at the right price and doesnâ€™t have any technological flaws or glitches, it could be tempting for a large number of bikers and riders.",Waqar Hassan

25/02/2016,http://comluv.com/free-alternatives-expensive-microsoft-products/,Free alternatives to expensive Microsoft products - ComLuv,"Yes, you got to work hard, but working smarter is the key to thriving as a business in this changing economy. And working smarter does not always mean buying the most expensive products in the market to help you build your business because that is what everybody else is doing; but working smarter means effectively getting your work done without breaking your budget. If you own a computer, then you are no stranger to Microsoft products and their prices. They dominate the markets of spreadsheets, text documents, slideshows, diagrams, personal information managers etc. and for good reason too; because they work really well. Yet, they are a little pricey, and we cannot always afford them without dangerously getting too close to breaking our fragile budgets. But fortunately, we have plenty of other options which are all good (free or affordable) alternatives to expensive Microsoft counterparts. What you should know is that, just because these alternatives are relatively â€˜cheapâ€™, it doesnâ€™t mean that they are necessarily low in quality. Once you start using them, youâ€™d find them to be surprisingly far better and easier to use! Here is a list of free alternatives for expensive Microsoft products you must know of; Linux is a free Unix-like operating system that is developed collaboratively by over 1000 developers from at least 100 different companies. This open source software can be installed on PCs, laptops, netbooks, mobile and tablet devices, video game consoles, servers, supercomputers and more. The defining component of the software is the Linux kernel, around which many varieties (a.k.a distributions) have been produced by various companies involved in the development of the software. These different distributions are aimed at all kinds of users including home users as well as business users.   is probably the most famous of these distributions but there are many others targeted for specific users. Chrome OS is an operating system developed by Google and is built on the Linux kernel. Since both applications and user data reside in the cloud, Chrome OS primarily runs web applications. Itâ€™s a viable alternative to Windows on small portable netbooks or Chromebooks. If you can use a web browser, then using Chrome OS and its Chromebook would be an effortless task. Thunderbird is regarded as one of the most stable alternatives to Outlook. Itâ€™s recognized for its reliable security system and the many extensions it provides. Itâ€™s an advanced email app with impressive features that is ideal for business as well as personal use. Itâ€™s not only completely free and highly customizable, but Mailbird is an email client specifically designed for speed and as a platform for email productivity. The client can link to both IMAP and POP email accounts. It allows integration with popular productivity apps such as Google Calendar, Evernote, Google Docs etc. Its latest version also allows integration with Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Furthermore, with features like Email Snooze, Video Meetings and Speed Reader, Mailbird stands out as a better alternative for Microsoft Outlook. We all rely on many Google products on a daily basis, and if you have a Google account, then you have free access to Google Docs Spreadsheet application. Itâ€™s Googleâ€™s own version of an office application which is readily available for you unlike the Microsoft application. Its not as feature rich as MS Office but for basic office work its more than enough. It has a word processor, spreadsheets, presentations and you can enhance it through various add-ons. Additionally it operates inside your browser, so whatever you are working on will be saved online. OpenOffice is another completely free alternative to Microsoft Office. Again its not as feature rich as MS Office but for basic office work you donâ€™t need all those features anyway. However, unlike Google Docs , OpenOffice is a downloadable program and can operate locally on your personal computer. Creately is a diagramming software that you can use on your web browser as well as on your desktop. You have the ability to draw over 50 types of diagrams using this app while collaborating with your team in-real time seamlessly. Itâ€™s mostly known for ease of use which is facilitated by its unique features such as 1-click create and text-to-shape. One of the noteworthy features of Creately is that you can easily import your existing Visio files. It also allows you to import Visio Stencil and Template files, giving you access to all your legacy content. Compared to Microsoft, Creately is not only cheap but also much easy to use. Dia is open source software similar to Microsoft Visio. While its user interface closely resembles that of Microsoft Visio, most of its features are also essentially similar. You can create several structured diagrams and charts with Dia using more than 1000 predefined objects and symbols. It supports Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and can also be scripted using the Python programming language. These software weâ€™ve talked about have come to challenge the very dominance of Microsoft products in the market, not simply because they are free or cheaper alternatives, but because they are better-designed and stable. These software are ideal alternatives for anyone looking for affordable tools that have similar functions and features to the expensive Microsoft counterparts. Having them in your arsenal will certainly help you work smarter and better.",Nishadha Silva

Even if it is just a slight discount, theyâ€™ll probably see it as a golden opportunity to get the best value for their money. Moreover, in an era full of opportunists, the demand for  sites has grown steadily. Everybody loves special sales. The use of coupons has been embedded in the mindset of consumers for as long as we can remember. For example, did you know that   look specifically for coupons or special sales? Additionally, 64% of American adults who shop online are more inclined to buying with a loyalty coupon. With the internet, this consumer behavior has opened up an opportunity for online marketers to make money by promoting the brand of others. They gain their traffic by offering special discounts and promos for other products on their site. In return, they receive a small commission for every confirmed purchase. Think affiliate marketing. Of course, it is an excellent way to drive sales for those products, increase brand awareness, and encourage cross-selling as well as up-selling. Moreover, since this method is straightforward and highly achievable within a few weeks, the competition has predictably grown to vicious heights. Make no mistake that thereâ€™s much money to be made from this industry. However, you need to be outstanding if you want a piece of the pie. You must aim to be second to none; otherwise, the competition will just demolish you. Fortunately, it was only a matter of time before the contest itself reveals the best practices to succeed in this business. Here is a simple checklist that will help maximize your coupon siteâ€™s earnings: This may be a no-brainer, but sometimes it is a lot easier to overlook the things right in front of us. With this being said, always remember that  successful coupon sites feature a simple and fast  This way, users can find what they are looking for within moments.

With tools like  you can easily create your search bar without writing a single line of code. Keep in mind that users probably already have an idea in mind of what coupons to look for. When it comes to design, it is often desirable to place the search bar right on top or in the middle of the page. Make it appear as the central feature of your coupon site. It is also always a wise decision to add a CTA (call-to-action) so the users will know what to do within seconds after loading the page. The perfect example would be how   pulled it off with Eventually, a pattern should emerge when it comes to the most in-demand coupons. As a marketer, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with squeezing what you can from cash cows. With coupon sites, you can do this by making sure your best cards are the easiest to find.

Consumers who use coupons are most likely to use them again sometime in the future. This is why they are great remarketing leads that can convert well. Youâ€™ll be missing out on a huge revenue stream if you simply let your customers go even after using one of your coupons. There are several strategies you can use for building your list for email marketing. A tool like   is a good option since it has everything you need for creating opt-in forms to building the actual emails. It is also imperative to present these offers in a non-forceful way, which is why you might need  .

This year, it will be very exciting to at least double the income we generate online. We donâ€™t double our income by doing the same things we did last year at the same pace. Some of these things, we must put in a little more effort. However, some of us put more effort and focus on the wrongs things. Once youâ€™ve identified the right and scalable aspects of your business, focus on them, rinse and repeat, improve your skills, etc, you are certainly going to drive more sales. So as bloggers, who want to generate income blogging, which areas should we focus on? As a matter of fact, the key is not even promoting as many products as you fine online. Rather, focus and promote products that are relevant and add value to your blog for your readers. I have said it a couple of times that   is one of the best ways to generate income online especially if you donâ€™t want to get into the worries of creating and maintaining a product. What you do is simply promote products and get get paid commissions. So how do you proceed this year to double your income through Affiliate Marketing? Most bloggers fail because they are dabbling. They donâ€™t know the right things to do that will generate the right results. They lack the necessary information so everything else they do fails. The first investment I recommend is training. As bloggers, there are things we do that will generate consistent results. I suggest grabbing a copy of  , an ebook I specifically wrote for bloggers in any niche, wishing to make money in Affiliate Marketing blogging. I share my hidden tips in this ebook while digging deep into what some very successful bloggers do to generate the kind of income they show us on their income report pages.

Luckily, massive amounts of buyer behavior data has already been collected and analyzed by large retail corporations, doing most of the legwork for you where figuring out   is concerned! Your website needs to look stellar, full stop. And if it doesnâ€™t, you should upgrade! Dated sites donâ€™t look trustworthy to savvy buyers. Your ecommerce functions need to be simple and streamlined. If your website doesnâ€™t meet these qualifications, consider using a low-cost website builder; you can even compare some of the best with  . The great part? Many modern website builders make it easy to upload, update, and alter product information, and offer secure checkout options with great additional features. Since your homepage is what many visitors will land on, it needs to have a lot of wow factorâ€_ while also helping your store  And unfortunately, itâ€™s very common that online shops are designed without any thought to what makes a great online shopping experience. If the main point of your   is to  then you need to be concerned with some of these details! You should always have a clear and prominent, professional-looking logo in both the header and the footer. Always reference the brand name in any homepage text rather than â€˜Iâ€™; this makes your website look more professional and is likely to increase your websiteâ€™s profitability. Logos create brand loyalty, and knowing that the store in question  a brand subconsciously encourages visitors to trust the site. You should also consider Display products on the home page! Either with slider images, columns showing most-purchased or most popular items, or showing product categories; just make sure that your siteâ€™s visitors can get to your products from the home page. There are a few things each of your product pages should always have! Every product should have more than 1 photo, for example; and should also display color and size options (rather than having different product pages for each color or size option). Some   owners donâ€™t add any copy or description about the product, but doing so always makes your website look far more legitimate. Â  If your product needs a sizing guide, link to it on the product page, as well as to your return policy. Another important thing? Item reviews or buyer comments. Potential buyers are always more swayed to purchase items which have reviews. And the last important thing to include on each and every product page, at the bottom, is either a â€˜similar itemsâ€™ or â€˜customers also boughtâ€™ list! This increases click-throughs and up-sells, meaning visitors are more likely to buy more at your store. The shopping cart experience can be great and breezy, or it can be so frustrating as to cause potential buyers to abandon the cart entirely. On the first step, buyers should be able to choose to buy without needing to register; according to some statistics, this can dramatically increase purchases. Buyers should also be able to see shipping costs early on in the checkout process, and have a wide variety of payment options. Most simple checkout plugins can allow for as many as 50 different options, but ideally, you should be able to accept debit, credit, paypal, and google wallet payments.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Of course, investment in a good market is the best choice for any millionaire or billionaire because this causes the money to increase. However, you donâ€™t always feel like making investments from your money. Sometimes it is about your passion, spirit and dreams. Buying a house on the hilltop is not just an investment but it is more of a realization of a dream. Even a person living in a small house with a family of 10 would think of having such a house. Keeping novelties, buying expensive musical instruments, making peopleâ€™s wishes come true etc. are also a few things people with money like to do. Among these things, there are some people who have the passion of owning exotic cars. These are the cars that are close to the ground in height, look out of this world on the road and are made in a very small number because of the huge price tags. Why do people like to buy   when they can travel in other ordinary cars as well? There are many reasons for people to buy exotic cars and they can change from person to person. However, a few common reasons are given below: Spending money on looking rich and having a high status was once only associated with men but thatâ€™s not the case anymore. Today, there are just as many Hollywood celebrities with exotic cars as there are male celebrities. There is a huge list of modern celebrities who have astonished even the male celebrities around them with their choice of cars and how they converted those cars to exactly how they wanted them. A great example is Paris Hilton who got a custom Bentley Similarly, you have Nicki Minaj who has her Lamborghini Aventador painted with matte pink not only on the body but also on the rims. Beyonce has taken things a step further from all other female celebrities with her passion and purchase of 1959 Silver Cloud Rolls-Royce that has a value of more than $1,000,000. On top of everything, this amazing old classic is a convertible so it will be a bit frugality of words to say that Beyonce has got a gem. As it becomes easier with time to earn money â€“ thanks to the internet jobs â€“ more and more people are buying the exotic cars. Not all exotic cars are made equal and while some look great, some have the looks from out of this world that make every head turn on the road when they pass. There are quite a few exotic car brands that are known all around the world and are considered the face of exotic car manufacturing. However, some brands are known for their uniqueness in what they do and   is one of them. The new entries into exotic cars from Jaguar need some special mention. The recent 2016 F-Type series from Jaguar is no doubt one of the coolest out there. The power of these cars is to be talked about later, the first thing that blows you away is how these cars have been designed. There are coupe and convertible models available of this car. The exterior of the car is tremendously beautiful with headlights that are more like tear drops stretched at one side. The side skirts are fully crafted with proper care of the aerodynamics and the back lights are as thin as they could be. The dials on the interior are analog with options for auto and sport mode available at your fingertips. The interior can be designed as you want so the personalization of the car depends completely on you. The engine on the car is V6 with best acceleration available on F-Type S that allows you to go from 0 to 60mph in just a little less than 5 seconds. On the automatic models you get 8-speed transmission and almost all the different models are available in the coupe and convertible form. Jaguar exotic cars needed a special mention because one has to agree that these are currently the coolest looking cars on the roads compared to the still old styled exotic cars mostly popular among people. A few other cars that need to be mentioned for offering some cool new looks are Lotus Evora 400, Porsche Cayman GT4, Audi R8 with V10 etc. The most obvious thing that you need to have before you buy an exotic car is of course the money. However, there is some other stuff that needs your attention before you buy one. First, you have to make sure to buy an exotic car that matches your personality. Some personalities are more like sober personalities and they look cooler when they are riding the more down-toned and subdued exotic cars like R series from Audi. A lively personality with a passionate look on the face would look great in a car like Jaguar F-Type. Furthermore, you have to know that exotic cars are already designed with intricate details and attention to even the most minor things that count. If you want personal changes in these cars you have to be very intelligent and careful with that. You donâ€™t want to ruin the great looks of your exotic car. For example, Nicki Minaj is not praised much for painting her Lamborghini pink. However, if you are a person who cares less about peopleâ€™s opinions, you can have your exotic car just the way you want. You can also choose your car according to the event you are about to attend.",Waqar Hassan

28/11/2015,http://comluv.com/brain-injury-patients-will-able-communicate-latest-technology/,Brain Injury Patients Will Be Able To Communicate With Latest Technology,"Any severe accidents that take place on the road each day can result in brain injuries that either completely change a personâ€™s life or take the life away consequently. Just like a computer, the human brain is a sensitive machine thatâ€™s why the nature put it in a hard skull. However, sudden jerks and big damages can still damage the soft and sensitive brain inside. The big problem with human brain is that it canâ€™t be repaired as easily as you could repair a desktop computer. Scientists, doctors and engineers are working to this day to come up with some technology that could help quadriplegic victims in getting back to a normal life. Some recent steps taken in improving the lifestyle of quadriplegic patients have proven to be revolutionary on a small scale and if things work fine, it is expected that making quadriplegic patients live normal lives is not far away. Have a look at the recent example of this amazing step up: This article will revolve around patient T6. This patient, who happens to be a female, operated a laptop using just the pulses of her brain. The new technology let her use Android whereas she had been working to make her communication possible using a system from the 1980s. Lou Gehrigâ€™s disease is what keeps her from moving and communicating like normal human beings. Also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, this amazing patient is fully paralyzed starting from her neck to her toes. She could think but not communicate with the world. Such a condition comes when a person receives big damages to the spinal cord. Brain-machine interfaces were the only way to make that communication possible. Due to the paralysis of nearly entire body, these people are not able to speak. Due to paralysis being from neck-down, they canâ€™t write to communicate too. It is only possible for such patients to have any connection to the outside world through revolutionary technology that could allow them to use other means to communicate than normal ones. Itâ€™s not that this challenge is new for medical scientists and engineers. They have been trying to take on this problem for quite some time now. The technology to make brain-machine interfaces possible saw its peak two decades ago. Engineers and medical scientists were working together to make it   for the purpose of communication. Many inventions were made in pursuit of this objective but they were not put to use because their impracticality was always the issue. One of the many inventions allowed brain injury patients to communicate with people by moving their eyes as their eyes controlled the movement of a pointer on a computer screen just like a hand controls a mouse. Accuracy was a huge concern for these devices. Due to their bad accuracy, the patients had to type many of the things again and again. This was a tiring process for them and so the inventions were considered impractical. There were some other problems other than this too. The equipment that was invented for these devices was so extraordinary that only the patients that came from wealthy backgrounds could afford it. Patients that did not have rich backgrounds were not going to get any help from such technologies. Even if efforts were made to make this technology affordable, the issue that it tired its users was going to remain there. Coming from Stanford University, Paul Nuyujukian is a person who is always in touch with such technological advancements because he is a neuro-engineer himself. At a talk in 2015 that he made for annual conference of Society for Neuroscience he said that they were working on this technology day and night. The main objective for them was to cut the costs of the technology so it could be given access through clinics. Neural prosthesis was an idea they came up with while working on this task. It was not their mission to leave eye tracking technology behind and move to something more practical, affordable and sophisticated. During their work they had observed that making a patient use an organ for communication was not efficient and practical. They wanted to create a connection right from  . They had to use brain signals for this to happen. The brain signals had to be translated in a computer-understandable language for this. If this became a reality, eye tracking technology would become much inferior and unusable. The idea was great but its price was high too. Patient T6 was made a part of these experiments. They were now ready to work on their idea and make it a reality without a huge price tag. BrainGate clinical trials were going to be conducted using the patient T6. Her consent was crucial in these experiments and it was obtained with ease as patient T6 wanted to see a change in her life. 100-channel electrode array was used to make a connection of her brain with the computer. Stanford subdivision was doing a parallel experiment with its keyboard with which was going to allow patients to type words without using any organ but the pulses of their brains. In short, both the experiments were similar to each other at some point. A prototype of this keyboard was brought to use and patient T6 was again the main character in making this experiment successful. The pulses in her brain passed through neural prosthesis and then were translated to letters she wanted to type. She could do all this by simply looking at the letter. Once again, accuracy was a problem in this experiment and the tiring exercises of looking at words and removing them repeatedly did not prove this experiment to be a success. To Dr. Nuyujukian this system looked outdated and the presence of electrodes really bothered him. Looking at the modern touchscreens the team involved in the experiment came up with a great idea. They realized that their system acted quite like a modern touchscreen did. They put this idea to good use and went ahead to invent their own touchscreen system. While in the process of doing this it came to them that they were working on something they did not have to i.e. touchscreen systems were already in the market so they didnâ€™t have to create a new one. The device they put their hands on to carry out this experiment was Nexus 9 in this case. The setup was now being prepared using the  . They did not have to do much work in doing that because most of the things that they thought they had to do were already completed because they had bought the technology from the market. The system was complete in less than a year and the need of electrodes was removed from the system by putting Bluetooth technology to use. The neural prosthetics took signals from the brain and carried them to the tablet. The Bluetooth technology made the connection possible just like it does for a mouse connected with a tablet or laptop. The experiment was conducted by connecting the setup to patient T6. Short movie clips were made as patient T6 used the system to communicate with the device. Patient T6 was easily moving around on the internet using this technology. She started searching for the topics of her interest on Google with this technology and among many topics her favorite was gardening. Dr. Nuyujukian said that they could not help but smile at the fact that patient T6 now had the power to use Android apps like anyone in the world does. She was only thinking of the movements in her head and the setup was conveying messages to the tablet using Bluetooth â€“ not at all tiring for the patient. Of course, just like any other system this system will also expire after some time. However, the timeline given by the team for current system to expire is 2 years. For 2 years the patient T6 can continue to use the internet freely. While the setup is used the team is going to work on other things too. One of the many objectives for teams is to make the system even more durable. Dr. Nuyujukian commented by saying that they have finally created an affordable system and the available technology has made this possible. He said that the affordability of this system is going to allow them to bring this technology like regular equipment in clinics. The team has now started moving ahead to make the technology better, more practical and easier to use for the patients. New features will be introduced and the current systemâ€™s limited use of point and click will be upgraded to dragging features as well. Multi-touch features will also be added to the system and while the equipment is only available at BrainGate clinical facilities, it will be spread to other regions to bring happiness to patients who need it. As of now, this particular system is only working with the Android operating system. The team wishes to make it usable for other operating systems as well. Progress is being made and the team wants to call it a complete system with all the features on it that they have only imagined. Personal injury attorneys will now have a new chapter included in their information. They can now calculate the impact and costs of such a system in their personal injury cases too. Anyone who has received spinal cord and brain injuries resulting in paralysis of the body should talk about this program during the settlement of the case.

It is never late to apply all lessons you learn on your journey, and make it work. Success doesnâ€™t come overnight, and every step you take is another lesson. However, there are six lessons almost every business person learns on their way to the top. Whatever business you are in, there is a 99% chance that you will come across more than one problem, and that you will make a mistake, which will lead to failure. At first, these situations seem like a point where everything falls apart, but at the end you manage to swim and not sink. With time, you will have certainly learned to use your mistakes to your advantage and benefit from them. Wrong choices definitely take us to the right place, once we realize that failures arenâ€™t actually obstacles, hopefully not too late. As we focus on our careers, we forget about our loved ones and that their support is the one thing that keeps us going. When you leave your job obligations at the office, and stop working overtime, you can spend some quality time with your family. At the end, what matters is a nice family dinner filled with laughter. All animal lovers, know that having a dog, a cat or any kind of a pet is a bliss, and they always put a smile on your face. Whether you are sad or angry, you cannot but become happy when you see the cute look on their face. Whether you are   or a dog, know that caring for animals is also a sweet obligation, and if you are single living with a pet, you know itâ€™s a full time job. Itâ€™s like having a baby, who seeks attention. Our lives are stressful and in order to be prepared to face the problems, we need to have our body ready, because it will protect us from exhaustion and pressure. By exercising, we are not only strengthening our body, Also, as exercising boosts endorphins, we become happier, and you can face any stressful situation much easier and solve it efficiently with smile on your face which is why you donâ€™t have an excuse to give up on  .

Also, when making a decision always ask for a second opinion, because you need to hear all the options, and youâ€™ll be surprised how many things you didnâ€™t even consider. However, this doesnâ€™t mean you shouldnâ€™t do it your way, but it will help you better understand every aspect of it.

Invest in your team, and organize different team-building activities, which will contribute to them learning how to cope with problems that occur constantly in every business. Building a career isnâ€™t easy, and can become a fulltime job, which leads to sacrificing your private life and your hobbies. The main thing you sacrifice is yourself, because you stop caring about yourself and your whole life is then dedicated to one single goal â€“ success. Being overly ambitious can lead to you not living a fulfilled life, as you will realize what you have missed out on in the end. Invest in yourself and take the necessary vacations, spend some quality time with your family and donâ€™t forget to enjoy your life.

While you hope to never be involved in a serious crash, itâ€™s also possible that you will be involved in a not-so-serious car crash that sets you back financially. Either way, crashes happen, and itâ€™s better to be prepared and have a good understanding of what to do in these situations. However, some people make mistakes that can cause injury or get them into trouble. The following are six mistakes people make when in a crash that you should definitely avoid. If you are injured, itâ€™s perfectly fine for you to stay inside your vehicle if moving will make your injury worse. In these instances, itâ€™s best to wait for medical assistance. However, if you are fine, you shouldnâ€™t stay where you are. Instead, itâ€™s best to try and move your vehicle to a shoulder or a non-busy road (again, if possible). If you remain on the road, you are putting yourself at more risk of being hit by another vehicle. Moving to the shoulder not only keeps you safer, but also allows traffic, including first responders, to get to you more quickly. Nobody likes to be in a crash, especially when theyâ€™re not at fault. However, getting angry and yelling and screaming at the other people involved will only make the situation worse.   and catch your breath, and then remain calm when talking with other drivers and first responders.

The big problem with this is that all data is not created equally, which is something that you have to consider when looking for a data provider that will meet all of your needs. If you want to have success as a marketer, then you should make sure that you ask questions about your data providerâ€™s services. While many people are only  , there are a number of other things that you should be focused on as well. Â  You want to find a company that actually collects their own data. When a company chooses to collect their own data, they are able to control how the data is collected. You can choose how the data is classified, which means that you never have to worry about your target audience being connected with the relevant information about your products.

If you do not check your data frequently, then your   might not be well-represented. Make sure to ask the data provider that you are using what their look back window is.

Besides, children arenâ€™t that easy to entertain anymore â€“ their IT intelligence is far more developed today than when you were a kid.

Itâ€™s like with adults, really â€“ you need to select a present according to a childâ€™s interests. This list consists of seven different types of gifts, and all of them are stimulating and entertaining, so Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll be able to find the perfect one. Itâ€™s never too early to start with books. Naturally, you just need to keep the childâ€™s age in mind and a find a suitable theme, but that shouldnâ€™t be an issue. There are so many talented childrenâ€™s authors, so  . In order to really draw a childâ€™s attention you should go with illustrated books â€“ you need to understand that visual information provide the strongest stimulus, so make sure that you go with something entertaining, but colorful as well. It is extremely important for children to develop their social skills early on. Children may have a lot of difficulty socialising later in life if they donâ€™t learn how to get along with others from an early age, which can lead to them developing certain psychological issues as adults. Board games are mentally stimulating and quite useful when it comes to learning how to share, negotiate, develop strategies, etc. However, like with books, you also need to   according to a childâ€™s age. Enabling a child to have an artistic filter may be just the thing they need.

Obviously, any gadget would be a well-accepted gift, but Iâ€™d suggest to get a kidsâ€™ version if youâ€™re getting something for a toddler. Those editions are much more resilient, so thereâ€™s less of a chance for it to get damaged. Being able to fix something around the house is always useful, and the sooner your child starts  , the more capable they will be when they grow up. The whole point of a DIY project is that you probably have all the materials you need right at home. However, you should equip your child with a proper set of tools that will enable them to build and create cool items. Naturally, adult supervision will be required here.

It is a fact that you are safe online as much as the weakest link using your computer, and for most people, that link is their child. Kids have a constant habit of  . They try to go around security measures in order to visit sites that you have banned for them. And what is most frustrating of all is the fact that they are usually far ahead of their parents, making them unable to keep up with them. Kids learn quickly and it is probable that half the children which are less than 18 years old will learn to breach the security system one way or the other. The costs for these breaches can be very high and they can come in the form of money, information or damaged computers.               Figure out how skilled your kids are. Keep an eye on your childrenâ€™s ability to get around the restrictions you have put in and, as they get older, try monitoring their ability to alter the settings. One way to do this is to approach your children with humor and curiosity and ask them nicely how they did something. It is more likely that they will give you a straight answer if you donâ€™t yell and, in some cases, they will be proud to show you what they know. There is another way how you can check your children and this includes searching history. It is very important that you teach your children about online security â€“ the sooner you discuss this, the better. Talk with your kids and see if they understand that the online world is much similar with the real world. Let them know that there are also bad people on the internet and that safety online is as important as in real life. When it comes to online protection and security, ignorance is not a bliss. Malware and hackers are everywhere and their focus is not only on big corporations with a lot of money. These threats can affect anyone who uses the internet recklessly and this especially applies to children. Malware is bad software designed to infect someoneâ€™s computer and then exploit its weaknesses. It can steal information from your computer, destroy data, make your machine run slowly, etc. Installing quality antivirus software and updating it on a regular basis can be helpful, however, there is nothing that can secure a computer from reckless web browsing. A hacker can even hack into your online banking account and steal money from you, which can lead to severe consequences such as making you  . If your kid uses your work PC, you can lose valuable work data and this can ultimately lead to getting fired.

Sometimes, you might even think that it is an irrelevant question. However, apparently, presentations can help you get ahead in the game called Marketing. Slide presentations have come a long way since being used conventionally for academic and professional purposes. In this modern era, no information is ever valuable if you are not able to explain it wellâ€”that is, through visual content, particularly slide presentations. â€œSlide decks are easy for virtually anyone to see,â€ù says Rand Fishkin in a  . â€œThey are a simple, powerful way to present content. You can present visual content. You can present charts and graphs. You can even embed video. You can do all sorts of stuff, and they are easy to make possible because you can screen capture elements from all sorts of websites and then quickly show attribution.â€ù From the traditional software and tools we used long ago to make basic slideshow presentations, we are now being introduced to a wider variety of applications for improved visual content. Using this form of content creation could be advantageous, especially because people nowadays quickly absorb information through visual means. If you think you have already included everything in your marketing strategy, think again. One should just never disregard nor underestimate the power of slide decks in the marketing world or any other industry. Without slide presentations, you will not be able to elaborate on your point well and give your audiences a concrete description and information about your product or business. Slides rely on images and visuals, which makes it a perfect choice for creating valuable visual content. This is the very reason that makes presentations perfect for content marketing. â€œContent marketing is the process of creating any type of visual, text, audio, or other multimedia information to educate and engage prospective customers,â€ù says Michael Jenkins at Shout!, a  . â€œThe power of content marketing is that as you present more and more valuable information, your community and prospect pool grows.â€ù Before, businesses would present the set of slides that they made while elaborating the key points during meetings. Now, slides can stand alone as content pieces for your marketing strategy. Most importantly, using slides to generate a different type of content lets you diversify your content production. This allows you to reach out to your audience who likes written and visual content! There are many ways on how you can make effective slide presentations. Using   has been   way for people to create slide decks for business meetings. However, there are other tools you can use to develop visually compelling slide decks as content pieces.

Itâ€™s fortunate Philip is royalty where he is, because he might as well be the king of music land. You see, Sweden is not just another European country. America and Britain donâ€™t hold a monopoly over musicians who set the global music charts ablaze. Every now and then, the Swedes make an aural connection with the masses to the point that you could argue that they rule pop music. If Madonna and Michael Jackson are the Queen and King of Pop, then Sweden is the Kingdom of Pop. Aside from Icona Pop and Avicii, here are 11 talking points why: One of the most inescapable songs of the late Aughts, â€œYoung Folksâ€ù has appeared in everything from  and   to FIFA 08. So entrenched was the song in pop culture that it catapulted the man doing the unforgettable whistles, Adam Privitera, to stardom. He would go on to whistle his way through Maroon 5â€™s   â€œMoves Like Jaggerâ€ù and Flo Ridaâ€™s summer anthem â€œWhistle.â€ù Yes, â€œYoung Folksâ€ù is truly something to whistle home about in a wedding. That the most famous musicians out of Sweden consisted of married couples is just a tiny fraction of the reason why you should include ABBA songs in your wedding. Their songs are simply contagious, thatâ€™s why. No mortal man or woman on earth with a good pair of listening ears could have resisted â€œDancing Queenâ€ù the first or second time. Itâ€™s a shoo-in for any wedding party â€” that and the painfully obvious â€œI Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do.â€ù If the groomâ€™s name is â€œFernando,â€ù well, donâ€™t be afraid to slip it in during the mother-groom dance. Also, hearing â€œTake a Chance on Meâ€ù will goad everyoneâ€™s inner disco god out of hiding. All hail the Queen of the Clouds. Thatâ€™s the name of the debut album by Tove Lo, currently Swedenâ€™s ambassador to the international charts. Her single â€œHabitsâ€ù recently peaked at number 3 on the Billboard charts â€” the highest position for a Swedish act since Ace of Base reached the summit â€œThe Signâ€ù decades ago. While the song does not have the most moral of all messages, Tove does have some wedding-worthy cuts in her short but surely expanding catalogue. Recommended cuts from her album include the dirty love songs â€œMomentsâ€ù and â€œGot Love.â€ù Ace of Base, one of the biggest-selling bands of the 1990s, is proudly made in Sweden. The group is one of only a handful of recording artists who could lay claim to a diamond-selling album in the US, i.e. an album that has sold 10 million copies. This is one of the many distinctions of their debut album, which yielded one world-shaking hit after another, including the inescapable â€œThe Sign.â€ù Although the song remains a marker of the decade, itâ€™s â€œBeautiful Life,â€ù the first single off their sophomore album that will, lyrics-wise, inject some happiness into your wedding party. Written by a band member while vacationing on a comely beach, it will reaffirm your zest for marriage and life as a whole. Itâ€™s worth noting that one of â€œBeautiful Lifeâ€™sâ€ù producers, Max Martin, would go on to change, vicariously, the pop music landscape. He is the man behind some of the biggest hits by the biggest American recording artists in the world, everyone from Britney Spears and Taylor Swift to Katy Perry. â€œâ€_Baby One More Time,â€ù â€œOops! I Did It Again,â€ù â€œSince Even   likes him some EDM. Songs from the Swedish DJ supergroup composed of Axwell, Steve Angello, and Sebastian Ingrosso will likely make all the kids in your party throw their inhibitions. While you technically would not want â€œIt Must Have Been Loveâ€ù playing at your first dance (â€œBut itâ€™s over nowâ€_â€ù), Roxetteâ€™s discography is chockfull of other alternatives. The twosome, who entered the scene several years after ABBAâ€™s popularity ebbed in the 1980s, released many radio-friendly hits, such as â€œThe Look,â€ù â€œSpending My Time,â€ù â€œDangerous,â€ù and â€œListen to Your Heart.â€ù But itâ€™s â€œVulnerableâ€ù that will best capture any groomâ€™s sentiments for his bride. Lykke broke out in a big way when her composition, â€œPossibility,â€ù was featured on the soundtrack of  . Since then, Ms. Li has been a ubiquity in the soundtracks of young-adult TV shows and movies, e.g.     and  Itâ€™s hard to pick one Lykke Li love song for a wedding â€” there are just too many to mention â€” but one of the best is her first international single, â€œLittle Bit.â€ù On your wedding day, it pays to remember those first moves that led you to the altar; this song is a good reminder of those.Â  Or you may opt for her biggest hit instead, â€œI Follow Rivers,â€ù which talks about love that will ford every stream. Robyn refuses to go away, and that kind of longevity is inspiring. She has spent enough time in the business to change her sound from American-style R&B leanings to pure pop. In 2010, she released her arguably finest work yet, a trilogy of opuses called   â€œHang With Meâ€ù is a particularly cool love track set to a shimmering electro beat. But if youâ€™re still in love with the Robyn who gave you â€œRobyn Is Here,â€ù it might be a cool idea to set your wedding party entrance to â€œShow Me Love.â€ù Her audible passion in the lines, â€œIâ€™ll give you my heart if you just give me love / Every day and every night,â€ù is really all you need. Just in jest, you can set your processional to this novelty song by Swedish glam metal band Europe. If youâ€™re the type who is down for irreverence on this most special of days, go for it. But if youâ€™re not really the funny type, donâ€™t try hard and go for something more traditional. â€œLovefoolâ€ù is one of those songs that stick hard, fast. Once you hear it, itâ€™s hard to shake it off. The Cardigans may have dark songs in their catalogue, but itâ€™s â€œLovefoolâ€ù that they are most known for.Â  Radio played the saccharine-sweet pop song to the hilt in the 90s. It would go on to be featured on the soundtracks of two cinematic love stories,  and Baz Luhrmanâ€™s  . It should be part of your wedding soundtrack too.

Just like you need a room for sleeping or one for dining, you need your own space for conducting business. A professional-looking home office is highly important if your clients or business associates need to visit you or if you need to arrange meetings at your home. With that in mind, letâ€™s go over a few basic things you can do to transform a room in your home into a full-fledged office. You should consider several different aspects when choosing the room for your workspace. First of all, make sure that the room you are considering is the closest to your front door. This way your clients wonâ€™t have to go through your entire home or through the living room to get to your office. Keep your private life separated from your professional life, and make sure there are no distractions. People usually say they donâ€™t like to bring work home, which, in your case, is rather impossible. However, you need to make sure that the room is separated from the rest of the house, and that you can meet your clients and work without any interruptions. Having a desk and two chairs in a room doesnâ€™t make it a proper workplace. Besides the basic equipment necessary for your work, you need to make sure the furniture is right for the job. Obviously, you need a desk, but depending on the size of the room, you may want to consider some armchairs, a coffee table or even a sofa. Look up   and make the best home office that your budget allows. Having a well designed home office is highly beneficial, not just for the important meetings, but also for increasing your productivity and overall performance. Believe it or not, color can have a big affect on your physical and emotional Despite the fact that you are at home, if the meeting is about to start, you need to be dressed up for it. Of course, depending on the type of the business and the significance of the meeting, you will choose to wear something that will be acceptable in any business environment. Even though you are at home, you need your shoes, so donâ€™t forget to lose those slippers and put something more appropriate. By dressing up, you are   you are, and that working from home doesnâ€™t affect the quality nor the professional approach. This also goes for the office itself â€“ spice it up with some creative decoration, but keep everything elegant and professional. Your clients will be more comfortable and feel less like they are in somebodyâ€™s house, invading their privacy. Apart from the things you really need, your office shouldnâ€™t be an equipment storage facility. Before you install any of it, think about whether you really need it. For example, a new TV in your home office might sound like a good idea, e.g. if you canâ€™t watch your favorite program in the living room because your kids are watching cartoons. However, most of the time it will only distract you from work and prevent you from successfully completing your tasks and  . Everybody likes to work from home, but not everybody knows how to deal with it. Setting up a home office is an important part of an efficient and productive business. However, your home office must be a place of work, with no sudden family matters or similar distractions. A well-lit workplace with modern, yet professional-looking furniture will make you and your clients more comfortable, and significantly improve your concentration.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

This is soul food, and as your body needs meals, so does your soul! By checking out the next seven money-saving tips, youâ€™ll be able to learn more about how to lower your overall traveling budget. If you donâ€™t want to waste your money, you need to use your time more wisely.  , you need to do some serious online browsing, and youâ€™ll be surprised by the amount of discounts, cheap traveling plans and last minute offers youâ€™ll encounter. However, you shouldnâ€™t book or reserve anything until youâ€™re absolutely sure that a particular offer is the best one youâ€™re able to find. Traveling during the peak of the high season simply canâ€™t be healthy for your budget. Thatâ€™s exact period of the year when everything is overpriced and ridiculously expensive. The only thing thatâ€™s absolutely certain about traveling during the high season is that itâ€™s going to be crowded, and waiting in lines is probably the one thing youâ€™ll remember about your whole journey. So, be smart and travel in low season when prices are reasonable, and when youâ€™re able to hear yourself think. If youâ€™re traveling to a distant location, you shouldnâ€™t really bother with other types of transportation, especially if you donâ€™t have any time to waste â€“ we all have jobs and families to get back to. However, instead of taking a direct flight, you should settle for spending a bit more time in your plane, so you can save a significant amount of money. If youâ€™re willing to go a step This is the golden rule â€“ renting a room in a hotel just after youâ€™ve arrived somewhere will undoubtedly reflect on your accommodation billing. As a matter of fact, you need to avoid hotels, and search for alternative solutions. If youâ€™re going to an exotic city, like Amsterdam perhaps, thatâ€™s crowded with tourists practically any time of year, itâ€™s obviously not a good idea to enter the first hotel you see and ask for a room. Instead of doing that,   â€“ youâ€™ll have more room for yourself, and itâ€™ll definitely be cheaper. The time of guides has passed â€“  . When people are unsatisfied with someone service, you can be positive that theyâ€™ll leave their comments online. Also, this kind of critic will show you how to eat, drink and move around a specific city like a local, and they always know the cheapest and the most efficient ways to do so. This is another way to handle your budget â€“ donâ€™t stop working. Now, working full hours simply isnâ€™t smart, but a couple of hours per day should do the trick, especially if your job onlyÂ requires a good internet connection, like a lot of them do nowadays. If thatâ€™s not the case, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll be able to find a seasonal job where youâ€™re going â€“ something simple, like handing out flyers. Even if the only job youâ€™ll be able to find is waitressing, youâ€™ll be able to find out a lot of things from the locals, and spend time with all kinds of people, which will obviously help you get to know their culture better. This is just a beginning. Once you start exploring different ways to save money while traveling, and adopt them as a part of your routine, the whole experience will be a lot different and â€“ cheaper! One last piece of advice â€“ planning is everything, so youâ€™ll definitely need to work on your organization skills, and upgrade them, but trust me, itâ€™s worth it.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

If you are on the lookout for good server options, here are a few things that you may want to keep in mind: Know what your needs are. The first and most important thing that you should do is assess your needs. Before you go out and purchase a pricey state of the art and top of the line server unit, you have to make sure that you actually need it. For instance, it would be a waste of money on your part if you were to buy a server that can host 100 units when you only have 10 employees to put in the server system. Consider virtualization. Virtualization is a process which will help you make the most out of whichever server unit you will purchase. Through virtualization, a single server will be able to act as multiple servers.

You will need to make some sacrifices, as not everything can be done the way you imagined it. You are limited either financially or with the amount of space available, so do not go overboard. Do a little bit of research online, gather some nice ideas, and then youâ€™ll be able to find something that suits your needs. Different people and different homes need different gardens, and I am sure that youâ€™ll find what is best for you. Â  Whether the garden is in front or in the back of your house will determine what you want to do with it. A front type garden should be more oriented towards looking good, having lots of flower beds and nice decorations, than being practical, as you wonâ€™t be spending time there as much as you would in the back garden. The back garden can be   where you can go to relax from all the commotion, and enjoy your free time. Create enough room for your furniture there, so that it doesnâ€™t feel overcrowded. Bigger shrubs and plants should go towards the wall or fence, while smaller should be placed around paths. Create a design that is calming, yet good looking. Â  It Â  Flowerbeds are a great and a more natural way to decorate your garden, but I believe that using outdoor pots and various planters is a bit more practical, especially if you live in a place with a harsh climate â€“ that way, you can enable your plants to survive even during the winter. If youâ€™ve never dealt with pots before, you should definitely do some research in order to  , and plan your project carefully. The great thing about big planters is that you can make anything grow â€“ fruits, vegetables or flowers â€“ because they come in all shapes and sizes! Â  While plants hold the most prominent place in any garden, you will also need to make sure that everything else is spotless, too. You can create a few paths and a small area where people can walk, you can use decorative gravel to emphasize certain spots and flowers, or you can even have fountains installed. Some people even have fish ponds placed in their back gardens, but this is recommended only to those places where the climate is appropriate. Place a few gnomes here and there, and you will surely make a wonderful garden for yourself and your family to enjoy and have fun in. Itâ€™s quite important to make a thorough plan before you start with actual work. So, take your time, gather different ideas and have fun. I hope youâ€™ll find my suggestions helpful, and I really hope that you succeed in creating the perfect little garden!",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Cities like Miami and Orlando are some of the most desirable places to live â€“ it is always sunny there, filled with tourists, and they do not fall short off attractions. In other words, if you would want a place where you can efficiently sell a house at a higher price after a few adjustments, then you canâ€™t go wrong with state of Florida. Flipping houses can be a lucrative hobby, and if you are interested in interior design, the whole experience will be rather fulfilling. If you are very enthusiastic about interior design, yet still interested in making a good investment, here are a few tips on how to approach this matter. The first thing you need to do in order to increase the chances of a profitable sale is to make some improvements to the house. Since painting and changing tiles are the most troublesome tasks, you can start by focusing on those things. If the new house owners are not required to jump into these tasks, right after buying a house, you will be able to raise the price. When you are trying to make a profitable arrangement, always go for convenience â€“ the less people need to do around the house, the better.  â€“ a garden with an array of different flowers will make it a perfect place for relaxing. Donâ€™t stop there, if you can throw in a porch along with a hammock, a small fountain or a pond, you can turn the house into a small slice of heaven. Additionally, you can buy a pool table and place it in the basement, thus turning it into a game room. Introduce some final touches by placing bunk beds and toys in room intended for kids, and there you have it, a perfect family home atmosphere. After all, this is the clientele you should strive to attract, someone who wants a fresh start with his or her family and is willing to pay You should also prepare yourself not to be caught off guard. Before you start the whole open house event, call in an exterminator to get rid of any possible pests, and call someone to check if the house has any signs of moulding, or if there are humid areas where mold can easily form.  , and it would be ridiculous to throw away all the previous efforts just because you didnâ€™t take this issue into account. The next step towards a successful sale is advertising. Of course, when you are selling a single house it is largely different than when you are trying to advertise a product or spread brand awareness. This is mostly done via newspaper or online ad. Still there  . A good way to hook your readers and make your potential customers interested in what you have to say, is by telling a story. Also you should post some videos and pictures of the house as a part of your add. However, make sure these are done with a high definition camera. If you are unable to purchase a good camera or find someone to help you out, you can upload the photos to your computer, and use filters or photo editing programs to enhance its quality. Donâ€™t forget to point out the location, its convenience, all the perks that come along with house, and always say that the price is negotiable. Always make sure you are positive during tours â€“ have some food and refreshments in place, like lemonade and cookies. Feel confident as you present the house to the visitors, and ask the neighbours if they can put on a friendly face when they see them in the yard. Â I wish you the best of luck in your transaction, and I am sure that after landing the first contract you will start to love this job, since it leads to a lucrative career.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

However, if you do the basics right, youâ€™ll be left with only a minimal set of chores you need to do on a weekly basis. But before you reach that level, you need to do some through cleaning up, gardening and decorating. In order to save you some time, I came up with the following four steps that made my garden beautiful with no difficulties whatsoever, so check them out! For a second, try to forget the previous appearance of your garden, and only set your mind on its landscape. This will enable you to find out if all that space is used properly, because there might be a few simple tasks that you can perform to make it a lot more functional. For this process, Iâ€™d recommend that you check out a few different websites that offer tons and tons of different ideas, because this will enable you to take a look at your garden from a completely different perspective. Besides,   â€“ you just need internet connection and some time. After you get familiar with all the possibilities, you should be realistic and objectively assess which of those ideas can be applied to your garden, without spending too much money on the whole project, of course. Whether your garden has been under a coat of snow up until now or you have simply neglected it for a while, the first thing to do is cleaning it. This is probably the most boring part of this project, but itâ€™s quite necessary. Equip yourself with a quality pair of gardening gloves and a pack of trash bags, so you can promptly remove all leaves and while youâ€™re at it all weeds, so you donâ€™t have to deal with it later. Plants require a different kind of nurturing depending on their origins, naturally. When it comes to fertilizing, this process needs to be repeated at least twice per year â€“ plants need food as well. The second part of feeding them is watering, which shouldnâ€™t be done more than once per week. However, when you do water your backyard, make sure to water it deep â€“ it will give your plants enough water for a week, but it will also keep insects and small animals out of your yard. The third and final part of this nutrition regiment would be providing enough air, so that plants can breathe properly â€“ just make narrow holes by using the first stick you encounter, and it should do the trick. Before you can really enjoy your garden, it needs to have a few walkways that allow you to move around without getting dirty or disturbing the peace of your plants. Now, you need to determine whether you need to do the walkways all over or if they simply require some remodeling. In any case,  , and it wonâ€™t cost you a small fortune. After you decide on material, you should think about whether or not you can do this by yourself â€“ if you lack in these kinds of skills, maybe you should allow experienced people to do it for you this one time, so you can learn from them and so you donâ€™t mess things up. After youâ€™re done with these three steps, the only thing left is to enjoy your garden! Have a couple of friends, share a meal and have fun. Thereâ€™s nothing similar to that feeling of fulfillment while you enjoy the fruits of your own work, is there?",Ivan Dimitrijevic

As the Search Engine Optimization commonly referred to organic results; its gravity can be understood with the term â€œorganicâ€ù itself. To understand the importance of Search Engine Optimization, we should try to explore the digital marketing in more detail. Where, Digital Marketing tools consists of organic and inorganic methods, the organic plays the more vital and steady role where as the inorganic methods normally plays the role of a life support. Both has their own importance and can be preferred by the individual choices. But itâ€™s gets necessary along with the time to take a mandatory help of the organic method or Search Engine Optimization; when you are simply undertaking the inorganic methods. The simple reason behind it: Inorganic methods can bring the instant results, but they are like the gas in the carâ€™s fuel tank where the results simply stops coming when you run out of fuel. So like fuel, it costs to undertake the inorganic methods and thus it makes your business more lame and dependent upon it. Now, we need to understand here, that there are more than 65% searches on the search engine are still preferred from organic results rather than inorganic or sponsored results. The reason behind it is the trust, where an The cost of effectiveness is another important factor, which also leverage the importance to SEO, where the inorganic methods can generate the revenue for sure, but canâ€™t give you a regular presence on the web. Where the customers have turned really smart in this dynamic world, they tend to go for an online check for the review or draw a comparison of a product or other info regarding it before calling it a purchase. And it seems pretty obvious that the SEO job done on your website/page will help and enable the user/customer to locate you and your business on the internet and without the SEO, people will find it more difficult and annoying in giving you a search. Thus Search Engine Optimization will always stay bedrock here, not once but on multiple occasions. The simple reasons stated above donâ€™t inflict the idea of the inorganic results but rather depicts the true sense of Internet marketing. The idea is to understand that the Search Engine Optimization is a never-ending process, which can place you on the pole position without investing heavily and if not can generate the early revenues but a long-term establishment.

Thereâ€™s a way to bring everything with you, but you need to be highly organized â€“ the secret is in kits. If you start a couple of days before your trip, youâ€™ll be able to pack absolutely every item you consider important without having to deal with extra weight which will just slow you down. Check out the next five types of kits â€“ you might find quite useful! Instead of having several different pockets where youâ€™ll store your creams, makeup, shaving equipment or other personal items intended for hygiene, you should have only one. Carefully select a few items that you actually plan on using from each of these groups, and pack them into one toilet kit. In order to do this properly (so you donâ€™t find anything missing in the middle of your trip), you need to think about the number of days youâ€™ll be spending away and, accordingly, the amount of cosmetics youâ€™ll be needing. Itâ€™s a great idea not to bring shampoos, conditioners, soaps and baths if youâ€™re staying in a hotel, because the hotel management will most definitely provide you with those. The fact is, you canâ€™t go anywhere without your toys, right? And itâ€™s so simple to leave something out while youâ€™re packing, which is why you need to use your organization skills and place everything in one pocket â€“ a gadget kit!

I find it most practical to place those items in a small jar, so nothing gets misplaced or lost. One last piece of advice â€“ if you do end up with a lot of clothes (which may happen if youâ€™re going somewhere rainy or cold, because outfits you need are often massive), you should know that itâ€™s smarter to bring two smaller bags instead of a large one. This way, youâ€™ll find carrying your luggage easier, because youâ€™ll be able to distribute that weight better. Itâ€™s quite important to take your time for packing, even if itâ€™s just for a weekend. Take a couple of hours to think about everything youâ€™ll find necessary during your trip and pack all those items.

You should try going out more in the daytime, and approaching people in the park, at the supermarket or while waiting in line to get some coffee â€“ all it takes is a few interesting comments, a smile and plenty of courage. There are also plenty of  , and this may be the best strategy for a lot of us, as dating websites allow you to search for people with defined interests and personality types. This helps cut through the little formalities and white lies. Even if you have somewhat   you can find the right online platform. Â  Sometimes itâ€™s worth looking  . Itâ€™s called the proximity principle and it essentially comes down to people connecting much better with someone from the same background who moves in similar social circles. Social media or online dating website allow you to bypass the need for geographical proximity to an extent, but your friends can be much better at match-making than a piece of software. Whether youâ€™ve found out a few things about someone from friends, read their profile or heard it straight from the person in a face-to-face chat leading up to a date, itâ€™s not a good idea to put blind fate in a few bits of information. Make sure to approach the first date or first online conversation as if it were a screening process, a job interview if you will. It doesnâ€™t sound too romantic, but trust me, itâ€™s better to get some things out in the open right from the start. You donâ€™t have to have completely identical hobbies, tastes, aspirations and personalities, but you have to be able to see eye-to-eye on a few big issues â€“ e.g. moral values, sense of humor and major life goals. In the end itâ€™s worth noting that very few people are lucky enough to hit the jackpot on their first try. Even though someone may seem to fit your criteria, they can easily have several serious deal breakers hidden away from sight. Donâ€™t lose faith after a few mediocre experiences, and keep searching. It may seem like there is no other person in the world that can give us what we need at times, but remember that there are billions of people in the world, and that it is all just a numbers game. There is someone whoâ€™s just right for you out there, no matter what you are into and what kind of life you lead.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

However, thatâ€™s not the only thing you need to be worried about â€“ every ambitious business leader needs to put their best effort into providing maximal protection for their business and employees. You can never do enough, really â€“ the more successful you get, the more attention youâ€™ll attract, and people will want a taste of your success. Dealing with security breaches will only slow you down, which is why you need to take certain precautions. As your company grows, so will your office. There are many different reasons why you should start building your security system with live monitoring; first, you canâ€™t possibly be at several different places at the time, so you can never be 100% positive whatâ€™s going on around the office; second, you need to protect your office and your employees from any kind of security breaches; and finally, you need to protect your employees from each other. However, this doesnâ€™t mean you need to become paranoid and start sneaking up on people â€“ you just need to make sure everything is in proper order, and if a bad thing happens, you can always go through your recorder footage and find out the truth with no problems whatsoever. As we mentioned, things happen. Having recorded footage will be more than helpful, but in order to deal with a certain type of situations, youâ€™ll need live backup. Sure, you should always take the high road and hope it will never come to violence, but   when and if it comes to that. Naturally, your security system needs to be straightened with high quality locks. As we all know, keys tend to get lost without a single trace, and you shouldnâ€™t This is an absolute must. Of course, you should do everything in your power to prevent a fire hazard, for example, but if it comes to that, itâ€™s necessary to act quickly and make sure that every person in your office is saved from harm. Adult people are capable of taking care of themselves, but when an accident occurs, their mind is a bit hazed because of panic â€“ providing your employees with a simple evacuation plan in case of an emergency will guide them through the safety procedure and make them feel protected. Each piece of info your company records should never leave the office unless you allow it to. Keeping the actual files locked up is one thing, but keeping your online content in the circle of your employees may be a bit challenging, especially if you have through competition. Other than keeping your passwords private and insisting on protected communication among your employees, you should also pay attention to whom you grant access when it comes to info you find more than valuable. Also, make sure all pieces of software you use are licensed and properly updated, so that you have no problems with outdated technology or unauthorized access to your data. If you have no experience with this matter, Iâ€™d advise to hire an agency that does â€“ this way, you wonâ€™t be bothered with stuff that are out of your area of expertise, and you can sleep well knowing that your business secrets are kept safe. If you implement all my suggestions into the way you do business, Iâ€™m sure your employees will feel and be protected, and that all   â€“ inside your office. However, this is an area of technology that is developing quite quickly, so itâ€™s very important to keep yourself updated about the latest pieces of software which are being released.",Ivan Dimitrijevic
23/06/2015,http://comluv.com/throw-best-summer-party/,How to Throw the Best Summer Party - ComLuv,"Throwing a pool party is much harder than it seems. If something goes wrong, the consequences may be severe and thatâ€™s why this job must not be taken lightly because if youâ€™re responsible for the organization, youâ€™ll be the one to blame if anything bad happens with the party or to any of the guests. The fun part is easier if youâ€™re creative. The best parties are always themed ones, so youâ€™ll need a cartoon, book story a movie or an epoch for a start. Here are some ideas. While you picking out one of these great ideas, consider the costume. Not all costumes are easy to find as they are not easy to wear. You wouldnâ€™t want to wear some heavy, huge costume at a pool party â€“ imagine you get thrown into the water. It will be hard to get out and the costume is destined to be ruined. So, when you have finally chosen, you should get to the next step â€“ invitations. Now, you mustnâ€™t make the pool crowded because everybody will just be nervous all the time and they will be â€œliving in fearâ€ù of accidentally falling into the pool. But, if you invite just a couple of people, thereâ€™s not going to be a party â€“ just a few people who are dressed weird. The next step is decorating the exterior. Try to pay attention to the smallest details, so that the atmosphere would be almost tangible and real. For example, if you decide to throw a cocktail party, which is very simple for decorating, just place around something that resembles chair-sized martini-shaped glasses and put some glowing lights in (this will also solve the major part of lighting). Other than that, you can throw around some giant colorful paper umbrellas that you can make on your own, if your budget is limited. You are free to stop there if you lose your inspiration. If you have a garden you can focus on arranging it in an interesting way to boost the stylish look of your home even more. Balloons and invitations should be taken care of a couple of weeks before the party. If you order the invitations on time, they will arrive at the right moment for you to send them. Regarding the balloons,  , but before that, be sure that youâ€™ve got the dates right, so that you donâ€™t end up with a house full of balloons and nothing to do with them. The harder part is connected the pool itself. No one wants to be at the pool party where the pool is muddy and filled with plants and dirt that the wind brought. If the pool is dirty, your guests will undoubtedly question your personal hygiene, and therefore, the drinking glasses and plates. To avoid this kind of humiliation, be prepared and donâ€™t let First, make sure that your pump and filter are fully functional and that theyâ€™re doing the job well. The power of the pump must be proportional to the size of the pool. If the pump is too small, itâ€™ll take forever to clean it. Then, be sure to add a chemical that you use. If youâ€™ve not already decided what will be your cleaning medium, do not panic, itâ€™s never too late. Look for a: Use the manual to find out about the amounts you need. Do not go overboard because if you do, the chemicals may react with each other and create stains on the pool walls or, eventually, on your clothes. If you decided to throw a party in the early summer night, you might consider throwing in some heaters, just in case it gets windy. Look for: The choice in front of you is easy, if your budget is not limited. Gas Pool Heater are the fastest and the most efficient and youâ€™ll be swimming in the desirable water temperature in no time. If you decide to be an owner of a Gas Pool Heater, youâ€™ll be obligated to have a special gas line that will bring gas or propane to the heater. Electric pumps are longer-lasting than the gas ones, but they take longer to heat the whole pool. Also, they cost less to maintain than gas pumps, even though both of their purchasing prices move from one to a couple of thousand dollars. Youâ€™ll need to take care of your home after the party as well, so make sure you consider some . If you want your party to really be remembered, why not make a sensation? Pool lights are great idea for the exterior design, and an even better one for parties. You can go classical and put just clear lenses, but donâ€™t leave them just anywhere â€“ organize and imagine the final appearance before you place them. If youâ€™re into more â€œmodernâ€ù colors, you can use colored lenses and fit them with your existing exterior first and then to the theme of the party youâ€™ve already chosen. The lights will probably do more than just glow â€“ they will be one of the factors that will dictate the overall mood. Swimming goggles can also be one of the partyâ€™s props in the water, and out on the â€œdry landâ€ù â€“ playing with colors is always funny and crazy. All the hard work you are ready to invest will surely pay off, but a couple more tips wonâ€™t do any harm. Even if you want to throw a crazy party  . There is nothing wrong with wanting to preserve your budget! Do not go overboard with the decorations â€“ thereâ€™s a thin line between just enough and too much stuff â€“ where your pool will look like a storage facility (I am exaggerating). Also, be sure to dress tastefully. No one wants to see too much cleavage or a half of your behind that just happened to fall out. If you exaggerate with lights, youâ€™ll end up with a bunch of half-blind blinking people that are constantly bumping into each other. Hygiene is the one thing that you canâ€™t have enough of. Nothing is too clean and thereâ€™s always a place for some extra effort.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

I suppose it goes all the way back to our wild ancestors who had great respect for the big, fast and powerful beasts roaming the fields and letting out deep growling noises. In many ways, a good sports car is like a creature of the wild â€“ it looks dangerous, it roars, and only a worthy individual can tame its massive power. Itâ€™s a little bit sad that not everyone gets to experience the great thrill of zooming past clunky and sluggish sedans on the highway, due the higher price associated with top grade sports cars, but there are some cost-effective options for the car enthusiast on a budget. You just need to know what to look for when weighing your options. Here are a few basic things that make the difference between a well-priced car with good performance, and a cheap mediocre ride. There are different types of sports cars available, and we can generally divide them into these basic informal categories: Each of these has a unique set of pros and cons, a distinct style, and a price range you need to carefully consider based on your preferences. Itâ€™s kind of difficult to think about selling our sports car several years down the road when we havenâ€™t even bought it yet, but itâ€™s important to think ahead  . Certain colors, engines and models are far popular than others, and will maintain a good part of their initial value even after a few years, if you take good care of it. More popular models will also have plenty of options and accessories to choose from, including a wide range of aftermarket parts. Since youâ€™re likely going to be doing most of your driving around town, you want something that can go through tough corners, as well as develop a decent amount of speed. An option that a lot of people go for is to invest in a good stock car, and then put in a full professional suspension kit later on. So, you can invest in version of the car with all the sporty bells and whistles, or you can make do with cheaper versions, and   to upgrade to high-end sports performance when you have the extra money. Thereâ€™s a simple reason why most great sports cars   â€“ it allows for excellent weight distribution, high traction, and lets you to drift through corners effectively. It can take some experience to learn to power-steer and keep the tail end on point when going through corners at speed, but it is an acquired skill. A big engine with tons of horsepower and promises of an impressive top speed doesnâ€™t actually guarantee a great level of agility and maneuverability. When driving in urban environments you want to be able to overtake other cars and go from a full stop to impressive speeds in as little time as possible. The final choice will depend on your style, finances and needs, but if you want a good mid-range sports car, whether youâ€™re buying new or used, make sure that youâ€™ve got all these points covered first and work from there.",Ivan Dimitrijevic
18/06/2015,http://comluv.com/4-reasons-logo-important-business/,4 Reasons Why a Logo Is Important for Business - ComLuv,"One of the ways to tell the community that you intend to become a world famous brand is to add a logo to your company. This may prove to be more challenging than you initially anticipated, and it is definitely not something that should be done hastily. One day, your logo may influence your business in a good way, provided that you indeed have a good service when it comes to your line of work. In case you are planning on creating your logo, here are a couple of tips about logos and the messages they should convey. It is a well-known fact that not only business companies, but also almost any existing institution has its own logo. The reason for that is quite simple, it is much easier to establish your own identity as a company if you have a logo to back you up. In fact, we must all agree that   which is unique than to remember a unique name. Just think about all the logos in your head and think about why you ended up remembering them. There is no doubt about the conclusion, which you are going to reach â€“ because they were incorporated in good marketing, and conveyed a powerful message. This does not mean that you should put your product as a logo, it means that your logo should be an idea that you promote. Allow me to elaborate â€“ if you are a company that produces cell-phones, your logo should be a picture which shows connection between people, like Nokia for example. So, if you are in the line of work that produces fast food, you will try to promote happiness, if you manufacture padlocks, then you will promote safety, etc. Take a moment to consider what would be the best symbol for the idea you are selling, so you can make that symbol your logo. Do not forget to be cautious, for sometimes, symbol may be ambiguous and therefore, it may confuse the intended audience. The way you use your logo should also reflect your companyâ€™s philosophy. For example,  ,Â donâ€™t print out thousands This is not as easy as it sounds, mainly because a logo should promote your idea, be more or less simple, in order to be easily remembered, and be unique at the same time. It is for this reason that you should not form your logo all by yourself, unless you are acquainted with the art of graphic design. It would look really unprofessional if you start changing the appearance of your logo for the worse but if you do a good job with logo design, it will certainly help your business to some degree. Perhaps the best thing to do is to make a survey, which consists of various ideas for your logo, and see which logo picture was the most memorable one for the viewers, or which one they liked the most. Once the survey is finished, you will have a basic idea of how to create your logo. Sometimes, it is impossible for your logo to clearly represent the intended idea (usually in cases when your logo is just a single letter, like McDonalds and Facebook for example), then you need to add a slogan to it in order to boost its representative potential. Slogans should be a short message, which also promotes the idea behind your product. Think ofÂ a creative slogan that can do that for you and but donâ€™t take it lightly, it may seem simple  . Also, with a good slogan, you have a high possibility to go viral on the internet, meaning only one thing â€“ people will start advertising you on their own. To sum up, a logo is quite essential for success, despite the fact that it is just a picture, because it is a tool for your products to be recognized in the eyes of the consumers. Once you manage to satisfy the needs of your customers, your logo is associated with quality service and in the digital age it is immensely important to retain a consistent visual presence. Just make sure that your logo is designed properly and propped with a good slogan. Once all of these conditions are met, just sit back and watch how your brand name spreads across the globe.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

However, we all have our limits, we reach a point when we are simply not focused or interested in completing our tasks. Nothing bad happens if we take a day, or a week off, but slacking off on a daily basis is truly toxic. Instead of pushing ourselves to reach new heights, we are more focused on finding excuses, which only leads to self-disappointment. We also tell ourselves how we would be way more productive if we were doing what we loved, rather than what we have to. The truth is, even doing what we like will eventually become repetitive, and end up boring us. If you truly want to be productive and responsible then try some of the following tips. We usually unwind by watching TV or playing video games at night. This, however, interferes with our normal sleep cycle. If we are to be productive, we need to be fully rested for the next day, and standing in front of a lit screen does not help your eyes at all. The brain is stimulated for the entire time and thus, it takes time before it can assume the desired sleepy state. It is worth mentioning that if you canâ€™t fall asleep, TV is also a bad idea, since most of the shows late at night are mind numbing. Use the time more productively. Everyone is asleep, there are no social distractions, and youâ€™d be amazed just how prolific you can be in the middle of the night, plus that way, you make up for working less at work.

The higher the degree theyâ€™ve accomplished in schools and universities, the more respected they are in the eyes of recruiters and employers. As a result, they are granted more career opportunities compared to non-graduating professionals. However, what if the professionals granted the most opportunities coasted through their education with the help of  ? Does it invalidate their achievement or is it just a matter of finding a way to success in school? This is the moral problemÂ that people argue about whenÂ the topic of students hiring third-party services to write their reports, essays, and final papers for schools comes up. In fact, this practice isnâ€™t limited to high school students and undergraduates â€“ hiring essay writing services have been done by students in the higher education. There are lots of essay writing services that students can reach out to get their papers done. A quick look at this   reveals the best ones you can find online in terms of quality, price, and customer service.Â The services are organized as each provides you different types of papers to order, depending on your need, and how fast you want to receive them. , the real problem presented by these services is the devaluation of writing as an academic practice. Because services like these has made it possible students to coast through their education without writing a single sentence in the papers they submit without getting caught, they donâ€™t get to develop theÂ valuable skillÂ of communicating their ideas and thoughts through words in the long run. Having said that, should you avoid essay writing services like a plague? Letâ€™s say youâ€™re a student who has been writing essays for your class all this As the semester draws near and youâ€™re about to draft your final paper due days from now, tragedy strikes. Something happened to your loved one and he or she needs youÂ by their side more than ever. Doing this will rob you time of finishing your paper in time. Despite pleas to make the deadline just this once for your sake,Â your professor does not budge because it will be unfair to other students who will be submitting on time. Not submitting a paper would mean not being part of the honor roll that will look goodÂ in your transcript, or worse, you wonâ€™t graduate at all. Try as you might to whip up something before the deadline, youâ€™re pretty sure that you wonâ€™t be able to submit something of substance in time. With your backs against the wall, hiring essay writing services for this specific paper doesnâ€™t seem like a terrible idea. Yes, itâ€™s out of character for you to just hire someone who will write for you when youâ€™ve been writing for yourself all this time.Â But as far as youâ€™re concerned, itâ€™s the   idea. Putting things into perspective, taking up essay writing services only becomes a terrible thing when you use it for all your written works for school. You will surely never develop your writing skills this way. In your case, you are only using an essay writing service this way to get through a difficult situation youâ€™re in. Itâ€™s not like you donâ€™t want to learn and develop you writing skills, but because of the situation youâ€™re going through, you have to improvise. While this rationalization wonâ€™t fly with other people, it only proves how complicated the subject of using essay writing services is. Not to defend these types of services, but their sheer availability and existence is not necessarily a cause for trouble. Again, it is up to students on how they intend to use an essay writing service to help them with their studies. That said, it will depend on how you as a student manage the choices you make. If you can live a life of using anÂ essay writer and other services to help you coast through life, then more power to you. If your conscious cannotÂ bear the burden of using these services to write your reports or papers even if thereâ€™s a good reason for you to proceed with this, then great.",Christopher Jan Benitez

03/04/2015,http://comluv.com/hyperpigmentation-african-american-skin/,Hyperpigmentation in African American Skin - ComLuv,"Many people with dark skin suffer from hyperpigmentation. It is a common challenge and something that we just learn to live with. Alongside learning to live with hyperpigmentation, we also try as many remedies as possible to make our skin appear clearer and more even, and combat the visible signs of hyperpigmentation. For those of you who are always attempting to combat the effects of hyperpigmentation, you look at it as the enemy. And like any enemy, you work very hard to fight it. But youâ€™ve got to know exactly what youâ€™re up against. Hyperpigmentation is the darkening of an area of skin or nails caused by increased melanin. Hyperpigmentation can be caused by sun damage, inflammation, or other skin injuries, including those related to medications or acne vulgaris. People with darker skin tones, African Americans, Africans, Asian or Mediterranean, are more prone to hyperpigmentation, especially if they have excess sun exposure. Many forms of hyperpigmentation are caused by an excess production of melanin. Hyperpigmentation can be diffuse or focal, affecting such areas as your face and the back of your hands. Melanin is produced by melanocytes at the lower layer of the epidermis. Melanin is pigment that is responsible for producing color in the body in places such as your eyes, skin, and hair. As your body matures (ages), melanocyte distribution becomes less diffuse and its regulation less controlled by your body. UV light stimulates melanocyte activity, and where concentrations of the cells are more dense than surrounding areas, hyperpigmentation is affected. African American skin is more prone to hyperpigmentation than any other skin type. So, itâ€™s safe to say that hyperpigmentation will be a problem for us more so than any other ethnicity. Since this is a common problem, itâ€™s best to understand where it comes from and exactly how to attack it head on. There are two very common skin conditions that cause hyperpigmentation, or discoloration in skin. These two conditions are: Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation and Melasma.  causesÂ  darkened skin and discoloration that shows up as dark spots, or as large patches on a personâ€™s body. This is because cells that normally produce brown pigment evenly across your skin go into overdrive and produce too much melanin. This happens because of an inflammatory reaction in, or to an injury to, your skin. Dermatologist will tell you, â€œIf the excess melanin is produced in the upper layer of skin (epidermis), the pigmentation color is a darker shade of brown. If the excess melanin is produced in the lower layer of skin (the dermis), a gray or blue discoloration becomes visible.â€ù Although PIH can occur in all skin types, it is more common in people of African, Asian, Latin, and indigenous Indian backgrounds, and can affect men and women equally. Areas of the skin affected by PIH correspond with areas of previous inflammation or injury. When your skinâ€™s color remains dark after the underlying problem has gone away, you have PIH. The most common causes are injuries such as scratches, burns, cuts, or bruises. Eczema, psoriasis and fungal infections can cause PIH. Ordinary conditions such as acne or pimples are a very common cause of PIH in individuals with darker skin.  is another skin pigmentation disorder that can cause distress for people of color. Like post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), melasma results from functional problems with cells that produce and contain the melanin pigment. This In melasma, the dark spots and patches usually affect the nose, cheeks, forehead, upper lip and chin in three different patterns. Melasma can occur in all skin types and in people of all racial and ethnic groups, however it is most common in women with darker complexions who are between the ages of 21 and 40. It is sometimes referred to as the â€œmask of pregnancyâ€ù because it occurs commonly during pregnancy and in women who take oral contraceptive pills. Furthermore, people living in areas of intense and prolonged sunlight (Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean) are more susceptible to developing melasma. Although the exact causes of melasma remain unknown, common factors linked to the disorder include pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives (BCPs), hormone replacement treatments (estrogens), hormonal abnormalities, as well as a family history of melasma. So the first is caused by an inflammation and the latter is mostly hormonal. There are a few treatments for hyperpigmentation in African American skin. Before considering any type of treatment for your hyperpigmentation, you should always consult a dermatologist or esthetician to find out what treatment would work best for you. This is especially true if your hyperpigmentation is a severe case. Some of these treatments involve the use of products that are heavy with chemicals and there are others treatments for hyperpigmentation that involve the use of natural products and remedies to treat it. Here are some of the treatments for hyperpigmentation in African American Skin: While these are not all of the ways you can treat and care for hyperpigmentation, dark spots and skin discoloration, they are often suggested as options.

The first thing you need to understand is that an event like this takes a lot of time and devotion, so you donâ€™t miss anything out. There are so many things to consider because of the amount of people which will be part of your event â€“ participants and visitors. But, before you even get to think about people, there are important choices you need to make. Letâ€™s begin! This isnâ€™t just about picking out a random date of the year. First, you should make sure that big event will be occurring during a weekend, when most people are responsibility-free, so that they can actually show up. The second factor is coordination with other sporting events â€“ you canâ€™t expect your event to be successful if itâ€™s occurring the same day when another well-visited sporting event is happening. This can be difficult, but at least try not to have your sporting event when thereâ€™s something big happening in the world of that particular sport. In the end, check whether your most important guest are available, so that youâ€™re positive they will be attending. The second decision is   during your event. If you want it to be family friendly, I suggest you make the whole thing friendly and tension-free. This usually implies organizing a children league, so that all parents and family friends can have an opportunity to support their kidâ€™s team. On the other hand, if youâ€™re up for something more exciting, you should organize a league for local amateur teams, which can be really entertaining because thereâ€™s always an amount of friendly competition between them. This one is strictly related to the sport youâ€™re into and, well, the weather. Include both factors while making your decision so that everyone can feel pleasant during your event. However, if you are dealing with something neutral, like soccer for example, just check the local weather forecast and make sure itâ€™ll be sunny! Or, maybe you should coordinate your event according to the quality of sporting If you want people to attend to your event, you need to make sure that they are well-informed about it. Probably   is by using social platforms â€“ everyone is using them and the word will spread really fast. Consider investing in Facebook ads, perhaps, and follow that through with some advertising material on a local basis, like a few good posters and flyers containing all the necessary information, of course. There are also a few important legal matters you need to pay attention to. In order for the whole event to be properly organized and on time, you need to have a very neat list of all teams and every single participant, so that there are no any misunderstandings. When it comes to funding, I suggest you equip yourself with funding items, like   on them. By doing that, youâ€™ll be working on your fan base and raising money for your expenses at the same time. You canâ€™t do everything by yourself. The best way to get a couple of extra hands is to work with volunteers â€“ most of them already have at least some experience with organizing big events, so youâ€™ll have someone to give you a piece of advice and direct visitors and participants at the same time. Besides, they are trained to be friendly, so theyâ€™ll definitely have a positive effect on the overall atmosphere. And of course â€“ you need to come up with an awarding system. If you decided to organize a childrenâ€™s event, you should know that most such organizers decide to award everyone with an equal prize, so there is no pressure on the kids. You can  . On the other hand, working with an older audience will require from you to provide them with a certain type of motivation, so thereâ€™s that competitive spirit we mentioned earlier. I hope your event turns out to be successful, and Iâ€™d really like you to let me know how it goes if you decide to listen to my suggestions. Good luck!",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Of course, it is not only your teaching method that has an impact on your lesson, it also depends on your attitude, your students and the nature of the lesson. Even after years of practice, you are still bound to alter your approach, to keep up with generations and their interests, in order for the transfer of knowledge to be successful. Here are a few tips on how to be good at what you are doing. These can come in handy if you are still new at this teaching profession, trying to figure out what to do. The first thing you need to do is to assess the nature of your students. Of course, every child is different, but if the majority of the class consists of trouble makers and attention seekers, there is not much room for you to be easy going. You are not required to be strict immediately, since children are prone to change if they recognize you as an authority, but if they are generally uninterested in your subject, chances are they wonâ€™t listen. Meaning that if  , you are more likely to draw attention to yourself and keep children focused. However, sometimes even this might not work. As mentioned, some children respond differently to a certain approach. This means you are the one who will have to adapt, in terms of attitude and teaching methods. As a last resort, you can simply lay down the rules, and punish anyone who does not adhere to them. The downside to all of this is that you will be perceived as a grumpy teacher, and you wonâ€™t form a bond with your students. This is rarely the case but sometimes, it is unavoidable.  by good grades, or frightened by bad ones. This makes it hard for you to motivate them, they simply see your subject as irrelevant. You need to be creative, come up with a good motivational speech to incite their desire for learning. If that doesnâ€™t work, try telling them a few good jokes â€“ you can always read them online â€“ and promise them some more after the lesson is over. You can also give them assignments to write down an essay about themselves, since this way, you can know them better and perhaps find out what motivates them. Once you have some sort of insight, you will know what kind of approach you should take, what kind of examples you should provide when you explain something. If you manage to make them understand the topic, they are very likely to follow and show interest. The problem is that this can be very hard if your class has more than twenty students, which is why the teaching process is more efficient in smaller groups. This can be extremely helpful, since children are allured to technology and gadgets. Using projectors and computers during your lecture will definitely make the whole lesson more interesting. The   that you can use to help you during your lectures. You can use these tools as a teacher to assess some of their skills, to help them learn and to keep track of their progress. After all, learning occurs more frequently when it is governed by unconscious processes, and this is why people are struggling to create good learning games. If the whole process is fun,  . Think about it, when you are reading the book and when you are conscious that you are reading, then you are not actually reading. You are focused on what you are doing not on what the author is saying. Just imagine if all of the books your students need to read are available in the form of a video game, then they would definitely know what happens in each book. Teaching tools are the next best thing, since students are focused on exploring the program and the input occurs naturally.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Their motivation and work ethics might be on point, although most people have a problem with these aspects as well, but they simply donâ€™t know what it takes to make good progress. What usually ends up happening is that they do some online research and either go for a routine geared for more advanced lifters or they find interesting exercises and try to come up with their own routine. Some even just improvise workouts on the spot, which means they take their sweet time, do a bunch of random stuff and have no plan when it comes to progression.Â For a beginner, the focus should be placed on quickly packing on size and gaining a good strength base, and to do this, there are several things you need to consider when it comes to choosing the right program and making the necessary lifestyle changes. There are a bunch of good beginner programs out there,   and   to name a few, and they all have a few things in common: Full body training or simple splits work best for beginners, as they cover all the muscle groups, and allow you to hit all the muscles 2-3 times a week, which is important for optimal growth. When youâ€™re on a good program, there is no wasting time pondering which exercise to do next or what weight to try â€“ you know exactly what you will be doing, and you can attack the weights with full intensity without overthinking it. This is the most important part â€“ leave the damn phone in the locker or in the car, avoid too much chit-chat, and be 100% focused on what you are doing. While you can lose quite a few pounds even if you donâ€™t have the cleanest diet in the world as long as you keep your calories low enough, getting stronger requires a healthy body working at optimal levels. For this, you need proper nutrition, not just your 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight and a slight calorie surplus. We need the right nutrients to recover quickly form a workout, and there are some   as well. Some people have problems eating more food, or less food depending on the case, and supplements can be a good way to give the body what it needs quickly, but you should make sure that you are eating right first and foremost. This is something a lot of new lifters mess up. Itâ€™s pointless to look for magic ingredients or   to improve performance and size if you are missing out on the anabolic properties of 8-9 hours of sleep. Thatâ€™s per night, every night. Thatâ€™s why good programs have you training 3-4 times a week â€“ you need all the rest you can get after a good workout. Our bodies can get water from food, especially fruit, but itâ€™s important to keep it well hydrated by drinking plenty of water during the day. You should always have a small bottle near you so you can take a sip when you start feeling thirsty. Of course, make sure your body has enough electrolytes, which you can   including milk, peanuts, almonds, tomatoes, oranges and anything you sprinkle a pinch of salt on. So itâ€™s important to have small regular snacks throughout the day while drinking your water in between big meals. The simplest and most important rule to follow is to view your training as an obligation. It may be fun, but it should be an obligation, and you can schedule around it. You will have busy days when you can only run in and do 4-5 big exercises before you rush out the door, you can switch to 3 sets of 10 to cut the workout down to 35-40 minutes, or you can move it one day, but just make sure you train several times a week, every single week. There you have it folks, the   in order to create a good strength training program that will get them impressive results within the next year or two. Stick with a basic program until youâ€™ve made all the progress you can make out of it and start stalling for several weeks, and remember all the points mentioned above.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Initially, it was believed that this security bug was only a threat to Mac computers and mobile devices, but that doesnâ€™t seem to be the case now if the companyâ€™s announcement is to be believed. It was on Tuesday that the first news about the vulnerability came to light when nine security experts made a disclosure of ubiquitous internet encryption technology that would render devices running on the Android browser of Google Inc. and the iOS and Mac operating system of Apple Inc. vulnerable to cyberattacks. On Thursday, the software giant decided to release a security advisory in order to give a warning to customers that their PCs were also vulnerable to the security bug called Freak. PCs that regularly connect with those webservers that have been configured on the basis of encryption technology are open to this vulnerability so they could become the target of attacks. The technology was weakened intentionally in order to comply with the regulations of the US government that ban the export of strong encryption. If the hacking attempts They asserted that hours of computer time would be needed by the hackers in order to crack the encryption, which would be essential for launching the attack. According to people part of the security industry, this isnâ€™t a very big issue because several ducks in a row would needed for accomplishing it. The hackers would first need to locate a web server that was vulnerable, then they would have to break the key, find a vulnerable mobile device or PC and then gain access to it for the attack to be successful. System administrators were advised by Microsoft to implement a workaround that would disable settings on those servers that make use of weak encryption. The software giant said that there was an ongoing investigation into the flaw, but hadnâ€™t yet come up with a security update that would provide Windows PC users protection from it. Apple, on the other hand, did make the announcement that it had developed a security update for this problem and would be rolled out to all iOS and Mac users in the next week so they could be secure.

Being a true professional isnâ€™t something that just comes with some habits you adopt, but it also arrives with the way you reflect those habits on the way you look. Letâ€™s see which essentials should be in your closet in order to get this right. Why should you satisfy your needs with classical plane old belt  ? Sure, this type of belt is an absolute must have when it comes to suiting-up, but when you donâ€™t have to look like a million bucks, you can allow yourself to be playful, right? Plaited belts are the right way to go â€“ they carry a certain attitude, but they still allow you to look professional. This is one type of denim pants which will never go out of style. Yes, we had our fun with skinny jeans, but enough is enough.   says about your style more than you think â€“ it says youâ€™re done experimenting, and that you donâ€™t have to attract attention wearing something tight and uncomfortable because your strong personality will achieve that for you! Similar to plaited belts, this is a fun item which  . Itâ€™s not necessary to go with something orange or green if that doesnâ€™t make you feel comfortable.

A classical white button-down shirt should be the crown jewel of your closet. Â  Bags for men arenâ€™t a taboo any more, but most of you still decide not to wear them. This happens because you havenâ€™t  , which is why I decided to select this item as one of the essentials. Thereâ€™s nothing girly about it, it comes in bold colors and it will fit every single thing you need during the day.

With these items in your closet, which are all so simple to combine with practically anything, youâ€™ll be able to save a lot more time which youâ€™d normally spend on dressing up.

13/03/2015,http://comluv.com/start-plan-company/,Start up Plan for Your Company,"You are young, ambitious, energetic and highly motivated. You have a good business idea and you desire to be your own boss. Or you have had rich experience of working for somebody else and now you have decided it is time to stand on your own. You are willing to take the risk and try something new. What is the best way to start your own company? Who will your employees be? How to get through to the clients? How to make a good business plan? How to find investors? How to make it all work?Â When embarking on this journey you need to be very smart and thoroughly plan every step of the way. The most important thing in the very beginning is  , or how good the service you will provide is. Start with what you know-think about what you would like to have on the market, but it has to something innovative and fresh, something that nobody hasnâ€™t thought of yet. If you decide to deal with something that many companies already deal with you have to think of a new approach, and incorporate something more appealing to the potential customers. Donâ€™t be unrealistic though-it is crucial that you stand firmly on the ground and think clearly and practically. It is good to be imaginative and creative; however, it would be a huge mistake to live in the imagination and not pay attention to the basics-meaning your clientsâ€™ needs. The clients should always come first. You have to adjust to what they want and be very perceptive of their needs. No matter how good you believe your product is if nobody else wants to buy it, you are finished.  and extremely detailed as it is the document that contains all the vital information about your companyâ€™s further development. This obviously includes finances and your plans for the future. Â Also, think carefully about your marketing options. You need to find a way to approach your potential clients directly and friendly. Online email marketing is very popular today and some of the best email marketing solutions of modern business practice include permission based email marketing. It works rather simple-you do not send spam email to a large number of email addresses but instead you send emails containing marketing material, like brochures, leaflets and special offers only to persons who have previously given their permission. This form of marketing is highly effective as you donâ€™t have the risk of annoying random people and creating a negative reputation for your brand. Instead, you only form a connection with the persons who are truly interested in your promotional material and who are really your potential clients. These days companies use various types of software for the   or performance. There are software that can help you with project management, client management, sales management, billing and invoicing etc. With appropriate software or applications at your disposal you can out perform your rivals who are in the same line of work. The main reason why this is important is because you are in a start up phase therefore people do not know who you are, thus they lack trust in your service, which is why it is crucial that the service you offer is of higher quality than your competition. This opens up a lot of possibilities. For starters you have an opportunity to share the content from your website on other websites, which is a part of inbound marketing. However, your blog content is to be considered a viable linking material, you need to write useful information. In other words you are not creating a blog, just for the sake of having a blog.  , how your services truly benefit the users, if Â you simply use it to spam your brand name in each article, then you are making your blog into an obvious marketing tool, which will only backfire. Your niche is determined by your line of work and your sincere advice needs to come from your expertise in that field. Once your blog is filled with quality content you will have a great deal of sharable material, for either linking, or creating social media buzz. In the end, if you have definitely decided to start your own business you need to realize that achieving financial or any other independence is never easy-you will have to think everything through, plan everything, decide on what to do with your idea, consider who your clients are and what is it that they expect from you. Â Find the coworkers you can rely on and who share your ideals, respect work ethics and are dedicated, but always think twice, even when it comes to details.

10/02/2015,http://comluv.com/good-reasons-one-become-teacher/,Good Reasons Why One Should Become a Teacher,"Teaching is not a vocation for everybody. One must have a certain spark in order to become an educator. However, this line of work carries some amazing awards, as long as one is capable of appreciating them. Those who are truly fond of their profession are not motivated primarily by a financial gain, they are in it for various different reasons. If you want to find out why people opt for becoming a teacher, here are a couple of good reasons. The most prominent aspect regarding the job of an educator is seeing your understudies succeed. They come into your classroom with diverse qualities, shortcomings, foundations, and various convictions about themselves. Always bear in mind that there is no student that is â€œun-teachableâ€ù- basically, there are only those who havenâ€™t met the right instructor to help them realize their true potentials. What truly makes all the diligent work justified, despite all the trouble, is the moment when you manage to change certain students perspective form â€œI canâ€™t do itâ€ù to â€œI can do this!â€ù. It is because of these moments that you can truly be proud of yourself, and you will see what an exceptional ego-booster this job may turn out to be, as long as you manage to reach your students. For individuals who are exhausted by occupations and who have repetitive obligations, constantly doing the same thing while their brains go numb,   and every new generation that you have to teach is a challenge. Each kid is distinctive and adapts in diverse ways. Each class has a certain element that must be both monitored and nurtured with regards to the classroom environment and control. You may instruct the same subject more than once, however, it will never be the same twice! You hone your teaching skills in order to find an optimal approach on how to efficiently teach and keep your students interested Â  As it was already mentioned, you are honing your teaching skills, as well as your database, not only with the information connected to your line of work, but also by learning from the students. And do not forget field trips, as a teacher ,you will have the opportunity to travel and increase your cultural knowledge along with your students. Of course, there are  , since you are required to take up an immense responsibility which tends to be stressful, especially if you do not know how children will behave in certain environments. All things considered, you are bound to find an efficient routine sooner or later and enjoy your stay. Practice makes perfect â€“ nobody knows that better than the teachers. Educating is  . Future specialists, attorneys, construction workers, managers, hairdressers, and whether you like it or not, burger flippers will pass through your classroom. As a teacher, you will see that children more often than their parents or guardians will. You will have a golden opportunity and the ability to convert them into attentive, kind, and innovative individuals and citizens. Fundamentally, educating is touching youthful lives and improving them, which you must admit is an extraordinary profession if you are good at it. As long as you end up with good results, no one can tell you how to do your job. If your students do not complain about your methods and have good grades, you have nothing to worry about, you have found an efficient way to transfer knowledge. This is one of the best professions you can ask for if you want to have a good insight in how to raise kids. You will  , be able to put yourself in other parentâ€™s shoes etc. Additionally, you can always enjoy summer vacations with your family, considering that both you and your children will be on a vacation during the same time.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

And youâ€™ll needÂ to invest in the necessary equipment in order to get these breathtaking wildlife imagesÂ . However,Â it is steal in my opinion this one thing you dont want to miss at least for time time in your life No where else worldwide there is such a massive activity of animals as quick as well as outstanding as the wildebeest movement where millions of animals migrate from south Tanzania to the greener meadows in  . the movement has to cross the Mara stream where the huge crocodiles are waiting for the least possibility of a dish. This phenomenon is among 7 worldâ€™s wonders. Wildebeest arrive at the Mara River in their tens of thousands, and gather waiting to cross. For days their numbers can be building up and anticipation grows but many times, for no apparent reason, they turn and wander away from the waterâ€™s edge. Eventually the wildebeest will choose a crossing point, something that can vary from year to year and cannot be predicted with any accuracy. Usually the chosen point will be a fairly placid stretch of water without too much predator-concealing vegetation in the far side, although occasionally they will choose seemingly suicidal places and drown in their hundreds. Perhaps, once again, this is because crossing places are genetically imprinted in the minds of the animals. Some fords do attract larger numbers of animals than others though, probably because theyâ€™re visible from a greater distance and the arriving herds are able to see others of their kind either in the process of crossing the river or grazing on the lush grass on the far side. If you are into predetors and want to get the ultimate experience of watching them from very close, Tanzania is where you want to be, and if you want me to be more specific,the south, the Ruaha national reserve.Â It is a wildlife photographerâ€™s dream location. Ruaha is a â€œ  park located in the southern part of Tanzania and is usually accessed by bush flight from Dar es Salaam. Unlike the more famous Serengeti National Park,  allows open safari vehicles and off-road game driving.Â  This means that if game is spotted away from a road, we are allowed to leave the road to gain prime access for taking photographs. In addition to an abundance of wildlife of all kinds, Ruaha is known for its massive herds of Cape Buffalo which large   regularly hunt.Â  It also has rare species like African Wild Dogs, sable antelope, and 530 recorded bird species.

But these donâ€™t make video conferencing faultless. In fact, there are also disadvantages in conducting online meetings. Case in point:   that shows how normal video conferences work. Faulty internet connections, voices overlapping, and dogs barking (or another transient noise in the background) are just some of the pains that attendees have to deal with during an online meeting. But the biggest culprit of online meetings is the ability to multitask. During a face-to-face meeting, you cannot do anything else other than listen to the people in the room even if youâ€™re bored out of your wits. During an online meeting, on the other hand, you can play solitaire or surf the internet while the meeting is going on and get away with it. Thereâ€™s a chance that you might have missed out on key points during the meetings while engrossed with viewing cat videos on Youtube. Even then, you can repeat the entire online meeting as recorded using   or other premium tools. The solution to this problem is simple, really: make your online meetings much more interesting. If you are the one holding the online meeting, it is your responsibility to keep attendees on their toes all the time. You must find a way to get their undivided attention so they donâ€™t multitask on their computers during the meeting. Below are a couple of suggestions to keep attendees of your online meeting attentive at all times. Or at least donâ€™t give attendees access to the recorded meeting. This will encourage This can be done in random during the meeting or just before wrapping up the meeting. For instance, ask an attendee from the IT department about what was discussed when talking to the sales rep also present in the meeting. While both departments have little to do with each other, being able to answer the question shows that the person has been intently listening to the meeting. Make sure to keep things light when asking questions. Attendees might find it hard-pressed to answer questions that donâ€™t understand because it is beyond their expertise. In this case, give incentives to people who can get your questions right. For example, ask a couple of attendees to   in the best way possible. The winner will get a gift coupon from you. The other attendees can vote for the participant with the best summary to help determine the winner. To get more people to stay attentive during the meeting, assign a person who will   before the meeting starts. Choosing that person must be done at random to avoid second guessing. This is a great way to teach and train attendees to become more detail-oriented. Get attendees to come up with a question regarding the meeting. It can be about the presentation or a topic that was discussed. Do not include clarifications as an acceptable question. Those who are unable to come up with a question should be penalized for the next meeting. For example, you can ask offenders to do some random but fun stuff for the group before the start of next meeting. You can ask them to review a film that just came out from the cinema along with proof that they actually saw the film.",Christopher Jan Benitez

Texting is a form of communication, and as you probably know women love a man who knows how to communicate with them. Letâ€™s take a look at threeÂ hugeÂ mistakes that you can make while texting a woman you are interested in. The following three mistakes made during a text can send the wrong message to woman or reduce her interest in you. Either way, itâ€™s not good! Sending shortÂ text messages to your friends is okay, but if you want to engage a woman and gain her interest, it is not enough. You cannot simply answer with a â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜noâ€™ when talking to a woman or she will think that you are not interested in her. This doesnâ€™t mean that you have to write paragraph after paragraph through your text messages, but it does mean you have to be clear on what you are saying. For example, if a woman asks you if you want to get together, you could say â€˜Yesâ€™,   you could say â€˜That sounds good to me. Looking forward to it.â€™ One sounds like you could really care less, and one sounds like you care a lot. SendingÂ the longer textÂ will make her feel good and excited to see you. Always make sure that your text messages are clear. If you think that there could be any confusion inside of the text, changeÂ it so that she understands exactly what you are trying to say. For example, if she asks you to call her later, and you think you are going to be busy, you could say, â€œI suppose I could do thatâ€ù. That messageÂ tells her you are not sure if you are really interested in calling her later. But, if you were to say something like â€œI would like to call you. I have to see how much extra time I have though,â€ù Â you are making it clearer that you want to call but may not have time. Always make sure that she canâ€™t read something negative or untrue into the text before sending it. This will save you a lot of heartache and explaining in the future! There is something that I call the  . It is where you text her a message that doesnâ€™t really require a response. And, if it does, the response can only be given with one or two words. For example, â€œIt is nice outside today!â€ù is a dead-end text. She can only say â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜noâ€™ in response, and it doesnâ€™t really lead to a conversation. On the other hand, â€œAre you enjoying the weather today?â€ù is an open-ended text. It gives her the chance to tell you about her day and can start up a pretty decent conversation. If you are not hearing back from women through your text messages, then there is aÂ good chance you are making one of the above 3 mistakes. If you want to improve your textÂ game with women, always make sure to send detailed, clear, and engaging texts. You will notice a difference instantly.",Bellaisa

With so many things to keep track of, it is undeniable that parenthood is an arduous assignment, and it is never over. When your child is on the level of a toddler, he or she is now trying to figure out how the world functions, and with such high degree of curiosity, there are many dangers lying ahead. For toddlers, a world is like a big puzzle, and they want to see how pieces fit in together or whether the pieces can fit in together. It sounds like a wonderful ambition but it is quite dangerous, since they have no idea how electricity can be dangerous, how they shouldnâ€™t mess around wall sockets, or play around hot stove etc. Here are some tips on how to control the out-of â€“control toddlers. As it was already mentioned,   and will not take your word for it when you explicitly say that something is dangerous. Additionally, toddlers can be quite cunning, once they set their mind on something, they are more than willing to follow that plan through. They will wait for a window of opportunity, and start messing with the things they are not supposed to be messing with just to feed their curiosity. It may look cute and funny at first, but this kind of a behaviour will drain you mentally, thus you should always find someone to switch with you, either a nanny or a grandparent, someone who wants to supervise children when you reach your limit. Additionally, you can perhaps demonstrate the dangers of heat or electricity in their weaker form, it would be like a vaccine. It may sound silly but it will not hurt your child, plus it will be able to witness how unpleasant it can be when one is burnt or electrified, only on super miniature scale. If they The best way to find some peace is to keep the kids occupied and interested. You can either come up with an alluring game that you can all play, which will hopefully exhaust them so that you can sleep, or you can do something to educate them a bit. You can read a book to them while they are watching closely, and hopefully they will pick up some tricks on how to read. If a book doesnâ€™t grab their attention, you should try with a good cartoon that you can watch together. Select a good and beautiful cartoon, which is in a way a cautionary tale they can relate to.

Children cannot possibly comprehend just how sugar, or anything taken in a great amount for that matter, can have a negative impact on their metabolism. All they hear is: â€œYou cannot experience the good side of lifeâ€ù, this is why it is so hard reasoning with them. It is your job to protect them first and then to be a parent that they adore, thus being strict, and grounding them from time to time is not a bad thing, it is for their own good.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

It is true that making a breakthrough as a musician can be hard, but it is not impossible. The reason why there is such a big problem with this is the fact that big publishing companies push their artists to the top by having immense marketing budgets. An independent artist canâ€™t really compete with that directly. Still, there are things that you can do to  , but it will take quite a bit more time and work to get it done.

09/12/2014,http://comluv.com/newbies-checklist-starting-blog/,Newbieâ€™s Checklist for Starting a Blog - ComLuv,"â€“ So youâ€™ve finally made the decision to start your own blog, congratulations. So where do you start youâ€™re probably wondering? Starting a blog for the first time is an exciting venture, but with the excitement also comes frustration, especially if you donâ€™t know where to start or have very little knowledge about blogging itself. Fear not, for this post will try and provide you with a checklist of some of the things you need to do to get your first blog off to a cracking start. The first step of starting a blog is finding a niche for your blog; a niche is an idea, subject or topic in which you will primarily discuss on your blog. This could be anything you want it to be, to help you find the perfect and perhaps the most profitable niche for your blog. Once youâ€™ve settled on the niche for your blog, the second step of starting a blog is to find a reliable web host. If youâ€™re planning to use a free blogging platform provided from the likes of BlogSpot or WordPress.com then you can skip this process, however if youâ€™re serious about blogging, I would strongly recommend that you consider self-hosting. OK, Hooray, youâ€™ve launched your first blog, congratulations. Now to start writing your first blog post, but before you do, here are some tips and heads up on writing the best launch post possible. One of the most common reasons why new bloggers run out of steam in the first month of blogging is because they run out of ideas to write about, amongst other reasons. Getting post ideas can be challenging not just when youâ€™re starting out, but continuously throughout your blogging career. So now youâ€™re well on your way to building a great blog. But it doesnâ€™t stop here. Another common reason why new bloggers lose interest in blogging fast is because they see very little results for all their effort, i.e. traffic, comments etc. Blog promotion is as important as creating quality content regularly. I hope this checklist for starting a blog has been somewhat useful. Of course the journey doesnâ€™t stop here either, starting a blog is just the beginning and needless to say that blogging is a lifetime commitment, it takes time to develop and success will come if you persevere, the very best of luck on your quest for blogging success.",Ovais Mirza
06/12/2014,http://comluv.com/6-things-keep-mind-launching-weight-loss-blog/,6 Things to Keep in Mind When Launching a Weight Loss Blog,"At first, building a weight loss blog doesnâ€™t seem like a particularly different task than building any other type of a blog website. So, let me be the one who breaks this to you â€_  . Okay, the technical part remains the same. Thatâ€™s mainly because WordPress is perfectly capable of running any kind of blog (actually, any kind of website), and weight loss is not a challenge at all. So when it comes to getting a domain, a web host, installing WordPress, handling the initial settings, and so on. Itâ€™s all the same story. However, the part thatâ€™s very different is the approach youâ€™re going to take with the niche, the type of content youâ€™re going to publish, and the type of relationship youâ€™re going to build with your audience. The weight loss niche is a difficult one due to one main downside. People   and weight loss  . And itâ€™s quite understandable, actually. Letâ€™s take a look at a completely different industry to explain this. If youâ€™re in the space of â€œblogging about bloggingâ€ù then credibility is not that important. I mean, it will surely help you attract more visitors, but when itâ€™s all said and done, if you can craft good enough advice and share it with people, they will pay attention. In weight loss, things are a lot more difficult. Weight loss advice usually involves doing something specific to our bodies, which is very personal. The best way to gain credibility is to get featured (via a guest post, for example) on some semi-popular or popular blogs and then list them in a custom â€œas seen onâ€ù block. That way, anyone visiting your new weight loss blog will immediately notice that other sites in the niche are already paying attention to you. Affiliate marketing is one of the top methods for bloggers to make money. Even though Iâ€™m not here to undermine the power of the practice itself, I do advise you to take it easy in your beginning months of weight loss blogging. Thereâ€™s a ton of affiliate programs in the weight loss niche, but thereâ€™s also a ton of scams. This poses two dangers: Affiliate products work great in many niches, but in weight loss, itâ€™s best if you build a relationship with your audience first, and only then start to mention some promotions here and there. If youâ€™re going to be the main writer of the blog, you need to make things personal and not hide behind any nickname or the overused plural form â€œwe.â€ù First of all, use â€œIâ€ù a lot. Secondly, share your own story related to weight loss. If you donâ€™t have any, get in touch with someone willing to provide articles for you and get personal articles from them. Weight loss is a very personal niche by default. Essentially, no one cares about some brand talking about   or  . What matters are people and their own methods/tricks/approaches at successful weight loss. Email marketing is often treated as the holy grail of building a website-based business. In theory, all you need in order to succeed is a website with some   coming in, and leading to a landing page where you convince the visitors to sign up to your email list. And then you have a never-ending possibility to constantly nag them through email. Itâ€™s actually quite scary how many marketers still attempt to monetize their sites this way. Anyway, thereâ€™s a much better method, and itâ€™s called  . Hereâ€™s how itâ€™s done. First, divide your newsletter messagesÂ approach into four types: Then, create your  . Hereâ€™s how I like to align it myself, but feel free to makeÂ your adjustments: The next step is to create all those (c) and (d) messages and put them through an autoresponder sequence â€“ a mechanism that will send out those messages automatically at set intervals. The technical side of things is really simple so you donâ€™t have to be a webÂ expert to make it happen. Luckily, there are many tools available that you can take advantage of here. If youâ€™re on a tight budget, check out  , which is the only major email newsletter service offering autoresponders as part of their free plan. As far as I can see, everywhere else (MailChimp, AWeber, GetResponse) you have to pay to getÂ the feature. This sounds a bit vague, so let me elaborate. What I mean by multiple paths is multiple angles at weight loss. For instance, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re doing a lot of keyword research if youâ€™re in a big niche like weight loss. In such a case, you might end up with a range of keywords like ( ): The worst thing you can do is create individual posts for each keyword, butÂ provide the exact same information in all of them. For example, itâ€™s really difficult to make a post titled â€œWeight Loss Adviceâ€ù significantly different from one titled â€œWeight Loss Tips.â€ù A lot better approach is to tackle this from multiple angles, focusing on different aspects of weight loss, such as: All of the above are your different   to take. Weight loss is such a big area that you can easily incorporate different types of content into your offerings. Here are some possibilities and remember to  : Iâ€™m positive that there are much more possibilities waiting for you out there than what Iâ€™ve mentioned here (in terms of content types), but this list should be more than enough to get you going. This actually concludes what I have to say, so now I encourage you to take the floor.",Karol K

Making your body look great for the summer may take some time and effort, so the perfect time to start doing something is right now! Follow these simple tips, and by summer time, you can have a perfect beach body that everyone wants. There is nothing worse than seeing that orange-peel-like skin on your thighs and belly â€“ it just makes you not want to wear a swimsuit ever again. If you are one of many women with this problem, you probably donâ€™t feel comfortable wearing bikinis, or even shorts. Cellulite is essentially fat stored under your skin which then develops small dimples in certain areas. There is no magical solution to this problem â€“ if you want to be cellulite free, youâ€™ll have to work for it. The best way for   is combining these three things â€“ exercise, diet and a massage using anti-cellulite oil. Itâ€™s more than enough to have a 30 minute workout a day (10-15 min. of cardio and the rest focusing on the problematic area). For food intake, make sure to avoid processed foods like breads and pastas, eat a lot of vegetables, and, of course, donâ€™t forget to stay hydrated. On top of that, you can go to the store and get some olive or seaweed oil and massage the problematic area yourself. You will see a positive change in no time. If you want to get in shape for the summer, the best (and only) way is simple â€“ regular exercise. Combine cardio with strength workouts, and youâ€™ll get a sexy body quickly enough. There are many different workout programs, but not all of them will give you the desired results. Make sure you pay more attention to your thighs, glutes and stomach. There is nothing more attractive than a flat belly and round booty in a bikini. You can try the â€œbikini body workoutâ€ù, recommended by fitness expert  . Even if you donâ€™t have time for regular workouts, you can use the next few tricks that will help you get in shape. You can take the stairs (forget the elevator), park a few blocks away from the store and walk to work, or even better, forget your car and ride a bike to work. We all know that in order to lose those extra pounds, exercise is important, but it is just not enough. The second most important thing you must pay attention to when trying to get that bikini body is your diet. Like exercise programs, there are also so many kinds of diets, and you just donâ€™t know which one to go with. The truth is, you donâ€™t need some special diet program in order to lose weight or reduce cellulite â€“ you just need to take care of your food and drink intake. First off, drink a lot of water.  . Avoid sodas completely, or at least switch to a diet version, and reduce alcohol, since they have a lot of sugar and can cause dehydration. Focus on upping your protein and micronutrient intake by eating fresh fruits, vegetables and non-processed food. Foods high in protein and fiber are especially effective in reducing body fat because they require more energy to digest and utilize. High-quality food high in protein and fiber is the way to go. Now that your body is ready for the beach, you want to make sure that your skin is also ready for bikini and summer clothes. Heat causes sweating, which can increase allergies and cause acne to develop on your skin. Donâ€™t worry, this can be easily stopped by using few skin cleaning products, face masks and peeling. You want your skin toned and firm, especially during the summer. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is dry brushing â€“ not only will it remove dead skin and help showcase your natural skin color, but this can also be very helpful with reducing cellulite. And the most important piece of advice â€“ never forget to use sunscreen! Sun rays are very harmful â€“ they will make your skin age faster and, of course, they can cause serious illnesses. Everyone looks better with tanned skin, but health is more important, so always use some   during the summer months. Â  Itâ€™s still winter time, which means that there is plenty of time to get ready for swimsuit season, but for the best results, start now!

But remember, fashion is a delicate thing, and you can easily buy some items that will ruin your style, and this is particularly important when you yourself are not sure what you want to wear, what will look good on your, and what is currently in style. There are some fashion no-noes which you must avoid if you truly want to be a man of the 21st century. Letâ€™s be realistic, fashion is not just for girls anymore, and men have not only the right, but an obligation to look the best they can, both in a professional environment and in an everyday setting when hanging out with friends, shopping or simply enjoying a nice day outside. The winter is just around the corner, and now is the right time for some shopping, so we have made a list of things that you need to have in mind so that you can avoid them like the plague and never, ever do them.  â€“ Even if you are a regular gym goer, the chances are that tight fitted clothes do not fit you, simply because they are not practical and they limit your movement â€“ but despite this, many men around the world think that this looks nice. An honest thought: if you really have a nice body, tight fitted clothes will make it visible, but you can achieve the same results with clothes which size is suitable for your body frame. Even when you buy a simple shirt, you should be careful that it is fitted around the torso, and the sleeves should be an inch past your wrist bone.

If you buy a clothing item, a shirt that is too tight or a scarf that is extremely popular yet it makes you itch â€“ this is going to show. Everything, from the simplest t-shirt to the most formal suit should be comfortable for you to spend hours in, and if it is not, your body language is going to show that you are not having a good time.  â€“ Long gone are those days when only women could wear bags and men could only use briefcases. Not only are briefcases not comfortable to constantly hold in your hands, but they are also not flexible enough, and not many things can be put in there, but nowadays,  .

What is more important, not only can men bags be a fashionable statement, but they are extremely practical.   â€“ Fashion changes, and what was unimaginable yesterday is extremely good-looking by todayâ€™s standards. This can bring you a sign of relief, as you do not have to feel guilty for not wearing all the things that you have in your closet.   over time, so it is natural to buy things that you want right now, and next year, maybe youâ€™ll like something else, and youâ€™ll buy it. If you force yourself to wear your old clothes which you donâ€™t like anymore, despite them being in perfect condition, will only make you feel uncomfortable, and fashion should be fun â€“ above everything else.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

However, none beats updating your blog dailyâ€_ it is one of the most silly â€“ and wrong advice youâ€™ll ever receive. Ever. If you are a newbie and are considering  , you must stop, immediately! If you are a Problogger or have been blogging for any reasonable amount of time and believe blogging daily is the key to success, I have a shocker for you: IT ISNâ€™T. So, for both the newbie and professional alike, why is the daily routine such a bad fix? There are many reasons blogging daily doesnâ€™t produce great results. Letâ€™s look at them one by one: Whosoever said writing (great) blog posts was easy was certainly being very economical with the truth or was outrightly lying. Brainstorming, drafting, crafting, editing and possibly rewriting (and then editing again) is one of the biggest time sapping ventures around. There are some epic blog posts that may take 15 or more (tedious) hours to craft â€“ and publish. This may mean almost 95% of your waking hours! Now, if you really want to awe your audience (like all serious bloggers should), how exactly can you publish such epic content, share on social media, get it across to your social networks and possibly boost it on via commenting? That would be close to accomplishing the impossible! Ideas are funny things â€“ very funny. There will always be days when youâ€™ll have an abundance of ideas and youâ€™ll be wondering what to do with them. Personally, some good days come along and on such days, immediately I wake up, I get an idea for a great blog post. And, as my wife and I settle down to breakfast, I get yet another idea and before the day is half spent, yet another idea strikesâ€_can you imagine? Yet, there has been days when it is almost next to impossible to even develop those excellent ideas into blog posts (even though the ideas may have been carefully outlined. And, before you imagine that this is my problem, it isnâ€™t. Infact, all writers and real bloggers face itâ€_itâ€™s called  So, if youâ€™re the â€˜update-the-blog-dailyâ€™ kind of guy, how exactly do you propose to go about it? Manufacture â€˜excellentâ€™ excuses? A blog, though kept in reverse â€“ chronological order, is still a blog and that means you do not write it for yourselfâ€_ it is written for an audience. Sadly, the audience that it is written for is a super busy one with more than enough distractionsâ€_ Or, do you imagine that your readers read every entry you put up? Few do. So, as you rush to update daily, it would be apt to remember that your audience also has many other things that are begging for accomplishment in their lives. Great chances are that most of your readers may in themselves have blogs and would also need time to craft compelling content for them. Also factor in the reality that your readers need time enough to be allowed to visit other sites tooâ€_ (something that they must do). Or, does it pay to talk to an empty room without an audience? There has been many a point you landed on a blog you knew too well and the content you saw confused you. What exactly was the blogger thinking? You imagineâ€_the post is completely off niche! Sadly, this When such happens, an unsubscribe is close by. Often too, such a visitor may not bother to come back to such a blogâ€_Can you imagine an opportunity thrown away? Such a reader would have converted brilliantly â€“ if given the opportunity. Itâ€™s not usually a great idea driving away readers and prospective clients. Donâ€™t you think so? Content gets stale â€“ and once in a while, links get broken. Usually, this impairs user experience and severely hurts search engine rankings. When such happens, youâ€™ll most likely imagine that you were hit by something greater than Panda and Penguin combinedâ€_ And youâ€™ll be correct. You would be hit by your own decisions and their effects! On the other hand, if you take things gentle, update at   and keep an eye on older articles, youâ€™ll certainly be running a blog that would overall, be more productive, alive, relevant and user friendly â€“ without any stale content. Can you give up the above for the temporary pleasures of updating daily? The last â€˜sinâ€™ (but obviously the most important) is that updating daily makes a blogger or information marketer assume that he/she is making money that way. Or would. Nothing is further from the truth! While updating daily may work for newspapers and newsmagazines (sometimes multiples times a day â€“ because of their niche), great chances are that if you are not in the news niche, the opposite may even be the case â€“ especially if you use PPC programs like Adsense. In the blogosphere, bloggers and other webmasters recognize an ad when they see one. Now, if such a ad does not really capture their attention, the possibility of clicking on it is really slim. So, how exactly will more content (especially one produced daily) help you out? It would be right to ask me at this juncture what exactly you should do â€“ afterall, I just condemned all that you may have believed in arguing that   is an unpardonable mistake. So, whatâ€™s the ideal posting frequency? Once in two days? Three days? Once a week? Twice a week? Once a month? NO! The ideal posting frequency is one that allows you enough room so that you can carry out all the money making activities (successfully) that a daily posting schedule may prevent you fromâ€_the very activities listed here. The twist to this post is that if you can blog daily and not fall into the pitfalls enumerated here, congrats! Youâ€™re a genius â€“ and super blogger. It is however doubted though â€“ especially if youâ€™re doing things solo! I did not always hate updating daily and wasnâ€™t so vocal against it. As a matter of fact, I (like many other bloggers and webmasters), was a strong advocate of hitting the publish button daily. However, I grew older in the business of blogging and learnt some secrets many do not know even exist. Fortunately, I now make more money as a result of failing to publish daily via such ventures like the Amazon Kindle Platform and other numerous online efforts. I thus (in advance), understand completely with my professional friends who will unfailingly disagree with me. This is certainly a million dollar question: so, whatâ€™s the answer? Use it more productively to make more money. For me, this involves bettering user experience,   and writing best selling eBooks and guilds to be sold on my site. Be creative â€“ and have a great day in the process!",Akaahan Terungwa
26/11/2014,http://comluv.com/manage-professional-facebook-account/,How to Manage a Professional Facebook Account - ComLuv,"Running a professional Facebook account is much different than using your personal one. There are many things that you must look after and take care of before going public in this way. If you want to have a positive PR, it is very important to know what you will be posting, how you will manage people on Facebook and how your profile will look. If you want to recommend yourself to future employers or customers, you need to know how to build your presence on social networks in a way so that people will think of you as a professional, a serious worker, no matter what line of work you are in. If someone sees your post or your involvement in someoneâ€™s post, he might decide to visit your profile. When someone who is not your friend visits your profile, he can only see the public information section. This is why it is very important that this section says the right and important things.   may be the turning point to someone deciding to follow your profile or to send you a friend request. Write an appealing column that simply explains who you are, what you do and what your skills are. You can even write about your biggest achievements and about the things that you are proud of the most in your carrier so far. The first thing that you need to do is to upload some decent and sharp looking profile pictures. This may sound easy, but just as much, it is very important. Choose a picture in which you look fresh, happy and serious. Do not make a mistake of putting a picture from a party, or when you got drunk, etc. Having a profile picture with colleagues can be a good choice, but try not to use the picture in which you are not clearly visible. Basically, try to avoid anything that may represent you as unreliable and unprofessional â€“ a photo with your family can also be a good choice (in case you have a family). A good choice for a cover photo can be one that can tell about your passion for the business that you are in, or a banner of your company. Putting a cover photo of you at When you are online, make sure that people see that, turn your chat option â€œonâ€ù, let people know that they can contact you freely. If someone asks you something on a post or a picture, try to always answer, and do this as professionally as you can, avoid using this profile for fun and joking around â€“ you have your personal profile for that. This is one of the reasons why you should avoid adding your friends on this profile because, in some situations, they can unintentionally cause you bad PR. Post photos with you and your colleagues from work. Share achievements about your work on your wall and keep people informed about what you are doing. Avoid talking about personal stuff; this can be hard because there is a thin line between professional and personal.   and colleagues in every picture that you are in. By doing this, more people will see these pictures in their news feed, and by that, more information about you and your work will spread around. Social networks can be very useful for marketing. Many people take social networks very seriously, no matter if they are your future employees or customers. If you want to be considered a professional you need to use your social network to boost your credentials with some content from time to time. Doing an essay or a research paper from time to time is a good way to do this. Still there are a lot of   so be careful not to turn an opportunity to get good publicity into a charade. Â If you are not proficient Â So, try to honor these instructions, it is not too much work, and it doesnâ€™t take much of your time, but it can be really useful for your carrier or your business. Although Facebook and other social networks can be useful, the bottom line is not too get too involved in it, but try to keep increasing your work skills.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Normally, you would look for available domains under the .com extension since this is the most common and identifiable among all extensions. However, if your brand name has been taken for .com, look into other alternatives (net, .org, .biz, etc.) and find which one is the most convenient for you.

Many people are already looking forward to next year, making plans and postulations. Here in the web design world, ComLuv.com spoke with   from   about three future evolutional trends. Letâ€™s take a look at some web design trends that have come to the fore this year and some that are expected to be even more popular in 2015 and beyond. These trends became very popular this year because they have added positively to the user experience by taking into consideration the meteoric rise of mobile device usage, reduction of search time and the new â€œminimalistâ€ù appreciative nature of web users. Flat design isnâ€™t exactly new, but the flat design of logos, banners etc. is a new trend growing in popularity by the day. It is basically a web design style that has thrown off all the shadows, gradients and 3D elements we were used to in the past, with designers sticking to the basics.   a great deal for the end-users, making it easy for web visitors to navigate a page irrespective of the browser or the power of their device. Flat design websites also offer faster load times due to their lightweight nature. This trend is here to stay and we will see more This simply means designing websites so that the pages automatically align with the screen and the resolution size of the userâ€™s device. Again, it is the increase in use of mobiles that has led to the soaring popularity of this design trend. With the prediction that numbers of  , it is not rocket-science to predict that a huge number of websites will take the leap to responsive design. It is quite likely that you are reading this from a smartphone or your tablet. If the page isnâ€™t rendered properly on your device would you continue straining your eyes or neck to read, or go elsewhere? Nine out of 10 users will go elsewhere! Website users of today have an increased ability to search and scan through a website once they land on it. This has a lot to do with the increased use of mobile phones, as almost everyone intuitively scrolls through a page while on their smartphone in a bid to find what they are looking for. Web designers have noticed this trend shift and are now making more scrolling websites than ever. A scrolling website allows the web user to see everything about the page by just scrolling down instead of having to open new links or new tabs to find something on the website. This has not been accepted unanimously by everyone though, as having multiple pages does a lot for SEO, but with the increase in traffic from mobile phones and tablets it is expected that many websites will embrace this in 2015 or risk losing out on traffic from this demographic. These three trends are some of the things you should expect to see more of in 2015 as web design keeps pace with our ever changing demands.",Ovais Mirza

16/11/2014,http://comluv.com/google-glass-apps-development-profit-loss/,Google Glass Apps Development: Profit or Loss?,"All Honestly, Google glass is still a mystery. Yes there is a lot on the internet that you can read about but what it really feels like and what all it can do is still quite the subject for debate. For some people, it seems to be the answer of all technological problems and for others it seems like a premature baby that still needs incubation. Regardless of what people think about it, there is barely any doubt about the fact that a wearable computer has many uses across various industries. This is probably why most of the multinational fortune 500 companies have already started undertaking Google glass app development. The glass is essentially a modern take on a secretary or a personal assistant. It can click pictures, record videos, and aid in video conferencing, live uploads and downloads; it can record minutes of meeting better than anything else and so on and so forth. Many industries see a very practical use in developing and industry specific app for the same. Then only possible drawback that one sees at this stage is the high price tag that would prevent many people from buying and its lack of availability even after over a year of its announcement. However, technology in the past has taught us that things that mature slowly are eventually the ones rated as the best. The biggest dilemma that technological enthusiasts face as of today is to categorize the glass with respect to its current position in the market. With so much ambiguity surrounding the product apart from the gaping hole of the fact that it is still not available for the general masses makes it very difficult to fully appreciate the preference that the audience will have towards it. However many online reviews and other surveys indicate that people are in fact In the end it all boils down to the ability of people to customize the functionality of the glass into something that is extremely personal to a particular industry and thereby make the most out of it. We have seen surgeons finding it very useful in order to telecast or showcase live surgeries to other doctors miles away. Similarly people in the fire fighting department are also developing custom apps that help in finding people trapped in fire and identifying the shortest and safest route to get them out. Another very significant field of Google Glass app development is the insurance industry. Some new Google glass application development companies have come up with a great insurance app that aids and facilitates the entire process of claims settlement. If there were a clear answer to this question Iâ€™d have given it to you at the beginning of the article. However, things such as ideas and concepts can barely ever be classified as profitable or one that can get you into losses. Google Glass apps development is a very subjective domain. The only way to ensure its success is to conduct thorough market research in your own specific industry trying to understand the market you have and the threats and opportunities offered. For instance, for insurance, the Google glass app is a sure winner, but the same canâ€™t be said about some grocery shop developing his own glass app. It is of utmost importance to study your competitors and to understand the general behavior of your niche audience. Once you do that there is no way you can go wrong. Also, it is a good idea to get in touch with an IT company or a specifically Google Glass oriented company. They can give you a much customized idea of what kinds of apps will work for you and what will not. Just remember, creativity and usability both go hand in hand. Separate one from another and you have a perfect disaster awaiting you. Be confident and careful and no one can stop you from being successful!",JillElliott

Unfortunately when we buy a house we end up compromising when it comes to size because of limited funds. With the value of homes in Australia at an all time high, especially in Sydney where median value of houses is  , many first time home buyers find it difficult to   of their dreams and instead settle for what they can afford. Small homes with small bedrooms usually mean inadequate storage space and cramped living/sleeping space that makes you feel claustrophobic. There is no reason to agonize about the size of your bedrooms. There are many ways to arrange and decorate a small bedroom to make it more spacious than it really is, with adequate storage spaces, without making the room look more crowded. Check out these decorating strategies. Ordinarily, small beds are used for small bedrooms, but do you know that small furniture like a bed can make a small bedroom room appear much smaller? A bed with a high frame and tall headboard can make a small narrow room with high ceilingÂ  look more spacious, especially if the bed has a canopy to draw attention to the high ceiling. You can also position the bed backed or centered to a window to make the window as the focus of attention rather than pushing it awkwardly on one side. A lovely   that gives the guise of a canopy will do the trick. For a small room with a low ceiling, a floor bed or pallet bed with side tables scaled to match the bed is a great idea since it wonâ€™t block the sunlight coming from Another alternative for a small room is a loft bed where the space beneath the bed can be used for other purposes such as a storage room, a study or work area or even a place to entertain. Do you know that a dark wall gives a room an  ?Â  When it is paired with walls painted in white, a small room can look bigger. Cheerful colors for a small bedroom are also a great idea and so are vertical stripes meant to draw the eyes upward towards the ceiling. This is a well-established ploy to make a room look much bigger. Of course painting the walls white and having white linens can make a small bedroom look airier and larger. Painting the room in one tone or color â€“ walls, cabinets, molding and even carpeting â€“ will give the room a unifying color that will smoothen out the lines and make the different flat surfaces blend together. Imagination is the key to creating storage spaces for a small bedroom. A headboard can be used as a display cabinet or storage space, so is the space beneath the bed. A boxy shelf positioned against the wall that serves as a headboard can serve as display cabinet for books and other knick-knacks.Â  On the other hand, baskets or boxes with rollers full of clothes, shoes or linens can be slipped under the bed to take advantage of that space. Overhead cabinets and drawers also called wall cupboards extending to the ceiling are also storage ideas that are great space savers. You can keep all your things and clutter in these wall cupboards hidden to make the place look neat. A neat room looks more spacious.",joelmayer

Over my 38 years on living on this rock of ours, I have learnt a lot of things. One of the things I have learnt is to take time out and enjoy yourself and also to cherish family and friends. Take my friend, client and fellow blogger   for instance, He is living his dreams and travelling the world and he is paying for this by doing something he enjoys which is blogging and writing and promoting his eBooks. Hey he must be good if he has guys like Chris Brogan tweet endorsing him. When you enjoy your work then it is not work. Over a decade ago I took the decision to quit my job and stop making other people rich by giving up my   for money. Believe me giving up your job to work for your-self is a courageous thing to do and I can imagine that a lot of people bottle out of this thinking itâ€™s too hard. Having the courage is not going to be without fear, Courage happens when you go and do it despite having the fear of doing it! Now I am not saying that you should give up your job first far from it, all I am saying is to build up a career that you enjoy first and then have the courage to quit the job you detest. We all have responsibilities so please donâ€™t neglect them. Now to the main story of this post pilgrim. I want to tell you a story! One that has been repeated many times over the years on this thing they call the World Wide Web where a lot of us now work and make a living out of! It is a story about a conversation between a young professional with a wife and kids who gives up time working for some fat cat in exchange for money so that he can provide for his family and another fellow in the later years of his life and for the past twenty years has lived a life that is happy and fulfilling! We shall call the young professional Alexander and the elder gentleman Harold. So there I was with my morning paper and a big steaming mug of my favourite coffee sat in my back garden enjoying the great weather and my favourite radio station on. What happened next was one of those moments in life that you just have to sit up and take notice of. As I turned my radio on I could hear a conversation between our two heroes. I turned the volume up to hear Alexander talking about his lot in life with Harold. This was getting interesting so I moved closer to the radio to listen to Harold who in my opinion used to work as a radio presenter or an announcer, you know the type the type who speaks very clear Queens English with plenty of Gravitas. Harold then went on to continue his story and his theory on how to make the most of our livesâ€_. It really makes you think does it not? Here I am sat hear aged nearly thirty nine which means I have just under one thousand nine hundred Saturdays left should I reach the age of seventy five. Really puts things into perspective. Anyway on to the rest of the story. Harold then went onto to explain to our young family man Alexander what it felt like watching his marbles diminish (please excuse the pun. none was intended. Saying that it is quite funny even for a small minded blogger like me.) What do you think of that pilgrim? It is a head trip of a story donâ€™t you think? After coming across this story a few years ago it got me to thinking and I made a decision not to goto work that day and take my partner out for a meal. And maybe pay a visit to a toy store on the way! How can this help my blogging business succeed, I hear you cry? Well for me this story has streamlined my days and I now have all the time in the world to do the important things in my life as well as the things that I enjoy doing like building websites and writing blog posts like this one my dear pilgrim. Building websites and blogging for me is a hobby and not a JOB at all but my Hobby is what keeps me going and pays the bills. If you can do something that you consider a hobby and it earns you a happy and fullfilling lifestyle then you have not got a  . With your hobby you can organize your days the way you like and work on your hobby as well as do the things that are important like spending time with your family and friends. There is something else you can take away from this pilgrim especially if you are in a   or what I call  ust  ver  roke. You see if you have a   you are working for someone else and making them rich. In a way you are a slave to them as you need that   to make ends meet. If you hate your   then I am afraid to say that you are a slave to the system and remember at the beginning of this post I was discussing Courage. My friend I feel for you if you are in this position you may be thinking about what you enjoy doing or if your hobby can become your business. DO IT, Have the courage and DO IT my friend. I love what I do and yes there are times I get stressed when I donâ€™t have cold hard cash coming in but believe me dear reader working for yourself doing what you enjoy doing is the greatest feeling on earth and I now think that every day of my life is a Saturday as I had the courage to stop working for the man and life a lifestyle that I want to live by helping others and giving freely. What are your thought on this? Do you agree or disagree! Do you want to make that change and stop doing what you are doing? Have you got the Courage or will you succumb to fear? Have an amazing day.

04/11/2014,http://comluv.com/smart-art-free-space-grace/,Smart Art and Free-Space Grace - ComLuv,"In order to make your home comfortable, you might have to come up with some clever ideas. Itâ€™s not easy to decorate your home and save space at the same time. On the other hand, keeping your home clean at all times is only possible if you keep all your stuff in a regular and patterned way i.e. in an order easy to clean. You also want your home to be a cozy place to be at. After all, you do spend a great deal of time in it. A new home is a blank canvas which gives you an endless number of possibilities. Itâ€™s a fun and overwhelming business, but you donâ€™t want to go over the top. Sometimes too much decoration can make your home look cluttered, which, besides being a major problem of many modern age families, makes your home look inconvenient. Going through these simple ideas you might find some that are just your cup of tea, and furthermore they might inspire you to give your own personal touches in the end. For starters, it would be a good idea not to think of looking after your home as a strenuous task. Think of the conveniences you will have after you have made you house a nice and pleasant place to be at. Before even thinking about decorating, you have to make space for it. This, however, is the trickiest part. Where will  all the old things you canâ€™t imagine yourself living without go? In the cellar or in the room which once was a fine little family library? But the cellar is full of bottles of vines and the home library became a storage room where thereâ€™s just no more room for you to walk into. Transporting all of them to another room just makes matters worse. Have you recently spent some time  ? I donâ€™t mean watering the plants of mowing the lawn. I mean transforming your garden into an equally pleasant place to be at, just as your own house. Not many people think of the possibilities a garden shed has right after they move in, but now might be the right time for it. After all, the purpose of a garden shed is for it to become a storage place. This way, you can remove all the stuff which has been narrowing down your free space at home and step 1 is complete. Now might be a good time to train your thoroughness and organization. You donâ€™t want to transport things in a disorganized way because this will only lead to a lot of mess. Itâ€™s a good idea to pack your things into boxes and separate them in logical ways. Labeling them is a sort of a necessity. It will make it much easier for you to get around afterwards and find the things you need in no time. Now comes the good part â€“ decorating! The best decoration tools take the least space, believe it or not. When your room is still blank canvas, you want to start from the walls. Painting them in colors you are fond of is one option, but After you have finished dealing with all the unnecessary clutter and after you have equipped your household with some refreshing high-quality tiles, you can go crazy and install all other decorations as you like it. Try out new   or redecorate the old one (paint the kitchen cupboards or your living room cabinets). Hang some artwork. You can even try out some catchy frames which will add up to the picture. Add shelves, but floating shelves. They donâ€™t take up the space and they look amazing on walls when filled up with books or some small ornaments. Play with lighting. Sew some interesting cloth designs which you can put over your lamps and create an extraordinary atmosphere in your living room. Â Try out some new curtains. They also take up no space at all but are much more effective than dozens of vases, statues and other ornaments people tend to fill their home up with. Windows are a great investment as well and most people donâ€™t understand that  as a decorative move but as general home investment as well. All these decorative tools will have an effect on your home, like an amazing spice has in a tasty dish. Feel free to experiment. All in all, lack of space at home seems to be a common problem. Getting rid of things doesnâ€™t have to be the only solution. Good organization, smart planning ahead and acquiring only practical things is the only way to go. The sooner you start clearing useless clutter from your home, the more space you will have for yourself, your family and friends to invite over. Â Enjoy!",Ivan Dimitrijevic
02/11/2014,http://comluv.com/android-l-vs-android-5-0-lollipop-changed/,Android L vs Android 5.0 Lollipop: What has Changed ?,"Finally, the most anticipatedÂ  Â is now out of Bag ! A few days ago Google has officially released their latest   along with the Nexus 6 and 9. It has been a few months we are using the beta version of Lollipop as Android L and so we already have an idea how the final build wouldÂ be.Â Being the Android L a beta release of Â Android 5.0, ObviouslyÂ weâ€™ve to expect some changes, bug fixes and additional functionality in the Final release. Recently the   is releasedÂ and now we have an idea about what all changes are made in the final release of the OS. Android L was an early release and that too a developer friendly version. It have missed a lot of stuffs even from the KitKat version. HoweverÂ Google has addressed all those drawbacks and bugs in the Android L and released the Final build with an entirely cool looking interface. Also the major thing that we should consider is the revamped material design UI. It now looks clearer and more professional. Now, we can have a look on changes made in theÂ Android 5.0 Lollipop. In the newest recent screen the Google search has fixed at the top of the screen and the headers of each applications are mode colorful. But the feature will be app dependent. The dialer provided in the Android L preview wasÂ on one of the nice features but Google has changed its cyan color to a light blue color. The yellow highlighter in the Tabs sectioned When you open a contact from the dialer, it directly opens in the People App. The new People app also shows recent conversation from Hangout along with some basic details. In the Android 5.0 Lollipop, the icons in the status bar has changed to flat design and the navigation bar icons appears smaller. However the smaller icons in the navigation bar may be due to a higher resolution of Nexus 6. The Priority Ringing Rules in the Lollipop has evolved from the older Â Do Not Disturb feature in the Android L. Some slight changes are made in the UI to make it more awesome. Here is what GoogleÂ has to say about the new feature: The above mentioned 4 changesÂ are spotted by us. It is sure that there will be a lot more changes and we will be writing on that after a detailed review. So until then stay tuned ! Do comment below what you have noticed in the Lollipop and whether you love it.",VM
29/10/2014,http://comluv.com/pitstops-around-europe/,Places to travel in Europe,"The itinerary suggested in the guide below is specific, as the order in which visitors take their tour of Europe matters. England, being proudly independent of other countries in Europe, has retained the Pound. Thus, the tour starts there and goes onto all the other countries which use the Euro. That way, there is no need to keep on changing currencies once the first visit has been made. Your itinerary may enjoy different locations within the countries suggested, as these are easily within reach of each other by car or plane. If you have never visited Europe before, the best places to travel in Europe are those that easily interlink with each other. For example, if you can buy tickets as part of a package, to include the countries of interest, you can get great discounts by booking early. Starting in London is a must as there is just so much history within the grasp of the everyday traveler with easy transport links from Central London to airports. Visit the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace and stop off in Oxford Street for a little shopping. Relax in city parks and take in the whole city from the London Eye, situated next to the Thames. If stopping  for a couple of days, taking an excursion to Brighton is worth it. This city alongside the sea offers a really British beach experience, coupled with great shops. The Brighton Pier is an experience all of its own with entertainment for everyone and the antique shops along the sea front are reminiscent of another time. It takes about 60 minutes to get there and the train will amble through some great British countryside on the way. Visit the City Museum and the Royal Museum and stop off in a street cafÃ© to rest your weary feet. Going back to London is easy from Brighton, though you may want to take a detour to Canterbury. Here, the visitor can enjoy the old city walls and the cathedral sharing its prominence with todayâ€™s modern city. Itâ€™s a worthwhile detour, since Canterbury differs so much from other venues chosen for this visit. From London, taking a plane ride to Paris shortens travel time, though if you wish to take the tunnel from the UK this is also possible, though less easily accessible. Paris offers so many sights that itâ€™s almost essential to book a stopover and enjoy the Champs Ã‰lysÃ©es at night. Itâ€™s also worth seeing the Eiffel Tower and taking a walk through Parisian shopping areas to experience the French ambiance. One place you mustnâ€™t miss is Montmartre as the area offers fantastic views over the city, approached by quaint streets where street artists gather. Â Walk along the Seine and enjoy the relaxation offered by the city. From Paris by car or by air to Austria, what awaits the visitor is wonderful countryside, great food and a welcome that makes the Austria one of the best places to travel in Europe. Austria is filled with quaint towns and a heartwarming welcome. Across the border by train, visitors can take in the sights and sounds of Switzerland because this is a country with a triple personality. From Basel in the German part of Switzerland, visitors can experience the mountainous regions within the Italian and French parts of the country. The hills and valleys that make up Austria and Switzerland are breathtaking. The best thing about taking in Austria and Switzerland is the contrast between the two countries. Architecture, tradition and backdrop are all so very different. Visitors also get a chance to let loose with their phrasebooks in three languages, before heading back to France. From Switzerland, the obvious choice is to return to France, though heading further south. Carcassonne airport will land you within reach of one of the most magnificent fortress cities in France, which is still a living city within medieval walls. Itâ€™s worth lunching there as varied offerings are available.Â Some of the best places to travel in Europe are the hidden gems and France has plenty. Toulouse, or the â€œVille Rose,â€ù is within easy reach of Carcassonne and although not as large has Paris, offers city life among the bridges and architecture that takes its nickname from the color of the stone used to build it. If you choose to fly south, Brive la Gaillard airport takes you into the Lot district of France where roads lead into Martel and give you access to the Dordogne at Creysse, St. Sozy and many other small villages along the way. This is a very desirable area of France with countryside which encompasses rolling hills and which has some of the best chateaus in France. The architecture here means many houses have medieval towers helping to add to the fairyland ambiance. A plane from Carcassonne or even from Toulouse down to   is well worth it. In fact, you will find so much to do in the city that hardly ever sleeps. A port town with the wonderful night life of the Ramblas, Barcelona has traces of the work of Gaudi in so many tourist spots within the city. Itâ€™s amazingly beautiful and the Segrada Familia is the best starting point, leading on to Park Guell.Â Gaudi used the inspiration from organic or natural environments to create an architectural style which is fluid and beautiful. Stand in the Guell Park in the center of Barcelona and look over the ceramic rooftops created by Gaudi so many years ago and still silhouetted against the blue skies. The park offers some splendid views and gives city visitors a break from city activity. Itâ€™s very safe too and youâ€™ll find your camera trigger always at the ready. With esplanades plush with greenery, Barcelona offers warmth and plenty of shade in this Catalan region of Spain which is fiercely proud of its heritage. These are some of the many highlights of your potential first visit to Europe, though there are of course many alternatives. Just make sure you get your phrase books at the ready. The advantage of traveling in the order suggested is that you wonâ€™t have to worry about constant currency changes. These are some of the best places to travel in Europe. In London, the Pound is still used, though all other countries mentioned use the Euro.",Josue Valles

The rhizome (underground stem) can be used as a spice as well as as a medicine. It might be used fresh, dried along with powdered, or as the juice or oil. Itâ€™s used everywhere in the world cuisines from soup crab, curries to ginger confectionary along with ginger biscuits.   is usually used to treat various kinds of â€œstomach problems, â€ù which includes motion sickness, morning illness, colic, upset stomach, petrol, diarrhea, nausea caused simply by cancer treatment, nausea along with vomiting after surgery, together with loss of appetite. Ginger can be ideal in assisting food digestion, thereby improving food assimilation and avoiding possible stomach ache.

If youâ€™re suffering through common respiratory diseases for example a cough, ginger aids in growing your lungs and loosening up phlegm because this is a natural expectorant that breaks down and removes mucus..

Several studies have confirmed gingerâ€™s ability to defeat several types of cancer cells, including one of the most aggressive and difficult to take care of: lung, ovarian, colon, busts, skin carcinoma, prostate, and pancreatic. Studies have shown that diabetes can be both prevented and cared for, along with the related abilities in order to reduce blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood fats. Gingerâ€™s antibiotic effects can be exceptional. At least one study that compares the end results of ginger and antibiotics upon Staphylococcus aureus and Azines. pyreus infections shows that ginger extract can be superior. The effects upon drug-resistant infections are, up to now, unknown. Ginger has been shown to have antibacterial effect on respiratory and periodontal infections. Fungal infections are one of the most difficult to treat, and drug-resistant fungi are already developing. However, thereâ€™s you donâ€™t need to despair, as ginger may be found to have antifungal functionality, including to drug-resistant sorts. How much is a lot? Some people will say that 2 tablespoons of shredded ginger in a very cup 2-3 times each day is ideal when you find yourself feeling under the conditions. A lot of men and women will mix ginger and honey to help you soothe a cold and drink it oftentimes a day. Naturally, itâ€™s used in cooking and candy, so itâ€™s difficult to help measure to say exactly how much you should consume, But with each one of these benefits, and with it so easily obtainable, itâ€™s really something we shouldnâ€™t even avoid. In fact you might even mix it up with other ingredients for example Green Tea.",Temilola Waliu

23/10/2014,http://comluv.com/best-way-pay-debt/,The Best Way to Pay Off Debt - ComLuv,"Getting into debt is very easy. Â Just start buying stuff with your credit card and donâ€™t pay it off each month. Â But getting out of debt is very difficult. The average American family with at least one credit card has around $16,000 in credit card debt ( . Â Many of these families are trying to erase that debt but are having a hard time accomplishing that. Â There might be many different reasons why this is so, but one of those reasons might be that theyâ€™re not approaching it the right way. When people start their debt payment process they usually try the most common way â€“Â paying off the card with the highest interest first, regardless of how much they owe. Â And this makes total sense. Â It is definitely the mathematical way to go. If you pay the highest interest first, you end up paying less money in the end. That to me is a no-brainer. Â But unfortunately that is  With the snowball method, you align your cards from lowest to highest balance, regardless of interest rate. Â You then pay the minimum on all cards, but add any extra money that you have to the lowest balance until you pay it off. Â You then take the money you were using to pay off the first card and you add it to the second card while continuing to make minimum payments on the rest of your cards, and I can already hear all the mathematicians saying, â€œThat just doesnâ€™t make sense mathematically! Â Youâ€™re going to end up paying more in interest!â€ù Â Which is true, but paying off debt is not just about math. Â It is also about emotions. By paying off the smallest balances, you create little victories. Â Those victories will boost your morale and motivate you to keep on tackling your debt. Â And thatâ€™s not just me saying it. Researchers at the   have found that people who use the snowball method are more likely to pay off their debt. How much more likely? Â A person using the snowball strategy for 12 months was 14% more likely to pay off all debt. Â After four years on the snowball method that same person was 43% more likely to be debt free. Thatâ€™s a big number. I know the rational way to pay off debt would be to pay the highest interest first. Iâ€™m not crazy, I know thatâ€_ okay maybe a little crazy, but I still know that paying less interest makes more sense. Â However, I tried going the rational way and failed many times. Â Once I tried the snowball method, I was out of debt in  . Emotions probably got us into debt and emotions make us cry when we see our bills ( ) so now letâ€™s use our emotions to get out of debt.

There are 2 ways to get other articles to show on your blog; As others articles show on your blog, yours too are being picked and displayed on other blogs.

19/10/2014,http://comluv.com/creating-responsive-email-design-watch/,Responsive Email Design: What to Watch Out For - ComLuv,"Reading email on desktop is still a wide practice; however, industry reports show that the numbers of emails read on mobile devices and tablets continue to increase. Those increases drive the need to   and adapt email marketing efforts for the on-the-go crowd, making sure your email marketing campaigns donâ€™t fall on deaf ears, or rather, on screens that canâ€™t render them properly. Responsive design is here to stay but not everyone has figured out how to reap the advantages of creating emails that display properly on different sized screens or within the mind-numbing hordes of email clients. Here are some tips about what to watch out for. Numerous industry statistics tell us how mobile use is catching up and in some cases surpassing desktop use for reading emails. You can do a quick internet search to see the stats for yourself. What kinds of emails are we concerned with? Ones from your cousin Vinny or your dear ole grandma? Ah! So whenever the term â€œresponsiveâ€ù comes up with respect to email, we are almost always talking about content in the form of emails to blog subscribers, emails to customers, marketing and promotional emails to potential buyers, lead nurturing autoresponder series, follow-up emails to people who have registered for our courses or have joined our membership sites. Thatâ€™s  . Weâ€™re not concerned with personal email (nor the predecessor, responsive web design). Note that sometimes the phrase is used interchangably with  . All elements of the email will not display exactly the same but the most important elements will be seen and consumed without difficulty. In some instances, emails are not viewed in a client native to the device; instead, they may be viewed in a browser opened on the device. RED takes these varying circumstances into consideration. In 2012 and 2013, BlueHornet (Digital River) surveyed over 1,000 mobile users around the U.S. then wrote an email marketing metrics report detailing   about email marketing. A key, but unsurprising, result of their 2013 survey indicated: â€œConsumer sentiment around mobile coupons and purchasing from mobile emails is generally favorable. However, tolerance for poor mobile design or rendering is very low.â€ù As you can see, our context is transactional and marketing email. And consumers want those emails to look good. There are so many options for viewing emails: As I searched to see what the experts were saying about the subject, I was surprised at comments where designers noted that there is an abundance of information about   responsive emails for different devices but how little information is available about the hordes of email clients being accessed on the various devices. This begs the question: â€œWhy donâ€™t ALL mobile app design efforts undertaken for the purpose of reading emails automatically incorporate HTML email best practices?â€ù Puzzling, right? These are some the many email clients most widely used today: And just to mix it up a bit, and confuse the issue more, on some devices instead of using the native device app for email, mobile users opt to open a browser, then access their email in webmail. So many options! Not all devices created equal, at least when it comes time to display â€” or not display â€” your carefully crafted emails â€_ As mentioned by Jack Filose in the quote above, email is tricky to work with. Even after youâ€™ve given your best effort to creating emails that are responsive on mobile devices, you will find some instances where your hard work is ignored and some devices refuse to display your responsive emails. Say what?! Â  Itâ€™s true: even if you use mobile friendly HTML, there are apps and mobile devices that still donâ€™t support mobile responsive emails; Outlook 2007-2013 uses Microsoft Word as a rendering engine; and Gmail strips CSS in the email head. These actions, which you have no control over, render your responsive emails  . So how do you get around that bit of misbehaving web anomaly? Your emails could be unresponsive because of the (up-to-date) technology you use â€” which is a requirement for ensuring so-called responsiveness. â€œIf you build your web page using well-formed, semantic HTML and progressive enhancement, your page will be accessible by many more browsers and devices than you can guarantee that it will work on. But sometimes a browser is so old and feeble that you simply canâ€™t support it,â€ù says authors Lyza Danger Gardner & Jason Grigsby in  . This is probably the case with older cellphones and desktops still using browsers like IE6. (If you get calls from clients or subscribers who say they canâ€™t view your email, and you ascertain itâ€™s because of old phones or outdated browsers, be nice!) Want more? Here are some email marketing and responsive design resources to help you along the way. With so many devices in use by consumers, designing responsive emails is increasingly important. Experts and data analysts agree that responsive emails enjoy greater open and response rates when they are brief with fast-loading images, have easy to click or tap buttons, sport short but personalized subject lines, and are attractive.

However, if you have started a blog (with the intention of making money online) and you are not recording success, the problem may not be the poor infrastructure of your country or the less than ideal fellows around youâ€_ The problem may instead be you! If you are the problem, it would be a great idea to figure out why you are the very cause of the lack of growth your blog is experiencing. What have you done wrong? Have are you still doing wrong? And more importantly, what do you need to change? Youâ€™ll find the amazing answers in the next few lines below: With the wave of entertainment bloggers rising up everyday, the tendency to choose that niche is great. Then adding up the blogging niche, education niche and make money online niche would provide a perfect blog for your readers (in your estimation). No doubt it will â€“ after you of course add the personal finance niche, the travel niche and the sexual health niche. Youâ€™re now officially a jack of all niches! The temptation of towing this path is that youâ€™ll attract readers from all walks of life and in no time, have very impressive traffic â€“ and hopefully,  . Fail â€“ completely! Lack a clearly defined audience makes it very difficult to pinpoint who exactly you are addressing as a blogger â€“ or information marketer. Now, if you do not even know your prospective clients and actual readers, how exactly will you tailor content to serve them? How exactly will you get content that excites them? How exactly will you be able to craft awesome products for them? Do you now see the futility of insisting on serving everyone? Monetizing a blog isnâ€™t the best part of blogging â€“ believe me. This is because, many of the different audiences respond differently to monetization efforts and it produces different results that vary from niche to nicheâ€_you will do well to know the exact niche you are covering and how traffic in such a niche responds to monetization efforts. If you are covering the entertainment niche, it is unimaginable that youâ€™ll be interested in writing eBooks and other information products! Readers to such a site would usually visit your blog when theyâ€™re in a light mood and suggesting an eBook would be monetization suicide! Aside, what would you have to say in your information products that would be compelling enough to make your readers want to part with some cash? How to be a good musician? I doubt. Instead, you should consider PPC ads â€“ your chances would be higher that way! What if you blog about career and are focused about job hunting tips? In such a niche, you can intelligently combine PPC ads with email courses and maybe, even eBooks (with other information products). The audience to such a blog will be To make money as a blogger, your foremost task is to intelligently choose a monetization method that would serve your niche and interest your audience. Remember, monetization is about smartness. Think! Blog traffic is a concept that is least understood. Every blogger wants more of traffic. Then more. And then, some more. This is perfectly normal but what manner of traffic are you attracting? Are you with some of these poor traffic generation websites that dish out â€œcreditsâ€ù when participating members land on your site for about 5 seconds then bounce away? Think! Such traffic is useless â€“ utterly useless! The traffic worth driving over is traffic that would most likely be interested in what you have to say. Traffic that may convert to readers. Or buyers. Or subscribers. Or the best: raving fans! In this wise, itâ€™s far better to have a site that drives in 10 targeted visits a day than one that attracts 100 visitors who immediately rush to use the red button. Itâ€™s impossible to make money online with a blog without first garnering the trust of your readers. When it comes to opening up a wallet, very few persons would dish out money to a complete stranger â€“ a stranger whose stuff they are not sure of. If all your posts/offers are just about buy this or click here, believe me, great chances are that youâ€™ll never make the bucks as quick as you intend. There are a million and one ways to earn the trust of your readers and make them buy whatever it is that youâ€™re offering. This is a basic guild/tip: Sometimes, â€˜luckâ€™ shines on a fellow and you imagine that he hasnâ€™t done any of these and yet, has succeeded in reaping all the benefits that come with doing things the right way. Donâ€™t be fooled â€“ such bloggers and information marketers have done their homework perfectly â€“ and like the duck, they have managed to keep their hard â€“ struggling and pedaling feet underneath the water. Donâ€™t fall for it! Itâ€™s always my sincere pleasure writing articles like this and clarifying some obscure concepts or better still, demystifying mythsâ€_Iâ€™m also certain you did enjoy the entry as much as I did (in writing it).

Make sure to balance between teamwork and competition, as both of those can be used to create a healthy environment, which will help your business.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Sure, there are headaches, sleepless nights, crying  , but once that stops, you can enjoy all the wonders being a parent can provide you. Watching our children grow and form right in front of our eyes makes us realize that all of this has finally paid off. The important process during growing up is learning how to have fun with your child. You child might not enjoy the same things you do, so you will have to bring yourself down to their level and do those things that they understand, which is both fun and educational. During that, you will also have a good time and you will have an opportunity to enjoy yourself and record each and every moment. Children, when they are not sleeping, like to play with anything they get their hands on, and it is your duty to make sure that whatever they get their hands on â€“ is safe. This is an excellent way of developing crucial skills for your child and teach it how to handle objects,  , sounds, and over time, with your constant help, it will even learn how to talk. It is easier said than done, and you cannot force your child to have fun. Wasting money on expensive toys is not something that we advise you â€“ it is better to buy one or two toys that you think will suit your child, something that can be educational,  are good for developing good reasoning skills, and although those games might seem too easy for you, they are designed in such a way to inspire logical thinking in your child. Puzzles are also extremely fun, but remember that your child needs to be a bit older if you want to let him or her play with it, as they can easily swallow small pieces. This can also be a good mental exercise for you too. Another important thing that you can do, while your child is having fun, is make memories. Not only mental but also physical ones, and it is as easy as pressing a record button. You can take as many pictures as you want â€“ you are not limited as your parents were â€“ and with a simple digital camera in your phone, you can record each and every precious moment from your childâ€™s life. With  , you can create a whole online collection that you child will have an opportunity to enjoy in a few years.

I canâ€™t say that it is as important as the interior but it isnâ€™t something that should be disregarded. Having a charming yard isnâ€™t something that is there to impress others, quite the opposite; you should do it for yourself! Your yard should be the place where you can spend time and relax, not something that you avoid looking at while going to a nearby coffee shop to relax in a nice atmosphere. When you look at things across the board, the costs of arranging an average yard into a not your everyday average yard are not that high. There are a few things you need to keep in mind and just let yourself be creative, like you would with interior decoration. Whatâ€™s the point of having a yard if you donâ€™t have a garden. There are two types of people when it comes to this; the ones that want veggies and fruit in their garden (the more practical approach) and the ones that consider a garden to be  . Â In all honesty, there is nothing stopping you from having both! Be mindful though, a garden is a living thing and requires your attention and care in order to grow properly and be healthy. It is also a science to an extent, so make sure you do your research before you plant anything so as to avoid ending up with a yard full of dead plants. You should always create a spot that is secluded and pleasant for reading a book, having a cup of coffee or tea with friends, or just sitting outside when the weather allows it. This can be a part of your porch or you can create one in your yard, but you should definitely have one. It is great to have a nice looking garden and a well arrange yard, but if you donâ€™t have   your, than what is the point?

You can really get creative with the way you arrange your path, you can use gravel, flagstone steps, lights along the path and similar solutions. Keep it functional though, and make sure it doesnâ€™t require too much attention. Having a yard path that gets wrecked every time someone walks through is a bad thing indeed. The driveway can be a bother to arrange to fit in. You need to think in advance and make sure it fits in with the rest of your yard. There are a few standard  , four to be exact, and they all have their merits and potential issues. Make sure you get informed and think on your decision before you go for the execution. There is no reason to leave your yard simple and unattended. You can really make a difference for yourself when it comes to the comfort you will have in your home. Donâ€™t be afraid to experiment, but if you think you are in over your head, seek out professional help from someone who has tackled tasks like these before.

It is probably the thing where a lot can happen, and which can endanger everything. This is especially important when the business is still young since mistakes that happen at that time can create a lot of trouble, and that is a period where you do not exactly have room to allow yourself such occurrences. The proper way of having every cent in mind is to run everything by yourself, or to hand it over to someone you trust, and this can escalate once your business starts expanding, but this is the problem anyone would be more than happy to deal with â€“ or so they say.

29/09/2014,http://comluv.com/mess-freelancer/,What to Do if You Mess Up as a Freelancer,"Dropping the ball, so to speak, is not a popular topic among freelancers. And thatâ€™s for all freelancers â€“ writers, designers, consultants, everybody. We all do like to read and learn interesting case studies, success stories, â€œunderdog turned big dealâ€ù â€“ stories and so on. But the â€œHey, I messed up and now Iâ€™m in troubleâ€ù is not the most common type of a blog post around the web. In all honesty, this isnâ€™t that surprising after all. I mean, who would eagerly want to share their failures when thereâ€™s no silver lining, right? Nevertheless, failures still educate. In fact, when you fail, you get a lesson you wouldnâ€™t have gotten any other way. So, long story short, yeah, I messed up. Not in a hugely significant way, luckily nothing got on fire, but still. The interesting part was that me messing up wasnâ€™t a result of not paying attention to my work, ignoring the things I should do, or taking a nasty shortcut. In fact, I worked hard to complete a given project â€“ a freelance writing project. I started with an outline, listed all the things I needed to write about, and spent probably 7-10 hours (not quite sure) in total to get it all done. Yet when I sent the article, the client wasnâ€™t all that impressed with it. I had to find a solution. I didnâ€™t want to lose the client. And not only this, but I also wanted him to be happy enough with my services so that he would come back with more work in the future. So here are the things I learned solving this difficult situation, and which Iâ€™m sure you can utilize too, should you ever mess up as a freelancer. When I got the email saying that the client wasnâ€™t impressed, I didnâ€™t respond right away. In fact, I waited two whole days before taking action. I needed this time to free my mind from all the negative thoughts and self-doubt. I knew that my first reaction would surely be in some way defensive. We are all like this. When someone is questioning our knowledge, skill or expertise, we donâ€™t tend to take it lightly. And thatâ€™s no matter if the person is right or not. Some time just needs to pass before we can look at the problem with a fresh eye and respond with something thatâ€™s an actual solution. Like I said, in my case, two days was what I needed. Of course, your mileage may vary. Now, this is the important part, and please bear with me on this one. Iâ€™m going to explain whatâ€™s the reasoning here in just a minute. When you mess up,  . Even if the issue is a result of poor (mutual)  , or poor project definition, or no feedback along the way, or any sort of direction changes mid-project made by the client, etc. You are always to blame. Now, why would you want to take the hit? The answerâ€™s this, when thereâ€™s a problem already, the fact who is to blame changes nothing in regards to finding a solution. Whether it was your fault, your clientâ€™s fault, or your mutual fault, itâ€™s always on you to come up with a solution and then execute it. Itâ€™s therefore easier to take the blame, forget about the fact right away, and immediately focus your brain power on solving the problem. However, donâ€™t start by saying, â€œOh Iâ€™m terribly sorry [â€_]. This will never happen again [â€_].â€ù You donâ€™t want to do this because there are different kinds of people, and while some will just accept your apology, others will become the dominant persona seeing your lack of confidence. You worked hard, so you have nothing to be ashamed of. Stay confident and get to the bottom of the problem. No matter how unsatisfied the client is, they still want to have their work done (theyâ€™ve already invested   sending you an advance, havenâ€™t they?). Because of this, they will be ready to cooperate and let you know what they donâ€™t like specifically if you only ask the right questions. The key-phrase here is â€œthe right questions.â€ù Probably in their first message, the client will give you a general description of what they didnâ€™t like, but what you need to do now is take that info and get Simply keep asking until you get an answer that you can use to fix the problem and deliver an improved version of your work. Of course, respectful tone and understanding is what you need to exercise here. I was in a restaurant one time with my girlfriend. We ordered some soup that we kind of didnâ€™t end up enjoying. I mean, it was okay, but not quite there yet. Since the waiter asked how I liked the soup, I told her my honest opinion. A while later, when we were getting ready to leave, the waiter came back and gave us a bonus card for 20 percent off next time weâ€™re there. Thatâ€™s a nice trick. Even though I wasnâ€™t that impressed with the food, the waiter managed to turn the experience around. Why not do the same when thereâ€™s a problem with the work youâ€™ve delivered as a freelancer? For instance, if youâ€™re a writer charging per word, make the article longer for no extra charge (add a bonus section). If youâ€™re a web designer, you can prepare a custom Twitter background image as a bonus. In short, no matter what kind of work you do, thereâ€™s always something you can give away for free to make the client happy. Some sticky client situations will happen every now and then. Itâ€™s just pure math. If you handle X projects every year, for five or ten years straight, inevitably some of them will get difficult. Now, if you are to learn how to handle them effectively, or how to try to prevent them as much as possible, you need to take notes and keep introducing new elements into your work process. Every lesson you learn from failure will be easily ten times more valuable than a handful of successfully completed projects. For example, maybe the thing that failed in your case was not the actual product, but the process and the way you defined the project in the first place? Having this knowledge you can search for new ways to construct a proposal and pick the elements of the project that clients really want. Maybe you need   and how to make all the details clear right up front. Another example. Maybe the client didnâ€™t see the vision you had in your head? If thatâ€™s the case, you should probably search for some ways to create visual representations of your work, products, or whole work processes. Using a tool like   will make this easier. Need more? In general, most communication problems can be fixed with a good CRM system (like  ), plus some tweaks to your work methodology. Luckily, the  , and with just some trial and error it can help us overcome many obstacles. As a freelancer â€_ scratch that, as a human â€_ you are bound to have better and worse days. I mean, itâ€™s actually quite strange when you look at it. Itâ€™s still the same you, same computer, same environment, yet sometimes the results youâ€™re getting out can vary significantly from day to day. So use your new note-taking habit to find the best approach to do your work, or the   when youâ€™re the most effective. For instance, what Iâ€™m finding is that I write much more smoothly in the morning than I do in the evening. Having this knowledge, I try not to schedule any writing tasks to begin later than 12PM. As a result, this helps me deliver better work to my clients. Okay, maybe   is not the best word here, but what I actually mean is that the fact youâ€™ve failed at something doesnâ€™t define you as a professional or as a human. Everybody fails and itâ€™s only how we handle failure that defines us at the end of the day. Every success is a nice pat on the back and a small kick to keep us going forward. But failures are so much more than that. Once we find the strength to get up after a failure, it gives us huge motivation to keep going and teaches us how to deal with similar situations in the future.

27/09/2014,http://comluv.com/practical-applications-google-glassware-reality-now/,Practical Applications of Google Glassware is a reality now,"There is a host of companies all over the world trying to create Google glasses apps in order to ensure that their company can increase their turnover overnight, but hey letâ€™s face it, when it come to practical and usable applications, one has to give the app store a thorough shake before they can land on something truly unique and usable. This has probably less to do with the difficulty of apps development for glasses and more to do with the fact that there are hardly any number of devices in the market which can be used for research and development. A lot of people are actually using the Google glass development kit or the emulator (simulator) to create basic apps but honestly, itâ€™s really no match for testing the app on the device itself. Well, apple enthusiasts have been app-ing away to glory on simulators for eons now, so whatâ€™s the big row about Google glass apps development on an emulator? Well, the fact of the matter is that people have still not experienced the device in its totality. Basically, unless you know what the gadget is all about, how it functions, what are its drawbacks, you will never be able to come up with any app that is beyond entertainment. The thing about Google glassware is that not only consumers, but also many app development companies and professionals have no idea what the actual practical look and feel of the device is like. So they put in their ignorant yet painstaking efforts to produce an app that is not really workable at all. There is no doubt about the fact that the glass is a futuristic device. Those who have been able to put their hands on it have really come up with some fantastic and practical industry ideas for applications. The most significant of them all Medicine is probably the most important area of research and development today. With the help go Google glassware, medicine and scientific study can both be taken to a different level altogether. A few months earlier, there were reports of surgeons using the glass in order to show the live video of a surgery to doctors sitting halfway across the world. With important data such as vital stats showing right in front of the screen, surgeons realized that the margin of error and the time taken during any surgery can be reduced significantly. Now thatâ€™s what we call a practical app. One of the first videos of Google glassâ€™s practical usage was of a fire fighter explorer who showed how the glass was incredibly effective in helping fire fighters in a lot of situations. With an innovative app that could sense and screen body temperature against the background would be extremely effective in highlighting and pinpointing exactly where the firefighter needs to go. Important information such as distance between you and the victim and the shortest and best possible route in order to save him too make the job a lot more convenient. This happens to be one of the most recent achievements for Glass. A very unique and practical app seems to have hit the market which is to facilitate insurance companies through their insurance claim settlement process. The process of investigation post accident is very tedious for the insurance company. This app has been carefully designed to ensure that a seamless bilateral communication between the investigator who does the field work and the experts at the office. This reduces overhead expenses and expedites the whole process to make sure that client satisfaction is optimum. I am sure with time and with further exposure to the device there will soon be an explosion of great apps for the glass. However, till then it might seem like a long and dull wait. But any form of actual developmental progress is sure to reach only after the glass is available for the general public. So, letâ€™s hope that happens soon! Keeping our gadget fingers crossed!",JillElliott

You have this country invading that country, neighbors fighting neighbors over a fence and people everywhere filling our heads with their own personal brand of negativity. We have all been there at one point where everything and everyone seems to be against you and the whole weight of the world is on your shoulders. Everywhere you turn there is negativity and nothing you do seems to go right. Everything you think about or see is wrong. Itâ€™s time that we put an end to it and start shedding some positive light on our lives; thinking about the little things that make us happy and using them in our everyday life. Life does not have to be all about the negatives; letâ€™s bring some positivity into the world and keep ourselves smiling. There is a lot of positivity going on around us every second of every day; we just donâ€™t tend to focus on it. There is beauty in everything around you. Donâ€™t believe me?

Or you can always go inside yourself and think about things in the past that made you smile. It has been said that smiling more often makes you healthier and can even help you live longer. We think it does, but you should decide for yourself. Go ahead, smile, it just might catch on with the people around you. And wouldnâ€™t that be a wonderful thing?

Common cause of inflammation is bacterial infection. Most commonly, lower urinary tract is involved in UTI, namely bladder and urethra, hence called lower UTI. Majority of the cases of UTI are generally mild, however in severe cases, UTI may lead to permanent kidney damage and renal failure. Women are at greater risk of developing UTI in compare to men. This is because of anatomical reason and less of physiological reason. In fact more than 90% of the patients of UTI, are women. Anatomically, female urethra is located near to anus and shorter and straighter then male urethra. Because of its proximity to anus, bacteria can easily reach urethra from anus and rectum, which numerous pathogenic bacteria that commonly causes UTI, such as e. coli. Once the bacteria reach urethra, they can easily travel upstream, because female urethra is straight and short. In comparison male urethral opening is far away from anus, it is much longer and tortuous, which makes it difficult for bacteria to find entry in the urethra and from there, upstream.

Not only that a cheap hosting service can be an extremely efficient one, but on the other hand, an expensive one does not guarantee high quality of service. There are many technical details that you must know before going deeper into the forest of hosting providers. Things like uptime, storage capacity, number of emails, malware scanning and the duration of trial periods must all be taken into account before choosing. So, letâ€™s start from the basics. You should  . A different hosting plan is required for hosting a blog, or for posting videos or pictures online. Maybe disk space is really important for you, but on the other hand maybe bandwidth isnâ€™t, as you donâ€™t expect many visitors. If you want a site that is rich in content, than you probably should pick a host more carefully. You want enough RAM, disk space and processing power to be there for the needs of your site, so your visitors can be sure that there are no imposed limitations. Weâ€™ve mentioned that price isnâ€™t everything, but still, nothing comes free. While it should be a deciding factor, you want to find the provider with the best plan that is suitable for your needs, and your wallet.   usually isnâ€™t all there is to it, as it usually has hidden costs and penalties, because hosting companies are also in the business of making money. Find a few providers and compare their offers, and find the ones that fit your needs. This is a really important one. When a website goes down, for any reason, you want to be able to make a call and get answers as soon as possible and you do not want to be forced to wait for responses. Also, you want to talk to a live representative of the company. It maybe their fault and their customer service must be able to handle all the calls from all their respective customers. Support must be available to you Even though commercials use words like â€œendlessâ€ù and â€œunlimitedâ€ù, there is no such thing. Everything is subject to fair use, and some resources are available to you as long as you are not overusing them. Maybe the number of files you can keep on your website is limited, or if your site gets a lot of visitors which the host hasnâ€™t predicted, they usually suspend the account, as it can hog their resources, and endanger other websites on the same infrastructure. All these things are mentioned in the terms of service (ToS), and it is recommended that you  . If your website grows in popularity and you start getting a lot of new, unique visitors per day, you want to be able to expand some of the resources available to suit your new, rising needs. So, you want your host to be able to quickly upscale any particular resource that you ask for, for a determined price, and you will want to know that there are no hidden penalties for changing your hosting plan. Always do  , since there are a few very good, specialized sites that do an in-depth review of the more popular hosting services and are grading their quality. They will also reveal any hidden costs, or any other things that are not mentioned on the official site of the hosting company. Do not be fooled by fancy offers, and only trust a service once you have checked the reviews from other users. In the end, it all boils down to research and reading the fine print. You must be willing to adjust your price range if a host provider is offering a better environment for your site.

The following dos and donâ€™ts will help you avoid the mistakes and make the most out of your blog commenting efforts. Backlinks and SEO used to be what come to my mind when I thought of blog commenting in the past. There are still a lot of people who think the same â€“ whichâ€™s probably why we all get tons of spam comments on our blogs every day. Of course, blog commenting is one way to build links. But thatâ€™s not the only benefit it has. When you post comments on popular blogs in your niche, readers will recognize you, remember your name, and maybe click through to your website. Not only that, but youâ€™ll also get recognized by blog owners. If you, down the road, want to contact one of the bloggers with your guest blogging, JV, or affiliate partnership offers, it will be easy for you because the blog owner already knows you and youâ€™re not coming out of the blue. Some people seem to think as though the commenting area is the spot to advertise their website or plaster their SEO links for free. Using keywords as your name, adding irrelevant links inside the body of your comments, and poorly written comments with spelling errors etcâ€_ are some practices that can get you labeled as spammer which you should avoid. Itâ€™s only when you offer some value that youâ€™ll gain something in return. You first need to add value by posting relevant and quality comments and in return, youâ€™ll gain exposure and traffic. While itâ€™s easy to write one-line comments like â€œThanks for the tipsâ€ù and â€œGreat postâ€ù etc.., itâ€™s not useful (unless thatâ€™s the only thing you can say, of course). The point of blog commenting is to share with the reader your unique experience, knowledge and point of view; and make them recognize you, trust you as well as see what more valuable stuff they can learn from you. Those kinds of comments, however, show nothing about you or your expertise. And they rarely get approved by the blog owner anyway, which is a waste of time. What you can do instead Blog commenting is not about quantity, itâ€™s about quality. When you read a blog post, leave a comment only if you have something valuable to say. Otherwise, just hit the back button. Also make sure to read othersâ€™ comments as well as the blog post through to the end so you can compose a detailed and relevant response. Â  How many times have you ever read a blog post, feel you got something to say and when you scroll down, you notice comments are closed? Some blogs close or disable comments on posts older than some time like two weeks. On top of that, first comments usually appear at the top of the list and get more exposure. New blog posts also usually get the most readers around the first time right away after they are published. You can subscribe via email or RSS Feeds, or use tools like Google Alerts to get notified whenever new posts get published on your favorite blogs. If you donâ€™t already know, Gravatar is a tool which lets you use a picture of yours when commenting. All you have to do is associate an email address of your with your picture, and whenever you leave a comment using that email, your picture will appear next to your name. This way, readers can put a name to your face, you can get recognized easily and get more click-through to your website. You can sign up to use this feature by going to   for free. Create a list of your favorite blogs or popular blogs in your niche with which you want to build relationships. Then become a regular reader and contributor. Youâ€™ll gradually get recognized by the blog owners as well as by the readers of blog. You can go to blog directories such as   or just head over to Google and enter some niche-related keywords to find popular blogs in your industry. When it comes to blog commenting, you get better results when you do it consistently rather than posting a few comments here and there and then disappear. Keep a schedule for posting like 5-10 comments a day or whatever you feel comfortable with and do it on a regular and consistent basis. Consequently, youâ€™ll make yourself recognized. Â  , effective blog commenting simply involves sharing your unique knowledge or experience with readers of other blogs on a regular basis. Always strive to provide value in your comments as thatâ€™s the key for gaining exposure and traffic.",Mickiyas

That is why everyone is always searching for the best way of improving their home, and making their life a bit more comfortable and not to mention, a lot more convenient. It is surprising to find out how some small changes can improve our overall satisfaction with our homes, but those changes must be carefully chosen, as most of us are limited by our time and our wallets. No matter what you decide is best for you, any home investment project is a good idea, as it will not only increase the overall value of the property, but will make your life a whole lot easier. Many houses have large attics, and those end up being used only as a place where you can store things you are not ready to throw away yet. If your house is among one of those, you are in luck, as you can easily turn one of those spacious attics into a spacious room, all for yourself, and finally have that gaming place youâ€™ve always wanted. Of course, every house needs a place where you can put things you donâ€™t need, so you can place a few shelves and make it into a well-designed storage room where you can place even more things, and de-clutter the rest of your house. If you plan on making it into an office space, a study or an entertainment room, then you will need to invest into some proper insulation, and make sure that you can actually live in it, and not freeze to death during the winter. With a fresh coat of paint,  , and a few decorative pictures, you can turn it into anything you want. Unlike basements, attics are a much better investment, and they are usually more open, spacious, and can let more sunlight in, which is ideal if you live in an area with a moderate climate. There are many things that you can do in The bathroom is quite an important room in any house, and you can easily tell a lot about a person only by visiting their bathroom, and because of this, you must make it a place where you can enjoy.

Why not change the color of the walls, or replace that old shower curtain? Small things like that can easily improve the overall look of your bathroom and the property value of your home. Buy a pair of waterproof speakers, so you can have your own personal concert while showering. Most of the things in an average bathroom can be refurbished, but if there are some broken tiles, make sure that you replace them. Leaky faucets are not only annoying, but can also be dangerous. If you like having long showers, think about having a tankless water heater that can provide you with an endless supply of hot water.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Even if you have the time, an hour of slow-paced cardio every single day and a circuit training may not be ideal for the kind of results you are going for. There is a particular type of workout for every specific fitness goal, and you need to tailor your workout program according to your needs. This is the most efficient way of getting what you want from your training. In this article, we will look at a few of the most common reasons why people train and provide some information on the right kind of workout for getting the best results in the shortest period of time for each one of these. Proper programming is just as important as choosing the right exercises and rep ranges, as it enables you to push your body close to its limits and leave it plenty of room to recover. If your main focus is becoming stronger, be it so that you can perform better in your chosen sport or if you are just a recreational lifter, than you will need to work with challenging weights at lower rep ranges, doing mostly big compound movements. The 3-5 rep range is where you will be setting up shop, doing something like 5Ã—5 or 4Ã—6 and focusing on the dead-lift, squat, bench press, bent over rows and military presses. As far as the diet goes, youâ€™ll need to be in calorie surplus to ensure optimal strength gain, but many strength athletes do slow clean bulks, adding only a few pounds a month and dieting down to a reasonable body fat percentage when they start getting a little too bulky. Here is an example of a good   for beginners. For those focused more on muscle endurance and optimal cardiovascular conditioning, a fair bit of movement is necessary. Your training will be based on whether you run, cycle, swim or play a sport â€“ specificity in training is the key to becoming better at what you do â€“ and whether you are focused on a mid or long distance. As for weight training, compound movements are still an excellent choice, but you will need to increase the repetitions and do fewer sets. Doing 15-20 repetitions can be beneficial, but switching between this and the 10-12 rep range can help you build muscle and endurance, which is useful for mid distance athletes. You will be burning a lot of energy doing this type of training, so a   â€“ 60-70% of your total calories â€“ is recommended. You can look into some of the different types of   to get an idea of what would suit you best. Some people donâ€™t really care about gaining too much strength, speed or endurance, and are focused more on looking and feeling good. If youâ€™re in it for basic health and developing a sexy beach body, then youâ€™ll need a quick and effective workout that allows you to be in and out of the gym in 45 minutes flat. With three sets in the 8-12 rep range, doing either full body or splitting your workouts, e.g. upper/lower body or push/pull movements 4 times a week, you can finish the work quickly. As long as you stay in a slight calorie surplus and  , you will make good progress. You need to build up your muscles first before you can show them off, so expect to be a bit bulky for a good part of the year and then shed the excess weight gradually over 2-3 months to keep all your muscle while looking lean and hard. This is someone whoâ€™s main goal is to improve their fighting skills and become a better fighter. One aspect of this is gaining some size, as thick muscles will help absorb powerful strikes, but you will also need explosive power and plenty of muscle endurance. This is a tricky thing to train for, as you need to be fairly quick and explosive over an extended period of time, all while staying in motion. Good basic exercises are dead-lifts, squats, bent over rows, bench press and military press in the lower rep ranges, 3-5 for 5-8 sets, as well as explosive exercises like jump squats, power clean and medicine ball throws. A good amount of core work, neck and grip training is also advised. Plenty of carbs will be needed for energy, but you will want to switch to a high protein diet when cutting weight since higher carb intake will make you retain more water weight. A good example of an all-encompassing fighterâ€™s training workout is MMA legend  . This is the everyday Joe or Jane, looking for a little more than good health and a decent body, without spending a whole lot of time and effort to get these things. Chances are you arenâ€™t able to fit in more than 2 workout sessions per week, and you can only squeeze in some 40-50 minutes of gym time. You can go the traditional bodybuilding route and do a 3Ã—10 program, but there is a nice little routine by YouTube fitness guru and science guy Jason Blaha, which is specifically geared towards busy average people with  . You have to be at the gym twice a week, itâ€™s no problem if you miss a workout, and you donâ€™t have to go for maximum intensity and punish your body each workout session. As far as food goes, just try watch your calories as much as you can and stack your fridge and pantries with healthy food. There you have it â€“ a little bit for everyone.

Have you ever thought of selling your photographs to the tourism industry through a photographic library or by approaching the tour operators themselves? And if you already have tried this, but without much success, are you wondering why your photographs arenâ€™t selling? Having worked within the industry for many years, as a photographer and a photographic editor, I would like to share some hints and tips on how photographs are selected and how you can improve your chances of selling your photographs to the tourism industry. And donâ€™t forget the smallÂ independent tour operators who specialise in specific destinations. TheÂ  Â has a useful list of UK companies. It may seem obvious but the aim here is to sell holidays and tour operators will want their brochures full of glorious sunshine and clear blue skies (maybe with just a few fluffy white clouds). Even a skiing brochure is full of photographs with brilliant blue skies. A moody sky with interesting cloud formations may create a much more artistic image that would look superb hanging in a gallery but in the main it wonâ€™t sell holidays. Donâ€™t just limit your photography to landscapes, cityscapes and the obvious iconic symbols of a destination but extend your collection to all the things that represent that destination. Images of traditional cuisine, flower stalls, shop window displays, smiling locals, interesting architectural details and so forth all make useful supplementary images. That doesnâ€™t mean you should not take images of say, crumbling buildings if they are evocative and beautiful, but keep in mind that the aim is to sell the destination. Tour operators often send photographers on assignment to not only capture destination shots but also images of properties such as hotels, villas, swimming pools and interiors so if this is something you would like to do, build up a selection of appropriate images for your portfolio and then approach companies directly.

I know a lot of the content in ComLuv deals with internet marketing, generating traffic, making money online, establishing your own online business(s), etc. But what if youâ€™re not interested in leaving the â€œrat raceâ€ù to earn a living online? What if you much rather work (or continue to work) for someone else instead? Well if thatâ€™s you, then thereâ€™s really nothing wrong with that. After all, a lot of you reading this article right now has either worked for someone else or is currently working for someone else. Additionally, in spite of the growing number of people making money online, thereâ€™s still a need for other professions that can only come with working for a boss. People still crave interactions with employees (and leading them); a desire to achieve and maintain a certain status; having someone else deal with benefits (health and dental); receiving W-2 forms; and there are just those who simply donâ€™t want change. In the end, we all want to land our dream job â€“ whether it means workingÂ in a traditional job, owning your own business, or making money online. If youâ€™re a recent college graduate or someone who has yet to find his/her dream job, then this article is for you. Here are four practical tips to land your dream job: You need to plan ahead. Regardless of your age and current status, where do you see yourself in five or ten years from now? Are you content with your current employer? Do you feel like the job youâ€™re in is fulfilling and rewarding? These are important questions to ask yourself because it provides you with a reality check on your current situation. Most of our time is spent working for someone else; therefore, you need to ensure that your time is spent wisely and purposefully. To create your dream job scenario, there are six components to consider: 1) Your ideal location â€“ is it close to where you live; close to outdoor activities; climate choice. 2) Your ideal work schedule â€“ hourly; specific days; flexibility; part-time or full-time. 3) Your ideal work environment and culture â€“ diversity; fast-paced or your own pace; structured. 4) Your ideal job function â€“ micromanagers; analytic or creative; isolated or maintain close interactions. 5) Your ideal salary or compensation â€“ hourly pay; monthly pay; full commission or base + commission. 6) Your ideal employer size â€“ small business; family business; large company. Narrowing your choices to these six components helps you make an informed decision â€“ instead of wasting time, effort, and resources to land the perfect job. How you make these decisions are based on your personality, character, work ethic, and social acceptance. Only  know what your likes and dislikes are; what makes you tick; what satisfies you; how fast or slow do you build relationships; how hard you work; what skills you enjoy applying; so on and so forth. Itâ€™s not rocket scienceâ€_itâ€™s about knowing who you are. Hereâ€™s an obvious choice thatâ€™s not so obvious. After planning ahead and narrowing your ideal job description, if you want to land your dream job, you need to start while youâ€™re still young and hungry. Because the longer you wait, the farther it is for your dream job to become a reality. One week becomes one month; one month becomes one year; so on and so forth. Not young anymore? Itâ€™s OK. As long as you still have the desire, drive, and hunger to pursue your dream job, itâ€™s not too late. But be carefulâ€_for your motivation For instance, when I was still in the military, Iâ€™ve always wanted to become a Personal Trainer. I told myself that I can study personal training while I was still serving. Well, this was a problem considering the nature of my job. And so, I decided to wait until I got out. Now that Iâ€™m separated, Iâ€™m still not studying for my personal training certificate. Instead, Iâ€™ve been doing other things and studying other disciplines. My dream of becoming a personal trainer is slowly slipping away. Donâ€™t let this happen to you. Start now. This advice may contradict the advice of your parents, mentors, or school counselors; but if you think about it, having a â€œbackup planâ€ù is really a subtle way of saying you might fail. â€œIf I donâ€™t land my dream job, well at least, I have something else to fall back on â€“ even though itâ€™s not what I want to do.â€ù A jobâ€™s a job after all, right? Although I cannot disagree with you aboutÂ being employed rather than unemployed (especially in this economy) â€“ after all, you have bills to pay and mouths to feed â€“ you still have to fully commit and not lie to yourself that youâ€™ll eventually land your dream job. Sure, it may take you a while, and in the meantime, you may also have to work with an employer you donâ€™t love â€“ but that doesnâ€™t also mean thereâ€™s no hope. Donâ€™t let your current situation stop you from staying focused and committed to working for an employer in     someday. Do what you need to do with no regrets, doubts, or excuses. Whatever it takes. Yes, you should always be networking. The problem is, however, most people donâ€™t know what it   means to network. To better understand what it means to network, hereâ€™s what networking is  : 1) Itâ€™s not about collecting business cards â€“ Itâ€™s more about quality, not quantity. Thereâ€™s more value receiving one business card from someone whom you connected with and have a meaningful conversation, as opposed to 20 business cards from superficial conversations. 2) Itâ€™s not about annoying others â€“ Donâ€™t try to establish relationships based on insincerity, or flatter a potential employer without being genuine about it. Flattery does go far, if done right and with some strategy behind it. Always be genuine and sincere. 3) Itâ€™s not about whom you know â€“ Contrary to popular opinion, itâ€™s not about â€œwho you knowâ€ù or â€œwho knows you.â€ù Itâ€™s about   and  . For instance, my sister once attended a job fair and landed a job that she wasnâ€™t qualified for because they loved her personality, character and ethical beliefs. They found that she was the right fit, because everything my sister is, matches the companyâ€™s own values and culture. They also saw what a valuable asset she can bring to their team. As I mentioned earlier, working for someone else may not be what youâ€™re looking for. But I also know there are those who are more satisfied to work a traditional job and maintain a certain status â€“ whether itâ€™s a banker, lawyer, doctor, military member, CEO of a company, etc. â€“ as opposed to earning a living online.

Of course now youâ€™re probably thinking, â€œwell thatâ€™s a subject normally not brought about in everyday conversation.â€ù And youâ€™re rightâ€_ In fact   is not a phenomenon that is widely recognized by science. Itâ€™s definitely not something you would see filed in the International Classification of Diseases. But believe it or not, there are large amounts of data collected over the years which may show that spontaneous human combustion is indeed possible. Skepticism has not always been the wide spread view of this phenomenon. Especially during the 17  and 18  centuries, the opinion of the masses was quite the opposite. There have been many documented cases of people found that were chard beyond recognition. But the strange part about many of these cases was that they would be found with all their outer tissue burned to a crisp, while all internal organs remained intact. Or sometimes everything would be burned except for a single digit or limb that was left untouched. Many of the   cases involved town â€œdrunkardsâ€ù and the popular belief was they were being punished by God for their unacceptable behavior as a public menace. While others were thought to of burned themselves up by falling asleep with a lit cigarette in their hand. So this leads us to our next question,  ? Researchers, compounded with popular belief, decided to test the theories of alcohol being at fault for many of these cases. They decided to perform a controlled experiment which involved soaking a rat in alcohol for a year and then set it on fire. Iâ€™m sorry to have to bring up this inhumane experiment, but it is relevant to the subject at hand. If it were up to me, I would of chosen a much more humane experiment. That being said, the rat was set on fire and it went up in a raging fire. Most outer layers of flesh were burned, but the ratâ€™s internal tissue and organs remained By the time the 19  century had rolled around, advances in biology and chemistry had allowed researchers to dig deeper into the possibilities of what causes spontaneous combustion. These seemingly inexplicable fires may have an explanation. After much research there were many new possibilities that were brought to light that could explain why this was happening. Of course even though these were all fact, when suggested as causes for spontaneous human combustion, they were merely hypotheses. It is quite possible that the human digestive system could build up enough flammable gas to pose a hazard. Static electricity combined with the buildup of these gases could be a deadly combination. At the very least it could be a condition that would start   in motion, even though something else could fuel the fire after ignition. According to experts from the National Fire Protection Association, it is possible for the   to build up a static charge equal to several thousand volts. Normally these static charges are dissipated into the air and are harmless. But given the right conditions, such as being in a room full of volatile chemicals, an explosion could be possible. But this still doesnâ€™t explain   in a sense that a person is reduced to ashes while the room and furnishings remain unharmed. There have been many other explanations for why someone would burst into flames. Even though there have been many attempts to uncover the mystery of spontaneous human combustion victims, nothing has been proven. Therefore this phenomenon, for now, remains a mystery. You can read up on   to get some more details about this oddity. Do you have any more thoughts on what may cause spontaneous human combustion?

The potential buyers will be investing quite a bit of money, and this house will possibly become their new home, so it is only fair that they have plenty of concerns going into deal. They also may have been burned before and have learned to be wary of sales pitches. This is why you need to spruce up the old place and make it presentable. No one wants to live in a dump and people expect a certain level of utility, as well as a good aesthetics. Here are some of the most important repairs youâ€™ll need to make before putting your house on the market. The roof is a major issue for people, and itâ€™s not difficult to see why. The roof is right there in plain sight and it is something thatâ€™s not being given too much thought when it comes to regular maintenance. And itâ€™s not just about how it makes the house look â€“ a leaky roof can cause all sorts of problems like mold and flooding.   requires a bit of cleaning, replacing a few shingles here and there and paying close attention to the flashing â€“ the thin metal or rubber strips covering the seams â€“ and make sure that everything is solid. While you are at it, clean out the gutters and fix any leaks, and have the chimney thoroughly cleaned. Â  The interior needs to be sparkling clean â€“ you want to give of a feeling of a well-maintained and impeccable home. While this means a whole lot of vacuuming, dusting, scrubbing and arranging furniture, most people forget about the little details like nail holes and various nicks and bumps in the floor, walls and furniture. Youâ€™ll want to fix all  , or at least mask them so that the house looks spotless.",Ivan Dimitrijevic
01/08/2014,http://comluv.com/7-hacks-get-24-hours/,7 Hacks To Get the Most Out of Your 24 Hours - ComLuv,"Each person is unique in countless ways, but we are all alike in one way. No matter the status of our births, our heights, our weights, our experiences, our hopes, our dreams, we all have one thing in common. We will have it common from the day weâ€™re born until the day we die. We all have only 24 hours in a day. No matter how many times we wish for more, perhaps feel we need more, weâ€™re stuck in time the same way as everyone else. Instead of wishing for more hours in a day, why not take action to get the most out of your allotted 24 hours? Take these seven hacks, for instance. Implement even one of them and youâ€™ll get more out of your time. Implement all seven, and people will wonder if you did indeed invent a machine that slows down time.  Routine gets boring. Structure adds meaning. It might sound like a pithy platitude, but the difference between the two can change your day. If you do the same exact thing, at the same time, every day, you will eventually stop doing it. Routine bores us.  Structure, though? We can use structure to build productive days that remain flexible.  So whatâ€™s the difference between structure and routine?  Get up and do your stretches, then put on coffee, then shower, then eat breakfast.  Get up and get your heart rate up. Before you shower, put on coffee. After you shower, eat breakfast. The differences seem subtle, because they are subtle. A routine is a set of instructions you follow every day. Structure guides us in the right direction. Humans get sick of following instructions, even ones from ourselves. So ditch your daily routine and set up a structure instead.  Need some ideas for how to structure your own day? Check out  . While we can trade in our old routines for new structures, some of our jobs require us to perform routine tasks. Unless you have someone to whom you can delegate, youâ€™re stuck performing these tasks. Theyâ€™re typically low-level yet necessary, and so fall into either the Urgent-but-Important, or worse, the Urgent-but-Not-Important quadrant in the task management matrix.  Even if you donâ€™t have someone below you on the company hierarchy, you can still delegate many of those routine tasks. Or, at least, you can automate them so they donâ€™t consume your limited focus and time. Services like   â€” if this, then that â€” have become increasingly popular, especially as theyâ€™ve developed smartphone integration. Yet for business, there might be a better service, one that connects with more than your typica consumer apps. Check it out:  . It connects with services like Trello, Salesforce, Basecamp, AWeber, and more. With integtation into these business-class services, you can automate a good chunk of your day.  Everyone would be more productive if they could hire assistants. Yet we all know that many companies just donâ€™t have the budget. Itâ€™s not just the assistantâ€™s salary. Itâ€™s the cost of finding a good one. Then there are training costs, benefits packages, and all sorts of costs that HR professionals know all too well, but people outside of HR take for granted.  One emerging alternative: virtual assistants. You might find them working independently, but there are many agencies where you can find a selection of assistants. You typically pay the agency for how many hours you need per month. Then you can delegate tasks to the assistant, freeing your time to pursue more important goals. The per-hour cost of a virtual assistant is far less than that of even an entry-level on-site assistant, and there are no hidden costs. Itâ€™s the new way to hire on a budget. Check it out:  . While many people think that virtual assistants can handle only administrative tasks like email filtering and bookkeeping, Worldwide101 assistants can do far more. If you pay for the upper tier service, not too much more than the standard service, you can even have them write up marketing materials and conduct serious outreach. And itâ€™s still cheaper than hiring an on-site assistant.  Mentally run through your typical day. How often do you find yourself in a situation where you canâ€™t get any work done? Youâ€™re sitting in traffic. Youâ€™re waiting for a reply so that you can proceed on a project. Worst of all, youâ€™re standing around waiting for someone. We have plenty of gap time in our personal lives as well. Consider the time you spend every We all face considerable gap time every day. During it we lose valuable minutes, even hours, every day and week. Yet there is plenty we can do during those seemingly idle hours. How? Here are a few ideas. Plan ahead for these gaps times, and watch your productivity soar. Theyâ€™re hours you didnâ€™t even realize you had.  The next two hacks might seem at odds, but once we examine them more closely theyâ€™ll make more sense. In order to get more out of our days, we can bundle tasks that donâ€™t require our full engagement. This is not akin to multitasking, but rather laying a partially engaged task on top of another partially engaged task.  For example, I like to read while watching baseball games. I love baseball, and can become fully engaged. But to be fully engaged 162 days per year is quite a lot to ask of my attention and time. And so I like to read a paragraph in between pitches, and a few pages during commercials. This works well with football (American football, at least). There is plenty of downtime between plays, and commercials abound. Iâ€™d wager you could read more than 50 pages in a book during a standard football game if you read during halftime.  There are plenty of other opportunities to bundle tasks. Exercise is a prominent example. Some people   music to keep them motivated. I once counted myself among them. But now I listen to podcasts while working out. Thereâ€™s hardly a difference in how I feel, and Iâ€™m doing more of something I like doing. Get a stand for your tablet and read while doing the dishes (or listen to an audiobook or podcast).  If a task doesnâ€™t fully engage you, try to add another partially engaging task.  When you bundle tasks, youâ€™re not switching back-and-forth. Youâ€™re doing two low-engagement tasks at once. When youâ€™re at work, oftentimes you have a number of tasks that do require your full engagement. Those are the tasks you should approach with focus. Yet so many people feel that they can get more done by multitasking â€” switching back and forth between many tasks. Can you be fully engaged in three or four tasks at once? Can you toggle your engagement in the same way you press the ALT + TAB keys? Many studies show that we donâ€™t just return to our tasks after distractions. It takes   to resume focus. Can we ever really get into the zone, really focus, if weâ€™re toggling among many different tasks? If youâ€™re toggling among low-level tasks, and have a time limit set, maybe. But here has to be time for deep, focused work.  A focused 25 minutes of work will yield more productive results than 90 minutes of constantly distracted work. So find some time in the day â€” maybe even get to the office before everyone else â€” turn off email and other interruption machines, and get to work. Even if you can manage only a few deeply focused blocks per day, youâ€™ll still find youâ€™re spending your time more efficiently.  No one wants to micromanage her life. We all groan when a boss asks us to report how many hours we spent on a certain task or account. So when I suggest that you track how you spend your time, Iâ€™ll hear similar groans. Do we need to track every minute of our lives in order to get the most out of the day?  No, not at all. Think of time tracking as an experiment, and a loose one at that. Track your time every day for a week. That weekend, take a look at your logs. Where were you most productive? Where were you least? Having these data at hand will show you where you can improve, and where youâ€™re strong.  Think about it this way: elite athletes analyze their own games to find their weaknesses. Thatâ€™s how they get better. Why canâ€™t we do the same with our own lives? If we understand where weâ€™re wasting time, we can devise a plan to reclaim that time. Check it out:  . Itâ€™s a simple tool, with a free tier, that allows you to track your time. Look at your logs for the week and figure out where you can improve. Then try to improve for a few weeks. Go back in later and track another week. You donâ€™t need to micromanage your life in perpetuity. But you can gain more time by periodically figuring out how you can better spend your time.",Joe Pawlikowski

I do love the last three letters ending the comlv.com and obviously it hasnâ€™t got to do with the .com but instead the â€˜luvâ€™. That means me too can take turn and share the â€˜luvâ€™ here as well. That means the 5 Ugly Blogs in this world can simply go ahead. Have you ever thought of what makes a blog look ugly? There seem to be so many blogs which are obviously ugly by nature. If there is one thing which is simply easier to set up in this world, it has to be setting up a blog. What at all do you need? Basically, a domain name which comes so cheap of late and a web hosting. Moreover, the likes of blogger.com can make anyone be a blogger in no time. Just sign up and just within some few minutes youâ€™re already a blogger. But what really makes a blog ugly?Â  What distinguishes between a good looking blog and one which isnâ€™t? I have being blogging for some time now and it really hurts when you come across a blog like this; If there is one thing which works off line but doesnâ€™t work online, it has to be flashy ads. One thing which makes a blog really look ugly has to do with the use of flashy ads. Reading a post and one ads just at the sidebar keeps changing colours obviously distracts a lot. What is the use of all these? And there is no doubt the blogger behind it intend driving away the reader for some pennies. Anyway, who doesnâ€™t want to earn cash blogging? We all want to but doesnâ€™t mean we need to go in with flashy ads. Our readers are more important than anything else. Just bear in mind that, flashy ads just make your blog look really ugly and at the end, drives many away from your blog. Another thing As to why most blog donâ€™t have that, I am yet to find out why. How come a blog filled with lots of information wouldnâ€™t have a search bar to make it easier for readers to search for things they need really makes me ponder? So if you want another ugly blog, check out that blog with no search bar. As to whether we like it or not, blogging isnâ€™t an island. No matter what, there will be someone willing to contact you. Be it advertisers, fellow bloggers, spammers, scammers etc. no matter, you have to make it easier for people to contact you. Not having a contact me page is more or less like standing in the dark and winking at a girl. No one knows what youâ€™re doing except yourself. Make it easier for people to contact you and donâ€™t forget that not having one makes your blog look more or less like an ugly blog. Have you ever thought of it? Take for instance this scenario, after reading this great master piece, the only option left for you to either agree with me or debunk some of those points of mine as being bogus, youâ€™re left with no option than to register before you can comment. Registering before commenting on a blog post really does you and your blog no good. I see comments as means of user engagement. That means what you wrote went down to some people well or not. But when one needs to sign in through his Facebook account or Twitter makes your blog look really ugly. That is it! Why go in with Disqus when default wordpress is great? Please before you release Â that sledge hammer on me, the fifth point is for you. Let the world hear your though on this. What do you make of this post? Your thoughts are very well welcomed by commenting below. What in your opinion makes a blog looks ugly? I have had my say, have yours as well!",Emmanuel Kabenlah Cudjoe
26/07/2014,http://comluv.com/3-free-tools-make-freelancers-life-easier-plus-bonus-free-tools/,3 Free Tools That Make a Freelancer's Life Easier (Plus Bonus Free Tools!) - ComLuv,"If youâ€™re not a freelance worker now, you very well might be in the near future. While full-time work has become scarcer, freelance work has grown in the last few years. Not only that, but according to a recent   (PDF link), freelance wages are on the rise, too. Sounds great, right? Not so fast. Yes, freelancing comes with many benefits. In almost all instances you can work flexible hours. You can work from home, which opens up more opportunities for people lacking the ability to drive. If you have the drive you can find more than one gig and earn even more income.  The catches? For starters, you have to find and pay for your own health insurance plan. In a system that still ties health insurance to employment, this becomes an increasing burden. There is also little job security. When a company hires you full-time, they make an investment. It costs them money if they fire you. Companies can hire and terminate freelancers with few added costs. Companies also donâ€™t pay half of freelancersâ€™ Social Security tax. No one realizes this until theyâ€™re no longer full-time employees.  So yes, freelance wages might be on the rise. But thatâ€™s only to correct for all the added costs freelancers have to bear. Then thereâ€™s the other grim reality for freelancers: getting paid. No, even a half-decent company wonâ€™t stiff you. But there might be a gap between project completion and payment. So even if youâ€™re earning a quality wage, you might run into financial troubles while you wait for a check.  As you might imagine, even with rising wages freelancers still need to be frugal. At the same time, they need certain tools to operate. A computer is a given, but there are plenty of applications that make a freelancing life possible. You can pay a fortune for these tools if youâ€™re not careful. Or you can check out this list of free tools to keep costs down while your bank account builds. If you donâ€™t already have Microsoft Office on your computer, you probably know how much it costs. Youâ€™ve been to the sales page, seen the price, and decided that itâ€™s just a bit too rich for your blood. I imagine that companies, not individuals, pay for the great majority of Office installations. The company that hires you as a freelancer wonâ€™t pay for Office.  Even with Microsoftâ€™s new plans, which cost $150 per year, the cost proves prohibitive. Two yearsâ€™ worth of payments is more than a single Office license. Meanwhile, plenty of people get by just fine with Office 2010. Open Office is one free alternative, but it might not provide everything you need.  Google Drive, formerly Google Docs, provides a viable alternative. You can open Office files within it â€” you can even upload Office docs and spreadsheets. Itâ€™s not quite as powerful, particularly the spreadsheets application. But it gets the job done with a simple interface. Combine that with gigabytes upon gigabytes of file storage, plus a quality suite of mobile apps, and you have a free solution.  You will even find many companies use Google Drive themselves to collaborate. Doing some freelance work for BuzzFeed? They   to coordinate and collaborate. But even if they donâ€™t, you can get plenty of use out of it and avoid the high cost of MS Office. One task freelancers will become familiar with that is foreign to full-time workers: invoicing. In most freelancing situations, if you want to get paid you have to send an invoice. It doesnâ€™t end there, either. In many situations youâ€™ll have to follow up and pester the accounting department to pay you. Itâ€™s not that they donâ€™t want to pay you. Itâ€™s that theyâ€™re disorganized like the rest of us.  To take this one step further: freelancers likely need a total accounting solution. Full-time employees have it easy. They get a paycheck tat Think you can process your checks on a simple spreadsheet? Then consider the tax implications of freelancing. When a company sends you a check, it doesnâ€™t deduct any taxes. That burden is on you. You have to pay the IRS every April 15, though they prefer you pay them every quarter.   offers a free tier solution that can work well for freelancers. It works best for freelancers working for a single company, since the free tier allows you to manage one client. If you need to manage multiple clients, the first paid tier is just $20/month.  Still think you can handle your accounts on a spreadsheet? You can still take care of your invoices using FreshBooksâ€™s  . It lets you send and monitor your invoices. It even notifies you when the recipient has opened it, so you know when to follow up. Just as a heads up, you will get emails selling you on FreshBooks services. Thatâ€™s the price of free, I guess. When you work from home, you become a topic of conversation among friends. Theyâ€™re curious about what that life is like. Most of them canâ€™t imagine life outside an office. At some point, someone will say, â€œI could never do that. Iâ€™m just not disciplined enough.â€ù Let me tell you: when I started freelancing in 2007 I was the least disciplined person I knew. Instead of doing my work Iâ€™d hang out on baseball blogs and look up statistics. Then came deadline, when Iâ€™d have to go to the library just to block out distractions. Work that I could have spread over a 40-hour workweek I did in 20 hours over three days (Friday-Saturday-Sunday). You can imagine that this affected the quality of my work. Most of the time when weâ€™re distracted we donâ€™t even realize it. Just a little bit of awareness can give us that jolt we need. Though Iâ€™m much more disciplined these days, thereâ€™s always room for improvement. I recently installed   on my machine, just to see my actual productivity levels. If I didnâ€™t know better, Iâ€™d have thought I was back in 2007! RescueTime requires some setup. It doesnâ€™t always know which websites are distracting and which are research. (For example, I never visit the Huffington Post unless Iâ€™m looking for information. RescueTime by default classifies it as distracting.) But once it knows your habits, it is brutally honest in its assessment of your behavior. Spending too much time on Twitter? Down goes your productivity score.  Perhaps the greatest aspect of Rescue Time: It lets you know how much time youâ€™ve actually logged. Itâ€™s amazing how much time in a typical eight-hour workday is idle. It might not be totally idle, since everyone has some offline work to do. But seeing only six active hours during an eight-hour day might give you the jolt you need. As will seeing a productivity score in the 70s. No one wants to be a C student.  These tools are the three Iâ€™ve found most helpful in my freelance career. Creation is key, so Google Drive becomes essential absent MS Office. Financial management is more complex as a freelancer than as a full-time employee, so FreshBooks and Free Invoice Creator give you the necessary tools. Discipline? Many full-time workers have never heard of it. RescueTime makes you aware and will turn around your behavior. Plenty of other free tools make life as a freelancer easy. Hereâ€™s a quick list of my absolute favorites. . I would have included this above, but everyone knows about Evernote at this point. Right? Read   if youâ€™re not already hooked on Evernote. You will be once youâ€™re through. . To-do lists donâ€™t work. The mere act of creating a to-do list gives you a sense of accomplishment. Thatâ€™s pretty much the opposite of what you want. Then thereâ€™s the flip side: those to-dos are basically failures. Theyâ€™re unaccomplished goals. Workflowy is a bit different. Instead of creating to-do lists, you create workflows. You can do this in dozens of different ways â€” any way that fits your style.  This is another tool that people have raved about. Set a trigger, using the dozens of integrated apps, and get automated tasks done. It can be a real life saver if you use it to its fullest. . The only thing missing from this is a good mind mapper. Freelancers need a constant stream of ideas. The most effective way to come up with new ideas? Mind map them. Pen and paper work fine, which is why paying for mind mapping software is only worthwhile if you know it provides advantages. Xmind is free for the basic version.",Joe Pawlikowski

These diets prey on people who are in a very vulnerable state and strive to dramatically cut calories or even whole food groups, valuing weight loss over health. What happens is that people lose a few pounds of water weight initially â€“ cut carbs down low enough and youâ€™ll lose a whole lot of water quickly â€“ and then burn some fat and muscle for the next few months until they reach a point where they snap or they just go back to their regular eating habits and regain everything. A healthy diet is a lifestyle choice. It should promote health primarily, and you can adjust it for weight loss by simply cutting some calories. More importantly, it is something that you can stick to for life, not just a quick way to cheat your body into behaving. Here are some simple tips that will enable you to lead a healthy life, so you can both look and feel good. Eat less, but still strive to get all the nutrients you need, and you will lose weight â€“ itâ€™s as simple as that. However, you should lower your calories only a little bit below what the body needs to maintain its current weight, otherwise you will endanger your health. Donâ€™t go more than 500-600 calories bellow  . Vegetables and fruit are full of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber, and generally low on calories. This makes them an excellent choice for virtually everyone. High fiber content helps regulate your bowels and has been shown to significantly  . Foods high in fiber also have a very high satiation value, which means that they make you fool and help you control your appetite. Certain vegetables and most fruit also contain plenty of water, so you can get a good portion of your recommended daily water intake through consuming them instead of forcing yourself to drink more water. Your body needs plenty of water to stay hydrated, and it can actually help burn more fat and fight cellulite. A soda or fruit juice every now and then isnâ€™t all that bad, but these drinks have several drawbacks. They are full of sugar and donâ€™t satiate your hunger at all, which means you get a calorie bomb and still feel the need to eat afterwards. All that sugar sticks to your teeth, which can lead to a rapid tooth decay. Due to their high acidity, fruit juice and soda can also strip the enamel right of your teeth. Dentists warn that it is quite common to see young people with teeth deteriorated to the point where   to restore their oral health. Stick to water, tea and coffee for the most part. Itâ€™s no secret that deep fried food is bad for your health, yet people donâ€™t seem it realize just how bad this kind of food really is. Frying or grilling certain foods on very high temperature creates   within the food, increasing your chance of developing cancer significantly. It has also been linked to heart disease, though some studies refute this claim, and the increased fat intake will make it difficult to lower your calories. When people say that fat is bad for you, that statement isnâ€™t all that accurate. Saturated fats are whatâ€™s bad for you, but even they are perfectly fine if consumed in small amounts. However, unsaturated fats â€“ olive oil, avocado, nuts, fish â€“ can actually be beneficial. About 15-20 percent of your daily calories should consist of healthy fats. In order to stay healthy and fairly fit, you donâ€™t have to do too much, but you have to stick with the lifestyle changes you make for life.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

With your wife pregnant, you will have to take care of all the things necessary for her and the baby, and donâ€™t even think of outsourcing this part of work to the future mother â€“ they should definitely be spared. Making a list would make all of this much easier. You can seek advice from different people, magazines, forums, etc. Ask your wife and try to agree on all the thing the two of you think are necessary. Plus, when you have a list with you, you will realize that you actually have less time than you thought. Donâ€™t wait too long until you start acquiring all the necessities for the little one.

If you want to keep waiting until the baby is born, you shouldnâ€™t â€“ trust me, you will be busy spending time in the hospital with your wife. Plus, if you start buying one thing at the time, the expenses wonâ€™t fall so hard on you.

13/07/2014,http://comluv.com/computer-face/,A Computer on your Face! - ComLuv,"Yes, that is exactly what the Google Glass is. It is a wearable computer that you can mount just like eye glasses and use all the advantages of computing without having to touch or type on it. You know, Iâ€™ve probably been working in the application development industry since the time it was all started ( no I am not old or ancient, just experienced) and still every time something new hits the block, I feel like a teenage boy all over again! Itâ€™s so exciting to have a new piece of technology to work with. I mean, itâ€™s almost like you get to do the whole mind racking creative exercises all over again and create an application masterpiece for the world to uphold and cherish. Well apparently with a design and finish like Google Glass, everyone wants a piece of it. Just like marmite. You either hate it or you love it. There are no middle grounds for it. I mean, on the one hand you will hear about people going all crazy about the glass and associate Google glassware and on the other hand you will be completely shocked by getting reports of Google glass wearers being attacked in public (I know, it was so funny)! So, basically what we are saying is that the Glass is a device with a lot of utility and provided there is a good deal of Google Glass web development handled in the right direction, there is no way that it can go wrong. In fact a lot of experts these days are associating the Glass with a digital personal secretary. With the right glassware to go with your device, your Glass can do just about everything from giving you information about particular things, making notes, giving reminders, taking down minutes of meeting and so on and so forth. Now that the device has rightfully become so popular, it is evident that developers all over the world must be going absolutely crazy over how to develop the next big app which becomes the technological revolution all by itself. Of course, development is a course that is easier said than done. I mean, if you are an entrepreneur who is just going through articles and blogs over the net to find out how you will employ the best developer, then my advice is step back. There is no way any blog or article can tell you what development is really all about. I mean, hello, we sweat and scratch our brains all day and night to come up with multiple ideas of which only one is feasible. But most entrepreneursâ€™ would just put a price on all that effort and give a deadline If you really want your applications to be successful, you have to come to terms with the kind of efforts that are put into developing it. For this reason, make sure that instead of looking for tips to hire a Google glass application developer, you look for articles that will explain the intricacies that are involved in developing a unique and beautiful app. That will help you in understanding the investment behind it is justified or not apart from showing you the nature and scope of your app. Also, you will be able to be realistic about the timelines involved in creating a useful and genuine app. Obviously there is a flip side to everything and not just technology. I mean, I may be a tech fanatic, but I am not as far out as Sheldon Cooper to not be able to admit that even the greatest and the best inventions have flaws. The glass although has one too many: The most irritating thing about any device is the weak battery. I mean, seriously, if you donâ€™t plan on coming home every two hours, itâ€™s going to get kind of impossible for you to use the glass effectively. Basically the glass gets connected to your device via Bluetooth and then it draws the internet from it. So, the battery gets consumed at a rather outrageous rate. Not only is the glass a wearable computer, but it is also in the shape of a normal eye glass. However, the big trouble with the glass is that storing it is enormously difficult. It doesnâ€™t fold in like other eye glasses so; you really have to be wearing all the time. This is actually a little on the funnier side. The controls of the glass are either through voice commands or youâ€™d have to tap your temple! The funny bit here is that the glass (in order to save on battery) tends to sleep very easily, so to spring it back to life you have to keep on tapping at your temple. Well, if you donâ€™t find it funny, ask the person standing in front of you. Whatâ€™s more, if you have been giving commands to your glass, youâ€™d expect it to know when you are speaking and when someone else is. But unfortunately it doesnâ€™t. So if the person standing next to you says loud and clear, chances are heâ€™d take your glass just as easily! No matter how many problems there are with this cool device, none of them are so complicated or big that they can be solved easily with the help of a few minor tweaks which I am sure that Google is working on. However, with some great apps and open minds (for those people who attack glass users) the Google glass is quite honestly set to revolutionize the way we look at technology. And to come to think of it, this is just the beginning. As Google continues to throw automatic cars and other technologically advanced devices, iRobot is just a prediction waiting to happen!",JillElliott

Chances are, youâ€™re going to find someone who is similar to you, but youâ€™re going to work hard if you plan on enjoying every moment of your relationship. You will not learn these things at school, and you can only learn on your mistakes, but there is still some general advice you must adhere to if you want to make the best of it. Talking is an essential part of any relationship, and the more you exchange your opinions and experiences with your partner, the less likely it is that you will have to argue. While a debate can be a nice way to say â€œargumentâ€ù, in essence this is extremely healthy and good for you as a couple. You need to listen to each other, and while presenting your arguments, make sure you are neutral as much as you can. Another important thing is to keep things polite, and as much as you are insulted, or no matter how much pain you feel, never stoop down to a level of a child and resort to name calling or threatening. Listen, understand, process, tell what is bothering you and  . If you lose your head, this can easily turn out of proportions. This is not just another clichÃ© saying, but a real practical one. Try to really dedicate time to  . The better you get to understanding that, the better partner you will become. This is important because then, you will develop a much deeper connection, and you will feel a deeper sense of compassion for your partner, even if you donâ€™t identify with everything you find out. The importance of a good and healthy relationship is also the fact that, while you two become a single entity, you should also dedicate some space and time to being alone, doing the things you like. Sex is important not only as a great way of releasing stress and deepening your love, but also as a way of staying healthy, both physically and mentally. That being said, you should be aware that sex is not the only important aspect of physical love, and simple hand holding can provide the much needed comfort, or a simple kiss on a cheek can provide consolation. Be careful not to idealize sex, or to require that it looks like that what you see on TV, or especially in porn; sex is unique, meaning that it means different things to different people, and it should only be considered as an extension of your love.  , as the bedroom is not a place for taboos, and everything should be talked about in there. Share your fantasies with your partner, you never know if you both might be interested in the same things. Not only should you feel free to tell someone that you love them, as those moments are really precious, but also try and actively dedicate some time that you can spend together. As time goes by, in any relationship, people are developing other interests, children, businesses or hobbies, and all of this can easily make your forget about the important thing, and that is: you need to find the time to spend together, and have those small and precious moments, as they will not always come naturally. You can simply watch a movie, or select a day, every week, when youâ€™ll go out and have a nice dinner together, where no one will interfere or distract you from your partner.  , or go to a spa together where you can get a nice massage. This playful interaction can go a long way, and it will not only make you closer, but it will also enable you to get to know each other a bit better.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Yet, when I was doing research for this article, I found that thereâ€™s apparently no master-list â€“ something that would cover more than, say, 20 techniques. So Iâ€™ve decided to do even more research, gather as many methods as I can, and put them together all in one place. And here it is! I hope youâ€™ll get some cool ideas going through this list. Aka. premium content. The idea is simple (but not necessarily easy). A subscription offer is based on people paying extra to get access to a premium area of your blog. The content youâ€™re providing there shouldnâ€™t be available through any other channels (especially free channels). The technical side is quite easy with plugins such as  . Essentially, there are two paths to blog monetization: passive income and active income. Offering consulting services is probably the most active way of making money possible. The difficult part is building up your expertise and status in the niche before you can reach out to clients. Probably the most straightforward way to make money from a blog is to sell it (on  , for example). Even if youâ€™re struggling to monetize your blog in any other way, some people can still be interested in buying it from you. Not to mention that there are hundreds of entrepreneurs out there who do blog flipping professionally (they buy existing blogs, grow them for a while, sell them, and repeat the process). Depending on your niche, and the level of user engagement on your blog, you might be able to launch a private forum where people have to pay for access. Usually works best in passion-driven niches like weight loss, business, or dating. AdSense needs no introduction. Itâ€™s a widely popular platform used by tens of thousands of sites. And itâ€™s also the easiest way to start making money from your blog (not necessarily the most profitable way, though). All you need is a free AdSense account. The   will take you through the whole setup process. Letâ€™s take a step back for a while. AdSense is a platform where you just sign up, get a piece of code, include it on your site, and from that point on, itâ€™s AdSense that takes care of serving the ads, tracking, and hopefully sending you a check at the end of the month. In comparison, when youâ€™re selling ads yourself, this is all on you. You have to find advertisers, pitch them on the idea of buying ad space from you, and then handle all the other aspects of the transaction. ! With such a volume of posts being published every month (42.6 million), no wonder that some site owners simply canâ€™t handle everything on their own. This is where you can come into the picture. Find your target (the blog you want to write for), reach out with a good proposal and offer your freelance blogging services.   created by the guys at Bidsketch. Note. You donâ€™t have to limit yourself to just blogs. Literally every other website that publishes regular content becomes a possible target for you. Speaking from my own experience, making money this way is often way more attainable than trying to build passive income streams. Freelance blogging was based on monetizing your writing/blogging skills. But thereâ€™s really nothing keeping you from monetizing any other skills you possess. For example, maybe youâ€™re an interior designer who has an interior design blog? You can still get some cool freelance gigs directly through your blog if you just position yourself properly. AdSense is undoubtedly the leader in contextual advertising, but they are not the only player around. So if youâ€™re not happy with their solution, try working with any of these companies:  ,  ,  ,  . The main idea behind affiliate marketing is that other businesses pay you for promoting their products and generating sales. To join the game, you have to pick your network (like  , or  ), select some products, and then promote them through your One way to do it is through strategically placed text links (within your blog posts). This is a more labor-heavy form of affiliate marketing. What you do is write a review of the product you want to promote, and add your affiliate link at the bottom. The idea is that when someone is thinking about purchasing a given product, they often look for some reviews of the product first. So if you get in front of them with your review, thereâ€™s a very good change they will click your link and then buy the thing. Of course, donâ€™t do fake affiliate reviews (ones where you actually havenâ€™t even used the product yourself or even seen it). Amazon is one of the biggest affiliate networks out there. The way you make money with them is very similar to any other network. Just sign up to the Amazon  , grab some links pointing to specific products from their massive store (as an affiliate, you can promote anything thatâ€™s in the store), and then publish them on your blog. This covers posts that you are paid to write, as well as posts that other people send to you and pay for the possibility to have them published on your blog. Usually a good method for sites that have already built a reputation in their niches. Similar to regular sponsored posts, but this time the advertiser buys a sponsorship package for the whole month. As a result, the advertiserâ€™s promotional banner/link is visible under every post on your blog that entire month. This is a very broad category. In its core, itâ€™s based on striking a deal with another blogger to participate   together. It can be an e-book project, some other product launch, software project, or even an agreement where you and your partner refer freelance clients to each other. Honestly, Iâ€™m only putting this on the list out of pure frustration that this is apparently still a viable business model for some bloggers out there. Iâ€™m not a fan, but since itâ€™s an actual thing, on the list it goes! Based on selling information and teaching people how to master a particular skill. Somewhat similar to info products, but e-books have a specific form, presentation, and generally, people have set expectations about what a quality e-book should look like. So whatever you do, donâ€™t just compile a basic Word doc, save it as PDF and call it an e-book. Try preparing something a bit more special. Developing a new piece of software or an app can cost a lot of money, but it is a popular business model regardless. Likely the best way to capitalize on this concept is to create an app that solves a specific pain that your average visitor faces, rather than just creating a   (one where people get easier access to your content). Webinars are the new hot topic these days. For example, one of the more popular podcasters in the business category, John Dumas makes more than $100k a month through webinars. The idea is to get people to a webinar, provide value on a given topic, and then offer the listeners the next step up in a form of a paid product. The method above was about inviting people to a free webinar and then selling hem on your product later on. This is about making the webinar the actual product. Itâ€™s a technique that   has been using successfully since its beginnings. This method was   a while ago byÂ Milica Pantic. The basic idea is this: you land some carefully crafted guest posts on reputable blogs, and then link them to your site, where you have something special waiting for the people coming in â€“ a product thatâ€™s related to the post. Similar to the above, but this time weâ€™re aiming to get freelance clients, instead of product sales. People still love t-shirts, and this isnâ€™t likely to change anytime soon. Besides, these days selling t-shirts is very simple (from a technical point of view). Sign up to   and see for yourself. Although this usually isnâ€™t a possibility for newbie bloggers, it is a possibility nonetheless. You will need a reputation in the niche before you will be able to go after speaking gigs and conference appearances, but once you get in, it tends to pay well. At least according to the people who do it professionally. Because â€_ hey, why not? Tip jars are a fairly common thing on the web. Putting one up on the sidebar of your site costs you nothing, so itâ€™s basically free money, even if all you get is $1 a month. Feel free to comment and share your own ideas for blog monetization.

OK, maybe thatâ€™s a slight exaggeration. Most bloggers wonâ€™t break the law, and those who do probably wonâ€™t get caught. Itâ€™s a foolâ€™s errand to police the entire internet. That doesnâ€™t mean that bloggers are immune from the law, though. If you break the law and   get caught, you could be in for more trouble than you can handle. Itâ€™s best to stay on the straight-and-narrow adn avoid the potential legal issues that can hamper bloggers. Thankfully, there arenâ€™t too many pitfalls. Just follow these tips and you should keep your nose squeaky clean. You learned it very early in your education, and you heard it repeated throughout school: do not copy other peopleâ€™s work without citing them. The even greater lesson: do not pass off someone elseâ€™s work as your own. It seems as though many bloggers pretend they never learned about plagiarism. When people publish content on the web, they own it. Either that, or their publisher owns it. Either way, if you take it without permission, you are stealing. While that might merely result in a not-so-friendly note demanding that you remove the content, it could very well lead to a lawsuit. It could also greatly damage your reputation; wronged bloggers tend to tell everyone about the experience. Sports fans know the line that broadcasters say at some point during the game: Any use of the accounts or descriptions of this game without the express written consent of Major League Baseball is prohibited. Keep that key phrase in mind: express written consent. Get it in writing. Itâ€™s the only way to cover yourself. Just as you cannot take someone elseâ€™s words and publish them on your own website, nor can you publish images that someone else owns. This might seem a little odd. Bloggers use other peopleâ€™s images all the time. Do they get express permission every time? The answer is clearly no, but that doensâ€™t make the practice right. Itâ€™s still stealing, no matter whether you get caught. Given the increasingly powerful tracking tools available, getting caught is more of a certainty these days. If you donâ€™t have permission to use a photo, either in written form from the owner or through a license, you can get sued. Blogger ROni Loren has a   about using photos without permission. Even if you donâ€™t make a dime by using the image, the owner can sue you for damages. You might have credited them thoroughly and linked to the original. It doesnâ€™t matter. The owner can press the issue if he or she so pleases. The solution? You can take advantage of  , a popular option among bloggers. You can write to a photo owner for permission. You can join a stock photo service and gain access to royalty-free Your blog might might sound totally original, but it still might infringe on someoneâ€™s existing trademark. The key to trademark law is not that marks are identical, but rather that they could potentially confuse consumers. Thatâ€™s why you can have Dove chocolate and Dove soap from different companies. You could not, however, start a line of candy bars called Dove, or even Turtle Dove. Thereâ€™s just too much potential for confusion. It can be very difficult to determine whether your blog name infringes on another publicationâ€™s trademarks. Danielle Walker found that out the hard way. Her blog, Against All Grain, seemed perfectly benign. The only issue is that an older company, called Against The Grain, had recently filed a trademark application. You can read about the issue at  . The change didnâ€™t kill Ms. Walkerâ€™s blog, but it did require her to make significant changes. The author of that post, trademark attorney Xavier Morales, has a ton of information on his site,  . Itâ€™s worth a browse even if you donâ€™t intent to register your blog name as a trademark. If you get something for free and write about it, you must disclose that relationship. If you link to a product and make a commission from sales, you have to let your readers know. This actually sounds pretty common sense, right? Yet it wasnâ€™t spelled out clearly until 2009, and wasnâ€™t fully clarified until 2013. If you review products that companies send you for free, or if you make commissions when people click links and buy products, please, read the â€œ â€ù document (itâ€™s a PDF). Or at least read a  . The last thing you want is to fall afoul of the FTCâ€™s guidelines. You could land in serious legal trouble. And trust me, the last entity you want to run afoul of is the federal government. They do not take matters like this lightly, even if you consider yourself small potatoes. The First Amendment might protect your freedom of speech, but you cannot use that freedom to the detriment of others. If you make knowingly false statements about someone, you open yourself up to legal issues. A harmed party could claim defamation of character. This happened a few years ago when blogger Crystal Cox found herself on the  . A jury found her guilty and ruled she must pay the plaintiff $2.5 million in damages. This is a rather extreme case, and not one seen often, but it certainly provides a cautionary tale for bloggers. If you stick to blogging about verified facts and your clearly stated opinions, you will be taking steps to avoid lawsuits like this. In other words: donâ€™t accuse people of things they might not have done. The law is on their side.",Joe Pawlikowski

Hey and welcome to another newsletter. Well I am moving this time because last time I was spinning around in circles and people didnâ€™t like that and to be honest when I looked back on the video it made me a bit dizzy as well. And itâ€™s okay. Now I am moving and I am right over there. Itâ€™s not as nice weather today, but it doesnâ€™t matter because I spent most of the time in front of the computer this week because I will be putting into practice all of those things that I have been learning on the course that I have been doing, you know I told you about that last week. And, I programmed the thing, coded it, it was only a little bit of code for the new system for registering and when people register it will put their password as their user name and then when they log in they will get promoted to changed their password to a more secure and less easy to remember and stuff like that. That has been coded and I have tested that and itâ€™s working so I will put it in over this week and this weekend to make sure that it works properly and then when the news comes in thatâ€™s sorted. Brilliant. But talking about new users. Since I had the sale when the sale ended I havenâ€™t had any sales for like 14 days!. Thatâ€™s the longest itâ€™s ever gone, ever in the entire history of the business of Commentluv. Now I put that down to something that Iâ€™ve changed during that time and one of those is the sales video and the other one is thatâ€™s itâ€™s on a new system. There might have been a little friction with people getting a little confused or whatever and like that. Iâ€™ve switched it back to the original video and I committed myself to making another video that is similar to that one more modern, more up to date with the things you can do with the anti-spam measures and things like that. So thatâ€™s nice, Iâ€™ve got loads more work to do for that kind of situation and well youâ€™re probably used to on this types of newsletters Â and things that people talk about their products. You are used to people The whole point of these newsletters is that you could learn from my mistakes. Especially lately Iâ€™ve made lots of mistakes! , loads, and you wonâ€™t have to spend lots of money learning stuff the hard way and you can do it the easy way for me doing it. You know I hope thatâ€™s okay andÂ  itâ€™ll have to be because thatâ€™s how itâ€™s going to be. All right, now Iâ€™ve told you about the coded thing about the user names and password and thatâ€™s all sorted. Iâ€™ve told you about the sales and things like that. The sales video having to go back to the old one because apparently the new one that I made that I thought was really awesome; isnâ€™t. You know but when in sales always be testing. If you are just going to switch it on and leave it and then you are going to ask for trouble anyways. So itâ€™s all well and good. Itâ€™s all fair and good. Fair and safe here in business and plug-ins. And also if you remember last week or the week before I asked what was your favorite plug-in or premium or your go to premium plug-in. Something that you always install and when you create a new site and stuff like that. I am still interested to hear about that, and you can let me know with the link in this post and/ or you could just reply to an email, this email, this newsletter email. And let me know which is your favorite premium plug-in. What one is the best and if youâ€™ve got time you can also tell me why thatâ€™s the one that you chose. And that will really help me with some of my research that I am doing thatâ€™s applying to the stuff that Iâ€™ve learned in the course that I did from the money I got from the sales. It wasnâ€™t a complete failure. I did make some decent sales, but you know I couldnâ€™t really hope for more because I didnâ€™t do any kind of lead up to it. You canâ€™t just send an email to your own internal list and expect miracles to happen and I really didnâ€™t expect miracles to happen. It would have been nice if it had but whatever I donâ€™t mind this is the way business goes. Sometimes itâ€™s good sometimes itâ€™s bad. And, if itâ€™s bad then you do stuffÂ  to it and you tweak things and keep changing stuff until everything is good and then you become bankrupt, but there is no chance of that because I donâ€™t have loads of property and staff and another extraneous expenses for this plug-in. Itâ€™s just the plugin and the hosting , and the hosting and the graphics or advertisements and the affiliates and the other stuff for that. So not really that much to worry about. Okay, so that is me and that is good bye, and I was trying to say it at the same time. Okay so let me know by replying to this newsletter what your favorite premium plug in is and / or you can do the survey form and you can fill it in there, but if you put in this email address then for sure you will get entered into the contest to win $50, which I think is fair enough.

Prices of median houses increased by 15% last year and in some suburbs it even raised to 27%. As of April 17 of this year home values in Sydney increased by 5.48% as compared to last year according to the RP Data weekly Australian house price update of Macro Business. Unfortunately, along with the improving market comes the rise of gazumping, a practice which is legal but not exactly moral. But, what exactly is gazumping or what does being gazumped mean?   is a practice where a seller offers a property to one buyer or real estate agent at an agreed price and both parties verbally agreed to the sale, however, the seller turns around and sell the same property to another buyer for a higher price before a contract of sale has been executed. And this is a prevalent practice in times where there are more buyers than sellers in the market and there is a stiff competition among buyers. Changing oneâ€™s mind is not a sin, but it becomes inconvenient to the first buyer who either has to put out for the higher cost of the house or lose the house they have set their heart to altogether. This is, if the first buyer is given a chance to equal or maybe even offer a better price than the new price. In Sydney, a property sale is valid only once the sales contracts have been executed, signed by both parties and exchanged. Gazumping usually occurs before In the event that a buyer is gazumped, he cannot expect to be reimbursed for expenses he has already made such as finance application costs, inspection report costs, legal costs and more. However, a gazumped buyer has to be reimbursed for the   he has paid as proof of his good faith and interest to buy. There is no sure way to avoid being gazumped, but a buyer can exercise due diligence to at least protect himself from being a victim of gazumping:",joelmayer

But, if we eat too much of the wrong thing we can gain weight. A healthy body weight is very important to your overall health. Eating healthy doesnâ€™t just mean eating healthy meals, but also includes healthy snacks. Eating healthier can lead to lowering the risk of illnesses like obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. How about kids snacks? If you have children itâ€™s important to get them off to a good start. Offer them healthy snacks instead of junk food. They will thank you later. Coke, Pepsi, Mountain Dew and other soda drinks are very bad, especially for children. They are loaded with sugar and can lead to obesity in children. Here are some of the best healthy snacks: Â  So what else can you do to snack healthy? Â Look at your portion size and avoid oversized portions of food. Enjoy what you have, but consume less of it. Eat until you are satisfied, not full! Keep in mind that calories do count. Many of our old favorite snack foods are high in calories and low in nutritional content. Thatâ€™s not good. Â  Having fresh juice for a snack is a great idea. I have fresh fruit or vegetable juice daily and itâ€™s a healthy choice. I have found when I have a glass of fresh fruit or vegetable juice I donâ€™t crave unhealthy foods. I like adding sparkling water to my fruit juice. It tastes great and is so much healthier than canned soda or fruit juice from the grocery store. So if you havenâ€™t tried juice for a snack you may be missing out. Itâ€™s simple and easy to do.

The truth is, people are living their lives wrong, and arenâ€™t even aware of it. Letâ€™s try to point out some mistakes that a great number of people make while trying to lead a perfectly normal life. Have you ever heard the saying â€œyou are what you eatâ€ù. If you have, what are you then? I donâ€™t think that we should be built from chemicals and food additives, and it seems that it is exactly what most people in the world are trying to accomplish right now, but it is not possible, trust me. A diet of a modern man is full of processed food, sodas, instant microwave junk food, etc. This is not what a human being should eat. There are numerous studies suggesting that this kind of food is not appropriate for the proper development of the human organism, because it mostly contains empty calories, which means that it doesnâ€™t provide important nutrients, essential for oneâ€™s health.   are often linked to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Because of the fat and sugar it contains, this kind of food makes our stomach seem full, but it leaves the body hungry, craving for nutrients. Many people believe that following a well balanced diet is hard and demanding, but that can not be further from the truth. If you would only replace candy with fruits, potato chips with nuts and seeds, hamburger with some grilled lean meat â€“ you would be halfway there. Most people nowadays are going to work by a car, sit in a chair while working and lay in bed while watching TV. This is not all bad if you include some exercise in your daily routine. The human body is meant to be used. We are built for hunting animals with a spear, climbing trees and conquering mountains, and spending all day motionless will make you evolve into a kind of cripple who gets tired when taking the stairs to the second floor. Donâ€™t divide yourself from your true nature. If you exercise three to four times a week, for about an hour,   because the more energy you spend, the more will return to you. It is a fact that people who are in good physical condition have more confidence and are often better at dealing with everyday problems. Running, swimming, pumping iron, whatever you choose is a good choice, just donâ€™t let the chair eat you and spit out an obese, unhappy and sick individual â€“ which you are NOT, believe me. Not going to regular check ups at the doctorâ€™s office now, when medicine is reaching its peak, is more than irresponsible. Some modern illnesses are very hard to spot, because at the early stages, there may be no symptoms at all. You shouldnâ€™t neglect minor health issues, because they can become major in no time. Many people skip going to the doctorâ€™s, and especially the dentist, because they fear them. However, this fear is more than irrational because those  . When dentists are in question, you should be more frightened of the consequences of avoiding the dentist than the dentist himself. Tooth cavities can be the trigger for many other, more serious and even life threatening health issues, which can not be neglected, no matter how hard you try. Donâ€™t let the fear take control over your life and go to the dentist as soon as you notice something bad going on.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

There has been a lot of talk in recent years about some ice caps melting and the climate changing. Letâ€™s face it, whether we like it or not, this is actually quite true, and if you havenâ€™t already changed your ordinary incandescent light bulbs with their energy efficient cousin, then I donâ€™t know what youâ€™re waiting for. Besides buying a TV that has a green energy star mark, there are plenty of ways to stay green that you simply havenâ€™t thought of. Â  We throw away who knows how many billions of plastic bags every year, as they are the most common way of carrying our groceries. All this, if not properly recycled by specialized companies, will only pollute nature. Donâ€™t worry though, nature has a lot of bacteria that can biodegrade any material if given enough time, and nature will decompose plastic in about, well, 450 years. If that doesnâ€™t make you wonder about what youâ€™re doing to your children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren the next time you simply throw away a plastic bottle, then nothing will. Â  Ordinary paint used for our homes, walls or any other kind of decoration, even printing ink can contain a number of dangerous ingredients, including heavy metals, or other toxic organic compounds that will cause ozone destruction or other health problems. All of those are released into the air by simple evaporation, and some traces will be left in the paint when completely dry. Naturally, when buying the next can of paint or ink for your printer,   for you and best for the planet. Â  Â  Not only will this be a great addition Â  If you are about to purchase your new hardwood floor, why not select bamboo? It is really eco-friendly because, simply put, it is a plant where a lot of it can be turned into planks, and it grows quite quickly. Unlike traditional trees which need many, many years (around 100) to properly develop into a full grown tree, bamboo needs around six years. Naturally, when using glues, select the one without formaldehyde, which is dangerous both for you and the environment. Â  Just because you have as much clean, drinkable water as you would like, it does not mean that everyone else in the world has that privilege. This means that you will have to save water as much as you can, take shorter showers, and replace all the faulty faucets which can leak incredible amounts of water each year. When it comes to pipes,  , as this is especially important if your water heater is not so close to your bathroom or kitchen, as a lot of heat is lost when the water is traveling through pipes. Â  Try and contact companies that are sending you catalogues of things you do not want or need. You will save a lot of paper in the process, and you will get rid of unnecessary junk, too. The same thing applies to the bills that you receive via mail. Ask if you can receive them via email, since that will save a lot of paper in the process, not to mention ink and transport. Save paper as much as you can, and when buying any paper products, make sure that they are made from recycled paper.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Hello and welcome to another newsletter. Now this is just on the cusp on the last moments on the sale that I said you could get $52 off with the coupon â€œHELPANDYâ€ù. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ll be able to see this video while the sale is still on, but, you know the sale was for 7 days, and did it do well? Well, it did okay actually. Did I get enough to get a new video editing suite? Well unfortunately, no. I think I was trying to be a little bit cheeky there to get extra stuff out of this sale, but that wasnâ€™t the point to having this sale. The whole point was to see which direction Commentluv needs to go in now, and highlight what things I need to work on, and what things need work, and work through the funnel, and what kind of settings that need tweaking and adapting so that we can go to a new era of the way Commentluv works. Now one of the first things I noticed was the password and the access system that go in through Zaxaa. You get a user name and password for Zaxaa, but then you get another one for Commentluv and how to download the plug-in and all sorts of stuff like that. Now that is okay. Most people got through it okay and they were able to determine what their user name and password is from which email and stuff, but you know even though there is nothing wrong with it I will do something to change that. So my idea is to let everyone have an initial username and password of their email address and thatâ€™s the address that they set up through Zaxaa or through their PayPal or whichever one they use their preferred one that they I will set the username and password to those. Both are the same thing as their email address and that way they could log in. And, as soon as they log in it promotes them to change their password to something else. And, this way they donâ€™t have to wait for emails to come through from my server or if there is some network interruptions. So that will be that sorted as soon as they log in they change their password and everything is hunky dory and they donâ€™t need to wait for anyone before they can log in and go to the members area. Pretty sweet. Iâ€™ve also got some funnel enhancements as well, but luckily it did make a fair few sales. Not as many as I was expecting on the fantastic pipe dream, day dream of thing I had in my head. I would be brilliant if they made 10 squillion dollars. It didnâ€™t make 10 squillion, but it did make enough. More than enough to pay for the email series that Iâ€™ll be having for new members when they come in and existing members will be able to see how they can get that as well. And also, I had enough money to get this course that is being released today about Facebook advertising about identifying audiences and stuff like that. Itâ€™s a good guide and the course is done by a guy. The last course I did with him I made over $50,000 from the results of it. So you know itâ€™s worth having a go at this one as well, and I think investing some money back into the business which is basically me is a good idea because that way when I do go forward with Commentluv then Iâ€™ll know I am going in the right direction rather than just driving off into oblivion and hoping, â€“hoping and crossing my fingers and hoping that it will work. So that does seem like a plan. The sale is going to end today. It didnâ€™t make 10 squillion dollars but it did make a few thousand and so I will be able to use that money wisely. I am not going to spend it on ivory back scratchers!, I am going to go invest it on myself and get some course material and learn how to do somethingâ€™s and stuff that really needs to be learnt how to do so that then I can do it properly rather than just you know throwing loads of stuff into the breeze and which ones lands. You know, itâ€™s not going to be like that anymore. Okay so it was really nice to catch up with you. I havenâ€™t been in your inbox for a couple of weeks while Iâ€™ve been doing the launch or the little money off thing and the little direction seeker that I have been doing with the launch, and I will be coming back into your inbox now, from now on and on a weekly basis it should be.

What we saw was such a creative way of brand promoting that it is simply hard to explain with words. As a business owner, you need to look into the future, having what Felix did in mind. Of course, we do not think that you are able to invest into such an endeavor, and that is why it is important to know that content marketing is not necessarily something that requires enormous amounts of money.              First of all, you will want to find the perfect social network that you will be able to use for that. Naturally, there are many other ways of engaging your customers, but online social media have the biggest audience, and can be extremely cost efficient. When we say social media, names like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Google+ spring to mind, but it doesnâ€™t mean that they are all the same, on the contrary, they all have their own unique advantages and drawbacks. Facebook introduced certain algorithms whose job is to make your life miserableâ€_ no, wait, their job is to determine who is going to see what you post and who is not. Decay over time is also a group of words frequently used. This is all done so that you have to pay in order to get promoted. While this can be an extremely good advertising strategy, it has been widely   Twitter on the other hand, offers a much more limited platform, but what you post there as a brand, everyone will see as soon as you do. Your posts must be relevant, informative, and interesting things. There is no easy way of doing this except that you must follow all the popular trends and use something that is related. Use  , talk about recent sport events, watch Oscars, and give your comments about the newest movie. Look at those  . Remember that not everything that you post has to be made by you. You can easily repost something from other sites (with a link added) if you think that it was related with your company. If you are selling pizza, you can easily mention how olives are good for your health. Try and be proactive, you must go to your customers, you do not need to wait for them to come to you. Go to forums that are related to your area of work, and post there, not by pushing your product, but by being a quality member of that community. Try and have a blog where you can collect all your thought others might find interesting, and this is called Guest Blogging. If that goes well, you might want to try posting on other blogs, so that you can broaden your audience. Remember that the goal is turning your faceless brand into something that has a heart, and what better way of doing that than giving it human features. You want your posts to be  , sarcastic, show that you can be touched by others, and that you too   as the people that follow you. People want a unique experience, and what is a better way than showing that you are not some robot, but a living being, and do not always hide that your job there is to promote your product. People will appreciate honesty. Of course, this can be very demanding and time consuming, which is why you might want to consider  . This market is really ever changing, and if you want to be successful and to stay that way, you will really need to pay attention to all the newest trends. Try and be unique, how exactly will you achieve that is up to you, but you will have to find something that suits you and your business area. Feel free to explore a bit, but just make sure to engage your customers, and they will reward that with loyalty.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

The most important one is how your progeny will live once you are gone. Even though some might think that 40 is not the right time to be thinking about that (there are still many years on your life tab, I know), the reality is that all of that can change in a heartbeat. Fatal illnesses or injuries can leave your loved ones without anything in the world, forcing them into a very difficult situation that can prevent them from achieving their goals in life. One of the ways to prevent this is to put your money into a life insurance policy, which will allow your progeny to enjoy most of the benefits they have enjoyed while you were still alive. However, getting insured is not all that easy. It requires a lot of thinking and you have to be sure that the policy that you are investing in is the right thing for you. Here is some advice on how to choose the right policy. The right choice does not lie with the first insurance agent that approaches you (as much as they would like you to believe so).  , just like any other, and one of its main rules is competition. This means that you could get a better quote somewhere else â€“ you just have to look for it a little. So, before making a decision, make sure to get multiple quotes from more than one source and take a look at all the options and restrictions that can influence your insurance payout. When you are buying a car, there is an option of   who will find the best deal that will suit your needs, and even negotiate the deal for you. The same goes with insurance policies. If you are too busy (or too lazy) to go out and do the research by yourself, you can always hire someone who is adept at those things to help you get the best insurance policy available. However, be cautious, as these services can be even Life insurance premiums (what you pay each month) are calculated according to the state of your health at the time of the purchase ( ). So, when someone who is in perfect health is being quoted for insurance, the rates will be significantly lower then being quoted once you are already seriously ill or on the verge of a chronic disease. However, you do not have to think about life insurance if you have no dependants (because it will be practically useless without someone to leave the money to). How many times have you received a call from someone selling insurance policies? They want to arrange a meeting, tell you all about how great their company is, how great their policies are and how they will make everything work. Today, with the advancement of the Internet, you can completely avoid having any contact with these spammers. There are ways to  . Once you have taken a look at a few quotes, you can make the decision yourself, without anyone rushing you to make a choice and telling you that their company is the best choice there is. However, be aware that these quotes may slightly differ from what an actuary might provide. Whether or not anyone with dependants should get life insurance has only one answer: yes, you should get insured. However, choosing the right insurance policy is something that takes time and deliberation. After all, what use is an insurance policy that has lapsed? Always make sure that you get a policy with premiums that will not encumber your budget to a large extent. You have to keep paying the premiums in order for your dependants to get the payout. So, think carefully about who you give your money to, because, in the end, it is the future of your dependants that you are thinking about.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

13/06/2014,http://comluv.com/avoid-processed-foods/,Why You Should Avoid Processed Foods - ComLuv,"First, letâ€™s define what processed foods are. Generally speaking they are those foods found in stores that have been prepared and stored for consumers. Those products on the inner isle. Products like canned or frozen foods are generally considered processed foods. White bread and even some whole wheat breads are considered processed foods. Condiments like ketchup, barbeque sauce and salad dressings are processed foods and of course fast food establishments serve processed foods. Processed foods are products that have been cooked or altered from their natural state so they can be stored long term resulting in nutrient deficient food. When food is processed, nutrients are lost, including fiber. Some products may be fortified or enriched to compensate for the lost nutrients, but fiber is not always added back to foods and the fortification or enrichment is not as beneficial as the natural whole food. Sodium, added sugars and/or fat may be added during processing. Read the Nutrition Facts Label and Ingredient List when buying processed foods. You may be surprised at the amount of sodium and sugar! Processed foods are linked to obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and other illnesses.Â Food processing may also alter food in ways that might increase the risk of cancer. Many will say, make your own sauces at home. Thatâ€™s great advice, but is it realistic for you? Maybe not. If youâ€™re like me, cutting down and using more healthful alternatives may be a viable solution. If you really love mayonnaise cut back, way back. Iâ€™ve found I donâ€™t need very much. Less is better. Or, check your local health food store for a more healthful alternative. As for ketchup, Iâ€™ve found I really donâ€™t need it. I donâ€™t need the ketchup! Cut back or eliminate it. Your body will thank you. Avoid fast food. You can check the nutrition facts from fast food websites. Hereâ€™s one from  . Fast food is often high in calories, sodium, sugar and fat. Fast food and processed foods are sometimes convenient, but when I remember how unhealthy they are, I stay away from them. E   I donâ€™t consider fresh fruit and vegetable juice to be processed, but technically I guess juicingÂ is. I use fresh fruits and vegetables from the supermarket, or better yet I grown my own. I donâ€™t add anything to my juices unless itâ€™s natural. Iâ€™ve found juicing to be very healthy and it helps me to get more fresh fruits and vegetables into my diet.

But in this modern day of social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, where does this leave the old school journalist, you know the ones, they would leave the office, head to a local event and cover the event live, taking in what was happening, making notes in short hand and then writing it up back at the office ready for the newspaper or news show later. Now things are changing, yes we still do have the side of Journalism where someone will cover the event in person, thatâ€™s how I do it with  , travelling from one place to another to cover music gigs, shows and Comic-Cons, for me personally I make notes on a tablet, even tweeting live from an event with fans or even the artists themselves and then writing the article back at base. But some types of journalists and I say that loosely, have taken the social media side of things that one step further away from the even being at an event, Iâ€™ve seen it happen many times, a message goes out on or about an event, where they are looking for people who have been to tell them all about it and then write an article with snippets and even photos from peoples Social Media of the event. This way, they never have to go to events to see things first hand. May be Iâ€™m a little old school, but for me, if an event is known about and itâ€™s local to the news offices, surely a reporter/journalist should take the time to pop on over to the event and see it for themselves first hand, as I say may be thatâ€™s me, just being a little old school. Itâ€™s something that was inevitable in the digital A busy train station on a early morning, suddenly to everyoneâ€™s surprise a train fails to come to a complete stop and hits the buffers, what happens? People grab their mobile phones, take photos, tweet them out on Twitter with a hash tag and GEO location, which is then picked up by a local newspaper that is looking out for local news, maybe via a set of search terms on Twitter or even via a site such as Banjo, a website that shows you what is happening in your area. Shortly after all this the news is out there, no need for a journalist to get to the scene, photographs are available and the people tweeting have now become the journalists, passing the news around, now all the newspaper etc. has to do is take that information, write a short article, pull in some tweets, even tweet the people on the scene to ask their opinion, interviews taken, job done! I donâ€™t think they are, with the social media constantly being a well of information, someone will need to take that information, condense it and place it an interesting article that will sell newspaper or make an interesting end piece on a news report, but then again arenâ€™t we all know journalists in some way or another. There are still many that will train for their journalism qualifications and will love being part of that old school type that loves to go to the events and take in everything, which is great as it is certainly an ideal way of getting to meet the actual performers for a one on one and may be get that exclusive that others wouldnâ€™t get because they werenâ€™t there at the time. In todayâ€™s world of the blogger, we are all journalists, may be the qualifications arenâ€™t there and you donâ€™t work for a newspaper etc. but, by reporting news on your blog or reviews, you are a journalist, even here in the UK when you apply for a Press Pass, you can select blogger and if the majority of your work is for your blog, such as mine with the film and event reviews, you can get your Press Card for an annual fee.

In todayâ€™s world, people are letting computers and games teach their children, and, somehow, people believe that buying stuff to your kids is good enough and that your job as a parent ends if they are well-fed and happy. So, what are the lessons we are talking about? Well, some things that your parents, your teacher or a friendly neighbor used to tell you. Usually, those tips are not taught in school, or a college, but are, nevertheless, an integral part of being a human being. A good human being, that is. A very important thing is that your kid learns how to recognize good from bad people, and there is one simple way to do that: you should look at how people behave to those who are helpless. Naturally, we are talking about animals, and all the   that are constantly happening to them. Your kid should learn to respect every living creature, and to understand that they live and breathe the same as we do, and although they might not be as intelligent as we are, they have feelings too. This is a simple lesson, and you will need to surround your kid with animals in order for him or her to realize that. Take them to the zoo, or better yet, adopt a pet from a rescue center. Just imagine what people who treat animals in a bad way can do to people. Our whole lives, our dreams and desires guide us, but it is food that gives us raw power. You are what you eat, and you are as healthy as the things that you eat. So, try and show kids that fruits and veggies can be fun, make   salads for them. Explain the concept of vitamins and minerals to them. Junk food is a trap for the young ones, and ourselves too, as we are biologically drawn to fatty and sugary Make sure they become aware of the importance of education. No kid likes to sit around in a classroom all day listening to things they have no real interest in. Make sure you choose a good school that has a nice approach with children. The best thing would be to do a thorough research online. Your kid must understand that learning is a lifelong process, and that it can be boring, but is very important if they want to be good and nice people. All that studying must be accompanied with  . Kids need to enjoy their free time and entertain themselves. It is much better if they do it themselves, without the aid of computer games, but those are  . Nobody likes pain, and nobody likes people who sometimes cause pain. Weâ€™re not talking about bad friends, but about doctors, sometimes even dentists, who are only trying to help us. It is important to take your children to visit a doctor or a dental office when they are healthy, so they get to know them before anything bad happens. Choose a doctor who is nice to children,   who can help you explain what is good and what is bad for your child. Children are inquisitive, and you should try and teach them in a way that they can comprehend. Donâ€™t forget that whenever you try to teach your children, you should also try and learn from them.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Especially in these modern times where life is fast, people donâ€™t sleep regularly, donâ€™t eat regularly, and when they do have time to eat, it is usually a quick bite of unhealthy fast food. A carrier is the most important thing to many people so they spend most of their days working really hard, which causes a lot of stress, and that can lead to many health issues. Today, we will talk about having a healthy lifestyle. This means living your life and enjoying it, but in a right and healthy way. If you want for your body and mind to feel good, you will have to give up a couple of bad habits. Here are some of the things that you should do. The first thing that you need to do is organize your meals regularly and  . It is important to calculate the time between meals equally because this is good for both your metabolism and your stomach. If you feel like it, you can grab an occasional snack in between your meals. Eat a lot of vegetables of various colors; I am saying it like this because every color represents useful vitamins. Avoid drinking alcohol too often as this may cause some serious digestion problems and you will feel tired all the time. It is important to avoid drinking water or any liquid right after a meal. This has negative effects on digestion and may cause troubles with your stomach. Sleeping well is the key to starting your day fresh and rested. If you havenâ€™t slept well, the consequences may affect your working ability, or your appetite in the morning. Studies have shown that seven to nine hours of sleep is best for anyone to feel rested and not to worn out when getting up from bed. If you are forced to sleep under seven hours, than it is advisable that you take a nap of about two hours in the afternoon. Avoid sleeping more than nine hours. Most people make a Â mistake by thinking that the longer they sleep the better they will fell. This is not true. Sleeping too long will make you feel tired and worn out in the â€œmorningâ€ù, and you will not have the will to do anything that you have planned for the day. Brushing your teeth every morning and night from ten to fifteen minutes is very important. If you brush your teeth regularly, they will not go yellow, and you wonâ€™t need to repair them too often. Smoking can cause bad breath and your teeth becoming yellow even if you brush them regularly, so if you want your teeth to look nice â€“ quit smoking.   every year or so. By doing this, you will be able to prevent most teeth related problems before they become unfixable. If you feel any minor pain while eating, donâ€™t be like â€œnah its nothingâ€ù but visit your dentist as soon as possible to avoid having tooth extraction. In order to prevent diseases from developing, it is highly recommended that you do your check-ups at least once a year. Check your blood pressure, hearth pressure, and everything that you feel that maybe isnâ€™t right. To keep your body in shape, it is important to have some sort of physical activity at least twice a week. You can play basketball, football, go to the gym or go running, whichever you prefer. Physical activities clear your body from bad toxins and help you get in shape. It also has a   on the amount of energy you have. It is quite simple, the more energy you spend, the more you will have the next day. I hope this helps you achieve what you need. Organize your schedule in a way so that you can keep up with the things that I have told you. If you honor these pieces of advice, I guarantee that you will have no health problems in the near future.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Collaboration is founded principally on effective communication. And while email is an effective communication tool, it is not necessarily the best collaborative tool to grace the world of work.

30/05/2014,http://comluv.com/yahoo-changed-policy-emails-using-services-like-mandrill/,Yahoo changed its policy for emails using services like Mandrill - ComLuv,"Yahoo changed its DMARC policy for emails sent via third-party services. If you send customerâ€™s emails via third-party services like  , then this affects you. Letâ€™s start by looking at transactional emails. A transactional email is a one-to-one email of some kind. You can contrast them with one-to-many emails such as newsletters that businesses send out to people on their email lists. There are all kinds of transactional â€˜one-to-oneâ€™ emails. Some examples are the email that is sent when someone signs up to a service or the email that confirms when an online order has been placed. If all your emails go from your own domain address, then no problem. But if you allow customers to send emails via your service and you use their email addresses as the â€˜sent-fromâ€™, then this concerns you. A company that sends emails as part of its business could send emails from the email servers on its own web host. The problem is that the recipients reply, the company wouldnâ€™t know whether the emails reach their destination. Did they bounce? Were they marked as spam? Were they rejected by the recipientsâ€™ servers? Thatâ€™s where   come in. Transactional email services have methods of checking whether the emails are delivered or bounced, whether they are marked as spam, or whether they are rejected. And thatâ€™s the reason that a lot of businesses route their emails via transactional email services like Mandrill. Mandrill is a transactional email service with hundreds of thousands of customers. It is efficient and fast. Two weeks ago Yahoo changed its policy. It now prohibits third-party services (like Mandrill) from sending emails on behalf of Yahoo email addresses. In other words, Yahooâ€™s new policy is that Yahoo emails can only go direct from Yahooâ€™s web servers to the recipient. Any Yahoo emails that are routed via non-Yahoo servers are not allowed to get through because Yahoo tells the receiving domains to reject them   they did not travel directly from Yahooâ€™s servers. Itâ€™s a bit like a message on a letter telling the person who receives it to refuse to accept it. The technical way that Yahoo sends this instruction is through its Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance policy (DMARC). It is a code attached to an email that tells the receiving domain what to do with messages that did not travel direct from its servers to the recipient. We donâ€™t know for sure the reason behind Yahooâ€™s new policy, but Mandrill wrote on their blog about why they think Yahoo has made the change: That speculation may well be correct because Yahoo is a known target for phishing attacks. Mandrillâ€™s recommendation is:",David
29/05/2014,http://comluv.com/blog-got-10k-page-views-first-month/,How My Blog Got 10k Page Views In Its First Month - ComLuv,"On March 2nd I launched my business blog, and in its first 30 days (March 2 â€“ April 1) it got over 10k page views. Most people start their blog with a whimper, but if you plan your launch right, there is no reason you canâ€™t have an audience ready and waiting. Hereâ€™s how. A lot of people just launch things or start a blog without any regard to the strategy behind it. This is a huge mistake. You have to launch with a purpose. I had been thinking about my launch for the better part of a year and seriously planning and prepping it for 3 months. It allowed me time to research my target audience, get some great content together on important subjects, make sure all the bugs were fixed on my website, and drop hints with influencers along the way. Additionally, you are going to want to launch with at least 20 articles to fill up the blog. When people come on day 1 they are going to want to click around and see whatâ€™s available. I had the articles written and published in their respective categories so the blog was filled out. When you are launching something so big (like an entire blog with 20+ articles, it helps to have something serve as your main focus For me, I created a mega detailed guide called   which, at least in its niche, is the most comprehensive free guide youâ€™ll find. Now, I donâ€™t want to be pegged as the make money online guy and there are much more important topics I want to discuss BUT creating that guide allowed me to focus people during your outreach and say hey look, I just launched this blog and it includes this awesome guide, come check it out and if youâ€™re looking for something to share, well, that guide is definitely worth it. As a result, I was able to get awesome shares from people like Spencer of Niche Pursuits It also doubles as a newsletter teaser (despite it being free right there), which helped me capture 60 subscribers in my first month. Read any expert round up about blogging success and half of them will say you need to connect with influencers. I just launched this blog, but Iâ€™ve been working online now for 1.5 years so Iâ€™ve connected with a good amount of people in and out of my niche.              Similarly I created an ultimate business resource guide and featured a ton of articles from major influencers. I have found if you are polite and not uber aggressive, then, with proper cause, the big guys will step up and share your stuff. After the launch dies down, and inevitably, it will, you have to find a way to reignite the fire. For me, that was with a  , which gets 100kâ€™s of pageviews a month. This guest post was a huge hit and sent over 500 visitors to my blog in my first month, and was key for me getting over the hump and hitting that 10k mark. Additionally, it reminds everyone you just told that you are here to stay and are someone worth following. Promotion is a never ending job. That entire month (and really, even now, everyday), I look for new people whoâ€™s work I admire and connect with them through an email or tweet. In doing so Iâ€™ve gotten a lot of free shares, guest post invites, podcast invites, and a spot in magazine! Itâ€™s all about hitting the trenches.",dave schneider

However, if youâ€™re like me (at least, the former me), youâ€™d simply put an opt-in form (with an annoying product to induce your list) and once someone signs up â€“ you simply start barging them with affiliate links â€“ even from the very first welcome mail! Fail! â€“ Then fail again!! Let me tell you something about human psychology: nobody loves being sold to â€“ though we all must buy in order to live! If you must sell therefore, you must make that fact subtle enough â€“ or else, youâ€™re sunk! So, how do you tackle that â€“ especially in the light of the new laws of affiliate marketing? The first new law of affiliate marketing is that if you run a site that isnâ€™t highly targeted, youâ€™re better off choosing a different monetization approach! This is because; the offers you are sending to your list should be what will interest them. If you are running an authority site and simply delight in sending mass messages to your list, what you should consider is that someone However, if you blog about dog management, all your offers should interest your list (if not now, in future!) The first law of affiliate marketing is thus: go niche or be content with abysmal results! This is quite a silly policyâ€_many bloggers make the mistake of making all communications with their list a pitch! Itâ€™s either â€˜buyâ€™ this or â€˜purchase that!!â€™ Now, your list did not subscribe to make purchases and make you money â€“ it subscribed because it imagined that value was to be gained through such an act!! What would be a great option for you will thus be to make sure that you actually send other information that is critical for progress of your list and sparingly offer your affiliate links! Second law of affiliate marketing: keep the pitch frequency low â€“ real low. Your list should feel special being part of the numerous subscribers you have. To ensure this, always make sure that you give your list special treatment: an occasional free eBook, a post that does not appear on your regular blog or make sure that the offers you give cannot be found anywhere else on the internet! Why would your list ignore your offers if you have all these in place? The last law of affiliate marketing is simple: give offers that cannot be found anywhere on the internet! What actually keeps your list is what you consistently offer not what you induce them with. It may amaze you that many subscribers actually only subscribe to your list for the inducement â€“ and once Itâ€™s got, simply unsubscribeâ€_learn the rules and make money the affiliate way.

25/05/2014,http://comluv.com/6-great-activities-childrens-birthday-party/,6 great activities for a childrenâ€™s birthday party - ComLuv,"Throwing a birthday party for your child is sometimes more difficult than it appears to be. As children grow, they become more demanding because they create their own value system of what they consider amusing and, on the other hand, boring. Insisting to be a supervisor of a party the whole time may not be a great idea â€“ your childâ€™s guests could feel a bit too observed, so they wonâ€™t feel free to play like they usually would. But, checking up on them now and then, and encouraging them to have fun with suggesting an interesting activity usually turns out to be a great idea. Check out these six interactive activities your child and its guests will love. You know how children are always interested in whatâ€™s going on in the kitchen? Well, at least until they grow up a bit and start avoiding all possible chores and responsibilities. But, before all that happens, when they are sevenish or so, you can gather their full attention in the kitchen and  . Sure, itâ€™s going to be a bit messy and loud, but you can avoid all unwanted hazards with just keeping them away from your oven. You can even turn it into a competition, and give a symbolic reward to the kid who bakes the most interesting cookie. How many times have you tried to turn your child away from drawing on a wall in your home? Of course, you donâ€™t really have to allow your child and its friends to turn your wall into their master-piece â€“ you can simply stretch a type of canvas or a thick paper over your wall. If you decide to try out this child activity, have no doubt that itâ€™ll be the most fun activity your child and its guest will have, but you may want to consider protecting (or removing) your furniture from the new painting room. Children in general canâ€™t resist   â€“ it has a mysterious touch that they find fascinating. Just imagine how thrilled everyone would be if you gave them a pirate map that looks old (you can manage that with just a thin If youâ€™re ready to deal with some extensive noise, this is the perfect game for your childâ€™s birthday party. All you need is a ton of balloons and some post-it papers. The plot is in the notes written on those papers â€“ you can write a type of reward on each of them, and simply wait until all balloons are popped and just give out the rewards when theyâ€™re done. You can always use candy, but if youâ€™re ready to invest a bit more money into this game, you should know that toys are always a great idea. If you stack up with some skin-friendly paints, youâ€™ve just made it in throwing the best childrenâ€™s party ever! Let them explore for themselves, and youâ€™ll be able to see that a childâ€™s imagination is truly unlimited. After theyâ€™re finally finished, you should ask them what character they wanted to become, and believe me that youâ€™ll hear the most amazing answers. This game is pretty simple and thereâ€™s no age limit â€“ even adults find it interesting. Write down a number of characters on paper, pair them up (make sure thereâ€™s an even number of children so you can avoid an uncomfortable situation) and give them a few pointers, like what questions they should ask in order to find out which character their partner is pretending to be. Each of this activities  , but you probably already have most of them at home. Other than this, you should consider adding a surprise at the end of your childâ€™s party, like a gift-bag. It doesnâ€™t have to be something pricey â€“ again, candy will do just fine. But if you want to go a step further, you can get the bags with popular characters printed on them â€“ your childâ€™s guests will be more than happy because of the bag, so anything you put in it will be like a second gift to them.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Hey and welcome to another newsletter and itâ€™s going to be a short one this week and I am not out and about walking and talking because you know Iâ€™ve got busy things. Iâ€™ve got stuff to do; I have an afternoon nap later and stuff like that. But let me just tell you, this week, next week I wonâ€™t be appearing in your inbox because my friend from London is coming up and we are going to spend a week doing some silly stuff, mostly playing Xbox. But, Tom sent me an email asking me about, well heâ€™s not the only one loads of people of other people have sent me email saying about how do I make that walk and talk video? How do I get it to look like its being filmed on an expensive steady cam. Youâ€™ve seen the ones where they make proper movies from and it stops all the jiggity jiggity. And other people have asked me do you have a pauperize following you? And I was like â€˜Noâ€™, but I would like to be a famous enough to have a pauperize, and other people think Iâ€™ve got a crew or someone is following me or walking backwards with a camera. And how do I make it look so smooth and stuff like that. And basically Iâ€™ve got a stick that I straighten out on a telescopic mono pod and a camera on the end. And my mate what he is going to be able to do when he comes up is he is going to be able to film me while I am filming myself because I canâ€™t do both at the same time, and from that I will be able to do a little tutorial video for exactly how I do the walk and talk, and how to make it smooth and how to use the extra features Itâ€™s really quite cleaver and itâ€™s quite easy and itâ€™s really quite quick. So within a few weeks I will be able to really start and you will be able to watch that and make your own walk and talk video. I would love to be able to see some of your stuff. Next weâ€™ve got the promo video and I am not asking for more feedback because I have spent so much time on this promo video now. I listened to the first lot of feedback and I am putting it all together in my editing app and I am putting sound tracks to it, Iâ€™ve got a Morgan Freeman voice over and Iâ€™ve got loads of little screen shots, screen saves, and screen grabs that I am going to put in there as well. So hopefully that will explain what the plug-in sort of does. And after that, I have got to send all of those suggestions from you about what you would like to be taught when you were a new blogger or what advice would you give, and I will be sending that to the writer, and the writer will be dealing with that and we will be having a little chin wag and stuff and feedback. And that will be given back to me sometime next month sometime. So you know things are moving on and itâ€™s going really nice, but I think I might need another nap or 2 before thatâ€™s all done, but definitely I want to say thanks very much for watching these videos and giving me the comments and all the feedback and all the support I got on the Facebook page, on twitter, on the blog, on the board tickets, on the email. All of that stuff, I do read every single one of your suggestions and your comments and your emails and I love to hear from people. I read every single email. I canâ€™t always rely, and I canâ€™t always get feedback immediately to you, but I definitely really love to get all these emails and the support, and all the questions as well because now I get to answer you. And things like Tom asking for you know how I make the videos and the other people that have asked and now I get to show you. So thatâ€™s coming in a few weeks the videos coming and I might be able to give you a secret preview of the promo video in a couple weeks after I have had my week off. And Iâ€™ve got to see what else is coming up. Oh Iâ€™ve got to award the prize to the best suggestion for the best subject. I will do that in a few weeks as well because there are some really good suggestions, and I am loving that. That means I donâ€™t have to think of them either. Brilliant, all of this stuff has just been done for me. Iâ€™ve only have got to pay thousands of dollars to get it made. Thanks very much for that and I will see you in a couple of weeks.",andy

Youâ€™re visionaries! When the human species first begins colonizing Mars, weâ€™ll be almost entirely dependent on hydroponic gardening. Why? Because weâ€™ll be doing all the growing indoors in smaller highly controlled environments where the temperature, humidity, water, CO2, air circulation, and other climatic conditions are kept in check. Once we terraform the red planet into something more similar to earth, then we can talk about conventional outdoor soil gardens. Letâ€™s talk about the conditions of your hydroponic grow space. These are rules of thumb to grow by. Learn them. Love them. Your yields depend on it. Letâ€™s move on to choosing your first setup. As you might have guessed, the modern world is undergoing a hydroponic revolution. The different kits and equipment you can get these days are absolutely staggering. The potential accessories in the setup stage alone will melt your mind. Then thereâ€™s all the complexity that comes along with every other These go way back. Itâ€™s the most basic approach to hydroponics and a great touch-off point for the nobbishly inclined. After you setup your first wick system, youâ€™ll grasp the foundational concept of hydroponic gardening. From there you can move on to more complex systems. The team at HorticultureResource.com summed it up nicely: You need to avoid all the nastiness out there in the mainstream hydroponics industry. Many of the heavily marketed solutions are filled with refined, highly-processed ingredients. Itâ€™s still not easy or all that cheap to find â€œorganicâ€ù hydroponic solutions, but theyâ€™re out there and you can find them online if you do your homework. Hereâ€™s a quote from UrbanFarmOnline: With hydroponics, the plant can transfer all the energy it would have used in developing an extensive root network into providing better yields and quality crop. Hereâ€™s another good thing about soil-less gardening: it is   messy than traditional growing. If youâ€™re going to have a lot of plants in a small space then hydroponics, coupled with   is your best bet. There, that should be enough to get you thinking about your grow space, the types of containers youâ€™ll need, how much yield youâ€™re interested in and how to get your hands on proper solutions and mediums.

Some of them were passing fads, while others were more enduring and are very active even today. One of the more persevering sub-cultures is the Biker culture around which a lot of unjust stereotypes have developed over the years. One of the primary ways bikers network  . They basically started out as groups of people interested in motorcycles but from there, they expanded into so much more. These daysâ€™ motorcycle clubs are serious organizations which setup rallies, charities, sponsor sporting events and a lot more. They have annual fees which they use to fund these efforts and have a set hierarchy. They can be divided into several groups: AMA ( ) is the largest organization of this kind in the US but what I find more interesting is the part of this culture that chooses to stay off the radar, the so called â€œOutlawsâ€ù. This term should not be taken literally, and it often is, because it merely shows that a certain motor cycle member abides by the old biker philosophy that was started in the 1950s in the United States. This philosophy included and still includes a strong disrespect for authority and conformity promoting the freedom of the open road. They promote this independence by sewing MC into their riding jackets. While popular biker groups and motorcycle The traditional biker apparel stems from their riding clothes which include leather which protects them if they fall, sunglasses to protect their eyes on sunny days and some other clothing details include various scarves and bandannas, boots and accessories like piercings, rings, etc. In most cases, things that make up the biker style stem from practical things so try not to overdo it. Typically, bikers are rock and metal fans but not exclusively. In all honesty, most of the music associated with biker culture has  . Some of the bands that are known as â€œbiker musicâ€ù are Motorhead, Ac/Dc, Steppenwolf but in true biker spirit, bikers listen to whatever they want. Bikers have a bad image with the general public but contrary to popular belief, they are actually very socially aware people. Motorcycle clubs are patrons of many humanitarian events; they strive to spread awareness about safe riding and safe traffic in general, by organizing toy runs. Itâ€™s one thing to read about the biker spirit but the only way to learn what it means to be a biker is to sit on your motorcycle and ride.  , make a plan and start following the road.

Hey and welcome to another newsletter. I am not out and about walking along the canals today because the weather is not so great and also my leg is not so great too, but I am sitting next to the cabbage. Next to them growing. I am really proud of them they are looking lovely. I will give you a tour of them one day. Now Iâ€™ve got 4 things to mention in this video. Iâ€™ve got personal assistant, Iâ€™ve got more subjects for the ten email series from an expert. Iâ€™ve got that changes to the sales video that I have done, and the contest. So first thing the personal assistant. Now Iâ€™ve heard and Iâ€™ve read all before from other entrepreneurs or business owners or successful people like that and they say â€˜what is the biggest thing you regret?â€™ And quite a few times Iâ€™ve seen people say that you know â€˜I regret not getting someone to do it for me, I tried to do everything myself, I was a control freakâ€™, and that was the main stopper to their growth and they found that when they started employing people to do the things that they could do repetitive task then they were able to do more stuff generate an income or give ideas and you know more use of their time. Now I can see their point because I am starting to bring on people that are paid to do a certain number of things for me, and I can see their point about that being a stopper to them growing their business because you know, if they spent all day trying to edit a video that could be done by someone for $10 an hour than they are not doing stuff that is earning them big money. So really I could see their point about that, but also on the other side of the coin I can see that advantage of doing everything yourself. I am quite technically capable. You could say I am a proper geek, nerd guy! And so, doing all of these different things for the business it was never a problem for me and in fact in the beginning I didnâ€™t even know it was going to be a business. And so, I had no choice but to do, if I wanted it done I did it myself, and I have become used to that. And that advantage to that is that when you get a bit of news that can affect your business like â€œby the way here youâ€™ve got a chronic conditionâ€ù.Then I am free to put the business not on hold, but put it on go slow for a little while because I donâ€™t have any obligational requirement to make sure the people that I am employing have enough work to do so I donâ€™t have to sack them. Which is kind of how my Bricks and Mortar Business with my Mrs. and the Chinese take away. Weâ€™re to have a certain element and level of business to be able to pay the staff that make the business happen, and if we donâ€™t have enough business to pay that staff weâ€™ve got to find that money from somewhere. So there is an added bit of pressure, and pressure is not what I need when Iâ€™ve got this condition because it does funny things to me Iâ€™ll tell you!. But that being said I am bringing on someone Okay the second thing I want to bring up is Sales video.Â  I donâ€™t know if I said that secondly in the beginning but the sales video. I am being quite disabled this week, but I have done a lot for some source of music for the video so it goes corporate then sad, then corporate, and then happy, and then corporate. That kind of thing, which is a difficult thing to do actually when you are browsing through these music files you think â€˜oh that will work, or that would workâ€™ and so on. Oh itâ€™s a bloody nightmare. Next weâ€™ve got the suggestions for you know emails from an expert and so I want more suggestionsÂ  because Iâ€™ve gotÂ  another week now to accumulate all suggestions and choose the best ones and send them off to the writer, and the writer will get them done and we will have a little feedback and chin wags about it. And then I will be able to put it into the system for new members. And so, if youâ€™ve got a suggestion itâ€™s basically now you are an experience blogger (if you are) what advice would you give to yourself in the past?, what would you say to yourself just to make blogging a little bit easier on you or less time consuming or less worrying and stuff like that. Or what would you like to have been told by an expert when you first started blogging. What would have made your blogging life easier? So send me an email, send me a support ticket, send me a response on the YouTube video, and send me a comment on the blog post. I will choose all the best ones. I will get 10 of them, send them off to the writer, and the person with best suggestion wins $100, which I shall pay next month sometimes and let everybody know what they won and what they said and what they suggested and all that kind of stuff. Talk of wining, the contest is going really well so the last one been claimed, the one before that has been claimed. So check the blog post on Comluv.com for this newsletter and then you can see who won the premium license and this is a life time license as well so they always get constant updates as well as when I have released them as well instead of having to pay a recurring fee. The way that you can enter this contest is just use Commentluv, not even Commentluv premium, just use Commentluv and get some comments. More than one comment on your blog to get some Commentluv and I will get to know about that when the stats get updated every couple of weeks and then I will choose people that are using the latest version that got a comment and I will award them a life time premium license. Now if that one person is a premium member then they get a license to give away on their blog for anyone else, it is transferable. All right, come to the blog and see who won. Send me suggestions for what you would like to be advised about blogging when you first started blogging and cross your fingers for Adnan who is going to be processing this video and transcribing it, and turning it into a blog post and newsletter. Hopefully I have done all the videos and the updates and put down the steps and set the column in the boards in the cards in trello that I can follow the which aspect he is doing and can follow along like that. If you are interested there is this thing called trello and I just mentioned it before.

But it will not be useful if you getÂ crappy visitors whoÂ havenâ€™t found anything useful and interesting on your blog. So you have to catch their attention with substantial content from the very first second. Ok, I guess the intro is enough. Now I will head over straight to the topic. The main reason, why most bloggers fails with blogging is that they are not paying much attention to their  . You are not writing for robots, so your article has to be clean and easy to read. If you require to be Â successful, you have to be original and give your loyal readers something, what they canâ€™t get elsewhere. Thatâ€™s why they are coming to your blog. They expect something from you. Moreover when they offer and help them they begin to respect you. The   I strongly believe, that you have seen many such websites, where is no life. This is because those blog owners are not trying to create a community around their blogsâ€_  When you make connections with your readers, then they are more likely to share, what you are writing about, thatÂ means more traffic and more loyal readersÂ to your blog. Personally I check my fellow bloggerâ€™s blog plenty of times a day, expecting new updates.  Try to include your readers in the conversation. Ask them a question and share their opinion. This is useful for both of you â€“ your readers can feel their importance to you and on the other side you can get cool Â ideas. You should also answer to the comments on your blog, especially, There are many bloggers, who always emphasize that you have to post at least few posts a week or even more. Thatâ€™s OK. Â  Think of writing a long insightful blog postsÂ rather than small crappy posts that will neither benefit or readers. In my opinion,   than quantity. Itâ€™s better not toÂ write anything at all, till you find something interesting with your readers. You should write which people would love to hear and is beneficial to readers. You should know the fact, your headline is one of the most important partsÂ in your blog post.Â When visitors come across your blog in SERPs the major driving force is blog title. Your blog title decides whether the user will be a reader or not. So, it should be as much short and clearÂ as it can. Your headline has to attractÂ visitorsâ€™ Â from the very first moment. Your headline should say:  Have in mind that your headline will appear not only on your blog. Your headline will be visible in search engines (that means more or less search engine traffic, in feed, on other websites and forums. Search engines limit the characters used in blog titles to 56 characters. Â Thatâ€™s why it is so important to keep blog title short, clear to get their attention from the very first moment. Ask yourself, What type of traffic do you really need? Is it enough to get many useless visitors or is it better to get few loyalÂ readers. Loyal ReadersÂ will follow everything you are doing. When they feel respect for you, than they are more likely to support you, share or even buy a product from you. Thatâ€™s the real READERSHIP! Having a blog is not all only about writing articles and sharing your experience â€“ it is all about creating a community and building loyal readers.",Akshay Hallur

Now onward, when people use  , all they have to do is click on the clock icon that can be seen in the corner of the screen and this icon will allow them to explore areas and roads in almost any part of the globe. Once this new icon is clicked on by the users, a scrollbar will be presented, which can be moved for changing the season and also the year of the building or area they are viewing to show what changes have been brought to it over time.

Depending on the filter type, these may need to be either replaced or cleaned.Â  The cleaning or replacing of the filters is a very simple task that is all too often overlooked.Â  Dirty filters will restrict airflow and drastically reduce the efficiency and performance of your air conditioner.Â  Most filters can be cleaned with a mild detergent and warm water. Â Dry the filters before re-fitting them to the unit. Your air conditioner doesnâ€™t just cool your home down, it also reduces humidity levels.Â  Moisture from the conditioned space is collected in a drain pan and then drained away.Â  A drain not flowing freely will promote mould growth.Â  If your drain is all blocked up it will end up leaking.Â  Check/clean the drain with at least a liter of warm Like the indoor unit, it is important that the condensing unit is kept free of obstructions for optimal performance.Â  The condensing unit is the heart of your air conditioning system, so it is important to keep it in tip top condition.Â  Clear any leaves and debris from around the unit that may be restricting airflow and remove any plant growth.Â  Check that the unit is sitting level and that any the footings are solid.Â  If the coil looks particularly dirty, isolate the power supply and wash down with a mild detergent and the garden hose.

10/05/2014,http://comluv.com/bright-future-seen-international-student-industry/,A Bright Future Seen for the International Student Industry - ComLuv,"The number of full-paying international students for 2013 of 526,932 represents a 2.6% increase in enrollment compared to 2012. However, this is still a long way to go to the 7% annual growth rate of 7% that Australia has to attain if it wants to maintain its share of the international student market. In fact the 2.6% increase in 2013 is still very much below the average annual growth rate of 5.9% over the last 10 years. According to an Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) report, after several good years that peaked in 2009, in the years 2010 through 2012 there was a sharp decline in the enrollment of international students in the country. This drop in enrollment was attributed to the following factors, among others: As noted in both the ABS and the   (AEI) reports, the nationalities whose numbers declined considerably were from India, China, Nepal, and Pakistan among others. In fact the top 10 contributor countries which include these four countries had a 9.1% accumulated decrease in enrollment. The sector that was greatly affected by this decrease in enrollment was the Vocational Education and Training (VET) which comprise 25.6% of total international student enrollment. VET showed a 6.4% decline in enrollment in 2012. VET enrollment is mostly from India, China and South Korea. The outcome of the  which was released last 29 October 2013 by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection is seen to boost the international student industry. The recommendations on the report were hailed by educational institutions and   providers as a move towards progress. The report embodies recommendations that will simplify the Assessment Level (AL) Framework for student visas starting March 22, 2014. The recommendations that are seen to impact significantly in the prospective increase in the number of international students in Australia are: Benefited by this recommendation are former AL4 applicants. There are no known applicants for the AL5 level. AL4 visa applicants will now be elevated to the AL3 level. This means that the level of evidence for financial capacity, English language proficiency and previous study that they are required to provide will be reduced. This also means the removal of the English language test which is a requirement for English language study of AL4 and English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) visa applicants. For AL3 level visa applicants, the financial requirement of 18 months was reduced to 12 months. This brings Australiaâ€™s financial requirement for international student visa in conformity with those of major competitor countries. Enrollment to VET and English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) is expected to increase considerably because of these two changes. Students from India, China, Pakistan, Nepal and more comprise a large majority of enrollment to VET and ELICOS courses. They were formerly in the AL4 level, but with the upgrade and the reduction of financial requirement they will now have a better chance to gain entry to the Australian educational system.",joelmayer

God bimmie itâ€™s just got a bit windy now, god blimmie governor. Anyway, I have some points to make. I have a fail, then from that fail a nearer success I donâ€™t know yet, and then something else that you could help me out with. So listen out to the end because I will be asking you to help me with something. And also a little hint, a little allusion to something that Iâ€™ve got going on with Commentluv premium or especially with new people that are coming into Commentluv premium. First thing is a bit of a fail. Remember the last week I was talking about making a video and then doing some sort of voice impression or something like Morgan Freeman to narrate a story or something like that. And then well I did do something about like that, and Iâ€™ve got a guy, got a voice over artiste to have a look at some lines of script and stuff and he was going to say these lines and then I was going to match him up to the video and it is going to look brilliant. Well, in my mindâ€™s eye anyway. But I didnâ€™t because it sounded too robotic. It sounded exactly like Morgan Freeman, because it was all separate sentences. You know. Just say one sentence than pause, then say another sentence then pause. Now originally I thought it was a good idea to match the video up to the words or match the words to the video; to the timing of the video. But, the best videos are ever made Iâ€™ve done the opposite. Iâ€™ve got the audio sorted, and then got the video to match fully with the audio and that worked sweet. I donâ€™t know what I was thinking about doing this. But anyway, I spent money on it and the guy did it, he did a good job. He did as exactly what I asked him to do, but it didnâ€™t turn out very nice. You know too robotic. (robotic voice) Say hello to Mary. Mary is very sad. Mary isâ€_ You know I canâ€™t do it like that. So something good came out of it though because I actually sat down and I wrote a proper story. You know a script and it brought up 3 main pain points of people that are starting to blog or just getting established on a blog. And then the solution for to those things, and then Iâ€™ve left the demo part of it to speak for itself. You know because then I could put up flashpoints to point out particular things and those could change. You see because If Iâ€™ve got some guy narrating the whole thing, all the features, and the benefits and stuff, in the future when thereâ€™s more features, more benefits then Iâ€™ll have to pay the guy to repeat what he did, but with the new benefits and the new features. If you know what I mean, so now Iâ€™ve got a more generic script that I can use and sorted mate. Okay now the bit that you can help me with is also is integrated Do you listen to the people in the â€œWarrior Forumâ€ù? Do you listen to the people that say â€˜they are blog expertsâ€™ and stuff? So I am paying thousands of dollars to a blogging expert; who is just bloody brilliant by the way. And they are going to write a series of 10 emails that will welcome in someone that has just bought the plugin and show them the first steps. They are like mini courses if you will and written by a proper good expert. I donâ€™t want to release the details yet because it isnâ€™t fully committed, not all the parties have fully signed off on it. But you gonna love it! It is really brilliant. Well actually, I have to do some Shenanigans there so for existing members can get access to it, but this is a real added value thing that Iâ€™m adding to it. I wanted to do this ages and ages ago, and then I couldnâ€™t because sales werenâ€™t up cause I was sick, and I was like â€œPoor meâ€ù. And I couldnâ€™t make loads of sales and do promotions and stuff. Then I put the idea on the back shelf. But now that I am gearing up for another kind of mini launch and re-launch type of affair where I am able to work on few hours a day during the week you know, regardless of my condition because of the good medication that I am on. And while I am here, I thought I would reinvent that idea and I will ask that person, â€œAre they willing to do it?â€ù and they said, â€œYesâ€ù, but I got to get 10 subjects to them before the end of May. So that there is enough time to write before. Apparently, babies are coming. Hoo.. How exciting. But anyway, give me 10 subjects not even 10, give 1 subject. What 1 thing would you have liked to have known how to do or know what to do or where to start or things like that. Just give me 1 subject. Whoever gives me the best subject would win a hundred dollars. I am going to commit to that, on camera. Okay. So whoever gives me the best subject, send an email, send a comment, post a comment on the youtube video, on the Facebook page, on the blog. Send me an email to get support; anything. Send me an idea of what you would like to be told when you was a beginner blogger. If you had the chance to get something told you by an expert. What would have saved you time? What advice you would give now that youâ€™ve been blogging for a while? What would you give to a new blogger? Something like that. So whoeverâ€™s got the most creative or the most interesting or the most loody dah comment, okay, I would give them a hundred dollars. Thatâ€™s all you have to do. Come up with what you would have liked to be told or when you are a beginning blogger. What would have helped you? So thatâ€™s the thing for today. Send me the idea and also watch out for the video because Iâ€™ve got a feeling that the voice over guy got the story now. He is going to record it the next couple of days. I got a feeling that it is going to be brilliant. Hmmâ€_But I felt like this before. Anyway, it is going to be brilliant!",andy

That is a staggering number that can leave anyone thinking, â€œHow am I going to get people to consume my content over the other 26,999,999?â€ù These tips might be able to help you with that. Each of these techniques assumes you are doing things to   already: making it relevant to your consumers, writing for the web, using multimedia when appropriate, etc. These tips are for those who are creating great stuff, they just need a little help getting it in front of more viewers. According to Facebook their site averages 526 million active visitors everyday so it would be foolish not to try to tap into this pool of potential visitors or customers. Advertising on Twitter is still one of the best tools for sharing content. It helps if you already have a sizeable following, but even those who have only a few followers can get some traction if they tweet the right way. Experts say that there are three main elements to a successful tweet: a headline that tempts the reader, a link that takes the person to the content and a relevant hashtag so people searching the Twitter stream will find the content â€“ even if they arenâ€™t a follower of yours. Email is still one of the most effective tools for building traffic. Creating a great email newsletter that uses your content as a teaser is a great way to drive more people towards your content. Building a list might take some time, but it can pay off with huge dividends. Start by encouraging visitors to sign up for your newsletter so they never miss anything you post and augment this with the other two strategies mentioned in this article. Be warned, however, that taking shortcuts like buying email lists or scraping addresses from other sites can backfire by annoying your prospective visitors and get you in a bit of trouble if you are labeled as a spammer. Visitors arenâ€™t going to show up overnight regardless of how good your content is. You have to do a bit of work to drive people to your site in the first place. However once they see what you have to offer you can turn them into regular visitors who anxiously await your next post.",Jeff

You can actually look youthful even in later years of your lives. This is possible by employing easy to do and very   at home. In case you want to look youthful and smart in your later age then follow the following   at home. However the key to all such   is that you need to start them at an early young age so that by the time you reach the when age signs start appearing you will look younger. Squatting right is one of the   and can surely signs of old age appearing both apparently as well as internally. Squatting right is a very simple fix and lets your femur to line up correctly in to the hip joint that causes your knees to track down your ankles instead of caving in. The result will be a much stronger knee joint and less chance of knee pain which is a sign of ageing. Since men have a quite different structure of hip so they will squat in with their toes forward. Also it is advised by experts that women essentially do need to step their feet a little or wider than the hip. You can do this for about two to three times and still manage to evade your ageing. This may seem a little pointless but the reality is that it is one of the most effective and   you can do.Â  Our anti ageing exercise experts say that exercise is more of a physical crossword puzzle. This implies that the more activity you indulge into (that also engages your brain) the better and effective it is for anti ageing dynamics. Such activities canÂ  react by training (such as playing tennis or racquetball), memorizing choreography and changing directions in common in step, kickboxing, and dance classes which are quite mundane. Cardio exercises may seem to wear you out but the good thing is that they are great anti ageing exercises. Although the US guidelines advise some 150 minutes of cardio per week, our expertsâ€™ examination of this research concluded that 240 minutes per week is optimal for heart health and is effective too. All aerobic activities improve your mitochondrial function that work by producing organelles in cells by producing energy. This process is most likely to decrease as you age. So our experts advise you to have four hours of cardio a week. Although it sound like too much but the results are worth the while and you get used to it rapidly.Â  In case you cannot take out this much time, you can always got for interval training which is one of the most efficient and effective ways to exercise at high enough levels to improve aerobic fitness. Try these  and remain young and youthful all along. Good luck!",saanvi chaturvedi

Which is best? - ComLuv","If you are into  , at one moment, Iâ€™m sure you have had to think to decide which of these three models can generate the highest earnings â€“ Direct Advertising, Affiliate Banners and Adsense Why these 3 is because they are competing for the same ad spots; A 300X250 sidebar ad spot can be sold for direct profit (Direct advertising) or used to promote an affiliate product that pays high or recurring commission or Adsense ads. I know this works differently, from blog to blog and niche to niche. However, there is always this confusion and a common question; how do I monetize this or that portion of my blog? Now if your blog is struggling with traffic (like most of ours), this becomes even a bigger concern. I have seen bloggers switch between these models within days. This of course doesnâ€™t allow them enough time to gather required amount of data to guide their decision. Letâ€™s examine these models one after the other. Iâ€™ll will be excited to have you say your opinion in the comment box below  Here, advertisers pay you a once off amount for a certain period of time, generally 30 days. The amount paid here is a strict factor of your traffic (considering we have already dealt with the relevancy factor). The more the traffic, the more you can charge for the portion in question. Traffic is generally measured by the impressions or exposure that portion gets within 30 days. The problem here is direct advertising doesnâ€™t pay anything substantial. I have seen some struggling blogs sell 300X250 sidebar spot for $10/month. That in itself frightens away advertisers who may not be so sure of the value of your service. That not withstanding, some very busy blogs charge over $1000 per ad space with hundreds of thousands of impressions. You understand with me that this is big money for banner ad but what if an Adsense banner was optimized for that same spot?  Affiliate marketing is one of the most profitable ways to make Why will you choose to display an affiliate banner instead of selling that portion of your blog or optimize it for Adsense ads? There are some reasons that justify affiliate banners: But there is a big problemÂ  â€“ You may never make a sale for the next few months! Yes. There is absolutely no guarantee that going by this option will generate the sales. So what do you do?  I have written about an excellent  you need to check.  . Still want more on Affiliate Marketing? Here are some 6 evergreen ways to   This can turn to be the most frustrating model. Most of us think itâ€™s all about copying and pasting those Adsense code â€“ there is more to that. Without considerable targeted traffic and proper optimization, you may end up monthly with cents in your affiliate account. How discouraging that is! I donâ€™t recommend Adsense for new blog. What I hate most with this model is the fact that it completely drives traffic away from your blog. You have no option to control the click target (open in new window or not). My candid recommendation is not to be obsessed about making money with your blog. Concentrate on building a popular blog ( ) . Keep posting great SEO/Human content, grow your community, network with other bloggers, start building a list, etc. Secondly, when you think your blog is ripe enough to practice some money making activities, test and test and test (But give yourself enough time while testing) To make money blogging is not a short term activity.

Snow, ice and glaciers might be your passion, but they can also turn out to be your worst enemy. Besides warm clothes, axes, boots and ropes, you will need much more for an extreme sport like this. Good motor skills are always a plus if you  . Health tests checking how good are your hands and leg movement in coordination with eyes are obligatory, no matter how trivial the routes are. You need to be able to think and act quickly. Apart from strong will, you will have to be physically strong for this kind of occupation. Months and months of exercising are needed before you dare to put your foot on a mountain. This is not a profession for weak people because there are various dangers and life threatening situations even on a standard route. Overall strength and muscular endurance of both the upper and lower body are extremely important, so you better hit the gym as soon as possible. Experience is the key to staying alive in this extreme sport. First of all, you will need to go mountaineering with someone who has a lot of experience in this field in order to learn useful things. Â Climberâ€™s craft is indeed a demanding profession, so you will gain experience very slowly â€“ persistence and patience matter too. In the beginning, you will have to practice rock climbing at a local rock gym.   can be a hobby on its own, and some people prefer this to alpinism. However, Knowledge about climbing and experience are two crucial characteristics of a serious climber. Applied knowledge starts during the preparation and time planning. You will need to think clearly and logically â€“ what could you possibly need if some inconvenient situation occurs? Of course, you shouldnâ€™t pack too many things because, after all, you are going mountaineering and you will have to carry your backpack and equipment upwards. Apart from all the gear, you will also need: Pack a few snacks high in proteins along with a bottle of water as you will be spending more calories than usual and the height will make you constantly thirsty. A small first aid kit including ace bandage, athletic tape and something to sterilize wounds will fit into any pocket of your backpack, so make sure not to forget to pack it. A charged cell phone is your best friend when far from home. In case of an emergency, your phone is your way out, unless the reception is weak. In that case, I would suggest you  , too. I hope I proved my point here â€“ you donâ€™t need only good and expensive equipment to do extreme sports. You will need full focus and many other skills that you need to work on. Good luck, future mountaineers!",Ivan Dimitrijevic

As you can tell by me walking about, and not lying in bed going oh gah blah, I am feeling a little bit better and I have still got heavy legs but what the hell, I have been carrying my legs for all my life and Iâ€™m pretty used to that. Oh, blimmey what a hard thing is to edit that video! What was I doing listening to all the awesome feedback?, I could have just whack it up there and hope for the best, but instead, I listened to you people and a lot of people mentioned about those squiggly letters moving up and down which Iâ€™ll have to look at it again I thought â€“ at first I thought it was oh itâ€™s magic and then now I think, oh yeah, I see your point. I have calm them down a bit, I said, and they did after bashing the computer for about hours. Blimmey that was hard work. Then I got someone else who saidâ€”, Oh have a look at this picture! This is my chicken cacciatore. Have a look. See look how bright it is. It is lovely. Itâ€™s got red peppers, but I used the chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts because thatâ€™s all I had. Thatâ€™s got nothing to do with anything, plug-ins all business, but I want to show someone because my Mrs. works in the kitchen cooking stuff and she was like, â€˜Yeah, whatever.â€™ So sheâ€™s not impressed by cooking things, I am and hopefully you too. Iâ€™ve put the recipe of it there, below the video somewhere so you can find out how to make that too because it is a really nice recipe and lots of other people said this is really tasty too.               Oh yeah, well done for all the contest winners. Someone got in contact with me and got a license and then there is the other person this week as well, youâ€™ll find out on my blog on the post where this newsletter appears. And then Iâ€™ve got another I can talk to you about as well, I was going to say Iâ€™ve told you about video that Iâ€™m doing thatâ€“ Oh yeah, Iâ€™m going to do some live actions stuff or maybe some narrative stuff by â€“ maybe get Morgan Freeman to do it or someone who sounds like him because again, that was another feedback where someone said that the demo area or part of it was a bit short and so you couldnâ€™t really get an idea of what the plug-in does from the video; and after getting some emails from people saying, â€˜What does your plug-in do for people that canâ€™t read web pages?â€™ I thought, Iâ€™ve got a â€“ itâ€™s not that itâ€™s my fault, but still Iâ€™ve got enough responsibility to explain what it is on video, and for that I am going to have to extend those demo pieces. I canâ€™t really do it in the videos. We are going to have to do some shenanigans to do that as well. I will make the videos this week to put into the placement there and I will get them narrated or live action or me pointing at things saying, â€˜Look,â€™ maybe not and then that will be done. Thatâ€™s only like six weeks behind schedule, but as I said I donâ€™t do schedules so, Iâ€™m on schedule, huh how about that?. I donâ€™t do schedules so how can I be on it? That is existential for you, isnâ€™t it? Anyway, I hope to see you next week where I still will be ambulatory and hopefully my legs will be less heavy than they are today. So what can I say? Yeah, I can say goodbye. Cheerio see you all next week.!",andy
02/05/2014,http://comluv.com/google-glasses-enter-battle-sphere-us-air-force/,Google Glasses Enter The Battle Sphere with the US Air force,"The Google Glasses have been making it big in the world ever since its inception. In fact the very idea of its origin is set from the fact that a wearable computer can go leaps and bounds when it comes to any domain of the modern human life. Be it medicine or even fire fighting, we saw that the explorers have already begun putting the Google glasses to good use. But, the US air force takes it all to a whole new level. The US Air force has a specialized team of researchers who are apparently studying the Google glass and testing it for potential use in the domains of defense. The Battlefield Air Targeting Man-Aided Knowledge research team which is popularly known as BATMAN is responsible for beta testing any of the latest technologies for the purpose of defense. It is obvious that a wearable computer can be extremely useful when it comes to the defense world because it will reduce the response or reaction time by almost half, however, there need to be many tweaks to the gadget itself in order to make it completely usable. On the whole it can be said that the Google Glass might seem to be a big leap in the world of technology but for it to actually facilitate the big and serious agenda of a countries defense will probably require some amount of specialization. So letâ€™s say that the Glass is a beginning for a much more complicated and specialized device that the Air Force pilots can wear to facilitate successful air combat and so on and so forth. Understand the particular needs of the sector will help in customizing the gadget to every specific need. The explorer program was originally started off to make certain that people from various countries and backgrounds could use it and in that way be able to give a description on its uses in an assortment of industries. This worked quite well to a large degree because new and ground-breaking sources have been able to show how the explorer program is tremendously useful in various industries such as medicine, fire Also, developers and tech savvy people too have begun taking the plunge and participating in the purchase and use program to ensure that they can reap the maximum benefits of the same. There are so many types of apps that people are creating to help in making the device itself exceptionally user friendly. As more and more apps keep evolving in the market, the requirements for this great device will maintain to see the rise. The glass is a wearable computer that can be easily put on like eye glasses and used for a number of purposes. Itâ€™s most important uses include its ability to show you a virtual map for easy navigation, a translator for quick language translation, a camera for point of view pictures and videos and many more. Whatâ€™s more, many app developers have already begun creating applications with diverse roles to make it a super device. We have heard about Glass users being â€˜attackedâ€™ at public places and the only question that comes up to the mind is that why are so many people so rigid against the glass. Is it because they fear that this device will eventually be responsible in a breach of privacy that will affect every one? There is a kind of social stigma attached to it that prevents people from being able to accept it completely. Actually the main difficulty with the device is that it is yet to make its way directly into consumersâ€™ hands. This means that the only understanding that the general people have of the gadget is exclusively through early testers and the sometimes inconvenient photos of said testers. For the most part, people have become contemptuous of the glass only because it makes them look like they know about stuff. But actually, itâ€™s quite the other way round. If you in actuality know the glass for what it is, then you would never even think about it in any other way but as a fantastic device to do lovely things with. Worse, sometimes, people simply disapprove of it because they canâ€™t have it or at least they think that they canâ€™t have. You know that you canâ€™t get your hands on it and so you compel yourself to â€˜not likeâ€™ the invention so you donâ€™t feel badly about not being able to own it.",JillElliott
30/04/2014,http://comluv.com/3-things-must-barcelona/,3 Things You Must Do While in Barcelona - ComLuv,"Barcelona was originally named Barcino, and later the Romans, around 3rd century B.C., chose this city as the capital of that region, and there are some remains which can be found in modern day Barcelona. Now, it is one of the most famous cities in Spain, cradled in the northwest of the warm Mediterranean Sea. Its proximity to France makes it a very popular tourist destination, and that is why we are going to name some of the things you should definitely check out and try, if you ever get the chance to end up in Barcelona. One of the worldâ€™s most famous sites, even though it is incomplete, it has made its way on a UNESCO World Heritage List which gives it special importance. The construction of this gigantic basilica started in 1882, becoming one of the greatest works of art combining the Gothic and Art Nouveau style. It is being built from private donations, and that is one of the reasons why construction has been progressing so slowly, and has even been interrupted by a civil war. The basilicaâ€™s purpose is to atone for some wrong deed of the original financier, which gives it that mystical aura. The three entrances it has are there to represent three main virtues: Hope, Faith, and Love. When in Barcelona, this is a place you have to visit this and see   that will leave you breathless. Tapas are small plates on which food is served, usually in addition to drinks. No, they are not appetizers, even though they are on a toothpick. There is no original recipe for tapa, as anything can be served, and they range from small snacks to smaller meals, such as pork stew The final, and the best piece of advice, if you have an opportunity to visit this city, would be to explore. Barcelona is a very large and extremely beautiful city with an amazing nightlife. Â You can explore it with or without a map. The less complicated you make it, the more fun it will be and the more you will see. Enjoy everything you come across, try and visit some of the popular tourist attractions, but also create your own adventures, visit bars, local clubs, and small shops off the beaten track. Ride a bike through the city, walk, or   while the wind blows through your hair. Â Youâ€™ll create wonderful memories and have more than a couple of new stories to tell to your friends and family, and with a simple camera, youâ€™ll be able to capture all the perfect moment. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are going alone on a backpacking trip through Europe, or if you are going on a road trip with your family or friends, there are some European cities you have to visit. Even if you live in America (especially if you live in America), Barcelona is one the most visited cities in Europe, giving you an opportunity to experience a diverse, rich culture. From food to nightlife, everything is exciting. There are plenty of museums which are worth visiting so, plan your stay there carefully. You do not want to miss out on anything. Explore as much as you can, try to see everything, but enjoy every single step of the way.",Ivan Dimitrijevic
28/04/2014,http://comluv.com/using-online-press-releases-seo-building-traffic-lead-generation/,"Using Online Press Releases for SEO, Building Traffic, and Lead Generation - ComLuv","During the heyday of print media, press releases used to be an effective means to promote a certain business, company, or product. With the advent of the internet, press releases took on a different purpose; which is to drive traffic to different sites, improve SEO, and generate leads. Online press releases are used by prominent companies; as well as, small businesses and online entrepreneurs, for these purposes. Itâ€™s an effective and inexpensive strategy to drive traffic to your site, due to a high return of investment (ROI) via visibility and referral products. By now, we are all aware of Googleâ€™s algorithmic updates (and itâ€™s only going to continue) and how it has changed the way link-building methods are utilized. When you start a press release, ensure the distributor you chose (PRWeb, PRLOG, etc.) refrain from using anchor texts as â€œdo-followâ€ù, so you donâ€™t rank negatively in Google. This as a result affects SEO, when â€œno-followâ€ù is used instead. Nonetheless, thereâ€™s still a way to improve SEO with press releases â€“ which Iâ€™ll mention later on. Another drawback is that you can no longer hyperlink keywords to track back to your site, landing page, referral products, etc.;   you submit your press releases sparingly. Unfortunately, by not regularly sending press releases, your site will take a lot longer to rank. On the other hand, if youâ€™re aggressive with your SEO campaigns, then hyperlink natural phrases instead â€“ like â€œclick hereâ€ù or â€œcheck this outâ€ù, which are more viable options. Doing so will still keep you in good graces with Google. Aside from having an author or resource box to store valuable links, press releases also work as a prime method to disseminate information. A stellar press release will be picked-up In case there are landing pages and sign-up forms, the reader will be redirected to any of these pages for lead generation as well â€“ which is just as good as cash. These clicks not only lead people to your site, but it could also convert into potential sales or member sign-ups, for long-term relationships. In the event these new visitors donâ€™t buy anything the first time, itâ€™s OK because they have already become familiar with your site and could potentially come back for more. Repeat visitors are always better than one-time visitors. Earlier, I mentioned that SEO can still be improved using press releases. This can work to your advantage, if you optimize your releases with low competition, long-tail keywords within your niche. However, though itâ€™s important to find the right keywords, remember that a press release will be picked-up and read based on the   â€“ so good copy-writing is still a must. Your keywords should also flow naturally and not be overused throughout the release. Using too many keywords devalues your content and search engines (especially Google) will consider your release as too â€œspammyâ€ù; thus wasting all your efforts and resources in the process. Additionally, attaching your name on a â€œspammyâ€ù release will hurt your credibility and overall brand. Therefore, itâ€™s not worth the trouble. Your press release can be about a new product, a service, or a launch. It needs to be a news-worthy event that will attract groups with varying interests. You can also make your press releases more engaging, by adding quotes or blurbs from officials of a company, owner, or product developer. Be creative in the process. The more your readers connect with your content, the more inbound links youâ€™ll generate as a result. What do you think about using press releases for site traffic? Is it still a smart method to generate inbound links post Penguin? Please share your thoughts in the comment section below. Thank you.",Warren

As we all see, nothing of this has happened yet, but thereâ€™s another thing we should be worried about â€“ zombies. Nothing motivates people to finally start doing things from their bucket list more than total chaos thatâ€™s bound to happen. If youâ€™re one of those people, just imagine that the end is near, because there are a lot of amazing and breathtaking places on our planet everyone needs to see. We came up with this list that covers some of the most different places with only one thing in common â€“ historical and cultural heritage. Being the treasury for some priceless cultural artifacts, itâ€™s obvious why Vatican deserves to be on the first place on this list. As a tourist in Vatican, you can choose from four different routes. Each of them is a journey for itself through this breathtaking museum, and all of these routes end with the Sistine Chapel. This museum complex  , with the amazing number of 1400 rooms. Prepare to be amazed by the astonishing number of art pieces that witness about human history. Amazon is the place where nature is still mysterious and unexplored. A place where the number of animal and plant species are still being discovered each year. With more than 7,000,000 square kilometers, Amazon is  . This is the ultimate place for you to connect with nature, because it is untouched and free from civilization and all the bad things that come with it. The secrets of the Ancient World lie right here, in the largest of the three greatest pyramids in Egypt. Even nowadays, when we have advanced technology at our disposal, the human kind is unfamiliar with the way Ancient Egyptians have built the pyramids. Entering the Great Pyramid of Giza will take you far back in the past, when people strongly believed in gods and the afterlife. The famous prehistoric monument  . Thereâ€™s no kind of record about the culture that built Stonehenge, or any information about how theyâ€™ve built it. The scientists believe that the only This unique island is actually a product of the frequent volcanic eruptions, which resulted in the separation of this particular part from the rest of the land. Other than tourism, this Greek island is also proud of its archaeological site called Akrotiri, which dates from the Minoan era. If youâ€™re not too much into merging your vacation with learning, you can always just let the magic of Santorini seduce you. Being the home of Christ the Redeemer, Rio de Janeiro is a major tourist attraction. This religious monument attracts not only believers, but absolutely everyone â€“ its size and significance are simply thrilling. But thatâ€™s not all Rio has to offer; people there are proud of their culture, and they are more than willing to share their spirit with all the visitors. Petra, or The Rose City, is a symbol of Jordan. This breathtaking piece of architecture lies between two mountains, in a basin. It is a very old building â€“ itâ€™s established that Petra dates from 7000BC. It is still standing firm, but you should know that itâ€™s in constant threat, and most problems are caused by erosion and improper rainwater drainage. These intriguing ruins, placed 7000 feet above sea level, are separated into three different areas â€“ agricultural, religious and urban. Itâ€™s believed that the first settlers arrived here anywhere from 20000BC to 10000BC â€“ something as old as this carries a certain spirit with it, that simply cannot disappear. Also, itâ€™s placed far from the cities and modern way of life, so itâ€™s far from pollution and properly taken care of. Although the inevitable zombie apocalypse draws ever closer, there is still plenty of time to schedule a few trips around the world and see some wonderful places full of culture and history.

23/04/2014,http://comluv.com/unhealthy-eating-habits/,Unhealthy eating habits - ComLuv,"How many times did you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and you ended up checking the fridge and eating that leftover food? It happens to the best of us, you should not feel ashamed. But there are   related to this kind of behavior. Our bodies have their own internal clocks, and that is why we love sleeping at night, when we feel tired, while during the day, we are awake. The same goes for food. Calories are spent differently during the day and during the night. That is why it is important to know how much you should eat and when you should eat. Eating during the night may cause you to get that extra pound or two, and then youâ€™ll have a lot of trouble getting rid of it. If you want to stop this, try not to keep leftover food in the fridge, cook only as much as you need for one day. Remember that eating excessively will not solve your problems. We enjoy junk food. It is written in our genetic code that we like fatty, salty foods with plenty of sugar. Not only do these types of food taste better, but they can even be a bit cheaper than preparing a healthy meal at home. Of course, all of this has a downside. Junk food has too many calories. In short, it gives us too much energy, so much, that we are unable to spend it during our day, and our bodies store it as fat cells. And that is why it is extremely easy to get fat when eating junk food. We just need to control our urges that start to overtake our common sense when we pass fast food stands which are present everywhere. McDonalds restaurants are being opened everywhere, but next time, just pass by and do not go in. If you learn to control your hunger, youâ€™ll start feeling much better, and youâ€™ll lose those sufficient kilograms. We like drinking fizzy drinks all the time, during a meal, during a movie, while playing a video game. People who drink one to two cans of fizzy drinks a day, have a   of developing type 2 diabetes. This is a clear example of how our own eating and drinking habits cause us health problems. Why donâ€™t we just replace a glass of Fanta with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice with no additional sugar? Of course, buying a 2 liter bottle is cheaper than buying oranges, but how much can your body really take? Carbonated drinks are a great source of unhealthy sugars, and are among the top reasons why our children are becoming more and more obese every day. The answer to this problem is to simply stop buying them. Try and switch to healthier solutions and explain to your family why is that a good thing. Just think of all the health benefits you will have after you get rid of this habit. Youâ€™ll finally be able to   of sodas ruining their new color. Youâ€™ll start losing weight and you will feel much younger. Staying healthy is something that everyone must strive for, it is not something that will happen by itself. You have to dedicate your time, money and patience. Try and prepare meals of the right size, from the ingredients that were bought at the farmerâ€™s market, and that you know are healthy. Replace everything you can with an organic substitution. Use honey instead of sugar, and youâ€™ll start feeling changes in no time. Your body will thank you, and you and your family will lead a longer and healthier life.",Ivan Dimitrijevic
20/04/2014,http://comluv.com/6-things-need-provide-newborn/,6 things you need to provide for your newborn - ComLuv,"As soon as babies start crawling, you wonâ€™t be able to catch them â€“ and you shouldnâ€™t even try to. When theyâ€™re strong enough to move around and explore, you should let them. That healthy type of curiosity shouldnâ€™t be limited, because that is  . Keeping them safe while they learn could be an issue â€“ you obviously canâ€™t follow your child around 24/7. In order to have enough time to do your daily chores, without having an accident waiting to happen, you should install baby proofing items. Start from installing some locks on the bottom cabinets and drawers, especially if you keep some strong cleaners or cutlery there. An oven lock, a toilet lid lock and outlet plate covers are also recommendable. If youâ€™re living in a house, you should definitely consider installing a fence around the stairs, so you can control your babyâ€™s movement. The first few years will be really challenging when it comes to keeping your child clean â€“ itâ€™s practically impossible, at least until your child starts adopting some hygiene-related habits. But, you need to be careful when it comes to the care products. The babyâ€™s skin is really sensitive, which makes it more than easy for them to get a rash or develop an allergy to a certain substance. Baby wipes are great, but cotton balls combined with baby oil are probably the best baby cleanser there is, because itâ€™s gentle and efficient. Take your time with   â€“ itâ€™s always a good idea to ask for advice from someone who had some experience with babies. Also, you should have a chest with baby medicine, collected in accordance with your pediatrician, just in case. The items you need related to feeding depend on how you plan on breast or bottle feeding your baby. For bottle feeding, youâ€™ll need to stock up with formula When it comes to breast feeding, a list of necessities is a bit longer. You should definitely consider using a breast pump, so you can storage milk. You can keep breast milk in bags or bottles, but be careful when it comes to adjusting the temperature. For maximal comfort, you should get some nursing bras and a breastfeeding support pillow. The babyâ€™s body is fragile. The clothes you buy donâ€™t have to be expensive, but you should check the quality of the materials from which it had been made. One of the perks of being a parent is in   â€“ no one can take that from you. Other than diapers, you should get a couple of baby grows and vests, because they allow your baby to move freely and they are practical to use. You should also get a sleeping sack, so you can be sure that your babyâ€™s tucked in nicely, without checking on him or her every two minutes. Sweaters and snowsuits are necessary if itâ€™s cold, but a baby hat is a must-have â€“ itâ€™ll prevent your baby from getting sick. As your child grows, you need to gradually increase the difficulty of the games you two play. As for the newborns, the only thing you should do is play classical music â€“ it encourages their mind to develop. Most babies really start playing when theyâ€™re about 6-7 months old, so thatâ€™s when you should start with your peekaboos. Itâ€™s not recommendable to provide your child with girl or boy toys only. When your children start showing interest, let them pick out a toy by themselves. Meanwhile, you can always go with animal shaped toys â€“ theyâ€™re totally neutral. Keeping a type of a diary for your children will help you keep record of the major events; when they said the first words, started crawling and walking, etc. Besides, itâ€™s a wonderful way to capture all the memories, so you can remember everything years later, when your children are all grown up.",Ivan Dimitrijevic
19/04/2014,http://comluv.com/black-sheep-salt/,Black Sheep and Salt - ComLuv,"Years ago, I was cooking a meal for my family. The smells of beef, red and green peppers, onions and tomato filled the air. The scents and flavors made their way upstairs and filled all of the rooms as the pot continued boiling, and the steam continued rising. All day, I stirred it, adding ingredients as it cooked down and every member of my house crowded around the pot to get a sight of the source of the wonderful smells. We love family game night and we played board games together as we usually do, while I would get up once my turn was over to tend to the masterpiece on the stove. My husband had trouble concentrating on his game strategy as he was distracted by his stomach and the scent in the air. Of course, over the years, this has become part of my winning strategy. Cook something delicious, distract him with the scent and get both Boardwalk and Park Place! I know it isnâ€™t fair, but he Finally, I won and it was time for dinner. The table was filled with smiling faces, giddy with excitement for this homemade masterpiece. I dished up large spoonfuls for each person into their bowls. Finally, everyone began to dig in. I waited of course. I wanted to see their reactions. And just as quickly as I made the decision, I regretted it. The smiles turned to unimpressed confusion. â€œWhat could have gone wrong?â€ù I thought. So, I dig my spoon into my bowl, blow the hot steam off of it, and placed it in my mouth. To my disappointment, this was the textbook definition of bland. A few dashes of the single ingredient I had forgotten and those familiar smiles returned. Itâ€™s amazing what a little salt can do for a meal. And so the story is the same for the black sheep in a family. Those are the people who feel like they are outcasts, or like they were adopted, or maybe were adopted but still donâ€™t feel like they are apart of the family. A family is like a magnificent recipe. It smells great, it looks wonderful, but it isnâ€™t without its problems. If you are the black sheep in your family, then donâ€™t feel bad, be the salt. If you know who the black sheep in your family is, then donâ€™t forget to include them. You may not realize it, but the family recipe might become awfully bland without the salt.",Laura
18/04/2014,http://comluv.com/how-to-fix-the-invalid-xml-entity-error/,BOL newsletter 48 - how to fix the XML error and looking for a social media manager - ComLuv,"Hereâ€™s the video and transcription of this weeks newsletter on how to fix the invalid xml entity error and more And this weeks winner is Jeannie from  Â who recently wrote about  well done Jeannie,maybe someone will leave a comment on your blog to say well done (hint hint!) and get a backlink for the trouble _Ÿ™‚ (it will be up to you to claim your prize of a lifetime license to Commentluv Premium, you have until next weeks newsletter comes out) Hello and welcome to another news letter! Now I was supposed to be telling you the sales video that I edited and extended the demonstration videos for. Hi itsâ€™ Andy Bailey from CommentLuv.com and in this video I am going to show you how you can very quickly find and fix the problem if you get an XML invalid entity error when youâ€™re commenting on a commentluv blog Okay so here we are. This is my other personal blog, but letâ€™s says Iâ€™m making a comment on this blog here. Now this is using an older version of the free version of CommentLuv. Iâ€™ll put in fiddyp.co.uk and Iâ€™ll just show you here without having to write the comment and you can see that itâ€™s take a while because itâ€™s trying some different things to find the feed. But it says, this XML document is invalid. Now when you usually see something like this. If you hover over the area there where it says â€œHover your mouseâ€ù you can see thereâ€™s some white space before the start of the XML. And whatâ€™s happening is CommentLuv is trying to read the XML file that CommentLuv produces, but because thereâ€™s some space at the start it doesnâ€™t know what to do with it. Now Iâ€™ve written some stuff into the plug in that can mostly take care of that, but not all plug versions do this, and sometimes other files get included before CommentLuv can load and then itâ€™s those files that are adding this extra bit of white space, and thatâ€™s what causes the error. So this is how you fix it very quickly. So Iâ€™m Andy. Iâ€™m going to log in. So we are going to go to appearance, and editor. One of the main reasons that the XML error happens is because there are extra space in the functions file of you theme. So if you look at your theme editor and we go to theme functions, and then we scroll to the bottom, and exactly there you can see. If you can put your cursor after the closing PHP tag then that is what inserting extra space. So what we can do is delete all of that, but before we do all of that let me show you that if you have CommentLuv Premium it does some extra little fancy bits to try to mitigate that problem. When it gets the data back it tries to ignore any blank space, but like I said other plug-ins load before CommentLuv Premium does sometimes so even then, it causes an issue. So if we scroll down to the comments onâ€_ whoâ€™s this hereâ€_ Sarupa Shah. Okay so letâ€™s have a look here see how it reacts with the same URL on CommentLuv Premiums site. Now again I am not writing a comment on here I am just seeing how it reacts to my URL, and again you can see itâ€™s taking an extra-long time and that is because it is trying other different things when it gets and error. As you can see CommentLuv Premium is able to bring back that last post. So if you are having a problem the first thing you should do if you are using the free version of CommentLuv then go to your functions file and then just remove everything after the last tag. So youâ€™ve got the question mark and the closing bracket. That closes PHP. But because your theme gets loaded in the middle of everything else that Word Press loads you donâ€™t need to do this closing tag. In fact itâ€™s a good idea to remove it anyway. And so there you go. Make sure the last character is one of the PHP characters or there are no spaces after the closing tag. So letâ€™s update the files. Now itâ€™s not really a good idea to update a file while itâ€™s live on your site, but I am just doing it here just to make it go a bit quicker. What you would do, ideally is that you would download the file. Check it in a proper editor, not Microsoft Word and not Notepad, but something like Notepad ++ or some other type of editor like that, and then you would check it there. But, if you havenâ€™t got one of those editors this is the quick and dirty way to do it. So letâ€™s just check now. Letâ€™s see what happens when I try again. let me click in here again. And we can see straight away everything is working perfectly fine again. So that little bit of extra space that was after the closing tag that was the cause of it. So if you ever see an XML error entity starts at line 39 columns something like that this is usually the case. If itâ€™s not in your functions file then it will be in one of your plug-ins that youâ€™ve recently added. So if you added a plug in or updated it recently check those plug-ins to make sure that the closing PHP tag does not have any extra space on it. And youâ€™re better off actually just deleting the closing tag. There you go! what do you think? useful?",andy
15/04/2014,http://comluv.com/5-reasons-blog-will-fail-2/,5 Reasons Why Your Blog WILL FAIL - ComLuv,"Blogging is a superb way to get your message out to the world. Itâ€™s also (depending on oneâ€™s goal) an excellent way to earn full or part-time income. We all know the stories of bloggers who managed to quit their jobs and make a living online. I believe everyone has the potential to do the same; but at the same time, not justÂ  can be successful at it. Here are five reasons why your blog will fail: There are two ways to look at a blog. Either itâ€™s just a fancy pants online journal, or itâ€™s a business thatâ€™s earning the author an income. Unfortunately, a lot of bloggers (especially beginners) just believe that writing posts and creating content will bring them the big bucks. This is further from the truth. The business side of a blog is a whole other ball game which involves budgeting, testing, tracking, networking, support systems, and a lot more. You also need a business mentality to keep pushing forward, even when your motivation is low â€“ and there will be these moments. Youâ€™re not going to achieve sustainable income with your blog, unless you treat it like the business that it is. Think about it. Why would anyone want to visit your blog? Is it because you have the most beautiful blog out there? Wrong. For the most part, the content is what drives them to a blog. Content that is so epic and desperately needed that they want to share it with others, engage in it, and come back for more. Thatâ€™s what you want. They donâ€™t really care all about the â€œother stuffâ€ù. Most people use the internet for information. Therefore, if they visit your blog feeling like theyâ€™re just being sold to, then theyâ€™ll leave running andÂ  Â come back. Furthermore, the effect of focusing too much on generating income is that you often lose the motivation to keep creating epic posts. It becomes about the dollar return value (or traffic return value) rather than the simple act ofÂ  . Remember, your readers are human-beings and they want to be treated as such. The most successful bloggers on the planet didnâ€™t get where they are at on their own. They didnâ€™t just start a blog, post content regularly, and hoped the traffic would come. No, they strategically placed â€œsignsâ€ù all around the internet that screamed their message and how awesome they are. Think strategies like guest posting (the comment luv site is a great example =)), commenting on other blogs (I like doingÂ  Â five a day), becoming a regular contributor on sites like mediumdotcom or Yahoo! Voices Get in touch with other bloggers that have a similar niche to yours and begin establishing relationships. It could just be a note to say â€œhiâ€ù and show how much you love their work, and connecting with them through social media.Â  There are a few bloggers who can get away with this aspect. But for most of us, having a clearly defined target audience and topic, will go a long way to ensure credibility and visitor engagement. For instance, if Iâ€™m looking for information on any topic relating to â€œtechnologyâ€ù, I donâ€™t expect to read articles from a site talking about â€œhow to become a veterinarian.â€ù Am I right? You might be thinking that this is going to limit what you know, and perhaps it will, to a certain extent. But if youâ€™re also willing to brand yourself as an expert on a particular subject, then youâ€™ll need to get specific with your topic; and to become an â€œexpertâ€ù doesnâ€™t necessarily mean you have to â€œbe the bestâ€ù either (although that wouldÂ  Â set you apart). You just need to know a little bit more on your niche than the average person would. As a result, theyâ€™ll come to you for advice. Blogs take work and patience. Itâ€™s as simple as that. As I mentioned earlier, you need to treat it like a business in order to make money from it and be successful. Youâ€™ll only get what you put into it. Therefore, you need to put in the necessary hours and resources for the blog to grow. Itâ€™s either you fully commit or you donâ€™t. I like gauging the progress of a new blog through the first six months. Usually within these months, Iâ€™ll know if this is the right course for me, or if Iâ€™m entering the right niche. And if it doesnâ€™t work, then I move on to the next project. Once you determine that blogging is what youâ€™re meant to do, then by all means,Â  . Keep going no matter what. There are hundreds of blogs created on aÂ  Â basis, and hundreds more fail as well. Donâ€™t be the latter statistic. A big part of generating income online is to grow and learn the ins and outs of the business. This makes you a better blogger and an accomplished, successful online entrepreneur in the end. If you find yourself doing any (or all) of these issues Iâ€™ve mention, then today is the day to reform and take action. If youâ€™re willing to focus on your niche, respect your audienceâ€™s needs, and put forth the effort, then thereâ€™s no reason why you canâ€™t enjoy all the success your blog will offer. Do you have any other tips to share with aspiring bloggers out there? If so, I would love to hear your comments below. photo credit:Â  Â via",Warren
13/04/2014,http://comluv.com/resilience-bullet-proof-vest-war-called-modern-life/,Resilience: Your Bullet-Proof Vest in a War Called Modern Life - ComLuv,"In general, we humans are profoundly gifted and ingenious when it comes to problem solving which makes us more flexible and stronger when faced with stress. As children, we are more resilient. We fall down or trip but we get up again without any difficulty. But, with the increasing challenge of the modern world we are all faced with insurmountable pressure not only from the workplace but from society in its entirety. Thus, there is a need to be more resilient both in body and spirit. Unfortunately, the ability of man to manage and control pressure appears to have diminished. As we grow older we somehow developed inflexibility towards the unpredictable and lose our ability to change course. Maybe some of us might have lost it, but resilience can be re-learned with the help of resilience training A quote in a Harvard Business Review article written by Diane L. Coutu, author of the books  and   pointed out that: Resilient human beings are able to take advantage of their inner strength and flexibility to manage and bounce back from an adverse situation such as financial loss, death of a loved one, illness, divorce, job loss and more. Those who donot have this attribute are vanquished by such adversities. They are not able to move on and even employ damaging means to cope with the problems resulting in more problems. In the workplace or in business, people with a high level of resilience can face up to reality, are able to conform and accommodate feedbacks and criticism, change if there is a need for change and, with confidence, march toward success. Their optimism carries them through destructive repudiations and helps them keep breaking new grounds with a better perspective. They are able to stay on course with a clear view of their objectives and continue to forge ahead in the thick of hardships and set backs. An article on the  , draws a picture of Abraham Lincoln as the perfect personification of resilience. Meanwhile, his management style as president of the United States, which the article aptly called the Lincoln school of management, is a reflection of what exceptional leadership is all about.",joelmayer

11/04/2014,http://comluv.com/how-to-find-commentluv-blogs/,How to find CommentLuv blogs to comment where you know you should - ComLuv,"Hereâ€™s the video and transcription for the newsletter #47 Oh! and the winner of the first weeks lifetime license is :   who recently wrote about  ok that should send out some pingbacks to the site, itâ€™s just up to the owner to get in to contact with me either in the comments or via the support ticket system and I can send the lifetime license! (user has until the next weeks newsletter comes out to claim their prize) Hello and welcome to another Newsletter live and on video, actually not live, but definitely on video. _Ÿ™‚ Thanks very much for the feedback from the last video about the video, about the sales video, about the site, all sorts of things go brought up and now I am really pleased that on video I can address those things with tippity tappity you know what I mean? So the first thing that got brought up was about the color of the video, red wasnâ€™t really good. A few people mentioned that, David did as well. David mentioned another thing as well that I will bring up. Iâ€™ve changed the color of the video from red to blue because blue is apparently a more relaxing color. And also Iâ€™ve changed the name of the girl from Skyler, God knows what I was thinking putting her name as Skyler, anyways well Iâ€™ve changed it to Mary so you know that is pretty much a universal girls name. Everybody knows thatâ€™s a name of girl, not a digital device call Skyler. Anyways itâ€™s a work in process and itâ€™s never going to be a final thing until I get some good feedback from people like yourselves. Also Roberta mentioned something about not commenting on enough blogs. Well thatâ€™s the general gist of it anyways. She didnâ€™t say that, but the way it worked out was that she was reminded that itâ€™s a two way street and that made me think: why not I make a video for you to use for how to find blogs to comment on? Where one: they are commenting on people or they like to comment, two: you are going to get a link from CommentLuv and three: they are going to be interested into you because the other articles they write are interesting to you. So win, win, win. So at the end of this video is going to be another video with a little tutorial, Iâ€™ll separate later, of a little thing, but that will teach you how to find blogs to comment on in an organic way that isnâ€™t passing the list of comments on sites and not knowing the type of site theyâ€™ve got and if they give commetnluv and all that blah blah blah blah. So definitely at the end of this video is going to be another video about how to organically find CommentLuv sites to comment on. How about that? Make sure you watch until the end. Also I have got to say something else as well. Oh yeah I forgot to take the forum down from the website because I can see the error log that there is loads of really nasty errors from the forum that I was using. I donâ€™t think it was the forum I think it was an attack on the site by bots which happens all the time by the way its rubbish and such a pain to deal with. But, anyways Iâ€™ve removed that forum and Iâ€™ll be pointing people toward the support site if they want to ask questions and stuff like that. As part of that I will be doing more videos about how to do the simple things. The end of this video is start of it so make sure you have watch of that and send me some feedback or any more questions that you want to do and Iâ€™ll answer them on next weekâ€™s video. Oh and Iâ€™ll mention who won the contest this week, Iâ€™ll put that on the bottom of the post on ComLuv and then youâ€™ve come to that site and the person if they are the winner they can send me an email and claim their free lifetime license for CommentLuv Premium. Once they do that I will be able to send it to them, everybody is lickety split happity dappity. But in fact though the person that wins though does have to do some sort of reaching out to me to give me their details because you know itâ€™s a two way street. Hello itâ€™s Andy Bailey from CommentLuv in this video I am going to teach you how you can find other blogs to comment on where you know you will get a link, you know the owner likes to comment on other sites which is good because they will be commenting on your site, and also that their articles resonate with you. Here we go now I could show you as ComLuv as the basis, but what I want to do is encourage you to visit other popular sites, now here are just a few. Letâ€™s have a go at http://Famousbloggers.net. So what we are going to do is we are going to see here and have a look at Heshamâ€™s post here. Now this has to do with Tweets. So you could comment on these sites, but also as well as commenting on these sites because they have good articles, you can have a look at their comments. Now if we look down here we see here this hover icon, this heart, has got a little plus on it. The only two ways you can get a plus is either if you have registered to the site or that you have CommentLuv Premium. In this case theyâ€™ve got CommentLuv Premium so you know that if you go to this personâ€™s site that you are going to get a link back provided that you give a good comment So if you give a bad comment you end up getting bad stuff, but anyways. But point is, that if you hover over that you can see some of the other posts that personâ€™s has written. So you can see if they have resonated with you. You can also see here they commented on other posts on this very site and so they have 14 approved comments, you know they are a commenter. So itâ€™s a good idea to comment on this personâ€™s site because they might as well come back to your site and comment on it. Now if you go up here you can see the description about the blogger. Now this blogger isnâ€™t actually Lisa this is a guest blogger on Lisaâ€™s and it tells you there. Now this is a good thing as well because you know that Lisa accepts guest posts from bloggers and so thatâ€™s another way that you can get backlinks, exposure and authority just by writing a post on Lisaâ€™s site. Now letâ€™s have another http://kikolani.com Now this is a site run by Kristi Himes and sheâ€™s got loads of expert bloggers and stuff like that writing for her and she also writes for Kiss Metrics and other top quality authority sites. So if we click through to her post here and you can see itâ€™s got 156 comments, which is really really good by the way Now this is a large article and its all tips from all of these fantastic bloggers. Oh look thereâ€™s Anna and some other bloggers there that you might recognize from there. Now this is a very large article look at this, this is going to have a really good afternoon reading on this and all of these tips from known bloggers so itâ€™s worth giving this a really good read. In fact every article that you are going to comment on you are going to obviously read it because if you donâ€™t read it you canâ€™t comment on it, you wonâ€™t be able to know what you are talking about, itâ€™s not worth it. The idea here is not just to get a link, the idea here is to network and connect with other bloggers, but not just these sites. If we scroll do to the comments after we have read the article, which is huge!, letâ€™s have a look here. Right here Kristi does not have the hover icon because CommentLuv Premium allows you not to show that, but even so you know that people that are leaving comments like this are quality bloggers. Then you can click through to their post right here if it was interesting to you because they have good comments you know they are going to have good comments on their site as well, itsâ€™ just how it works. Now if youâ€™re not really into the SEO kind of thing have a look at http://justaskkim.com Now Kim does amazing articles about really useful stuff to use like application or online tools, things like that. Always you can find something of interesting on Kimâ€™s site. So letâ€™s have a look here. Again here is something. This is a really useful tool how to do the correct sized images and stuff like that online. Now after we have read the article we have a look at the links below. Now Kimâ€™s got Google+ comments, but below Google+ comments sheâ€™s got CommentLuv comments as well or wordpress comments that have CommentLuv on them. And straight away we can see that harlina has a plus on her icon and we hover over that we can see that some of her other posts sheâ€™s got some good lists posts as well and some of the other post she has commented on on this site you can see exactly that she likes to comment. 59 approved comments that means that sheâ€™s a good commenter and you can see that on you link that weâ€™ve two clicks on this exact comment and have 11 in total so sheâ€™s having a popular article that is getting clicked from CommentLuv on through to her article. So letâ€™s have a look. Harlina has CommentLuv Premium and letâ€™s have a look at this link. And here we go there is Harlina smiling â€œHelloâ€ù. Right, letâ€™s have a look down in the comments here just to make sure sheâ€™s got CommentLuv. Wow look at the size of this article. Now this is a pillar article. No wonder if itâ€™s had clicks. That is definitely worth an afternoon and you can see here that Shalu Shama sheâ€™s got a plus on her little hover icon there and she is talking about India. If you are an Indian blogger or you talk about Indian stuff this may be a site worth visiting because you will be in your niche and youâ€™ll be able to connect and network with this person. Letâ€™s Have a look. Yes sheâ€™s got some other good comments and posts and sheâ€™s commented 106 times on this site (ïÅ_) so definitely she likes to make comments. So if you go to her site you have an interesting and quality comment then you can be pretty sure that she is going to come and check you as well. And so thatâ€™s how you do it. Thatâ€™s how you do something called Blog Walking, but you have to do more than just visit the popular sites you have to visit the people that comment on those popular sites especially if they are in you niche. And thatâ€™s how networking is done.

However, ghostwriting is actually a type of writing that someone does for a client so that the client doesnâ€™t have to write it themselves. In most cases, the ghost writer doesnâ€™t get any credit for the work, but they get paid for their services. College students are usually in constant need of money for everything from books to classes and personal items. If youâ€™re a great writer in college, being a ghost writer can be a decent part-time job. Once you become established as a ghost writer, it can start to provide a constant income stream. There are several ways to become established as a ghost writer. You can advertise on places like Craigâ€™s List, in writing magazines, on Facebook, or even start your own website to advertise your services. Ghost writing pay varies greatly depending on your client and the length of the writing. It can pay as low as a few dollars to as high as thousands of dollars, depending on how good you are at it. Plus, it depends on the demand for your services and if youâ€™re capable of writing only one topic or multiple topics and styles of writing such as essays, web content, books, etc. Once you start ghost writing, you need to start building up your clientele and your reputation. The better your reputation, the more jobs you will get and the more money you can ask for. Word of mouth is a great way to do this, even though some may think it is old-fashioned. In truth, if you do ghost writing for your fellow college students, and they show it around and talk about how good you are, then this will greatly build up your reputation and help you to get more orders, and of course make more profits.  The more students that you can do ghostwriting for, the more traffic your website will receive if you have your own business website. For that reason, you need to bump up your online and offline advertising so that as many people as possible will know that you are a ghost writer looking for clients. Plus, if you do own a website, your website needs to be user friendly and easy to navigate and find. If you want a high ranking website it should also be optimized and always contain current and up to date information, including the type of ghost writing you do and the rates that you charge, as well as all of your pertinent contact information. The bottom line is that ghost writing can be a very interesting and profitable job for students to do in order to earn money to help them to finance their college and school activities. J.

Iâ€™m sorry about that but itâ€™s been a bit M.S.â€™y, a bit funny with my multiple sclerosis which, is you canâ€™t really predict whether your gonna be able to type or not. anyway, I seem to be getting some sort of equilibrium now with the medication that Iâ€™m on and also for the kindÂ of things that Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™ll be doing during the week, you know you just gotta reduce everything, the recipe for living with MS is just basically a recipe for a good life you know, you just got to eat nice and not get stressed and stuff like that. Anyway thatâ€™s not the point of this video well itâ€™s kind of really thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m on video instead of typing it out is because I donâ€™t know whether I can type or not beforehand you know itâ€™s not predictable.Â So what I will be doing is Iâ€™ll be making videos less than ten minutes long and Iâ€™ll send them out in theÂ newsletter. Now I know not everybody likes videos so Iâ€™m going to pay some guy on Fiverr who did my last transcription who did a really good job by the way (Iâ€™ll put you in the link below this video for him to do transcriptions of videos if you, you know use that sort of service) but anyway Iâ€™ll get it transcribed and then Iâ€™ll put the text of it on a blog post with the video on top so if you donâ€™t like videos, or you donâ€™t have time to watch videos, or youâ€™re at work and youâ€™re not allowed to watch videos then you can read the text or you can scan it and you can see if itâ€™s worth investigating more. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ll be doing from now on I hope thatâ€™s ok and you can be sure itâ€™ll be worth talking about because you know its gonna cost me at least a fiver every time I do it just to send you something, alright.Â (I wonder how many marketing messages I would have got from marketers if they had to pay a fiver for every oneÂ they sent. Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™d get less!) But anyway what I want to bring up in this video are three things : one is why Iâ€™m coming to you on video which I think Iâ€™ve just covered, score! Iâ€™m winning already. Two is a contest because Iâ€™ve committed to giving away at least one lifetime license to commentluv premium from now until I launch big every week, so I will tell you about that a little bit later, and number three: Iâ€™ve just made another simple sales video which is gonna be replacing the one thatâ€™s on the website right now the homepage of commentluv.com. I quite like it, but Iâ€™d like you to have a watch of it and then give me your feedback and any additions Ok now letâ€™s go revisit number two, the contest,this is going to be a way for anyone that is using the free version of commentluv to be able to win a lifetimeÂ licenses of commentluv premium and anti-backlinker which is doing fantastic things for anti spam by the way. now the way it works is anyone who uses the free version of the plugin and also the premium actually, it makes a phone back home and it just logs that site is using it and then from that it tells how many comments that they have that received some love, and as soon as they received at least one comment and you know theyâ€™ve given them love (given them a link) in the commentluv link then they are registered and they are eligible to winand if that person that wins on the week is a commentluv premium user well theyâ€™ve already got commentluv premium so they donâ€™t need a lifetime license I will let them transfer it to anyone so they can use it for a giveaway on their site and that will help them get more traffic and social shares and whatever it is that they require their users to do to enter the contest and so they get a free lifetime license to give away. quite valuable, pretty sweet huh? There will be another way to get another entry in there as well and that will involve getting onto a list and blah, blah, blah I will let you know about that next week because Iâ€™ve got to get all the dots of the iâ€™s and the crosses of the tâ€™s sorted for that one as well and for the sales video oh Iâ€™ve got loads to do!, and then Iâ€™m gonna show you the video now and if you can watch the video and then let me know what you think of it thatâ€™d be sweet so, here it comes. So whatâ€™d you think then?Â Itâ€™s a short, little, simple video and itâ€™s just a highlight you know the getting more comments, and encouraging,Â and rewarding readers, and for protecting you against spam. What do you reckon? Feedback. just let me know in the comments or on the Facebook page or in by email, ah yeah thatâ€™s the thing I want to say, if you want to send me an email thatâ€™s fine I will read every single email that I receive, but I may not be able to respond to it with tappity, tappity fingers for reasons Iâ€™ve said before so if you just want to ask a question then please do just cause if there are other people that ask the same question then I can answer that question on the next weeks video how bout that?, I donâ€™t have to type anything and also you get to ask all loads of stuff and I get to answer loads of stuff. Good idea right? So donâ€™t forget, feedback about the video, and anything else you want to say.

Have you heard about it yet? I was shocked when a friend, yes a real human, told me I was displaying symptoms of the addiction. The symptoms go in stages from 1 to 5 and 5 being the most serious. This is just crazy. Would you walk down the street and ask a complete stranger to like you. What a desperado you would be! Well people are doing this loud and clear..By the way do you like me? Sorry I might still have a problem! Anyway this is where it all starts. Collecting friends and followers by asking people to like you is stage one of the Obsessive compulsive social media disorder. It is especially bad for people that do not have friends in real life. Gathering 1000 friends is like a bag of gold for some. Status addiction is having the urgent need to update your status on Facebook or maybe tweet on twitter. For example: My friend and I were going to see Cold Play at Splendour in the Grass and we had to walk to the main stage before the big crowd came. The walk was only 5 mins at the most but my friend stopped and said, â€œWait a sec I have to update my status. My followers will be wondering what I am doing?â€ùÂù So we stopped. The updating status task took longer than we thought and when we finally started walking the stampede came. It then took us closer to an hour to walk the 5 min trip. We also missed out on getting close to the stage! I blame my friendâ€™s status addiction for that! Another tell tale sign of status addiction is when a person posts personal details on a business account like, â€œjust having breakfast..then doing some start jumps..ready for blogging.â€ùÂù Ok I am happy to hear that! NOT! But wait! Did you remember to feed the dog? We have all seen this. People posting absolute rubbish to their own loyal  . Do you show any signs of this symptom? So you have a website and you wanted to look popular. The â€œasking strangers to like youâ€ùÂù gig was not working out for you..Strangers were rude and did not want to like you. This is when you came up with the brilliant idea to press your own social media buttons. Press press press and the count goes up! Wow I am popular! You are so addicted to pressing your own social media buttons that you just have to move on and do more. That s when you start making more   under your 100 new aliasâ€™s you just created with your 100 new Gmail email accounts. Your social status is going through the roof! Its time to party and celebrate. When your social media accounts are listed on an Excel spreadsheet then you know you have a serious problem. The person that has got to this stage of the addiction by starting with what seemed to be a harmless task of â€œpressing your own buttonsâ€ùÂù. But then people kept asking â€œWow how do you get so many LIKES?â€ùÂù Instead of telling the truth and admitting their addiction they casually start claiming social media expertise. The other person looks at them in AWE and this makes the addiction worse! This is a difficult symptom to pick out because there might actually be some real social media experts out there. But donâ€™t be fooled because people with â€œObsessive compulsive social media disorderâ€ùÂù can look just like a real expert. If you are showing any signs of this addiction you need to seek help fast. I have just joined â€œObsessive compulsive social media disorder anonymousâ€ùÂù and I will share a few tips with you: Look out for the symptoms so you do not catch this addiction yourself and be sure to press my buttons for me as I am a recovering Obsessive Compulsive Social Media Disorder success story!",Mitz Pantic
05/04/2014,http://comluv.com/the-history-of-chocolate/,The History of Chocolate - ComLuv,"Chocolate has been called the divine substance and the gift of the gods. And really, who can argue with that? Chocolate has become the worldâ€™s favourite dessert food and an outright obsession for many chefs and food connoisseurs alike. But it hasnâ€™t always been this way. Until the mid 1500s no one in Europe had even heard of chocolate and it was a full 300 years after that that chocolate achieved mass appeal. So where did chocolate come from and how did this worldwide obsession with chocolate begin? We can trace the origins of chocolate back more than 2,000 years to the time of the ancient Mayans. They discovered that the pods of the cacao tree could be ground up with other spices such as chilli peppers and corn meal to make a delicious, though somewhat bitter beverage. Cacao seeds were offered as gifts to the gods and used in a number of ancient rituals. By the height of the Aztec Empire, around the year 1400, cacao was a major commodity which was traded between the Aztecs, the Mayans and others. The Aztecs would often require that the people they conquered pay tribute in the form of cacao seeds. These seeds were so valuable that the Aztecs eventually used them as a form of currency. When Columbus discovered America, the Spanish were eager to introduce the beverage to Europe and its fame quickly spread. It was so expensive that only the wealthy could afford it and so sweetened chocolate became a symbol of status and nobility. In France, chocolate was exclusively reserved for members of the royal court. It wasnâ€™t until the 1800s that chocolate Despite the mechanical advances, cacao is still grown in much the same way it was 2,500 years ago. It only grows in tropical climates, today mostly in West Africa, and is still harvested, dried and roasted by hand. What has changed is the way cacao is used today. Itâ€™s not only the worldâ€™s number one dessert, with an ever widening variety of recipes and versatility as a food, itâ€™s used in a number of non-food applications as well, such as cosmetics and medicine. In fact, despite the common myth that chocolate can cause acne, chocolate is actually good for the skin and maybe even help  . Dark chocolate contains antioxidants that improve the health of your skin. It also seems to provide some protection from the damage caused by UV rays and overexposure to the sun. In its latest form of decadence, chocolate can be used as a bath to improve the feel, tone and texture of your skin. The chemicals in chocolate can also have a medical benefit. These chemicals not only act as a  , but also help lower blood pressure, improve cognitive ability and lower cholesterol. But of course, if youâ€™re like me, youâ€™ll agree that the greatest of all of chocolateâ€™s benefits is the taste!

You start a blog for just passing the free time or getting the attention on the internet, but if it also give you some Monetary Gain as well. Hence you start looking for an ad agency to give you some ad material. You found out Google Adsense and you thought now I can make money easily. But after some days of applying you got rejected why ?  is the largest ad agency in the world. That is why every blogger and webmaster are running after them that has made very difficult to get accepted by   for new blogger.Â Now I have come with some basic guidelines that might lead you to get accepted by adsense. So before applying on adsense make sure that you are following all the guidelines listed below. An about page is very important for a blog. Not that will make your relationship better with your better but it will also help new readers to know what is your blog is about. When you apply for Google Adsense make sure you have created a about page and have given a link to it in the primary navigational menu. Without this page you will have zero chance of being accepted, so make sure you have written Â a good description of you and your blog and represented it on the primary navigational menu. This is one of the main reason that fails most the new blogger by accepted in the  . Privacy policy is a description that describe to your readers that what are the personal information about them you are storing. Most of the people thinks that what is the need of having a privacy policy on a blog. But they are wrong, you should have a privacy policy. And it costs nothing and will only take 5-10 minutes with an online privacy policy generator tool. So make sure you have a privacy policy when applying for Google Adsense. You can create a privacy policy from   for free. I have seen many blogger who got rejected because   said that you donâ€™t have enough content to generate ads. Now Google has not provided any fix number of posts which will qualified for this. For my calculation if you have 60 posts with an average of 700 words per post, then it will be enough for Google Adsense. So make sure you got at least 60 posts before applying for  . It is very important that you should provide a contact us page on your blog. Most of the premium themes has a template for giving a contact us page. Just you have to choose the contact us page template while creating a new page. If you do not have a premium theme or your theme doesnâ€™t provide you a contact us page then you can use the plugin like contact form 7 for creating a contact us page. If thatâ€™s also more of work then leave a email id there and make sure the comment tab is open on that page. So the reader can contact you by that email or by commenting on that page as well. So before applying for   create a contact us page and before applying please test it one time. Your site or blogâ€™s design play a very important role while applying for  . If you a irregular structure then you have zero probability of getting accepted by Google Adsense. But why a good design is necessary ? A good design doesnâ€™t means that you have good pictures or good animation from CSS or Javascript. A good design means you must have a clear navigational menu through which you can link to any post of the blog. Your menu must show all the main categories and primary pages such as Home, About us, Privacy Policy etc. If you do not have a good navigational menu than you will be rejected because you didnâ€™t follow the Google Webmaster Guidelines. Now be aware what are you writing, Google Adsense do not accept blogs which have illegal, Porn or adult, drugs related content etc. I think you have know about adult or drugs related content but let me give you some more explanation about â€œIllegal Materialâ€ù . Here illegal material can be articles which There are things which I thought was illegal but it wasnâ€™t. Those things are tutorial on how to Jailbreak or root a smartphone etc. So make sure before applying on Google Â Adsense that you doesnâ€™t have these types of materials. While submitting an application to Google adsense make sure you have written all of your details correctly. Its because if you found of providing wrong info about you then your account can be rejected and if approved then it will be banned after some time. Those days are over when Google Adsense accepts those blogs which have their blogs on blogspot or on wordpress. For getting accepted into the Google Adsense you have to spend some money and have to buy a Top Level Domain name such .com, So donâ€™t try for Google Adsense if you are still on Blogspot or wordpress sublevel domains. You are getting very high traffic after starting a blog because you bought some traffic from a traffic exchange site. Then beware Google hates paid traffic, you should never buy traffic because it wonâ€™t give you any benefit. Now to overcome this factor â€œ â€œ. So in six month, if you work properly you will have a good traffic and then apply for Google Adsense. If you have doneÂ plagiarism on some post then delete those post remove that content before applying for Google Adsense. You can check the forÂ plagiarism with some online tools such as Copyscape. Now images tells is necessary to describe the content or the post. So you searched the Google and got the images. But before using the images first check is they having a â€œ â€ù or not. So for those images you used that doesnâ€™t have a Creative Common License, you have to remove them. Donâ€™t bother to apply without removing them because your application will be discarded saying that it is doing the â€œCopyright Infringementâ€ù .",Rohit Sharma

Probably not. So what makes you think that you can start an online business if you havenâ€™t gone through any kind of business school? You probably have a clue where Iâ€™m going with it. (Donâ€™t get me wrong though. Iâ€™m not ranting on anyone here, which you will realize in just a moment.) Of course, having some business education canâ€™t possibly harm you, but do you really need it in order to succeed? When building a nuclear power plant you surely do, but is online business any different when you boil it down to the essential skills and knowledge? My answer is both  . Hereâ€™s what I mean. There are basically two ways of obtaining knowledge about anything. You can either get it through a precise, thorough school-like process (by learning and memorizing lots of theoretical material), or through action and gaining experience from a first person perspective. Therefore, there are also two kinds of activities you can pursue: Experience driven activities require very little education to get started. These are the things you can start doing right away and figure stuff out along the way. Knowledge driven activities, on the other hand, require a bigger amount of fundamental education to get started. These are the things that you canâ€™t be doing if you donâ€™t have enough expertise. I believe that online business lies somewhere in between, and thatâ€™s the beauty of it. Basically, you can start with next to zero knowledge,Â have some  , figure the essential stuff out along the way, launch a website, offer something to the world, and adjust later. Iâ€™m saying this because the starting activities are not that difficult. You donâ€™t have to be a rocket scientist to be successful. There are only two mandatory requirements: the desire to make it happen and the will to put some hard work into the project (well, some amount of money may be useful too). Then if you want to take your online business to the next level, some specific, targeted education/data/advice might come handy. You might have to consult with someone more experienced and more knowledgeable than you, or go through a training program. However, the starting point is available to everybody.  when it comes to the online business world. Letâ€™s get one thing straight. Iâ€™m not here to convince you that you need or donâ€™t need education to be an online entrepreneur.  , find out what your opinion is. : You can choose only one of these paths.

Probably because there are few statements that hold so much truth to them. Even in day and age where the Internet and technology make it that you never have to leave the confines of your own home, being part of a group, community or posse can really make all the difference in cyberspace. In the old west, when charged with the task of hunting someone down the sheriff would form up a posse. But these guys he would enlist werenâ€™t there to keep the lawman company. They were there to help keep the sheriff safe from someone who made their living killing and robbing innocent people. Fast forward to modern day society and you see the same mentality in street gangs. Kids who donâ€™t want to get messed with join up with a group. Drug dealers who donâ€™t want their product and profits to be fair game findâ€ùÂ_ safety in numbers. Of course no one expects you to pick up a baseball bat or a bike chain and ready yourself for a cyber rumble with the Gramercy Riffs. But the world online can be a scary place so having a few friends to help watch your back might not be such a bad idea. We all know not to open email attachments from people we donâ€™t know, and downloading just about anything from file sharing sites means an infected computer when you are done. But these attacks pale in comparison to the sophistication and deception involved with a malicious website. We all love how dynamic and interactive websites let us do so much more than the boring old static web pages of the early 90s. The problem is that each time you are allowed to upload, post or insert anything to a website the possibility for something nasty to be used is there. And Iâ€™m not talking about the seven dirty words you canâ€™t say on television. Malicious code on a website can steal your data, your identity, your financial information â€“ it can infect your computer or trick you into giving up just about any information it wants. Some websites In either instance, wouldnâ€™t it be nice if you were warned as to which websites may be harmful? Buying a cheap piece of crap may not be as threatening as a Cross Site Scripting attack that steals your banking information, however it is more likely to happen. One of the biggest complaints about ecommerce is that the product you receive does not quite compare to what you saw online. Guess, what? Your posse could help out here too. Amazon.com made their bones with user recommendations. People could log in and find out what the community thought of the book (or product) they were about to buy. Cooler still was the fact that if something was less expensive somewhere else, you could find out about it. Of course, social shopping is everywhere nowadays. You can find the lowest prices and reviews of just about everything. The problem is, you really donâ€™t know who it is that is recommending something. The crowd isnâ€™t your friends, they are just random people. When it comes to getting healthier, having friends to rely on can really make a huge difference. Having a posse to watch your back will keep you focused on your goals. They will encourage you to get active and keep you from chowing down on that third slice of sausage and pepperoni pizza.  can also help you find the best places to get healthy. It can be something as simple as recommending a new gym to join, finding the yoga class with other singles or perhaps you just need to find a group to go trail running with. Having a posse means having people who share the same goal (or interests) as you. It is symbiotic. You watch their back, they watch yours and it works because there is a relationship built around something. Maybe it is the fact that you share a favorite movie, or you all like the same soccer team. Quite possibly the group centers around learning Quantum Physics. Or maybe, you all just want to find the best burger in town.",Jeff

Your home should be a place where you and your children feel safe throughout the day, but you also need some peace of mind when you are away. Protecting yourself against things such as home invasion, burglary or just plain old vandalism is an active process. Most people donâ€™t give much thought to their security, even though   can save you from disaster. The best way of scaring away potential burglars at night is having an area of your yard suddenly light up as they approach. These lights are also useful because they save power as they are only on for about 10-20 seconds at a time. Make sure you install them all around the perimeter as burglars prefer back-doors and low windows that canâ€™t be seen from the street clearly. A large dog in your yard will scare away even the most determined burglar. Their incredible hearing and sense of smell allow them to notice potential threats from a mile away, while their protective nature makes them perfect for home defense. The dog doesnâ€™t have to be that big though, small dogs can be extremely loud and untrusting of strangers, often waking up half the neighborhood with their barking and alerting you of intruders early on. The biggest mistake people make is to assume that burglars donâ€™t operate during the day. The next big mistake is to open the curtains on all the windows facing the street. While this is a great way of getting plenty of natural light, it also gives a clear view into your home to any criminal passing by. Make sure all the windows are locked down tightly and that the curtains are closed to prevent anyone from seeing inside. A number of high bushes and a few trees in your yard may seem very aesthetically pleasing, but they allow a burglar to sneak into your home unnoticed. Keep all the greenery well-trimmed and low, and if you must have some sort All the doors leading into your home from the outside should be heavy,  . A sturdy wooden front door is of little use if a person can knock down you back door with a couple of kicks. If you can access the house through the garage, that door should also be fortified. You can find decent floor locks and deadbolts for a reasonable price. Having an efficient way of communicating with other family members in case of emergency is very important. Cell phones can get misplaced and your battery could die, so having walkie-talkies in several locations throughout the home allows you to communicate with other family members no matter what happens. A good set of walkie-talkies can last for years. As far as maintenance goes youâ€™ll need some extra batteries and a spare   or two. A flashlight near the bed and some extra batteries will ensure that you can get your family to safety in low-light conditions. Most burglars and home invaders will make a beeline towards the master bedroom, as most valuables are often locked up there, so youâ€™ll want to lock it up tight and perhaps hide most of your valuables elsewhere, preferably in a safe deposit box. You also need to choose a room to be your safe room â€“ usually itâ€™s the kidâ€™s room or the master bedroom â€“ and install a strong door with multiple locks like on the front and back door. If you have a gun in the house make sure the safe is easily accessible and that you have plenty of backstop, e.g. heavy bookshelves that can stop bullets. These are some of the most effective passive precautions you can take to ensure the safety of your home. Most of them are one-time investments that will last for years and years with minimal maintenance, so focus on the very best equipment that you can afford.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

In fact, this article is rather a recommendation on how the blogging about technology should be done from the point of view of a loyal reader and follower of many tech blogs out there. I have always been (and still am) extremely interested in technology, computers in particular. I find, following the authority tech blogs may be one of the best and easiest ways to stay up-to-date with what is going on in technology nowadays. However, many new tech blogs I have come across as a reader fail to excite my curiosity or sometimes make me question their credibility. As a long-time reader of tech blogs and a proud owner of aÂ  , I came up with a list of recommendations directed specifically at those blogging about technology. However, I find that every point could, to some extent, be useful for any type of blog. It is hard to think of any other kind of information that becomes irrelevant as fast as the news about technology. Staying up-to-date with a tech blog may be a challenge, but being relevant is the only way to make the readers to pay attention to what you have to say. Even if you are not delivering breaking news in tech on a daily basis, it pays to update the older articles, or link to posts about recent changes. When you write about technology, it is important to remember that a picture is worth a thousand words. The way you package your information can mean a world of difference. You can write an e-book about how to Technology is a broad term, but you do not have to cover its every aspect to call yourself aÂ  . Established tech authority blogs who write just about anything related to technology also have a few things none of the newbie bloggers have â€“ a crowd of loyal readers and a dozen of professional writers. Writing about a little bit of everything may not resonate with your readers, and makes you less likely to appear as an expert on the subject. Finding your angle and your place in the field may be just what you need to succeed. I cannot emphasize it enough, it is essential for articles related to technology to have the date of when they were published. It is incredibly frustrating for me as a reader of the technology blog to not be able to tell how old the piece of information is. How am I supposed to know if the article is still relevant? It may not matter to me whether the oatmeal cookie recipe I find on a culinary blog was posted in 2006 or 2013. However, I prefer learning about latest in technology from a recent post to wondering whether I stumbled upon a manuscript from the last century. It is easy to assume that the terms you are using are familiar to the readers of your blog. I sometimes feel that many bloggers lose out on potential return visitors to their blog by not providing guidance and introduction to beginners. I have been in a situation a few times before, when I had to scavenger for information on my own, find pieces here and there, in order to be able to make sense of what the bloggers were talking about. I have accidentally ran into some of those blogs later and have been following them since. However, I have missed out on those where it was much left to be desired in terms of basic explaining, so that the things could make more sense to those new to the topic. If you are thinking to make it in blogging about technology, donâ€™t ever expect to rest on your laurels. It has a lot to do with constantly evolving technology and the necessity to stay up-to-date in order to be relevant. Educating yourself and staying tuned could be fun if technology is what you are really passionate about. Passion is a good thing to find, because it is often times the only thing that keeps dreamers going when things get rough. Thank you for making it this far in the article, and good luck in your journey!",Aliaksandra L

In fact when people began discussing the various uses and purposes of Google Glasses it was pretty evident that it was thought of as a unique technology of wearable computers that could bring about a whole new revolution with respect to various kinds of activities, but whoever thought that it would enter all the realms of the society! The explorer program was one where in Google chose to ship of 8000 pieces of the Glass to various people all over the globe. These people all belonged to various different fields and not just information technology. It enabled Google, and of course the explorer of the various uses and benefits of Google Glasses in their respective industries. The Google Glasses are a set of wearable computers that can be worn on your eyes just like an ordinary pair of spectacles. People can put it on like they do any simple pair of glasses and you are good to go! However, the Glasses donâ€™t actually have glasses in them. It is just a thin frame that sits on your brow looking like eyeglasses. However, the latest version comes with a twist and go set of glasses with different frames that you can fit into your Glass to help you look trendy while taking care of its functionality. The recent version of Glass comes in a titanium frame which is strong and yet flexible and lightweight enough to sit atop any pair of the designs they offer. Google offers 4 frames for prescription glasses and 3 for shades to enjoy the sunny side. See, the thing about futuristic technology is that sometimes people find it extremely irrelevant in the present times. This is probably the biggest reason so as to why we her of the Glass haters and attackers every now and then. Did you read about that good natured lady who was attacked at a bar because she was wearing the Glass? Well, it has definitely caught my attention and made me realise that I for one donâ€™t want to flaunt it around. I guess the bigger question here is whether the people are ready to accept it as a device that does not attack personal privacy. I mean, people are okay with being clicked with a smart phone or a tablet, but suspicion rises when it comes to the glass because of lack of awareness. Your best bet to survive it would be to explain to people how the Glass works and how it does not hurt anyoneâ€™s privacy! You must try to Google Glasses have honestly touched almost every industry imaginable. This is the biggest reason why people are hopeful that this technology is sure to bring about some massive improvements in this direction. The Google Glasses has provided to be the most useful in the industry of medicine. It allows doctors to record and telecast it directly to doctors â€˜liveâ€™ through the internet to other doctors all over the world. This will help surgeons help other surgeons to ensure that the surgery ends up being successful. It will also prove to be beneficial for aspiring doctors who can get first hand feeds from senior doctors. Surgeons can teach juniors and interns how they worked on particular cases from a point of view. Earlier when people would record using a camera, it would have to be shifted from hand to hand with a lot of difficulty. It would also be very distracting for the doctor who must focus on attending to the patient rather than taking care of the video feed. Fire fighters too go through a tough time saving lives and property. Using the Google Glasses helps them locate the stress call to ensure that they can function well. The glass can keep updating them of the present scenario and other requisite data. The glass will automatically notify the wearer of the location of distress and provide a map right in front of their eyes. It will also help in locating the people who are stuck in various situations of problems. There has been an amazing app that has been developed for Google Glasses which allows you to see the trailer of a movie when you look at its poster. This will prove to be a revolutionary feat for the entertainment industry where in people will be able to highlight and showcase their movies and series in the most attractive ways. The show business will see a boom like never before. If any industry needs marketing and business development strategies the most, it is the fashion industry. With so much competition, it is only meet that an application is designed that allows people to showcase their designs to customers in the most customizable way. It can allow fashion brands give a virtual look of the dress or attire in question to the wearer. Advertisements play a very important role in the business world today. Google Glasses application development has led to creating apps that will give the user a better understanding of the products. Glasses are unique not only because they can make the whole experience unique for the developer, but also change the way the things can work out for the sellers as well. On the whole there are so many different uses of Google Glasses that are yet to be explored. Google Glasses are futuristic in every sense. There are so many different possibilities and scope of development with Google Glasses that it will mark an era of a much more digitally acclimatised and technologically advanced.",JillElliott

This move is just another one of the changes that have been made by Marissa Mayer, the Chief Executive Officer.

Last year, the company had announced a program that was designed for recycling user IDs that were inactive. This allowed new users to claim email addresses, which had not been used in the past year. The elimination of the sign-in feature with Google and Facebook credentials is reversal of a strategy that had been adopted by the company in 2010 and 2011 when the company had been under the control of the CEO, Carol Bartz. Mayer, who is herself a former Google executive, has reversed this strategy. According to a spokesperson of the company, the new sign-in process for the Tourney Pickâ€™Em will initiate from Monday.

16/03/2014,http://comluv.com/customer-service-the-customer-is-always-right/,Customer Service - The Customer is always right? - ComLuv,"Working in   for the majority of my career this mantra has been something that I have very much tried to live my life by.Â  I have not taken it to extremes by looking at businesses providing me with shoddy service and abraiding them for their lack of service, but have always tried to go the extra mile for my customers not only to earn their loyalty and repeat business, but simply because it just seemed to make sense to me! Now I do not want to minimize this in any way, there have been many instances where providing that extra level of service has been extremely difficult and I am proud to say that in more than one instance I have turned a potentially   into a raving fan, simply by going that extra mile.Â  Providing useful and relevant information to a client experiencing problems during the course of the issue has helped me more than once and sometimes calling back even if you do not have a new update means they know that you have not forgotten about them. UnfortunatelyÂ there are many instances where the customer is not right and dealing with these situations is a lot more difficult. When customers abuse your staff it is simply wrong.Â  There is never a justification for this and while you can tell your employees not to take it personally and that they are not mad at them, but rather the company, being called names and made to feel belittled is absolutely unjustifiable.Â  Your employees are really the key resource in your company.Â  It is not the what you manufacture, the service you sell or the product you maintain that actually defines your company, but rather the people that make those things and maintain them for you.Â  They are your true salespeople and your best resource. When customer service impacts employee morale, your employees need to come first â€“ while it might be difficult and costly to obtain a new customer, it is often significantly more costly to find and train a new employee.Â  In addition, by siding with the customer to the detriment of your staff, you impact your whole internal culture which has a knock on effect in many other ways. Isaac Asimov a great Science Fiction writer created what are now known as the three laws of robotics which are as follows: These same laws can be very much paraphrased in your approach to Customer Service and the client.Â  There are many businesses that sell multiple lines of service and while some of your customers might only purchase a portion of your total set of services, you cannot and should not treat them differently than other customers.Â  Correspondingly thoseÂ â€œlargerâ€ù customers should not by default take precedence over your smaller customers.Â  While money does talk, no one is saying that you should not help and assist them but it should not be at the expense of a smaller business who is also your customer.Â  Customer Service is about treating all of your customers as equally as possible. A great example of this is a service business.Â  This business has a booked, scheduled and paid for installation date for one of their services with small client A.Â  Unfortunately on the day of the installation, big client B has a service outage and the onlyÂ  person that can resolve the issue is the same engineer that is going out to client A.Â  While it might make sense to tell customerÂ A that you need to delay, you need to realize that they have built plans and possibly have other companies arriving for follow on work based on the work that they are expecting you to do.Â  Your appeasing big client B will not only lose you the business of client A now, but also the follow on business that they might be able to bring to you in the future. Customers often want the moon and while they might be willing to pay for it, sometimes it is just wrong to give in to their demands.Â  Company ethics â€“ while they might in some instances seem to be in short supply! â€“ need to drive your decisions and guide you as while the money might make you want to give in, there are very good reasons why you sometimes should not.Â  A very good example of this is the unfortunate plight of the staff at the News of the World.Â  This old and established newspaper (while not a high brow newspaper) was unfortunately embroiled in the recent scandal relating to Phone Hacking in the UK and this has not only forced the closure of the paper â€“ impacting all of the employees â€“ but has also escalated into other larger parts of the Rupert Murdoch empire. When you have a customer that is plain wrong, there really is only one option.Â  As hard as it may be to hear, they need to stop being your customer.Â  This means that if you are the owner or manager of a store, they are told â€“ politely â€“ that they are no longer welcome and while this may be hard to do (as they will be undoubtedly irate) it is really the only option that you have available to yourself if you are at all concerned about the long term viability of your business.Â  While this might have a negative impact on your bottom line in most cases this is a short term impact and if you continue to provide good customer service to the rest of your customers, one that you will be able to get over.Â  You do obviously always need to keep things like the   in mind and if this one customer accounts for 80% of your business your options are somewhat limited and your best case scenario in that instance is to spend significant efforts in growing your other customers.Â  This is obviously easier said than done, but I think it is safe to say that this is not a common scenario and if a customer is large enough to account for 80% of your business then they are generally professional enough not to be responsible for the issues mentioned above.",Hutch Morzaria

I have analyzed the many mistakes I have made in my past career, which I can now tell you and so, should help you to avoid making them yourself. If you have an ability to write content for websites or blogs then you can start your freelance writing career today. But, keep this in mind, youâ€™ll not make money if you donâ€™t stop yourself from making the mistakes I made in my past career. Today, when it comes to writing, many new freelance writers, even the professional writers often make mistakes. They wonâ€™t think writing a long paragraph might put off the reader away from its content. The article should be written in a point to point way. Let me describe these common mistakes.  â€“ If you write about something which has already been written by someone else, it will definitely be of no use as people on internet are searching for latest information. For instance, if you write an article for a tech blog, the article should have new tech information as nobody will appreciate the old stuff unless you bring a new perspective to it.  â€“ This could make your readers run away from your articles. I have seen many articles containing 10 to 12 lines and it is the common mistake I was making for the first few months. If the paragraph has 4 to 5 lines in it, people enjoy reading the content but if it becomes a long never ending novel, it becomes  â€“ Another big mistake most of the writers make. Let me explain by my own experience, since the day I got to know keywords are the key to be found through search engines, I started placing them in all my articles without even thinking where to place and how many to place. People search with keywords on search engines to get the things they want to read but this could create many troubles for you if you dont have the proper knowledge of keyword placing. I prefer to let it be natural.  â€“ This could affect your audience the most, I have learned from few of my past articles not to be over smart. Use simple words and make your articles readable. Readers wonâ€™t be happy if your articles required a dictionary for them to understand, use words that are in daily use.  â€“ I know many times I tried to make my small topic into a bigger one by adding few extra paragraphs. You have seen a few blogs content, they talk on and on until they complete few extra paragraphs, then the required stuff comes out. Now I realized readers do not want the extra stuff, they are reading my articles to get the things they really want to read â€“ not the extra stuff! Iâ€™m not the most successful writer but just a little drop in an ocean full of professional writers. Being a freelance writer is very tough and to survive it requires lot of time and hard work. After fixing my mistakes I have one motto, give your best effort and you will get the reward in the end. I hope my mistakes can become a lesson for others to learn and will not follow, so the future becomes bright.",Irfan Siddiqui
14/03/2014,http://comluv.com/10-no-brainer-tips-for-making-money-with-affiliate-marketing/,10 No Brainer Tips for Making Money with Affiliate Marketing - ComLuv,"I know how hard it is to make money with affiliate marketing and I am always looking for an easy way. In theory affiliate marketing is quite simple; you place an affiliate link on the Internet, people click on it and purchase the product, and then you get a commission. If only it were that simple? Most people think it is that simple and are extremely disappointed when they cannot make money with affiliate marketing. I know that people also say that it is easy to make money with Google AdSense, and even I am guilty of this, but we all know that everything takes work. I cannot give you a magic bullet to make money with affiliate marketing, but I can give you a few tips. If your website is about dogs then please have content about dogs. When people start veering off their subject they start to lose sales. Just think about it, why would a dog lover want to read about a cat? Or why would a person with a German Sheppard want to read about a Bullterrier? It is even better to have a more precise topic. By now we all know how important it is to researching a niche topic to blog about. It is also great to focus on one goal per page. Do not give people too many options as you will only confuse them. Just as you have focused on a clear subject, you also need to match your products with that subject. Often people find a particular product and try selling it because they like it. This will not get you sales. The people that are visiting your blog must want to buy the product that you sell. You should ask yourself a few questions when choosing the right product to sell. You must have these first two steps figured out before you move on. When searching for affiliate marketing products to sell, never limit your possibilities by only searching the companies you know and are familiar with. For example most people seem to stick to Commission junction and Clickbank products when there are so many other options out there. You can use any number of affiliate marketing companies in one website as there are no rules stopping you from doing so. I urge you to explore more affiliate marketing companies as they all offer different products to sell. What about Shareasale.com, Regnow.com, Ebay.com, Paydot.com, Neverblue.com, Linkshare.com, Amazon.com, Onenetworkdirect.com? Need I mention more. Always strive to get out of your comfort zone and spread your affiliate marketing wings. Some programs require you prove an established income on the internet, but others are free to join, without any qualifications. Are you in it for the money or do you have a genuine passion for your topic? Did you know that people will trust you more if they can see your passion? Maybe if you show some personality or the real you they also might trust you more. There are probably 1000 ways to gain trust but it helps if you are genuine in the first place. Again I have to talk about focusing on your topic and the right keywords. Anchor text in a back link pointing to a particular article is very important and the details do count. For example if you have a review for an Apple laptop and your anchor text says  , but when people click the link they find a review for a HP laptop. This is deceiving and people will be disappointed with Lets be clear here. It is not how much traffic you can get to an affiliate sales page, it is how much targeted traffic you can get that makes the sales. You cannot always expect a sale from your visitors but you must expect them to sign up for your list. You need to impress them with the free gift because you will only get one chance with most people. If you are letting the visitors go without giving them a chance to sign up to your list, you are seriously wasting your time. Just think, if you get people to sign up to a list you have a few more chances to communicate with them and wave your affiliate marketing links in front of them. That is so nice of you to give gifts away for free, but we all know that you have an ulterior motive. Giving away a free report is a perfect tool to use to make money with affiliate marketing. Especially if you give away a report that people find extremely valuable and hang on to or share with their friends. Have your affiliate links in a free report along with links back to your website. If you do not do this you are wasting a great resource for making money with affiliate marketing. Take a good look at my gift I give to my subscribers when they sign up for my list about   from scratch. Let me just say it is not the most perfectly formed giveaway but I am still improving on this. Investigate, research, and then write about affiliate products on your blog. People actually want to know other peopleâ€™s opinions about stuff before they buy them. Donâ€™t think you can just slap something together though. People are not stupid and can feel when something is not genuine. Use the products that you recommend on your blog. I have a blog about building WordPress websites and I only recommend the products that I use on that blog. The products all relate to WordPress and I am using them all which makes these products very targeted for my niche. For another example I have a computer related website and if I recommend a computer maintenance program that I use myself, I definitely sell more. â€œThe proof is in the pudding.â€ù Sometimes people see me using a product or doing something on my blog and ask me what it is. It is usually a product that I sell and make money with affiliate marketing. Surround yourself with what you sell and people will know that you believe in that product. Did you know that you can contact an affiliate marketing manager for either an affiliate company like Neverblue or the product owner themselves. Many people neglect to communicate with the â€œpeople in the knowâ€ù and lose out on sales because of this. I have constant contact with product owners as they help me to sell their products. They also give me freebies to give away which the website visitors love. Get closer to the products you sell and get some inside help. There is no doubt you will make more money this way. See my latest  . One of the main keys to make money with affiliate marketing is to focus on a topic. Focus, focus, focus. Then when you know what your topic is and what keywords you need to use, you can then create content and then build backlinks to it. Match the people to the products and you will have a winning combination. Affiliate marketing is not rocket science but some people can make it look difficult.

13/03/2014,http://comluv.com/the-six-main-myths-of-making-it-online/,The Six Main Myths Of Making It Online - ComLuv,"Most people come to the idea of making a living from online services through a desire to improve their work/life balance, enhance the quality of their career and free up more time to spend on the things they love, and less at work. However, often there can be some serious misconceptions relating to how easy it is to make a living using the internet, and many potential entrepreneurs fall by the wayside once it becomes apparent that running an online business is a bit tougher than they expected. It always makes me grin when people speak about the internet as if we were still in the heady days of the online boom. These days, making a living online is highly possible, but only if youâ€™re prepared to put in a lot of time, effort and energy. The customers I have that succeed are the ones that fully understand that working for yourself online takes just as much commitment (or usually more) as any other career, and the likelihood of stumbling across a winning formula for success that doesnâ€™t need any effort is minimal at best. People who assume that working from home means that they never need to set foot out of their front door again to make their business work are probably not going to make their business work! Although most of what we do is conducted through online networking via Skype, Facebook, LinkedIn and other virtual communities, no business can survive if it is conducted purely in isolation. Apart from the fact that most of us would go crackers if we were holed up day after day with a laptop in some dusty basement, we really do need to network face to face to get the most from our business relationships. Breakfast meetings, clubs and social events are all just as crucial to good networking as staying in and chewing the fat over Skype! Unless you know something that I donâ€™t, Unless you happen to be the one person in a million who manages to stumble across a really unique and innovative idea that goes viral, donâ€™t expect to make your fortune and retire to sunny climes for the rest of your days from your online business. Successful online businesses need strategic thinking to stay ahead of the competition. With the rapid shifts and trends which take place each day in the online world, we each of us need to be really focused on where we are headed, to achieve our goals. Understanding where you are, and what you want to achieve is much easier if you have a strategic game plan in place to follow, which reflects your industry niche, your capabilities, and your aspirations. This is not a true reflection of online business, as there is never an area which has been focused upon so much, that there is nothing else to do with it. Even if your market sector is saturated, itâ€™s worth thinking of ways that you can provide a unique twist on to existing services to make them a success. When Henry Ford started making cars, they werenâ€™t the only cars in the market â€“ he just devised a strategy to make them better. Similarly, the online world always has potential for new innovations and fresh takes on existing ideas. No-one starts out with an innate knowledge of the net when they start out in business online. However, they pick up knowledge as they go along, gaining more experience. The beauty of our industry is that there are always talented people out there to support us with areas of our business that we may not be experts in â€“ it makes sense to play to your individual strengths, and let the experts take care of the rest! Never let a lack of knowledge get in the way of a fine idea â€“ hit the books, call the experts, and youâ€™ll succeed online.",Andrew Rondeau
11/03/2014,http://comluv.com/when-less-costs-more-a-quick-guide-to-outsourcing-for-new-marketers/,When Less Costs More A Quick Guide To Outsourcing For New Marketers - ComLuv,"If youâ€™re new to internet marketing you might be just a tad overwhelmed. It all started with a great ideaâ€_your idea, and now you have an appreciation for all that is required to successfully launch an internet enterprise. You have an appreciation but if youâ€™re like most people, you donâ€™t have sufficient knowledge and experience to open up a viable business and start seeing sales roll in. Itâ€™s going to take time and itâ€™s going to take persistence on your part. The more you know about the business, the more experience you have testing ideas the closer you are to success. But thereâ€™s a way to speed up that process. Lets face it, not everyone who jumps into this business is a skilled website developer or designer, few if any have a strong working knowledge of SEO, some canâ€™t string two sentences together much less create compelling and engaging content. What most new people to internet marketing do have is a strong entrepreneurial spirit and at least a basic knowledge of marketing. So how do you overcome for your shortcomings? Well you have two choices. You can put off launching that camping tent site or online piano lesson website or whatever your passion is and spend the time (and money) to learn all of the skills required and quite frankly that may take years to become completely proficient. Or you can outsource those functions that youâ€™re not comfortable with. Done correctly, outsourcing is the fastest and most efficient method to get your business up and running. If you donâ€™t have the skill, tools or time to perform a task you can find someone else to do it for you. What you donâ€™t know can be purchased, but buyers beware. Outsourcing makes an incredible amount of sense in todayâ€™s economic environment particularly for small businesses that donâ€™t want, nor can afford, new employees. Freelance contractors can be found for virtually any business task from accounting, to web design to telemarketing and usually at competitive rates. But like all businesses, not all freelance contractors are equal. Let me share a quick story with you to illustrate what I mean. I was sitting on my deck one day when a chap approached me and proposed that he should fix the damage on my roof. He was kind of down and out explaining that he was a roofer but had not worked in over 3 months and he really needed the job and would give me a smoking hot price. Well in fact my roof did need to be replaced and I had shopped around and found the going price was about $4,000. This chap was offering to do the job for $1,500 or 65% less than I would have to pay a local contractor. He gave me references which I checked out and then awarded him the project. On the first day he advised me that he would need an advance as he didnâ€™t have gas for his truck. I gave him $100. He worked for about a half day and then advised me that he had a sore back (he was out of shape from not working) and When he showed up three days later he again needed an advance and I reluctantly gave it to him. He worked the day and then disappeared. I was able to contact him by phone and advised him that I was leaving for a week and wanted the job done by the time I returned. I further advised him there would be no more payment until the project was completed. Upon returning from a relaxing week of vacation I pulled into my drive, looked up at the roof, and discovered that absolutely nothing had been done. Goodbye relaxed vacation feeling hello frustration and disappointment. Eventually he did show up and he completed the job. And the job was perfect. He actually was a talented roofer but he was a horrible service provider. Now take a moment and think if my roof was my â€œbusinessâ€ùÂù. It needed repairs and it got repaired for relatively next to nothing. However it took much longer than planned, my contractor was non-responsive, my personal frustration was through the roof so to speak and if my roof was a â€œbusinessâ€ùÂù it wouldnâ€™t have been making me sales during the extended amount of time that it took to get the repair done. Now my roof experience was a personal inconvenience but had that roof been my business my $1500 â€œdealâ€ùÂù could have cost me much more in lost business. There are thousands of highly qualified, professional freelance contractors available. Unfortunately there are tens of thousands of freelancers that arenâ€™t so professional but usually are incredibly cheap. If you decide to use an out sourcing service based principally on price then you could very well experience your own â€œfix the roofâ€ùÂù scenario. Thatâ€™s not to say that you absolutely will. There is some incredible technical talent available from freelancers who live in countries where the cost of living is a fraction of yours. But even in these cases if the contractor is not fluent in English your project may be delayed or flawed simply because of communication problems. Quite frankly I learned the challenges associated with outsourcing when I used freelance contractors for my online business which was well before my â€œroof repairâ€ùÂù experience. Why I didnâ€™t apply the lessons I learned online to my offline life Iâ€™ll never know. But to help you avoid some of the potential pitfalls of outsourcing projects, hereâ€™s a quick â€œto doâ€ùÂù list: Done right outsourcing can really boost your business and it doesnâ€™t matter what your business is. You can have a photography website promoting infrared cameras or an outdoor adventure site featuring the  for camping. It simply doesnâ€™t matter. What does matter is if you donâ€™t have the talent, tools or time to do a task then itâ€™s not going to get done unless you outsource a pro to do it.",bstevens

In this article, weâ€™re going to investigate some of the ways people today are saving money and still getting the niche educations they need to partake in the modern workforce. For anywhere from $50 to $150 bucks or so, you can buy big packages of information products around just about anything you can think of, from bass fishing to options trading. ClickBank sells legions of them and modern information products are high value, in-depth and all digital. Weâ€™re talking video courses, ebooks galore, PDF guides, print books, and so on. Many of these information products are connected to online communities that focus on exchange of information, which is kind of like being in a collaborative classroom â€“ only a lot bigger. Whatâ€™s the difference between actually attending a lecture and watching one on your computer, live or recorded? MIT established the   back in 2002, but today there are countless universities that offer free classes and courses to anyone with a PC, an internet connection and an email address. Then thereâ€™s sources like the Khan Academy and Academic Earth which make it possible to get access to valuable information for absolutely nothing. Online tutors cost money, but compared to the price of an AA or BA degree, weâ€™re talking pennies on the dollar. Itâ€™s one-on-one time with an industry professional/specialist and the student typically for an hourly rate. Oftentimes there are live online tutoring sessions with students from around the globe. A tutor these days can go online and How many skill-sets could someone learn from YouTube videos for free? How many DIY projects can you learn from Pinterest? How many different professional groups can you hook up with on Facebook? How many free tutorial videos are floating around the social web? How many more are being made at this moment? Hell, in reality what canâ€™t you learn by using a Google search engine? Within a few years the vast majority of all human knowledge will be available (mostly for free) and a few clicks away. Along with online-specific universities, many technical schools and community colleges now offer specialty degrees (think  ) and certificates through exclusively online courses. What good is a â€œwell-roundedâ€ù education anymore? Itâ€™s all about very specific knowledge and skill-sets. What can you deliver? Thatâ€™s what counts. This is a relatively new path to gaining expertise that you might not have considered before. The big upside here is that you actually get paid to learn rather than the other way around. Anyone can head to major freelancing platforms like oDesk, Guru or Elance, and set up a contractor profile for free and begin taking jobs as a researcher. They can optimize their profile around a certain type of research, for example, business, nutrition, marketing, technology, etc. and begin getting paid to search the web and collect information on any given topic.. How much would you learn about online marketing if you were asked to read 100 unique blogs about the subject, all 500-1200 words long, within 1 month? These last 6 options are by no means all-inclusive. Each month that goes by, more information becomes available at our fingertips. Information is flowing in so many different forms now. Ebooks, webinars, videos, streaming, social media, search engines, open source, and on and on we go. That you can educate yourself for cheap is the reality â€“ the only choice is how much you need to know and how fast you can absorb it. Get started!",Ali Asjad
07/03/2014,http://comluv.com/laying-the-right-foundations-for-your-wordpress-website-business/,Laying The Right Foundations For Your Wordpress Website Business - ComLuv,"As with a real bricks and mortar house, you need solid foundations to build on when starting your WordPress website business. A website is considered a valuable piece of virtual real estate. A successful website can be worth more than your family home and without a solid backbone to your website, you run the risk of crippling your business before it even has a chance to get off the ground. Important tasks and systems need to be set in place before hanging out your â€œopen for businessâ€ù sign. With each new WordPress website business I build, I religiously follow the same simple steps that lay the right foundations from the start. This is the most important step when starting to build a WordPress website business. You should not just go and build any old website about any old topic. Correctly   can give you a huge advantage over your competitors. If you get this step right it will mean you have to do less work in the future. A great way to research your niche is to use the Google keyword tool and look for a keyword that people are searching for. When you find a keyword you must make sure that it has low competition, high search volume, and is also a potential moneymaker. For example if you liked computers and wanted to build a website about them you could not simply make a website named computers.com. Obviously that name would not be available and that competition would be huge. So therefore you would research a smaller niche within the subject of computers. You could have something like computer repair, computer blue screens, computer problems, and so on. If you do not find a keyword with low competition and high search volume then you can dig down deeper by searching for longer tail keywords. So then you could be searching for something like laptop computer problems, computer monitor repair, laptop computer repair, DIY computer repair, and so on. Once you have found the right keyword you should buy a domain name that contains that exact word if you can. This is proven to help in your search engine rankings for your WordPress website business. For example if you are looking for a computer tips website you should look for something like computertips.com. Do not get caught up in all the hype and go out and buy a fancy domain name when you really only need one that Google will understand and your visitors will remember. If the domain name that you want is not available use your keywords at the beginning and add another word on to it. For example you could look for computertipsonline.com computertipsforseniors.com and so on. Do not worry about a long domain name or even if you have to put a dash in it, because it will still work well in the search engines. Do not run your new business with a blind fold over your eyes. Open your eyes and know the path you are about to travel. Set some stepping stones or goals to achieve along the way. Follow the yellow brick road. Of course you can deviate from this path, however you will achieve more if you have a plan to fall back on. Some people do not think that getting the right WordPress theme is important, however I feel it is important because if you get the right theme in the first place you will save a lot of time and effort. People spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to use each new WordPress theme that they install. I personally like to use a very limited number of themes and become an expert at customizing them. This way you are a master of your WordPress theme and you are not constantly learning how to customize it to suit your needs. There are numerous accounts to set up each time you start a new WordPress website business in a new niche. It is not good for websites to share accounts and the first thing that needs to be set up is an e-mail account. Some other accounts include: When setting up your WordPress website categories it is important to use closely related keywords. I use the Google keyword tool to find related keywords to use. After finding the related keywords you need to enter the categories in and write a SEO description for each category. This needs to be done right in the first place. You can add category descriptions by clicking on the Post link in the left column and then clicking on the categories link. You will see all the options to edit or setup your categories there. You might not be ready to communicate with a list, however always start collecting email addresses from the minute you start your website. You might be missing out on connecting with one of your most loyal followers. People are willing to wait a couple of weeks, at least, until they receive communication from you. It is better to keep them waiting for a short time instead of losing potential subscribers for your WordPress website business. When I first started, I had my WordPress website business running for at least two years before I added and optin form. This was my biggest mistake. I eventually signed up for a free mail account at Mailchimp.com and have used them ever since. Now I have at least 10 or more auto responding e-mails set up for each website I build. I also have a newsletter that is automatically distributed to my subscribers at certain intervals. Once these things are set up, they are done forever. To configure your blog settings you will just have to follow some simple steps. Every WordPress website should have plug-ins to help the website promote itself. I use certain search engine optimization plug-ins that do most of the work for me. Here are some of the   I use on my websites. I have a set list of plug-ins that I install to every website by spell at Build. These include anti spam plug-ins, security plug-ins, related post plug-ins, and so on. Setting up your sidebar is very important because it makes your website look like it is finished. People do not like to visit a half done, shabby website. You could add your optin form to your sidebar, maybe a Facebook like box, and also a popular post widget. These are just some examples of what you can do to make your WordPress website business look complete. With each new website, part of its foundation, is to let the search engines know that it exists. If you have links pointing to your website, they could be called by Google Yahoo or being, and your website will be found almost immediately. This does not mean that you have to go around and beg for links because you can start off with many valuable free back links. Some of the websites where you can get free back links include Ezine articles, Youtube, Alexa.com, Statbrain.com, and many more. There are also free link directories, do follow blog commenting, and the list goes on. You should build these links with every new website you create. The busy at the website where you place the link the more chance you have of being recognized by the search engines. After you have completed these steps, it is now time for you to publish some posts to your new website. This new post that you publish will be spread across the Internet automatically if you have laid your foundations correctly. The search engines should be visiting your new website within days. Building a foundation for your WordPress website business is an easy task if you stick to the systems mentioned above.",Mitz Pantic

There have been a couple however that I have had to reject because they werenâ€™t guest posts, more like excuses to publish sales pages that lead to more sales pages or written solely to publish an affiliate link. If you are going to submit an article to someones blog as a guest post then show a little respect, donâ€™t trample your affiliate links and blatant seo baited anchor text all over the floor! Youâ€™ll go a lot further if you write a decent article, one that reflects your own blog and constructed in such a way so that the reader actually   to visit your site.               A lot of people say that guest posting is an excellent way to get links back to your site, they also say itâ€™s a great way to get more traffic but what they donâ€™t say is that you wont get either if you donâ€™t do it properly!!  Make sure you follow the guidelines set down by the blog owner, that means write to the minimum word count, donâ€™t put a gazillion tags on your post or try and hyperlink every.single.keyphrase and for crying out loud, donâ€™t include affiliate links no matter how relevant you think they are! Donâ€™t ruin your chances of getting your site noticed and your brand recognized by drive by guest blogging. Nothing will lose you respect and hinder your chances of becoming noticed quicker than thinking that you can get away with a half arsed article full of links to splogs.  I know youâ€™re excited about your product launch or 110% believe in your platinum plated, guaranteed roads to riches, one million hits traffic formula but, you know what buddy? keep it off my blog!! Rome wasnâ€™t built in a day, slow and steady wins the race etc etc. Donâ€™t rush these things! Itâ€™s so true, from little acorns, mighty Oaks grow. Donâ€™t be a fool and think you can publish one post full of questionable links to even more questionable sites and sit back and watch the riches come in. IT WONT HAPPEN!! It takes time to build a reputation, it takes effort to create a brand and it wont happen overnight. Sure! guest blogging can be an amazing way to jump start that process but not if you mess it up. Youâ€™ve got to do more than write guest posts, youâ€™ve got to write GOOD guest posts! The whole point of guest blogging (to me) is to get yourself in front of a new audience, to showcase what youâ€™re about. If the new audience likes what they see then they are sure to click through on your guest author box to see what else you have to say. If you write good articles the blog owner will want you to come back and write more, itâ€™s in their best interests to have a steady supply of unique, interesting content published on their blog so write the best post that you can, make it interesting, informative. There have been a few articles published in the past which have struck me as really good articles in their own right but also do a good job of promoting the guest authors own site/business.  One such article was the â€œ â€ù post written by Dave Baker who runs a   .  Another was â€œ â€ù by Rick LaPoint who runs an  . They donâ€™t all have to be a shoe in to your own site, guest posts can show off how well you write and what kind of authority you have on a given subject. Take Ileane Smiths post about â€œ â€ù , a funny yet informative post that makes me want to visit her   site or Satrap who has published guest posts all over the blogosphere to do with link building and SEO tools. His   has definitely caused visitors to go on to his   so there has never been a better time to guest blog.   and you can be up there in the blogosphere with people like Karen from   or Byan from â€œ â€ù writing quality articles that get well deserved attention on numerous high PR and pageview blogs like ComLuv,   and more.

Itâ€™s an old Internet marketing staple. But itâ€™s not as easy as just signing up, writing a few posts, and getting traffic back t your blog for life. Youâ€™ve got to pay your dues. Joining a forum is like joining a gang, and hereâ€™s how to do it right: Gangland You canâ€™t just join a gang, start bossing people around, and expect them to start blindly icing fools for you. Youâ€™ve got to prove that youâ€™ve got what it takes. Youâ€™ve got back up them fightinâ€™ words. The best traffic I get from forums is from forums that Iâ€™ve been active on for a while; people know who I am.  , man. They know what Iâ€™m capable of, and they respect that. No one likes a nark. Donâ€™t be a punk, and donâ€™t ruin other peopleâ€™s fun. The other gang members   ostracize you and maybe even put a bomb in your momâ€™s car. Your forum signature is your tattoo. You wouldnâ€™t want a tattoo with a winky emoticon on it, right? Right. Make your signature something that you can be proud of, something that represents you and your blog well. On a related note, some forums donâ€™t allow signatures; people have to click on your user name to find a link to your blog. Avoid these. The kind that allow signatures will help direct significantly more You want to get noticed? You want people out for your blood? You want to live in infamy? Start a gang war. You want to get noticed on a forum? Start up a thread that will get A LOT of replies. Like what? The way I see it, there are two main types of forum posts that will get lots of attention: controversial things, and things that everyone has an opinion about. Asking for peopleâ€™s opinion about controversial things is self-explanatory, I think. As far as things that everyone can weigh in on, some examples are, â€œWhat would you do with $1000?â€ùÂù, â€œWhen/how did you start ____?â€ùÂù, and â€œWhatâ€™s your favorite book/blog/movie about ____?â€ùÂù Note how each question is broad and can be tailored to pretty much any niche. The more people that view your thread, the more people view your signature, and the more people will click on it to visit your site. Erâ€ùÂ_ In other wordsâ€ùÂ_ be as helpful as you can. Quality of your work is important. The only way for people to notice you in your gang is if youâ€™re out on the front lines, doinâ€™ crap, sellinâ€™ crap, hustlinâ€™ crap. Same thing goes with forums. Quality of posts is key (remember tip 5?), but quantity is just as important. Donâ€™t just be a one   wonder (youâ€™ve got to admit that was a pretty great pun). Know the rules, follow the rules. If you donâ€™t, youâ€™ll get banned forever from your beloved homemadetransisterradiofortolkienfansforum.com forums. You donâ€™t want to commit a faux pas in your gang and wake up in the morning with your house on fire. There you have it. Follow those rules and you should live to fight another day. People will revere you, and youâ€™ll grow up one day to become the online mob boss youâ€™ve always wanted to be.",Tristan

If you are a webmaster and have not heard of this, then where have you been? Youtube is beyond huge because people watch   videos a day and are uploading  hundreds of thousands of videos daily. According to Youtube, every minute, 24 hours  of video is uploaded. Would you like a piece of that traffic? Youtube is here to stay. I have never heard anyone complain that Youtube is too hard to use. The main comment I hear about Youtube is when people ask â€œdid you see that video on Youtube?â€ù If I had to compare it to Facebook and the complexity of that I would choose Youtube any day. Youtube success is sweet when you can taste it, especially for a webmaster who has an opportunity to use the traffic to their advantage.  and getting traffic from Youtube are two different subjects and in this article I would like to focus on the later. So you have your own Youtube channel and have gathered a few hundred subscribers and loyal followers. What now? Of course you have heard this one a hundred times but I still constantly see people not adding a link to the video description. Also in some cases they have tried to put HTML to make a link, which Youtube does not accept. You need to type your full URL carefully and try to add it in the beginning of the description so it stands out. Leave them foaming at the mouth and wanting more. Thatâ€™s sounds terrible but if your video is great, and you know it has great information, why not manipulate the situation. What about temping them with 10 fantastic secrets and get down to the last 3 and tell them the rest will be revealed at your website. Maybe you started with some basic information and offer the more detailed tutorial at your website. I often mention that I have made a step by step tutorial with screen shots to go with this video. If they are interested in the subject they will want to know more. Of course the other way to temp your viewers to click is to offer them a gift that is related to video. This way they will visit your website to receive the gift. This gift can simply be a PDF file to download loaded with links back to your website and of course, great information. All these tasks will keep working for you in the future. Lets face it. If your video gets traffic then your website will possibly get traffic also. Therefore whyÂ  not generate traffic to your video which then leads to your website. If you feel that this is a waste of time then maybe your video is not worth it. If you can get them there to watch the video, tempt them, tell them to click and they do, this is very high quality traffic. This traffic is where the money is. This is where people fail. You must have the courage to tell the viewers what to do and where to go! Well you know what I mean. If you have temped them correctly it still does not guarantee that they will click on your link. Emphasize that there is a link to your website below the video and tell them to click on it. Unfortunately some who do experience Youtube success do not use this enormous traffic opportunity and it is a crying shame. I have seen videos with millions of views and thatâ€™s it. There are no links to websites or links to other videos, nothing! As long as this is not your video going to waste then do not panic. This is your sign to step in and make them an offer so you can have your website link there. See my screen shot below of a perfect example. Where the hell is Matt is one of the most watched series on Youtube about a guy who does a little dance in all different parts of the world. Even though Matt Harding has made millions from his videos he has still left traffic and money on the table. This video only has over 4 million views but his others have 33 million. If this isnâ€™t Youtube success then I do not know what is, but where the hell is the website link Matt? I have a good reason for suggesting you use your Youtube videoâ€™s to get traffic to your website. It is simply because these website visitors convert better. They buy more, click more, and sign up more.Â  After all, isnâ€™t that what you want? Traffic from Youtube accounts for 33% of my income so I know I am not wasting my time. Using Youtube success is guaranteed to boost your website traffic and sales if you follow those few simple steps I have mentioned above.",Mitz Pantic
20/02/2014,http://comluv.com/nonsense-guide-grooming-dressing-men/,A No-Nonsense Guide to Grooming and Dressing for Men,"Letâ€™s talk serious grooming and style. Weâ€™ll break our conversation into two parts and cover the things that really matter. After reading this article, the average guy in the world today will be able to completely refresh and re-design their look with ease. Man-hair, while it can be a nuisance, itâ€™s also one of the most potent tools at a manâ€™s disposal to show his virility, personality and character. In truth, men on the lower end of the metrosexual scale really have no clue what to do with the stuff. They either let it grow wild or typically just get rid of it all on a somewhat regular basis. Letâ€™s cover the primary grooming bases and their rules of thumb that every man should at least consider or keep safely tucked away in their mental file cabinet for an extra special night. [Credit: The image is from  ] The 90â€™s are over and looking as smooth as a babyâ€™s butt isnâ€™t natural. It works well for magazine ads, but not in real life. Itâ€™s about grooming. Take a look at the biggest actors, from Colin Ferrell and Hugh Jackman, to Jude Law, Jon Hamm and Steve Carell. Hairy chests rule, but theyâ€™re trimmed to perfection. Get rid of any hair thatâ€™s going up around the neck towards the back and vice versa. This hair is usually really fine and can be easily buzzed or whisked off with your razor while shaving. Once you reach a certain age it really doesnâ€™t matter anymore and most people will tolerate some for their special guy, but it never looks good. And, whatâ€™s worse, using clippers isnâ€™t effective. No one wants to shave your back for you. Some men just canâ€™t stand to have hair anywhere. Typically just a buzz maybe once a month on either the arms or legs is enough to prevent you from turning into a werewolf. Now, with the armpit itâ€™s best just to buzz off any extra-long hair that sticks out even when your arms are at your sides. Use a longer clipper attachment or scissors to trim, but donâ€™t take it all off. That will undoubtedly cause razor burn and irritation, especially if thereâ€™s any alcohol in your deodorant. [Credit: The image is fromÂ  ] Here are the two tried and true steps to mastering the art of shaping your facial hair: Work with your face not against it. Pay attention to the height of your cheekbones and the prominence of your chin before deciding to go straight for a traditional beard or Goatee. Finally, strike a balance between whatâ€™s on (or the lack thereof) your head and on your face. Like you, we really donâ€™t want this article to turn into a collegiate-level dissertation on the intricacies of modern style. So, what weâ€™ve done is break down a process that can work for any man alive today thatâ€™s looking to take more control of the way he presents himself to the world. The more in-shape you are the more versatility you have to work with. The slimmer and trimmer the tummy, the more types of fashion will look completely natural. Thatâ€™s just a fact. With that said, start wearing clothes that FIT. Workout, get in shape, eat right and enjoy the fruits of thy labor through the perks of looking good. If itâ€™s not necessary, get rid of it. Killing darlings is what writers are told to do to tighten up their prose. If the sentence makes sense without a word, get rid of it. Minimize. Simplify. Retract. Go through your wardrobe and remove every shred you donâ€™t really need. Most men are left with two pairs of pants and a few t-shirts at this point. [Credit: The image is fromÂ  ] Make your first real clothing  . Yes, start from the pinnacle of your new wardrobe and rebuild your way back. It works wonders. The process of finding a good tailor and then getting a suit that fits perfectly will be an education unto itself. Get a fresh pair of high-brow ($200) quasi-formal/informal shoes that suit your personality but fit with the suit as well. While youâ€™re at it, youâ€™ll needâ€_ Now, color blindness is far more common in men than women. If you want to spot a color blind man just look for one that naturally drifts towards white, black and blue. If thatâ€™s you just add some earthy tones and youâ€™ll be fine. This will be a great foundation for a new modern wardrobe, regardless of where you decide to take it with personalization. Again, make sure everything fits. Does that mean skin-tight? No. Regardless of what your particular classy and clean style becomes, clothes that fit are the hallmark trait a man thatâ€™s sure of himself and how he looks. Everything is amplified once you understand how they work together within your look. A watch is a big deal. Cufflinks are huge. Belts, hats, glasses and jewelry all make statements and add wiggle room for creative expression. Just accessorize with caution. If youâ€™re trying to hide or make up for something, fix the problem first and then simplify.",Ali Asjad

If this question did cross your mind while you are reading this, then let me explain it in short detailsâ€_. A winning blog is an authority in itâ€™s own right, a website that itâ€™s counterpart look up to, that gets the advertisers, that gets the traffic etc. Having a great website is the first step toward showing the world youâ€™re serious about your small business.

Depending on your link building strategies, how many blogspots and wordpress domain do you have in your memory? Currently, as for me, itâ€™s just two blogs on blogspot which i have, an entertainment blogspot and my ranking blogspot, i just canâ€™t fathom the idea of visiting a website (omoscowonder .com) itâ€™s not only hard for bloggers and newbies to store the name, but it shows immaturity for your intending advertisers. Ensure that you get a custom domain name for your blog, to make it look professional and quality too. Would you ever buy a .blogspot.com domain? as for me, yes, but it wonâ€™t  Another benefit of having your own domain name is the ability to have a sharp-looking custom email address that shows you know what youâ€™re doing in the blogosphere. Get an email address that is custom, like mine (omosco@omoscowonder.com) which is really professional and very matured.  One of the benefits of having a winning website is the ability to customize your siteâ€™s footer and remove the providerâ€™s branding. This is a good step toward looking more polished. This is one thing which i have noticed that bloggers are overlooking, their footer, top bloggers like Pat Fyln and John Chow, and their footer looks like another website altogether. Which gives them a professional look.  Weâ€™re in the technology age right now, and since humans are always on the move, they need to stay updated too, and making your website mobile friendly will be something that will really benefit you, in terms of your earnings, visitors and otherwise. Okay, lets take a classical example here, if you visit a website on your mobile device and itâ€™s just plainly notÂ compatible with your mobile device, making you to scroll left, right just to read a sentence, how would you feel?

Good motivation to have a great mobile version of your website for customers to browse on the go.

For most people, gifts are an important part of the festivities. When it comes to  , itâ€™s important to make a list. This helps eliminate the risk of forgetting to buy for someone, of buying too much for one person or of buying too little for another. The real question, however, is exactly whom should you include on your holiday gift giving list? The most important people are your loved ones. This includes parents, grandparents, children, spouse, siblings, nieces, nephews and close friends. You neednâ€™t be reminded that these people go on your list. However, some families choose to give Christmas gifts in a different manner. Some choose to each pick one person in the family to whom to give. Others only give to children and donâ€™t exchange gifts with adults. Find out before you make your list what your family and friends want to do this holiday season so you know for whom to buy. Teachers spend more time with your child than you do during the day, and they have another 20 or so children all to themselves at the same time.

16/02/2014,http://comluv.com/book-review-twelve-justin-cronin/,Book Review: 'the Twelve' by Justin Cronin - ComLuv,"In 2010, Justin Cronin, a graduate of the esteemed Iowa Writerâ€™s Workshop and acclaimed author of several award-winning if sentimental novels, finally hit a literary home run. The Passage, the first of a projected trilogy, generated fevered enthusiasm, slathered with praise, and even earned a place amid the â€œTen Best Novels of the Yearâ€ù according to Library Journal and Time. The book lived up to its hype. A vampire novel that didnâ€™t rely on the drawn-out sexual tension of True Blood, and wasnâ€™t fraught with the high school romance of Twilight, The Passage felt a story written for adults. Apocalyptic where other vampire tales were merely dramatic, The Passage featured an epic scope that had some drawing comparisons to Stephen Kingâ€™s The Stand. In fact, the novel managed to do something few vampire books have accomplished since Bram Strokerâ€™s Dracula: It actually scared readers, so itâ€™s no wonder fans can hardly wait for the   (which so far hasnâ€™t reached production). The second installment, The Twelve, picks up where The Passage left off, but also explores many new characters, including some who had only cameo in the first book. Both novels leap back and forth through time with relative ease, designating an era after the vampires (better known as â€œvirals,â€ù because they were born of a virus) with A.V. In a novel with such a broad narrative scope â€” some characters live during the first days of the outbreak, and others 100 years later â€” there are plenty of deaths. The brevity of a characterâ€™s life doesnâ€™t hinder Cronin, who impartially delves into the minutia of  . It can be a jarring tactic, at first, for readers who are accustomed to more traditional character deployment, but most readers should settle into it â€” which is good, because this particular device is crucial for Croninâ€™s success. Much like The Stand, Croninâ€™s novels hinge on two types of supernatural beings: those that represent â€œevilâ€ù (the vampires), and those that represent â€œgoodâ€ù (God and her chosen). We are supposed to understand that each individualâ€™s life and death is part of his or her destiny, part of a larger plan. Thatâ€™s why even the most fleeting character is given such nuance and individual voice. This is simultaneously a strength in Croninâ€™s writing style, and the place where both books, particularly his latest installment, Unfortunately, even attempts to complicate the issue of good vs. evil â€” asserting, for example, that the virals arenâ€™t inherently bad but lost souls who must be guided home â€” may come across as thinly veiled attempts at evangelizing. What appeared as a subtle undercurrent in the first book becomes crashing waves in the second. Thereâ€™s no soft touch to the overt spirituality promoted in The Twelve. â€œGoodâ€ù characters are described as prayerful and possessing faith. God finds physical embodiment in an old woman, but thatâ€™s about as liberal as the biblical interpretations get. Itâ€™s frequently been suggested that the books feature characters are on a predestined path. Even the bookâ€™s titles are biblically motivated:The Passage refers to Noahâ€™s ark, and The Twelve to the 12 apostles of Christ. Thereâ€™s nothing inherently problematic about using biblical tropes to guide the creation of an apocalyptic story. In fact, for a Christian author, itâ€™s perfectly natural. Unfortunately, unlike the C.S. Lewis epic, The Chronicles of Narnia, an overtly drawn Christian metaphor written by a well-known Christian scholar, the Passage trilogy attempts to sell itself as secular genre fiction: something we know by the end of The Twelve, that this novel is not. If weâ€™re to follow the logic taken for granted by the novels, then we must conclude that science is the devilâ€™s tool. The team that originally awakened the sleeping virus in the first novel were a group of scientists, intent on curing diseases. What they manifested instead results in a great purge of humanity, which the novel compares to the biblical flood in the time of Noah. This is problematic, because we donâ€™t know why the earth deserves this second purification. Whereas the biblical flood was Godâ€™s direct response to the wickedness of man, the viral surge in Croninâ€™s novels seems to be Godâ€™s arbitrary punishment for pursuing scientific research. Remember the  , when you realized you had just finished watching the longest-ever religious metaphor unfold? Remember feeling that youâ€™d been taken for a ride? The concluding book in the Passage series, The City of Mirrors, is due out in 2014, and while itâ€™s unlikely to feature happy families of the post-viral future, building white picket fences and  , it will probably come bearing â€œgood news.â€ù Still, thereâ€™s hope for the thoughtful reader. The series could always be salvaged by a narrative that rounds out the heavy Christian influences to arrive at a more secular appeal. Many successful science fiction authors have dreamed up ways in which tinkering with technology, genetics, and science could come back to wreak havoc and devastation against humanity. They just managed to compose without any proselytizing.",Jeff

It is much easier to go through all the difficulties that life brings when you have someone next to you, who will share everything with you. Being on your own will eventually lead you to a great deal of disappointment in life. That is why most people opt to live a family life rather than that as a solitary individual. Even if you have a big family and your life has always been full of people, you will eventually come to a point in your life where your dearest ones will have their own families and you and your partner will be left, so to say, alone. Of course, your children and grandchildren will visit you, but all their obligations will separate you more and more and in the end you will get to see them once a month, if you are lucky. You are going to spend the rest of your life with your other half â€“ and you might as well make this a good life. If you feel like your life together needs a change, do it without thinking! In this age, any change can seem great. Maybe this is precisely what you need. Travelling or changing the place of living are both a good idea for an elderly couple who is in need of something fresh.

And even though we want to eat healthy, local and homegrown, there are just not a lot of cocoa bean plants growing successfully in the United States. That means that when our sweet tooth is craving chocolate, we turn to decadent chocolate that started out being grown predominantly in South America and Africa. However, as concerned consumers, it makes sense to give some thought to how those cocoa beans are harvested and processed. The Ivory Coast of Africa is the largest cocoa bean producing region in the world. However, it is also one of the biggest offenders when it comes to child labor. There are as many as 200,000 children working the cocoa bean fields in the area and a significant portion of them may even be human trafficking victims â€“ forced slave labor. When we buy a chocolate bar without giving a thought to where it came from, who was involved in the harvest and production, and the working conditions those individuals have to endure, we are unwittingly enabling those who opt to use child labor. While not all work done by children is considered child labor, when a child works in dangerous conditions it is most definitely child labor. Cocoa harvesting involves danger. Using a machete for harvesting is one of the tasks children do that is developmentally By choosing Fair Trade chocolate, you are opting to purchase chocolate that has not been harvested by children. Fair Trade farmers must meet exacting standards that include fair wages and safe working conditions. While chocolate that meets this standard is slightly more expensive than regular chocolate, it comes with the reassurance that you are supporting a grower that cares about children and doesnâ€™t exploit them on his farm. While this may be the first time you have heard about the slave labor aspect of chocolate, there is much information out there about it. A simple online search for phrases like â€œchildren in cocoa productionâ€ù will give you a wide array of websites where you can find more detailed information. â€œ â€ù, a documentary about the subject that was made in 2010 can be watched online. In your quest to be healthy, take a moment and think about how the things you choose impact the health and even safety of those involved in the production of such food. Whenever you can, choose Fair Trade chocolate for a treat you know is ethically sound. Even if your local stores donâ€™t carry such choices, there are many online retailers that can feed your socially responsible chocolate needs for Valentineâ€™s Day, Easter and every other occasion all year long.",Antoine Moore

The sensors will showÂ you how you actually brush your teeth andÂ if there are any areas of your mouth or gums that you are neglecting. ThisÂ should help you avoid nasty visits to the dentist includingÂ fillings, extractions or even expensive dental implants. One very interesting benefit for the brush would be for parents.Â Most parents have a long running battle with their children to make sure they brush their teeth correctly or at all as the case may be. Now they canÂ be   and find out if their kids have brushed their teeth from the living room chair. They can also make sure that they have done a thorough job starting them on a path to good oral health for life. The brush has been developed by a French company called Kolibree. It was developed by a former google developer but is still only at prototype stage. He will be looking to raise funding this year to fund the development of the product and hopes to be bringing it to market later this year. If you think you would like to be one of the first people to buy one, they are expected to retail form $100- 200 depending on the type of API package you opt for. It is quite expensive for a toothbrush but no doubt some dental and techÂ enthusiasts will want to be the first people to buy them. Some people doubt the concept and do not think people will want to bring their expensive iphone in to the bathroom with them when they are brushing their teeth. Maybe, only time will tell.",Eoin Holohan
12/02/2014,http://comluv.com/get-website-visitors-google-depth-articles/,Get Your Website More Visitors with Google In-depth Articles - ComLuv,"As the name suggests, in-depth articles are articles that Google considers authoritative on a broad topic on the web. It has been a while since Google rolled out this new update that focuses on in-depth articles on a given subject. Lately, you might have seen a new box labeled â€˜in-depth articlesâ€™ while googling for a broad topic. Those results are long and detailed articles chosen to provide search users with content that will stay relevant for years. To rank for those in-depth results, your site should provide high quality content and you should let Google know about it. The concept of in-depth articles is a new search results feature that was introduced by Google in August 2013. As per this, Google looks for articles that are deep into the topic, detailed, long and provide helpful information to the visitors. In order to rank for these in-depth results, you need to implement schema.org article markup in your blog. This is to help Google understand the structure of the article and is the first thing you should do if you plan on making your articles appear in the in-depth results box. â€˜In-depth articlesâ€™ You need to optimize your blog before it can qualify for ranking in the in-depth articles section. The first and important one is to implement schema.org article markup which includes attributes like headline, alternative headline, crawlable images, description, datePublished and articleBody. As a next step, you should implement Google Authorship for your blog which lets Google evaluate relevant and expert authors. If your content is split into multiple parts, you should also use pagination and canonicalization to help Google understand your page structure. A logo is very important to let everyone know about your brand and stand out in the SERP; so it also helps to let Google find your logo. You can use the organization markup to give Google a hint about your logo or create a Google+ page with your logo as display image and link it with your website. Once you are done with all the essential optimization, it is time to write long and compelling articles which Google would be glad to rank for their in-depth results.",David Ford
11/02/2014,http://comluv.com/rank-number-1-google-search/,How to Rank Number 1 in Google Search - Comluv,"One of the most consistent and popular search term in Google search is how to rank number 1 in Google search engine. I also carried out an extensive research on how to get on the first pages of SERP. I always thought that to get on search result first pages is exclusively reserved for the SEO experts. I never thought an average blogger like me could create a page that would hit the first pages of Google, Bing and yahoo. Many times over, I would run a Google search on how to rank number 1 in Google. The information presented always gets complicated, I never figure out how these SEO experts do it. I felt completely overwhelmed, confused and frustrated due to lack of free targeted traffic. This began my quest to find out how Google works. After many trial and errors, I finally decode some basic steps you could take to increase your chances of being So I decided to write this article for beginners blogger who wants to understand the simple basics to build both human and search engine friendly blog so they could increase their chances of ranking high in search engines without having to know the nitty-gritty of search engine optimization. There are tons of information out there on how to rank #1 in Google, many of which will only turn you to internet junkies. Lots of garbage information that will only get you confused and completely paralyzed. Many of what youâ€™ll find online on how you can rank your pages up to the first page of search result are completely meant for the techies and not an average bloggers like you and I. In my opinion, there are only 4 most important aspect you should focus all your energy and attention when trying to hit the first page of Google or any other search engine. Below is what I consider most if you want to rank your web pages high in search result. *    There are lots of factors that determined how webpages are ranked like domain age, quality of content, quality of back links, sites speed, frequency in posting, search term youâ€™re targeting etc. What youâ€™re reading now are meant to put your blog and content on the right track and not a guarantee that your webpages will hit top spot after following my instructions. #1. The first step towards search visibility is to submit your blog url to Google and other major search engines on the net. If your blog url is not submitted to search engines, you donâ€™t stand any chance of getting found. Although, Google will find you even if you donâ€™t submit your blog url but is better to put your destiny in your own hands. #2.  Creating a site map is easy and you donâ€™t have to do it yourself. If youâ€™re on Word Press, there are plugins that will create and submit your site map on your behalf each time you updates your blog. This is very essential to do as it always allow Google crawlers to properly craw your entire blog and index your pages properly. It tells Google how your site has been structured so crawler knows their ways in and out. Youâ€™ll need to install a video site map plugin that allow Google to index videos on your blog. #3. This is one of the most important foundations to search visibility. If search engines crawlers canâ€™t in one simple sentence understand what your blog topics is all about, you probably not going to appear anywhere on the net. And if you does appear by mere accident in any search result pages, it is for the wrong keyword. This will amount to higher bounce rate on your blog. The first most important thing to do is to have in a clear visible space on your blog and in one sentence what problem exactly is your content solving on the net? In other words; In one good concise statement you should be able to answer all this questions. If you canâ€™t, then youâ€™re in serious trouble and no amount of search engine optimization and keyword research combine will help you get on the first page of SERP. The downside to this is that if you donâ€™t have your own blog description in-place, search engines will find a string of text on any page on your blog and attached it as your description. That is if youâ€™re lucky they found one, and the worst case may happen in which Google may choose not to display any meta description in your listing. Very bad for commercial purpose. A good Meta description should contain a part of the keywords your company or blog is primarily targeting with your content. It makes it easier for people and search engines to quickly understand your content, services or products. #4.  Everything youâ€™ve read above will become completely useless and waste of time, energy and resources if at the end of it all your content is nothing but gibberish. The only factor that stands between you and success online is the value you give in your service. Make sure in every article you produce anywhere online, you give your best. I canâ€™t categorically tell you what quality contents is, but I assure you that when you create one, youâ€™ll recognize it. When you create a quality content, these are the benefits that comes along with it: There are no right or wrong ways to produce a quality article. Donâ€™t be surprise when an article you pour all your heart in writing didnâ€™t get a single social share and something you wrote just to update your blog went viral like a virus. Is all about connections and effective promotions. The first thing youâ€™ll need most in creating quality article is theâ€ù â€œ. Learn how to craft articles headline that stand-out from the crowd. I wonâ€™t duel much on writing never to ignore headline Nevertheless, here are 5 time-tested and proven headlines categories that compel users to take certain action and click the call-to-action button in your copy. Start experimenting with each of the above headlines and see what works and donâ€™t work for you. I guess you grab the ideas behind each one? What you need to understand here is, its takes work and lots of it to rank your pages high in search result. Am not saying you will rank #1 or even get to the first page of Google but if you follow the steps outline here, you will increase your chances of hitting first page. Ask me why I believed you will? I know because they worked for me. The key important thing youâ€™ll want to take here is before you write your next post; ask yourself this very question â€“ All these questions youâ€™ll need to answer in your content. Remember, youâ€™re to write for human first, and search engine second. When youâ€™re done brainstorming on all this criteria, is time to do some keyword research using the Google keyword planner formerly called keyword tools. Thatâ€™s what I use. Providing genuine answer to those questions will make it easier for you to have a list of keywords related to your content. Youâ€™ll want to find its global monthly search and market value. Here youâ€™ll want to go after keywords with high volume global monthly search to build your content around. Focus on low competitive keyword to increase your chances of ranking high for a keyword that your targeted audience will find you with. There are many factors that lead to higher ranking which only on-site SEO will not guarantee you there. Type your keyword phrase into Google search and see what result it return. If the search result is more than 100,000 then it seems is highly competitive. Focus on writing your article around keywords that are below 70,000 return results to increase your chances. What youâ€™ll need to understand here is; the keyword may not send you massive amount of traffic but is far better than bunch of drive-by traffic that does nothing for your business. What you want is free targeted traffic; you only need to make the best out of it. Quality matter most, not quantity. Now, its time to write your post and tweak it around to include your targeted keyword. Iâ€™ll suggest you write your post normal and later see how you can include your focus keyword in it. Donâ€™t stuff your article with keyword in all paragraph, it doesnâ€™t work that way anymore. I recommend you include your focus keyword in the first paragraph of your post and lastly, in the concluding part of your post. Keyword density is no more an important aspect to ranking webpages. Make sure you include your keyword phrase in the title tag and post title, also in the Meta description tag. This help to entice visitor from search engine to click-through to your websites. The earlier you tell these spiders what your content is about the better, thatâ€™s why youâ€™ll want to include your focus keyword in the early paragraph of your post and it also help readers to understand theyâ€™re reading the right information. All-in-all, write for human first, then make sure the search spiders are able toÂ  find enough meat and potatoes on your blog when they come crawl your pages. Also remember that these spiders have no eyes yet, so it will be best to give your images description tag. It will help these spiders to know what type of information theyâ€™re crawling. Now that youâ€™ve created something worthy enough to tell families and friends, is time to share it with loved ones. In fact, no one will ever notice your content exists if you donâ€™t go out and tell them about it. You start by placing on your blog social sharing buttons of all major social media sites like Facebook, twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Delicious, StumbleUpon, etc. I assume you already joined as many as possible relevant bloggers communities. After hitting the publish button on your blog, visit relevant Facebook groups, bloggers communities and share your content in there. Promote promote and promote till you have exhausted all available marketing channel within your reach. This way your content will be seen by more targeted audience who could help spread the word out of your blog. I believe all Iâ€™ve said so far is just an intro. There is plenty left to be learned when it comes to search engine visibility and the theory of blog post optimization. I will be grateful if you can share with me your invaluable experience through the comment box below.",Shamsudeen Adeshokan

The evolution of this career choice was astonishing and it is still ongoing. All the stages of this evolution are still present as well. For example, we still have hobbyist bloggers who run blogs just for fun. On the other hand, we also have people who blog part-time for a bit of cash on the side (including blogging for SEO purposes) and people who are highly paid professional bloggers. What amazes me is that there are still a lot of people out there who virtually know nothing or nearly nothing about bloggers, blogs and have no idea about the culture that is developing around it but more and more people are starting to give notice. If you want to set up a blog and try out your writing skills, but are still new to the whole thing, Iâ€™m going to give you a few general tips related to how to set up a blog and a few more about the whole being a blogger thing. These days, this is a fairly simple process. There are a lot of ways you can go to set up a blog in a ridiculously short amount of time. Of course, I have to start with the reigning champion of blogging platforms. WordPress is pretty easy to learn and you can use   to get your own free subdomain with a couple of important features included. They also offer you a wide choice of different free templates and an option to go premium, if you want to take things to a more serious level.  is the most popular blogging platform with beginner bloggers since it is the easiest one to set up. It also offers you some freedom when it comes to customizing the look of your blog, but falls short compared to the beauty WordPress templates have. One of the things I admire is the fact that you are not asked for any money when you want to go for a custom domain. . is Â is a drag and drop based online website creator anybody can use to create the website they think they need. You donâ€™t need any programing skills to use it and it offers almost anything you might ever need. This is probably the choice that gives you the most freedom when it comes to modifying the look of your blog. The things that make a brilliant blogger are not really defined and not all people would agree on all of them but there are few general things you need to know and strive to apply so you can gain the right to call yourself a decent blogger. To some extent, blogs are like newspaper. We get used to them and they become part of a routine. As a blogger, you need to respect you readers enough to give them a new post at the time you usually do. The number of posts you are going to publish within a month depends on how much time you have but you have to set up a pace that you can always abide by. You wonâ€™t always be inspired to write but when you are, write as much as you can. From time to time, you wonâ€™t have the slightest idea what to write about and instead of pushing yourself and posting substandard content, you will have something stacked and you can use it to get some breathing space and a chance to fill your batteries. When you actually get your first fans, you will without a doubt answer every post and question from your users but you have to be aware that interaction with the readers is a regular part of blogging. You canâ€™t answer them all but you can give the courtesy of answering valid and interesting questions or even praising a conclusion someone has drawn from you post. All in all, this interaction is a must, since blogging is a two-way street. Bots, people, trolls and all kinds of internet creatures will siege your blog. You need to find ways to protect yourself before they suffocate your blog and drain the life out of you. These are the basics, all you need now is a good idea and you are on your way. As far as the more complex things are concerned, youâ€™ll learn them along the way. Happy writing!",Ivan Dimitrijevic

Well they are correct in every aspect to say that. Our body is complex machinery. It is a compilation of various systems like nervous system, respiratory system, digestive system, immune system, reproductory system and excretory system etc. These systems work unanimously and simultaneously together to keep our body working in an orderly manner. A time comes when these systems begin to slow down, which we call as ageing but if we eat right and avoid various health problems, then this process of ageing slows down and helps us live longer and healthier life. Obesity is one of these problems which should be avoided to live a healthy and longer life.

I wrote articles and posted them on this site where only those where were members would see it and sometimes  . It wasnâ€™t until I wrote some controversial article on any topic (gaming, politics, electronics or even religious) that i would get more than 4 or 5 comments and replying back would surely get me a few more, especially from those who replied just to contradict anything I said because they already had an opposing mentality with me. But after several years of blogging, more of a   than a writer, I still have the desire to keep blogging. Butâ€ùÂ_ why do I blog? From what I have seen thru out the years there are many kinds of reasons for people to blog. Some blog because itâ€™s something to do during off time of downtime at work; some blog because they like arguing and debating; others blog because they like to speak their minds and recently I learned that some blog because itâ€™s another source of income, in other words they can make money off of simply writing what ever comes to mind on any topic of their choice. Me? I blog for several reasons. For one thing I blog because itâ€™s fun. Although I have never been much of a reader, I enjoy reader what other people have to say. Even though bloggers can and do put a twist of their own in their blogs on any topic, I am more likely to listen to what they have to say than the Media who is more concerned with writing what they think people want to hear than providing real, complete and unedited stories. I also like to blog because I talk a lot. I mean I talk â€œa lotâ€ùÂù. In high school I was called â€œ â€œÂù (Iâ€™ve got my yearbook to prove it) and I was nominated for â€œclass clownâ€ùÂù and â€œclass chatterboxâ€ùÂù for my Senior Year. But while blogging is fun, a great place for a â€œmotormouthâ€ùÂù and the best place to voice my concerns; the biggest  to me is that not only can I help educate people but I also get educated in the process. Itâ€™s been my belief that the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were created with the intention of giving every citizen of this nation a place to live freely, a chance to live the American Dream, the ability to improve our culture, but most of all to have a Govâ€™t that, while responsible for safety, security and public services for the American people, was â€œ â€œÂù. But we live in times where people are not fully educated in our history and our rights and I simply want to do my part to help educate people on the basics and in the process learn things I did not know before. As I mentioned before, I recently learned that blogging can also be a  . Considering things are difficult these days, only a fool would pass up the possibility of getting paid to do something you like to do, something thatâ€™s actually fun and something where you can be your own boss. So I can accept that this would be yet another reason why I blog; although I have yet to venture in making money on my blog, I eventually will.",
06/02/2014,http://comluv.com/6-reasons-bloggers-fail/,6 Reasons Why Most Bloggers Fail! - ComLuv,"It is no joke â€“ the world loves to blog. It also loves any idea that will make money even when one sleeps hence the love for making money online. Yet, one worrisome fact remains that over 95% of blogs in the blogosphere today are either outright failures or are performing miserably bad! Why do these blogs fail? What are the bloggers behind these blogs doing wrong that make them tied to a check of less than $100 for an entire year? What could they change (or you change if you happen to be one of them) that would rake in subscribers, traffic and ultimately bring in the money? That and more, I shall reveal! For most bloggers, blogging is no more than looking around for a good blog (with a very serious and dedicated blogger) and consistently tapping every update unto to their own blogs! For such â€˜bloggerâ€™, the bulk of their content is either out rightly copied from another blog or spinned! It is as if they never get inspiration on their own or never bother to harness the array of topics that are yet to be written on. Google hates duplicate content with all its life! Duplicate content simply makes its botâ€™s work messier and unnecessarily tedious! Sites which are found to run duplicate entries are always delisted and organic traffic to such sites drops!               Truth be told â€“ most bloggers are dead unserious! They update their blogs when they feel like, the never bother to reply comments (or in extreme cases never even approve them) and generally donâ€™t take their visitors serious by providing crap content! The net effect is that the visitors of your site either make or simply mar youâ€_if you are adjudged by your audience as being dead unserious, how can they refer their friends to your blog or even visit your blog again? Another failed blogger in the making! Most bloggers have no idea about the basics of how a blog becomes either a success or a failure: their efforts amount to trial and error at best. For most of these bloggers, their daily reality is publishing a blog post (or copying one), posting it, promoting it on their Facebook walls (with a maximum of 500 friends, 400 of which may be offline and 80 unconcerned about the shared content) and relaxing. Such bloggers have no idea the benefits of leveraging unique talents in the blogosphere or never for once consider the power of networking! When you lack the basic idea of how a blog works, like most bloggers do, youâ€™re going to do it all alone (or why should you network?) Youâ€™ll never visit other blogs and seek to leave reasonable comments there (why should you? Why help another develop while youâ€™re still small?) With such a mindset, your blog will never be exposed and you run the risk of running a blog only you are aware of! Will you call such an online extension a blog? Blogging, and blogging successfully are two different things especially if you leave in the developing world! While the successful blogger knows and understands that he has to make serious arrangements for unforeseen circumstances like a laptop crash or poor network, the average (or poor blogger) simply is content with a single modem and laptop and still considers a tablet such as an iPad unnecessary in his blogging career. With power and steady internet challenge still a challenge in many countries (especially the ones that love to blog the most), it is very wise to at least have all the tools of blogging in pairs. This harsh reality really needs no further explanation. It either you have a â€˜backupâ€™ for your laptop, modem etcâ€_ Or face the humiliation of being another failed blogger! Your blog may have started out as a hobby. But the truth is that if nurtured properly, this hobby of yours holds the seed of a million dollar business that if leveraged properly, may make your current job look like childâ€™s play. Unfortunately, most bloggers never bother to treat their blogs like a business: it is the last thing they ever check (or update) in the day. How do you expect to make money with such an arrangement? Running a blog like a hobby is okay if you intend it to be a hobby! However, if you are looking towards actually making money from your site, quit being lazy! Wake up first thing in the morning and attend to your blog; it is a great idea to have something new everyday so that your readers can adequately benefit and have reason to check out your blog daily! But you may choose to run the blog like a hobby â€“ no problem! Donâ€™t just expect the check from AdSense (or any other monetization means) to exceed $100 dollars in a complete calendar year! The days of making huge amounts of money with a .com or .wordpress free domain extensions are gone â€“ and gone for good! If youâ€™re serious about making money online, why not invest in a high level domain (a .com?) It costs only $10 for a whole year. However, most bloggers want everything for free! Why should they pay when they can afford the â€˜sameâ€™ thing free of charge? Apart from testing to see if blogging is actually suit for someone, no blogger should ever bother with a low level domain except for fun or as a pure hobby. Why? The pains of a low level domain are simply not worth itâ€_so why bother? Iâ€™ve made this post as detailed as possible. My aim is to help every reader who comes across it with an idea why the world has many failed bloggersâ€_I have also attempted to make sure that the reader (thatâ€™s you) is put in a unique position which he can actually be better off and achieve success as a blogger.

03/02/2014,http://comluv.com/the-4-irrefutable-laws-of-blog-commenting/,The 4 Irrefutable Laws of Blog Commenting - ComLuv,"Whether you are launching a brand new blog or just putting out a new product or service, in all seriousness,  , you could successfully promote it just with blog commenting alone. Youâ€™d need to be strategic, consistent and intelligent about it, but there is so much more to blog commenting than you might think. Any successful blog launch needs a few things, mainly: visibility, accessibility, reach, and influence. If youâ€™re clever enough, you can see how all of these things, which I call the  , tie together to create one really impressive campaign and how persistent, strategic commenting can address them all. If you look closely, youâ€™ll notice that all of these things happen at once when you start leaving great comments. But you have to have the ability to see the bigger picture. Can you see it? Iâ€™m not talking about search engine visibility here. Iâ€™m talking about real, eyeballs-to-computer screen visibility (or screen reader visibility). When you are commenting, many eyes are going to see you. They are going to see your name, your comment, and probably your picture or avatar, too. Although not all blogs have it set up (but they should), the genius behind the   tool isnâ€™t that you get a fancy-looking link back to your blog, itâ€™s that people can see where the heck that link is going to take them. Rather than a mysterious link anchored with your name or keyword phrase, the actual title of your post is there for the world to see. If youâ€™ve got something special there, no use hiding it behind innuendos and cryptic language. This is your opportunity to create the easy button for prospective visitors. Spreading the word is a little different than just increasing visibility. The visibility part is a given, an obvious thing. The reason this law is so crucial is that, depending on what you say, you could successfully start the viral spread of your message just from a single comment. Think carefully about what you write, and also when you leave your The other day I left a comment on a someoneâ€™s blog â€“ someone new to me. In return, she checked me out. Then she replied back to my comment on her blog, telling everyone to go check out my blog because it was a great place for X, Y, Z, etc. Was I impressed? You betcha. Is it also true that instead of leaving a comment, I could have gone back to my blog and spent an hour writing an awesome post that gave her a tribute and hopefully she would talk about that on her own blog? Of course. But, the comment took less than 5 minutes and accomplished the same thing. And the whole progression was completely natural. Truthfully, all comments grow your back links, and this is probably the number one reason people leave comments, and why some of them are bogus and without substance. Bogus comments wonâ€™t help you out with the  , I should point out. However, regardless of whether they are bogus or not, and regardless of whether the receiving blog is nofollow or not, all comments increase the number of links going to your blog or whatever URL you leave when you comment. It just kills me when I see people leaving comments with no back link. Isnâ€™t there any site, any URL where people can go to find out more about you? Even if itâ€™s just to your Twitter page, you should get in the habit of linking back to a place where people can go to find out more about the mystery person who just left this great comment on their blog â€“ aka you. Your blog is not the only place you should be giving your two cents. Add to the community by chipping in. Think of your blog as your personal soapbox, and everyone elseâ€™s blogs as one gigantic community newspaper. You have the opportunity to contribute. Do not over think this! Fortunately for you, this isnâ€™t as challenging as Sudoku :). Just put what you are thinking after you read something in the comment box, and hit Submit. Easy peasy.

You leave positive comments on peopleâ€™s Blogs that are in the same market niche as you. They reciprocate and leave a comment on your Blog. The trick to   is to change your Blog to DoFollow. You do this via a plug-in usually. This means that the people commenting benefit from a â€˜bacllinkâ€™ to their Blog. The more back links the better for their SEO. In general the approach has worked for me I now have a PR3 Blog. The   seemed an ideal vehicle for   to comment on and their WordPress Plug-in makes commenting by visitors easy.

30/01/2014,http://comluv.com/leave-blogs-success-blind-luck/,Don't Leave Your Blogs Success Up to Blind Luck - ComLuv,"My blog represents little more than a way for me to expand my horizons and touch on only a small part of the world that is available to all of us online. Most of my freelance writing involves solidifying and manifesting specific subject matter for others which really isnâ€™t personally satisfying. My blog however allows me to run with my own thoughts from time to time and perhaps share some of what I learn as I continue to progress and develop my own creative focus. If I get a job inquiry then great, but really I just want the enjoyment. This doesnâ€™t mean however that I donâ€™t care if no one ever notices my blog. One of the most challenging aspects of blogging is  . While some of us may be concerned with prodding visitors into visiting sponsors and affiliates or buying something, and others could care less, just about every blogger wants comments. No matter who you are, if no one ever comments, it isnâ€™t too long before you find yourself wondering if the effort is worth it. If you look at the majority of opinions on the subject of  , youâ€™ll notice that there are a pretty standard set of suggestions floating around. Most will tell you to try working with controversial subjects or to make sure you respond when people leave a comment and little more. Thatâ€™s generally ok and common sense advice, but the truth is that it is pretty generic and rarely very effective. What you are trying to do is sell something. That something is your content. The currency is notice. And like any other sales, the best way to  is to put your merchandise in front of people who are interested in buying it. One of the most effective and proven methods for   is to comment on other blogs, which is also one of the usual recommendations given by the knowledgeable. However, just commenting and having a poster profile with a link to your blog is not enough. In order to really generate traffic and encourage comments you have to spend some time first putting together a cohesive plan of attack. First and foremost, have your content nailed down. Make sure it is well written and easily digested. Avoid fluff and make sure that you know something about your subject and have a defensible position you can build on. That will come in handy later if you are working with controversial subjects. Donâ€™t just post something because you think itâ€™ll incite someone to action, post about something that incites YOU to action and give it some detail. Next, pick and choose carefully where you comment. Youâ€™re looking to generate comments on your blog here and the best places to find them are other blogs that Donâ€™t confine your comments to blogs. Most newspapers and magazines allow comments on their articles and stories. Several consistently generate hundreds upon hundreds of comments and are fertile ground for comment hunters. More than one blogger has found themselves with some unexpected success after a few comments to an online magazine or news outlet. While you may be thinking this is obvious, youâ€™d be surprised how many bloggers never think to frequent newspaper forums and magazines and  . Donâ€™t be afraid to ask more of your visitors. Chances are, if they are interested enough to comment, they are willing to expand on what theyâ€™ve added. When replying to comments on your blog ask questions, look for ways to elicit more information, prod them into support of their own positions. When you simply say thanks and leave your reply at that, you are in essence saying your subject has nothing else to offer. One of the best ways to keep traffic and comments from flowing in is to spam other blogs. Never post short little â€œLove your siteâ€ùÂù comments. Put the same care and consideration into your comments as you would on your own blog posts. Add to the discussion and give other visitors something to chew on thatâ€™ll make them want to know more about you. Donâ€™t bother with commenting to 20 different blogs. Commenting on 3 quality blogs with quality comments will negate the need to engage in quantity commenting and generate far more traffic than comments to 20 obscure blogs. Plus, it will keep you from appearing desperate even if you are. Those are some of my own humble suggestions that Iâ€™ve learned the hard way. Of course there is no guarantee of instant success, but I can tell you with complete confidence that these tactics work and work very well. Spend a week trying them. Take note of your site statistics and after a week of commenting to other blogs and outlets in this manner compare your more recent stats with the old ones. Pay special attention to your bounce rate and traffic sources and youâ€™ll see some pretty significant improvements. Even if youâ€™re comment rate doesnâ€™t go through the roof, the improvements in traffic and comment quality alone are worth the relatively small effort it takes to implement a cohesive  . Like anything else, if you want to experience any success then you have to plan for it and put those plans into action. If you donâ€™t, then you are leaving your chances up to blind luck, and luck has never been a very reliable path to success. Image credit:  !

The first thing I did that actually got people to my blog was join in on daily memes (or blog hops). There are some really great memes out there just begging for people to join in. Many of them even give bloggers a prompt and tell you what you can write about. You may notice that I run a few giveaways on my blog. That started from the misconception that if I drove in traffic, I would gain readers. But, you have got to be careful with this. I am a firm believer that giveaways will   you traffic, but only real meaningful content will  . Giveaway comments are not quality, they are quantity. I still do them, though, because they are pure fun. You cannot write a blurb about your trip to the post office and expect to receive meaningful, insightful comments.

The first step to making money from your blog is to get some visitors or â€œtrafficâ€ù. Once you have traffic flowing to your website, you need to monetize that traffic. The best way to monetize traffic bar none is to recommend them a product. It doesnâ€™t matter whether or not it is your own product, it could be a product you are anÂ affiliateÂ for. The most important thing is that the product is of a high quality standard and you will make some money by recommending. Now you need to funnel your traffic into buying your product. The way I like to do this is to create a page that follows the following format. Your first goal when someone visits your web page is to grab their attention, if you fail this step youâ€™ve more than likely lost that person forever. If you need help with your headlines   has a full section dedicated to exactly that. Example: â€œFrom Geek to Freak â€“ How I Gained 20 of Muscleâ€ù Once you have the users attention then you have to emphasis with them and let them know that theyâ€™re not the only one with their problem. Example: You could tell a story of how you, or an associate was overweight for five years and was frequently bullied. By now you should have established an initial connection with the reader, itâ€™s time to let them know that there is a solution to their problem. Example: â€œThatâ€™s when I found out about John and his â€˜six pack abs courseâ€™ and more importantly I discovered losing weight is possible.â€ù At this point the reader is aware that there is a product on the market, but they still donâ€™t know exactly how this will benefit them. In this part you need to explain (in as much detail as possible) how they will benefit from this product. Example: â€œThrough the use of aÂ revolutionaryÂ new system John will guide you from your current state to one where you can be happy with your body. Finally you will be able to go to the beach without feeling ashamed.â€ù Lastly, and possibly most importantly is your â€œcall to actionâ€ù. This is where you tell the reader exactly what they need to do. Whether it be opt-in to a newsletter, sign up for an account, buy a product. It doesnâ€™t matter, the key point is to make it clear what you want the reader to do and give them a reason why. Example: â€œAre you ready to lose weight today just like me? Buy Johnâ€™s â€˜six pack abs courseâ€™ by clicking  .â€ù Creating a sense of urgency is a great way to boost sales by encouraging people to stop procrastinating. A simple way of creating urgency is to add something to the offer but limiting it to a specific time period. Hereâ€™s an example, building on the example above.

If you create a site and nobody knows about it â€“ it is no difference from websites that have not been created. Before we get started with methods to attract referral traffic to your website, here is the difference between direct, organic and referral traffic. There are three types of traffic that you need to get to your website and they are in a nutshell: * Organic traffic â€“ This is when search engines like google.com, yahoo.com, bingâ€_ etc, find you. Before getting to this stage, you need to have good content on your blog and even better Search Engine Optimization, (SEO) * Direct Traffic â€“ This happens when people directly went to your website, via bookmarks, typing in the URL example www.comluv.com _Ÿ˜€ * And now Referral traffic: Traffic that comes from people visiting your website from links that were placed on other sites is known as  . (example: If you visit my website moneyhomeblog.com by clicking on it here: this is referral traffic from  .) Before we can talk about how to get referral traffic to our website, it is okay to discuss or refresh our memories on what referral traffic is and that is what we have done above, now lets check out the methods to get referral traffic. If you build a new website, it will take sometime before it will be indexed in google and also it may take even longer time before you will start ranking for your targeted keywords, meanwhile, I advise bloggers not to wait for google to send them traffic before making money off their blog. I created a website some few weeks ago and was eager to rank the website and decided to get targeted referral traffic and this is exactly what I did- you can read my Journey on  . Without much ado, let get started with the topic here. 1. You can get almost instant referral 2. You know the power of guest posting already, if you donâ€™t, then you are still in the old age :D. Find out websites in your niches that accept guest posts or sponsored posts and then you can publish your posts on this websites and get quality referral traffic to your website or product. 3. The power of Social media is no longer a myth, if you are busy, you can hire someone to take care of your social networkingâ€_ You can generate lot of quality traffic to your website. A lot of people conclude or assume that social media is just about Facebook and Twitter. There are plenty of other platforms where you should be active in order to drive more referral traffic to your website. These include but not limited to YouTube, Google+, LinkedIn and the recently popular Pinterest. 4. Wherever there are groups of people who are interested in what you offer, then there is nothing stopping you from joining discussion boards to contribute to the discussion and then chip in your links once in a while. Some forums allow users to add links in their signatures. Make use of that. 5. This is my own sure way to get referral traffic that converts! I have been using yahoo answers for years and until now they have never disappoint me. You will get the most out of yahoo answer if your link is click-able. You will need to have a level 2 and above to make your links to be click-able. If you donâ€™t have one, you can create one or use services from fiver. One good thing about doing this is that you will at the same time be creating quality white-hat-like backlinks to your website. I told Isaiah Joe from   and within a few months of creating his website he is already ranking for some tough keywords and have a PR2! IF you want to diversify your link building, then get started building referral traffic to your site. See my full list of  .

23/01/2014,http://comluv.com/5-useful-wordpress-plugins-bloggers-freelancers/,5 Most Useful WordPress Plugins for Bloggers and Freelancers - ComLuv,"One of the primary reasons why WordPress is such a popular CMS is its flexibility and simplicity. It offers a huge variety of options, even for users with very basic computer knowledge. WordPress plugins cover almost every need of a webmaster from security and performance to user engagement and sales. This is the reason why the majority of bloggers and freelancers prefer WordPress for their websites. Hereâ€™s a list of 5 very useful WordPress plugins for bloggers and freelancers to add more flavor to your website. Finding a secure and reliable payment management and selling service is a major challenge for most freelancers who sell products/services through their websites.   is just the ideal solution for this problem. With Selz, you can sell your services and digital/conventional products with a simple WordPress plugin. Itâ€™s a free plugin that can be integrated in your website seamlessly without any need for technical knowledge and expertise. A major advantage of using Selz is its user friendly functions and interface. It is simple and easy to implement for site owners, as well as being quick and easy for customers to purchase without having to leave the site. Selz handles the secure processing of credit card transactions and the automated delivery of digital files when purchased. It also saves the email addresses of every buyer, and can be integrated with major email services like Mailchimp, AWeber etc. In short, Selz is an ideal WordPress plugin for anyone who wants to start selling within a few minutes on his website. Although there are very few loopholes in WordPress as a content management system, but thereâ€™s still some room for improvement. One of the weaker areas of WordPress is its default search mechanism. You donâ€™t always get the most relevant results with the internal search engine of WordPress. This can lead to dissatisfied website visitors and increased bounce rates. Fortunately, you can use Better Internal Link Search, an awesome WordPress plugin, to solve this problem. Better Internal Link Search gives you the control of developing your own search engine algorithm for WordPress. But donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s nothing technical. You can simply decide what areas of a post WordPress should search when a user enters a search query. The default WordPress search engine searches everything including post/page title and the complete content. You can limit this to only post/page titles, tags, categories and any other areas you feel necessary. On the face of it, these are simple options, but since theyâ€™re not a part of the original WordPress search algorithm, thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re extremely handy Building a sizable mailing list is one of the top priorities for any blogger. And thereâ€™s no better way to do that than using the Hello Bar. Developed by the CrazyEgg team, the Hello Bar can be used for a number of objectives. It does an amazing job in building your email list by immediately catching the visitorâ€™s attention. You can integrate it with any of the leading email services including Mailchimp and AWeber. It simply appears on top of the screen every time a visitor comes to your website. You can also customize the bar according to the theme of your site. Apart from list building, you can use Hello Bar for driving traffic to your most important pages or highlighting any particular product or segment on your website. Although itâ€™s a very simple and old plugin, but itâ€™s still so effective that I would recommend it to every blogger. Comment Reply Notification plugin significantly improves user engagement on your blog. A lot of the times when a visitor leaves a comment on your blog, he never returns to read your reply, because he never knows if you replied or not. Comment Reply Notification, as the name suggests, send an email of your reply to the original commenter. In majority of the cases, this leads to another comment by the user in response to your email. This simple plugin is very handy in kicking off conversations with your visitors and making them spend more time on your blog. It also helps you identify the real problems and needs of your visitors that you can address in future blog posts. [editors note :   has an advanced version of Comment Reply notification that can do even more!] Website security has always been a major concern for most WordPress users. But the threat has increased significantly over the last few years. Apart from other security measures, the WordPress 2 Step Verification plugin would be an ideal addition to your website defense system. This plugin adds an additional verification layer on your WordPress login page. Once you enter your username and password, the plugin would then ask you to enter a unique one time generated security code that will be sent to your mobile phone as an SMS. You can also generate the security code using the WordPress code generation app on your mobile phone. So even if a hacker manages to enter your correct username and password, he would still need the unique security code to enter your website (which, of course, will only be sent to you). WordPress is an ideal platform for bloggers and freelancers to set up their websites and online shops. Using the right plugins would improve the overall user experience and functionality of your website even more. If you think there are other plugins that I shouldâ€™ve added in this list, do let me know in the comments section.",Jawad Khan

Every blogging forum and community is full of posts highlighting the benefits of guest blogging. However, many bloggers never really make enough planned effort in order to get the maximum benefit out of their guest posts. This is why youâ€™ll find a lot of them complaining about the ineffectiveness of guest blogging and how it has been unnecessarily hyped up. In reality though, if you take certain pre and post guest blogging measures and think strategically, thereâ€™s no reason why your guest post wonâ€™t do well. Here are 5 things that your should do to create impactful guest posts. This is one of the most obvious, yet mostly overlooked, reasons why many bloggers fail to make an impact with guest blogging. Before starting your guest blogging campaign, define clear goals that you want to achieve from it. Whether your objective with guest blogging is to create backlinks to your website or to build the brand image of your company, you need to be clear about it from the start. Your objective will define the type of content you develop for your guest posts. An unclear objective will lead to an ineffective post that will fail to achieve solid results for you and waste the time of your audience.  Once youâ€™ve clearly defined your objectives from guest blogging, itâ€™s time to target the right blogs. Based on your objectives, filter out the most relevant blogs and create contentÂ that fits with them. Make sure that your content is in line with your target blogs. It should address the problems of the blogsâ€™ audience and should highlight actionable points to move forward. An overwhelming number of bloggers write generic posts with no real value in it for the readers and expect other blogs to publish them. And even when they do target the right blogs, the content of their posts is usually not in line with their guest blogging objectives. This is why it is absolutely Whenever you publish a guest post on any other established blog, you are likely to receive tons of traffic from it. Preparing for this traffic in advance is critical for the success of your guest post. Unfortunately, this is where a large number of guest bloggers fail to take benefit. The visitors referred from your guest post will most likely never return to your blog again if they do not find anything too hook them up on your blog. This is why it is always recommended to design a special landing page for the visitors that are referred through your guest post. One of your main objectives should always be to increase your email list subscribers. Once you get the email addresses, you can develop regular contact with your subscribers through new blog posts and emails. So make sure you do not ignore this crucial part of the guest blogging cycle. Your guest post has been published, and youâ€™ve started to receive comments and referral visitors to your website â€“  . You need to engage with your readers in the post comments and respond to their queries. Be a part of their discussions and respect the time that theyâ€™ve spent reading your post. Similarly, make sure you actively promote your guest post as well. It will not only get you in the good books of the editor of your host blog, but also enhance your chances of getting more referral traffic from your guest post. A great way to maximize the impact of your guest post is to write a follow up post about the same topic on your own blog. In the follow up post, you can either add something new for the readers or elaborate even further on the same points discussed in your guest post. Once you do that, email the editor of your host blog and ask them to link your follow up post with your guest post. Tell them how it would help their readers understand the topic even further. In most cases, if your post has value, editors would be happy to link back. Guest blogging is a great way to attract new visitors to your blog and increase your email subscribers. However, you need to plan carefully before you start guest blogging to make sure that your efforts get the maximum reward.",Jawad Khan
11/01/2014,http://comluv.com/top-ten-suggestion-increase-contract-bond-line/,Our Top Ten Suggestion on how to Increase your Contract Bond Line - ComLuv,"In todayâ€™s unsteady economic situation and tight market, it has been increasingly harder for some service providers to get bid, construction and contract bonds.Â  For small construction company owners and larger companies alike, it has been an environment where there are more roadblocks to acquiring deal bonds â€“ all this at a time where more owners are requiring those bonds. But itâ€™s not all bad news.Â  Even though the marketplace and economy may look dim right now, there are certain steps that you can take to ensure that you are doing all you can to make this process easier and (hopefully) cheaper. Below are our Top 10 helpful pointers to increase your contract bond line. Discovering an excellent Certified Public Accountant is THE place to begin.Â  Your CPA should be more than just a bean counter.Â  Instead, they   to take the time to understand your business and the proper way to disclose completed and in-process deals.Â Â  These techniques of accountancy (â€œaccountancy,â€ù is that a word?) must be used to not only give your surety bond firm with all the needed details that they need, but also be presented in a way that offers the best financial picture of your company to the surety.Â  This ability â€“ to offer the necessary financial statements, in the best possible way, (and a bit of tax assistance) is critical to your success as a contractor. Thus, an experienced CPA will present your financials in an expert way that paints the most effective picture to surety firms and job owners alike.Â  This, combined with solid tax advice, can reduce your cash outlay significantly. Many of the most successful construction businesses view their internal finance staff as a critical piece of their operation instead of just a cost to be borne by the business.Â  A knowledgeable CFO or Controller is going to be one of your best hires.Â  Their knowledge, along with a good staff, makes your bid process, collection process and compliance paperwork efficient and appropriate.Â  This will speed up collections and stretch out your payments (the goal: reduce A/R and increase A/P). There are a variety of things that a knowledgeable finance staff can do for your business.Â  A good, efficient collection process starts with getting the bill out quickly.Â  Even more, your staff should be able to detail your expenditures so that you can operationally determine where to best spend your money (many contractors can increase sales/marketing by 2-4% this way; wouldnâ€™t you LOVE an additional 5-10 good sales per year?). Finally, your staff can work with you and your CPA to determine the best way to present your financials.Â  This helps keep your bank costs, insurance costs and surety bond costs as low as possible. Great businesses understand the rules of the game and play well within those rules.Â  Not only that, itâ€™s crucial to know your legal rights and the legal rights of others involved with a construction contract. This includes the general contractor, all subcontractors, vendors and the owner.Â  As a contractor, you need to be aware of lien and stop-notice laws (they differ from state to state, and they are revised nearly every year).Â  If you lose sight of those rights, you could miss something and that could cost you dearly in time, energy and lost revenue.Â  The general contractor is probably going to be responsible for paying all salaries on the site, even if they are technically supposed to be paid by the subcontractor.Â  Many state agencies will apply minimum or prevailing salaries â€“ which can be much more than the bargained rate through the subcontractor (talk about a budget buster). It is also vital to know any pending legislation and have a top-notch lawyer who deals with construction matters on a regular basis to keep you informed. Finally, you need to know the ins and outs of any payment bonds on your projects.Â  Itâ€™s not enough to have a payment bond.Â  Itâ€™s YOUR job to know the details of that bond.Â  That is, who gets paid, when they get paid and how do they get paid.Â  These details are critical in your everyday cash flow.Â  If you know the details up front, it can save you a ton of time in repayment, fees, etc.Â  Lots of contractors regret â€œwinningâ€ù in court several years after the job was completed.Â  The legal fees and loss of cash flow was the real pain in the project. As a contractor, your cash flow can be quite different than other companies. Itâ€™s important that your bank loan officer and relationship board understand the building market and the different financing risks that are connected with general contractors and subcontractors.Â  Itâ€™s a great idea for you explain to the decision-makers at the bank these intricacies in financing a contractor.Â  Better yet, itâ€™s good to develop a relationship with your bank.Â  Account managers come and go, so it is essential that you maintain consistent contact with your bank. We used to tell people to set up a web site.Â  Guess what?Â  Not anymore.Â  Now we tell them to get a web site and establish a strong social media presence.Â  You would be amazed at how few contractors have a web site or understand how crucial it is.Â  Even more, many contractors do not understand why they need to have a presence on the web, including most social media outlets (think LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Owners, developers, and clients expect to be able to learn about a possible colleague with a click of a button. Nowadays, a construction business that does not have a web present is considered out of touch with the current demands of the marketplace. Companies that do not promote themselves online have a difficult time convincing others that they have the same capabilities as other service providers who have taken the time to establish an informative web presence. Finally a bonus to your web presence is that prospective employees consider it crucial when choosing an employer.Â  Your web presence can also potentially end up being a center of communication for your staff/employees, merchants, clients, and subs. A contractor MUST pay extremely close attention to their open receivables. The most successful companies make really clear exactly what the payment timetable will be   beginning any job.Â  Then, they consistently apply their collection policies and guidelines.Â  One tip is to pre-qualify clients and validate their readily available funding to make sure what is open to cover the amount of the contract. This is so vital because in todayâ€™s building economy, after acquiring a job, the most difficult component is getting paid for it. This can be the single greatest thing that you can do to get a great bond rate.Â  Remember, your bond underwriter is a person too.Â  Like everyone else, they appreciate meeting who it is that they are trying to underwrite.Â  Make it about more than your numbers.Â  Give them a face to go with the name.Â  Give them your story â€“ why youâ€™re in business, why youâ€™re passionate about what you do and why youâ€™re a good risk. Try and get a relationship both with your local branch underwriter as well as the home office underwriter.Â  Although the branch expert can be a strong proponent for you, the real decision maker is at the surety firmâ€™s home office. Hey, you spend a bunch each month on specialists to provide you the services that you need.Â  Your CPA, lawyer, insurance broker, bond broker, etc., all provide specialized services that you need.Â  All of these providers need to be kept informed in what youâ€™re doing. That way, these people can tailor their advice to best meet the needs of your business.Â  Instead of them trying to guess at what youâ€™re doing, theyâ€™ll know and devise a plan to maximize your business results.Â  Phone calls are great, but regular texts or emails are also welcome.Â  Anything that lets them know whatâ€™s going on is great. Youâ€™ve spent your entire life making your reputation, right?Â  So donâ€™t let others manage that reputation for you.Â  There are three parts to this: 1) who you know; 2) what they say about you; and 3) what you say about you. 1) Who you know.Â  Your relationships define you.Â  Those subcontractors, vendors, engineers, architects, are all important as their work on a job will affect you.Â  Try and work with the best people possible.Â  They will, in many ways, define who you are.Â  Also, donâ€™t forget about your CPA, lawyer, etc.Â  They are also influencers in the community. 2) What they say about you.Â  Donâ€™t let a few bad apples define who you are.Â  Be proactive in heading off any disputes (youâ€™d be surprised how many people put their head in the sand until itâ€™s too late).Â  Deal with your issues head on.Â  Itâ€™s hard, but itâ€™s worth it.Â  Finally, why donâ€™t you ask everyone what they say about you?Â  Youâ€™ll appreciate the feedback.Â  More importantly, why have you asked them for a referral?Â  It canâ€™t hurt to ask (if they do say good things about you). 3) What you say about you.Â  Iâ€™m as bad about this as anyone.Â  I grew up in a home where it was not appropriate to brag about yourself.Â  Ok, so donâ€™t do that.Â  But itâ€™s ok to go ahead and let others know what youâ€™re doing.Â  They can judge for themselves how great you are.Â  Use your social media accounts and mailing lists. And finally among the most important tricks to a successful surety program is to find a great surety broker. Â What a good surety bond broker does is match you with the proper surety provider. In todayâ€™s difficult surety market, a good, educated broker understands all of the different areas of your operations and how your operations (and financial statements) affect your surety credit. Â A good broker maintains the relationships with the surety so that they can understand all of the different aspects of the formulas that each surety favors. Â The number of active sureties in the market continues to decrease, so there are fewer choices.Â  So, when bond line capability becomes an obstacle, it is important to have all possible choices available.Â  Â A knowledgeable surety broker needs to be able to work withÂ  your CPA and internal finance staff, know how the game is played, have good relationships with banks (and be able to work with your bank), and can work with you on how to best position your story â€“ so that the surety can provide you with the best possible bond line.",Gary

03/01/2014,http://comluv.com/building-healthy-habits-way-build-healthy-relationship/,Building Healthy Habits: The Only Way To Build A Healthy Relationship - ComLuv,"Whether it is a new year, a new month, a new week, or a new day, building and engaging in healthy habits is important. This is true in all areas of your life, including your relationships. In fact, relationships are built upon habits. You either have positive or negative habits, and you either have a positive or negative relationship because of those habits. For example, if you are in the habit of coming home and watching TV instead of talking to your partner about their day, then that contributes in some way to your relationship. Depending on your partner, it may contribute in a good way or a bad way, but it does contribute. The bottom line is that everything you do in your relationship affects your relationship; and when you understand that, you can start to have a healthier relationship. Note: Are you single? Having a healthy relationship is different for everyone, because everyone has different values, beliefs, and traits that make them unique. Some people will be happy in a long distance relationship while others enjoy being together 24 hours a day. The one thing that every relationship does have in common, though, is â€“ thatâ€™s right, habits. Just because you develop positive habits, it doesnâ€™t mean that you are not going to fight, go against one of the habits one day, or have other issues in the relationship. It does, however, mean that the majority of your relationship will be based around good solid behavior that ensures there are many more positive days than negative days in your relationship. The hard part about building habits is that it takes work and consistency. You canâ€™t just say you are going to do something, do it one day, and then say â€œThere! I have contributed to the relationship in a positive way.â€ù When it comes to habits, it is all or nothing. What you repeatedly do becomes who you are, which means that you have toÂ  Â do healthy things in your relationship to make your relationship healthy. It can be hard to develop healthy relationship habits at first. For instance, trying to communicate with your partner when you have never done it before can be hard to implement and stick to. I found the following slide about building new habits, and I really like the concept. Take a peek and see what you think about this â€˜tinyâ€™ way of building new behaviors. There are many different areas of your relationship that can benefit from new habits. To talk about all the habits would require a book, but knowing where you need to develop good habits can help you go out and find the specific habits you want (and need) to develop. Following are some areas where habits will benefit your relationship and an example of one habit you may want to develop for each area. Obviously there is much more to a relationship and many more habits you can develop. But the point is that you are going to be building habits regardless, so if you care about your partner and your happiness, you might as well make them good habits that contribute to your relationship positively.",Bellaisa

Yes, you could promote yourself or earn money from it but everyone needs to find its own way. People could just help but no one will tell you the exact step by step guide to earn money. Anyway, these networks are made to provide entertainment and you can use them to watch out all your favourite videos in no time. Let me start with the most popular video sharing network. Youtube is one of the most popular video sharing network which was started by Paypal workers in 2006 and later bought by Google Inc after seeing how rapidly it has been growing since its start. People use Youtube for promotion and to share what they like in form of videos. It is among the world top 10 most visited sites. If you have a Google account then you do not need to register to Youtube. Just upload your favourite videos and enjoy. Dailymotion is again a popular video network with a huge database where you could watch all your favourite videos without any problem. As Youtube has been banned in many countries Dailymotion acts as an alternative in that countries for people who love watching videos. Recently, I keep Metacafe because of its overall popularity. Anyway, I have been watching Metacafe since it started and with the ability to upload videos it also embeded Youtube videos but now there database has grown a lot. It is also an impressive site with great looks and a huge amount of traffic is received by Metacafe. They have some limitations in uploading videos but there quality and speeds are just awesome. So people can basically use it for entertainment. Vimeo is also a popular network but basically it is a bit different from the 3 above. The all above are almost free and do not have any kind of premium packages but vimeo has some free limitations and offers a Vimeo Plus package for users to enjoy video streaming. They do not put that annoying ads a lot to earn money like every other video sharing network does but rather they provide some awesome services through which they generate revenue like Videos on Demand etc. Overall Vimeo is good and can be used to store your personal videos. Trueflick is a newly emerged and rapidly growing video sharing network. It is good for watching videos rather than promoting or uploading because they do not have a lot of traffic right now as compared to Youtube but they have some good speeds. You should check it out for sure. You could watch your favourite videos at high speeds here for free. I know there are many other Video sharing networks which I have missed but you could share them below in comments.",Hamza Ahmad
26/12/2013,http://comluv.com/expanding-solo-startup-without-breaking-bank-law/,Expanding Your Solo Startup Without Breaking the Bank (or the Law) - ComLuv,"It starts with something small: a passion-fueled blog, a consulting contract, a few freelance gigs. If youâ€™re lucky, you build up some momentum and see opportunities to build something bigger. With those opportunities come greater responsibility, and individuals are often ill-equipped to handle such a workload by themselves. There comes a point when expanding a solo project becomes necessary. While letting others into your business might feel uncomfortable, down the line it can feel liberating. Executed and operated properly, a business can eventually survive without you. That means collecting paychecks while spending your time on other ventures, while others do the heavy lifting in the business. Itâ€™s one among many perks of building a business from the ground floor. Startup expansion does have its obstacles. Inexperienced entrepreneurs will find them lurking around every corner. Improperly handling any of them might mean troubles with finances â€” or worse, the law. Cautious new entrepreneurs should take measures to ensure that everything is above-board before getting too deep into the business. It all starts with a simple mantra: Of all operating expenses,  . Thatâ€™s for good reason, of course. Without them youâ€™d never get anything done. Still, owners can help keep those costs controlled. The easiest way is to ensure that employees you hire stay with the company. Turnover can be costly, given the expenses of attracting and training employees.  To hire slowly might be to impede growth, but unless you need quick cash, initial growth shouldnâ€™t be a huge priority. (And if you need cash quick, starting a business probably isnâ€™t the best route.) Taking the time to learn about potential employees decreases the chances youâ€™ll hire the wrong people. Bring in the right people from the start, and youâ€™ll have people that can grow with the company and help the company grow. The wrong people will just impede growth for longer. When employees clearly arenâ€™t working out, fire them quickly. Yes, thereâ€™s a chance that they can turn things around, that theyâ€™re just going through something. A startup canâ€™t afford to have such patience, though. It might seem cold-hearted, but this is your livelihood Small businesses canâ€™t afford the in-house services that larger businesses enjoy. Chances are you donâ€™t have the budget for a personal assistant, or even an IT department. But that doesnâ€™t mean you should outsource everything possible. There might be immediate cost savings, but in the long run those cost savings can turn into logistical nightmares.  Many outsourced services can cost you significant capital, when there are reasonably priced in-house solutions. For instance, you can use   services instead of outsourcing to a paycheck company. Given the power of modern cloud software, that will end up saving you even if it means learning how to use and operate unfamiliar software.  Again, with meager funds, owners must be choosy with how they spend money. Some services are more worthy than others, and perhaps none is as worthy as a lawyer. Not that youâ€™re going to get sued left and right. Lawsuits can happen, but theyâ€™re not exactly common. The reality is that you might need to consult a lawyer about any number of things. Having one at the ready can be crucial. How can you engage a lawyer? Itâ€™s not as though you can just sidle up to one and ask him to be available when you need to ask questions. Chances are youâ€™ll need to establish a business relationship. What better way to start than when you need to file incorporation papers? There are company that will do this for you, but if   make a mistake you could be in some trouble. Finding a lawyer to do it might cost more money, but it will establish an important relationship for the future of your business. This last is the main message of the bestselling  . If you keep working in your business â€” that is, doing the work that led to you starting the business â€” youâ€™re going to fail. Like heavy machinery, businesses do not operate themselves. They need people at the helm, guiding the overall mission. That canâ€™t happen if youâ€™re busy being a technician.  The consequence of not working   the business is that it will start to bleed cash. Accounts wonâ€™t be kept up. Unneeded expenses will go unchecked. The business will not only lack direction, but will bleed cash. If youâ€™re wondering why so many great-looking businesses fail, this is the No. 1 reason. Owners have to work   the business before all else.",Joe Pawlikowski
24/12/2013,http://comluv.com/time-running-apply-tips-improve-blogging-productivity/,Time Is Running Out! Apply These Tips To Improve your Blogging Productivity - ComLuv,"Basically, we unintentionally waste time without noticing. As a blogger, I hate wasting time; recently Iâ€™ve read some productivity books and managed to increase my blogging productivity. So, in this article Iâ€™ll share some methods thatâ€™ll help you to increase your blogging productivity. I have found this method very useful and it works quite well. As bloggers, we are free souls; we donâ€™t have someone like Boss or an authoritative person to set rules or deadlines, thisÂ is indeed good being a freelancer, but sometimes we tend to misuse this luxury by â€“ Procrastinating. Sometimes, we forward our tasks, we skip doing unattractive tasks and we simply procrastinate. This type of procrastination will decrease your blogging growth and productivity. So setup rules and follow it strictly with discipline like a soldier; Set deadlines yourself; I have decided to write at least 5-6 publishable article every week, by doing this I can store lots of articles in my draft for future. Its been some days Iâ€™m following this rule which Iâ€™ve set and Iâ€™ll continue to do so. So if you want to get more productive things done, then set deadlines yourself and follow it strictly. You started to work on your projects; suddenly something distracted you, your internet is very slow, what you do? You make an excuse to yourself and postpone your work. I used to do this often, but not anymore because I realized that we make these excuses just to skip doing uncomfortable works; we give unnecessary reasons to ourselves to procrastinate. We do this on a daily basis because we want comfort, but remember; success always lies out of your comfort zone. You have to get out of your comfort zone to achieve your desired blogging goals. We often stay quiet and donâ€™t do any productive tasks because we believe in tomorrow. We think tomorrow will be easier, we think things will settle itself, but if you donâ€™t work today, tomorrow will get much worse. Iâ€™ve seen people talking about New If you donâ€™t write blog posts/guest posts today, your competitor will go ahead. And you canâ€™t catch him tomorrow. This is simple logic we tend to donâ€™t understand because of our laziness and negative mindset. Do as much productive tasks as possible today, and youâ€™ll be happier tomorrow. If youâ€™ve watched WWEÂ wrestling on TV then Iâ€™m sure you probably know about the â€˜no-holds barredâ€™ matches; here you can smash your opponent with anything you want â€“ no rules, no restraints, no limits. In blogging, you need follow this method â€“ Set goals and chase them without any restraints; this will help you to stay focused and productive. Instead of going for comfort, think about the end goal, think about the rewards you get later. How to set goals and follow them? Make your big goals into small parts, and follow a 7-day rule. For example; for the next 7 days follow these strict rules â€“ no television, no entertainment, no social networks, etc. Eliminate everything that is unproductive and distracts you. Follow this day-to-day, in these days write as many blog posts, guest articles as you can. If you follow this rule just for the seven days you can change a lot of things. Working 10 hours/day continues doesnâ€™t mean you can do productive tasks. As a blogger or writer, working long hours wonâ€™t be good and itâ€™s less productive. Blogging needs creativity; I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll stay creative for long hours. Your writing will always reflect your mood.Â  According to some researches, it will only take 21 days of consistent actions to build a new habit. So if you want to improve at something, for example, if you hate writing, you can make writing as your habit if you follow this rule consistently for 21 days. But you need to set a positive frame of mind to take constant actions. For bloggers, writing is the most important task and there is no way to skip it, you canâ€™t be a good blogger if you hate writing, so try to apply this 21-day challenge to get more things done. Blogging is all about doing productive tasks; we had to work productively to get things going. So try to follow the above points to stay productive at blogging.

Just like the word cool, no one really knows when and how come it became a fad, but somehow both, cool and jeans, have managed to fight the changing times and still remain relevant and still so cool. Interwoven at different angles and lighter threads (argh  ), there lies in our wardrobe, the natural earthy tone color chino and its somewhat less dressier day-to-day around-the-house khaki, (though both are used interchangeably . Casual dress nowadays frequently dictates the standard of jeans, but can chinos/khakis stand up to the challenge of the all-time mount Olympus of casual â€“  Let the battle begin with the skinnier heavyweight champions â€“ the ripped skinny jeans and the skinny khaki pants Iâ€™ve rounded up for  . Round one, when the weather starts to heat up too much, you do not want to be wearing denim, the khaki pant, or chino is the perfect alternative with its lighter material. That said they are great with boots and a jumper, making them an ideal outfit for the winter months as well. Chinos are one of those wonderful garments that can be worn in multiple situations. Pairing rolled up chinoâ€™s with flip flops or sandals and a tank top will create an effortlessly casual look that can be worn around town, or on the beach. The chino can also be a great item to wear on a night out. Wear white skinny chino pants with a pair of high heels and a nice top and you are on to a winner tonight. I have even worn chinoâ€™s to Chinoâ€™s also come in a wide variety of colors, adding to their diversity even more. This opens you up to the opportunity of wearing bold statement colors.

Pastel colored chinoâ€™s are great summer wear and keep the same chino class without having to stick the mundane beige of traditional chinoâ€™s. When it comes to the style of chino/khaki pants, you canâ€™t go too wrong. For smarter occasions there are more tailored chinoâ€™s which are suitable for office wear or more formal events and meetings. If youâ€™re looking for something smart casual, like an outfit you could wear to a bar for example, then the skinny chino is a great option, in any color. There is also the loose fitting straight legged style which does wonders for the appearance of a longer leg. Short chinoâ€™s tend to sit just below the knee and are usually a more summery option to be worn with flip flops. That said, the shorter length of chino looks great with a pair of heels. Avoid the cargo pant style as it does absolutely nothing to flatter your figure, or gain you any points for style. They may be comfy, but sometimes comfort just isnâ€™t worth looking that frumpy. The chino in all its versatile greatness should be a sure resident in every womanâ€™s wardrobe, whether itâ€™s a trip to the beach or an office meeting, there is quite literally a chino for every occasion. Lastly, thereâ€™s a chino for every taste and when itâ€™s just right you know it, or as wisely expressed by Goldilocks (and three bears) when tasting the steamy sweet porridge: â€œOWW!â€ù she yelled â€œthis is too hot!â€ù, â€œBrrrr!â€ù she complained â€œthis is too cold!â€ù, and thenâ€_ the inevitable, invincible â€œYUMMY!â€ù when itâ€™s just right!

Here is a direct link to read about It.  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  Digg I would be explaining in simple terms how to get backlinks that matters from these  . Most people always thought that theyâ€™re building backlinks from these authority websites, but what they donâ€™t know, is that theyâ€™re actually spamming in the most â€œmarked as spamâ€ù way, which might get their account suspended or disabled. When building backlinks from authority websites, make it look more like youâ€™re human, and youâ€™re trying to enrich the lives of their (social network) users, which could be achieved by writing more than 100 words + and add a link to read more about it. That would certainly make it look wonderful. According to latest facebook update, the more your words followed by your link, the more you will have views and reached people youâ€™re targeting. I have a short story to share about Google+ community, when it came out, I was like, since google owns this community, hundreds of their bots must be waiting to rank any website that is shared here, and I guess you know what I did? Well, I start a massive spamming campaign, sharing just less than 10 words with my links, in communities, business pages, and in comments.

Linkedin is a community that connects business owners together, and get you to know each other. The truth here is that getting quality backlink from Linkedin is through the profile. These are just five â€œsocial networksâ€ù to get authority backlinks from, but here is a must read for all bloggers who want to build authority backlinks and rank their website/niche blog in google using this helpful and free authority links. Since am not talking about getting traffic here, I would leave the traffic for another day. Please, you can also get your blog posts more authority links by sharing them in Linkedin. Make sure that you donâ€™t spam linkedin, or your can account might get banned. In Digg, you donâ€™t need to create an account, you can just sign up using your twitter or facbook account. But thereâ€™s a page to submit blog posts, and if you have friends in digg who can vote your post and it reached the top front page, then consider yourself a god for that duration, because your earnings and traffic would triple, and if your host is not strong, then sorry, because the traffic will surely crumble your account. But in Digg, you can only submit a post url, not your homepage url. What do you think about this? Have you got any links from these websites and if yes, did you noticed any improvement in your rankings? Please I would love to hear your experience and your thoughts regarding this. Thanks.",omoscowonder

But when is the right time to wear bold footwear? You certainly donâ€™t want to turn up at work wearing your black skirt suit and a pair of cerise shoes. Yes you will look hot, this is a given, but the office is neither the time nor the place for such extravagant foot wear. The bold shoe should make an appearance when you want to be noticed, but subtly. For instance if youâ€™ve been invited to a wedding, then you canâ€™t wear a brash dress.

Donâ€™t worry; this list doesnâ€™t contain any big remodeling projects and lengthy chores that involve lots of backbreaking work. Instead, here are some simple, little things you can change up in your daily routine; choices that will make your home a better place. Yes, some might eat up a bit of time or require a small financial investment, but nothing here will snap your budget or require a manual. So improve your digs with the following seven easy ideas. Okay, stick with us. This may sound weird, but consider how often a remote is handled, thrown, pawed, licked, and chewed on by various members of your household â€” none of whom likely cleans their hands. Add in all those cracks and pockets created by the buttons, and you have one of the greatest bacteria carriers in the house. To keep your family healthy, clean the remote (or remotes, if you have several)! The same is true of those other objects around your home that are frequently handled but never really cleaned. Of course, you could always use one of those remote apps on your phoneâ€_ Do you wear shoes around the house? Stop it. Especially stop it if you have rugs or carpets. Your shoes are filled with dirt, grime, and bacteria, and you and your friends and family are tracking it everywhere. You can make your house much, much cleaner just by taking off your shoes at the door and requesting that If youâ€™re worried that your feet might smell bad, then you already have another way to make your home healthier, and we arenâ€™t even at idea number three yet. Moisture is bad news for all houses and the materials they contain. It encourages mold, rot, pest damage, and all sorts of unpleasant things. So if you see a leak or think you may have a moisture problem in your vents, attic, or crawlspace â€_ get it taken care of, pronto. The cost to fix it now will be far less than the cost to repair all the future damage. Yes, this is a worthwhile task! It will make your house more interesting, enable you to experiment with   ideas, and give you a chance to clean all those dusty places you probably never have time to get to during a normal cleaning. Plus, you may even find that toy or book that you lost months ago. Donâ€™t leave your curtains closed; open them during the day! The same UV rays that tan your skin will also kill spores, bacteria, and various germs in the air. A sunlit home is a healthier home. Stop using industrial-strength cleaners and   with baking soda, vinegar, and other handy items. If you donâ€™t like the results, you can switch back, but these homemade versions are cheaper, less harmful, and may even work better than what youâ€™re using right now. Plants absorb CO-2 and release oxygen, so theyâ€™re excellent for clearing up stuffy rooms! Just avoid over-watering them and creating potential mold problems.",Jeff

Yet still, some of you havenâ€™t been able to get this whole guest blogging thing down. Maybe your pitches have been rejected more often than accepted, and you think your pitches are written badly. Maybe you just donâ€™t know what topicsÂ to pitch to them, but at the same time you donâ€™t know how to figure out what you should. Or maybe you just think that popular bloggers wonâ€™t even give you the time of day, and that youâ€™re â€œnot bigâ€ù enough to write for their blogs. Well, it doesnâ€™t have to be this way. We can make you into a fearless guest posting machine. The key? Using proven methods and tools thatâ€™ve already given other people success. Writing a pitch to a blogger â€“ let alone a popular one â€“ is a scary experience. Youâ€™ve got thoughts like â€œwhy should he even read my pitch? Iâ€™m a nobody!â€ù running through your mind. Youâ€™re priming yourself for failure before sending the email out. This is actually a normal experience. Every blogger has felt that feeling, even popular ones experience this when they pitch to more popular bloggers. Youâ€™re still afraid because you either: This means that either your approach is off or you just need a way to move forward despite your fear inducing inexperience. So what do you do? Simple. First, an easy to follow structure is a good start. Youâ€™ll get that below. Second, you need established methods of success to follow. Weâ€™re going to copy the methods of people with a ton of guest blogging success and use their approaches/templates. And if itâ€™s worked for them then itâ€™ll work for you. All thatâ€™s left is for you to try it out. People say you should understand the blog you pitch to, but what does that even mean? Letâ€™s take a page from guest blogging authority  , the â€œFreddy Kreugerâ€ù of blogging. He says you should know these two things: To see what topics are popular there, see if they have a â€œmost popularâ€ù posts section. If not, use the â€œ â€ù tool. How does â€œstrip the blogâ€ù work? Itâ€™s easy, plugin the name of the blog youâ€™re researching, select a date range (2 months is good), and click â€œstrip it.â€ù Youâ€™ll get a list of the most popular posts within the last two months (the most popular ones will be at the top of the list). Thatâ€™ll show you instantly what topics are hot there. You can take it a step further and see what the commenters talk about the most. If you make a post about that then you are guaranteed high engagement for that post. Next, see what headlines are popular there. Look over the most popular posts and see what â€œstructuresâ€ù and words you see the most often. Hereâ€™s the list I made to prepare this post for ComLuv: I just ran through the blogging section and grabbed the ones with the most comments (the numbers are the amount of comments). Hereâ€™s what I noticed: And this post was the result. Just combine your research with your own knowledge base to create the perfect topic to write about (just like I did with this post). Now we can make contact with other bloggers. The pitch is very important, and while you definitely want to make it personal, you also want to follow a successful structure. But first things first, check the blog and see if they have any guest post guidelines. Most of it will be normal stuff, but on some (popular) blogs youâ€™ll need to keep an eye out for things like â€œtrigger words.â€ù They add these to make sure youâ€™ve actually read the requirements, so be extra careful when reading guest post requirements. With that out of the way, we can pitch our topic. Remember what I said about structures? Thatâ€™s what you need here. Follow these outlines  (itâ€™s got to sound natural)Â and confidently. Theyâ€™ve worked for other people, and theyâ€™ll work for you as well. Two templates are all you need, just pick one and use it (for ALL pitches, and with proper personalization). Hereâ€™s a few tips to remember though: Once youâ€™re pitch is accepted, you get to write it. But if you want to be a â€œguest posting machine,â€ù then you need a fast and effective method to do so. So what do I recommend? Like with your pitch, use a template. Once again, you donâ€™t need to follow it strictly. Just two again? Yup. Having too many options just slows things down, we want you guest posting successfully TODAY. Donâ€™t underestimate the power of these established templates. They create the groundwork for you, and have a great track record already. They just work, and so will you if you use them. So now weâ€™ve come full circle and you have everything you need to fearlessly pitch and write awesome guest posts. So even you beginners have no reason to not guest post, this is literally all you need to get started. Fear is one of those things that stops us from taking action, even if we know we should. So my question to you guys is this: How were you able to move past your own fears and start pitching for guest posts? What piece of knowledge made you say â€œI can write this pitch, and Iâ€™m good enough to write for this blogâ€ù? Please leave a comment below with your answer because Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ve all experienced this feeling.",Ericson
17/12/2013,http://comluv.com/6-steps-building-perfect-website/,6 Steps to Building the Perfect Website - ComLuv,"Business websites can be the meat of a company, especially when it comes to a start-up. Many customers want the availability that a website brings to the table. Not only do websites stay open 24/7, they are also great places for the general public to browse and take in all they need to know about a company. Websites are simply one of the best tools of the trade, when it comes to starting a brand spanking new business. So what do you do to build the perfect website? Below are six steps to building the perfect website. Website design can consist of many more aspects than just the company name. Put all your ideas, dreams, and thoughts onto paper first; then take a step back and decide whether or not itâ€™s feasible. Most successful sites are born from rudimentary ideas that spring forth randomly. Some of the best ideas may have initially seemed pretty silly. After getting your overall project down on paper, you can move forward on the digital front. Choose your lettering design carefully. When you start to  , you want your lettering design to match in most areas. This means to stay consistent with your ideas and make them harmonious. With the exception of your logo design, all other letters should be professional and connected in some way. This will keep the customer from getting distracted by unnecessary â€œnoise.â€ù Carefully select your color theme. The direction you are headed and what your company represents should help to determine the color scheme you choose. Donâ€™t go wild and start adding a lot of different colors. Always stick with one basic theme and move out gradually with lighter or darker hues of that same color. There may be a good reason to use two or three different colors, but you should never start adding colors randomly to represent some idea such as â€œcheerfulness.â€ù If your company uses this emotion as a marketing tactic, then the idea should come through with the company itself, and not through the overuse of colors. The structure is the next important step to designing   website. The site must retain a structured layout The pages can have a design of their own but all aspects of the site should tie together. Remember to keep the layout simple, then add only the tools and components that are needed for the business. Details, or the lack of them, can really make the difference as to whether your website is successful or not. By simply adding a gradient to the coloring of your logo, for example you can bring attention to the name of your business. There are other small details that, when tweaked, can also add value to your companies image. After the website is designed and the details are perfected, itâ€™s time to promote your business through the use of your companyâ€™s page. There are many methods of promotion, including utilizing social sites and SEO practices. If you are already familiar with these areas, then all thatâ€™s left is posting in a timely manner and using your tools to draw in traffic. Promotion and advertising will come more naturally over time and with practice. To really get a feel for what a good website looks like, take a few minutes to check out some of these examples. Each one provides you with a foundation as to what your site should do for your business. . This isnâ€™t a flashy site because it is designed to sell its products. It uses a clean look that is well organized and is easy on the eyes. Customers can find the product they are looking for and there are plenty of ways they cross-promote other products, including the use of video. Â This Chicago based restaurant makes navigation simple by providing links to all the basic questions on the left hand side of the page. The rest of the page is used to deliver content or advertise using a slide show of items off the menu.  Right on the home page you are told what the product does and the call to action is right there for you to sign up â€“ for free. The images used show you exactly what devices this SaaS product will work on as well. Again, nothing flashy but everything you need as a potential customer is right there. A new business needs many things in order to succeed, but only one aspect can work for you when youâ€™re away; and that is your webpage. Designing an effective webpage is not hard to do; but it takes time and patience to realize its full potential.",Jeff
16/12/2013,http://comluv.com/common-business-web-design-mistakes-avoid/,Common Business Web Design Mistakes to Avoid - ComLuv,"Nowadays, websites have become crucial branding and marketing tools for many businesses. A well designed site will attract many visitors and result in increased revenues. However, a poorly designed site will give a negative impression of your business and turn away potential customers. Here are some common mistakes you need to avoid when designing a business website. It is important for a business website to appear professional and attractive. However, the design should not be too flashy or complicated. A site which is over-designed is likely to push away visitors instead of attracting them. It is therefore advisable to keep your design as simple as possible. Use navigation which makes it easy for your visitors to find what they are looking for. If visitors enjoy a pleasant user-experience, they are likely to spend more time on your site and visit again in future. Many people rush into designing their business websites without giving much thought to their target audience. As a result, they end up with a product which is not effective. Before you begin designing your site, take time to carry out some research on the target market you would like to reach. Use the information collected to design an appropriate site. For instance, if your target audience is teenagers, it would be advisable to use images, fonts and colors which are youthful. In addition, you will need to ensure that your site is optimized for mobile devices. The kind of web designer selected is very crucial for the success of a business website. If you opt to work with a cheap designer, you are likely to end up with a mediocre site. On the other hand, a large web agency, though expensive, might also not be able to meet your specific needs. Therefore, When people visit your site, they should know what you want them to do next. This could be contacting you, signing up for your newsletter or purchasing your product. It is therefore very vital to include prominent calls to action in all the pages of your site. Make sure the â€˜Buy Nowâ€™ or â€˜Sign Upâ€™ buttons are large enough and appear above the fold. To encourage visitors to take the action desired, you could offer incentives such as discounts or free products. Having a well-designed site is not enough. You must ensure that the content on your site is updated on a regular basis. If people donâ€™t find any fresh information about your business, products or services, they might eventually stop visiting your site. You could consider starting a blog within your site where you can frequently post content that is relevant to your prospects and customers. This could be information about new products, special offers of general industry news. Fresh content will not only drive traffic to your site, but will also enhance your search engine rankings. Nowadays, many people access the internet using mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is therefore very important to have a design which is mobile-friendly. You can either optimize your site for mobile devices or create a totally separate mobile version of your site. Before launching the site, take time to test it on different devices to ensure that users can access it easily. Visitors usually get very frustrated when they click on links which are not working. If there are broken links on your site, you might end up missing on a repeat purchase or a new buyer. Take time regularly to check and fix any broken or incorrect links on your site. Make sure the links direct visitors to the correct pages.",Charles Mburugu
15/12/2013,http://comluv.com/decoding-black-tie-code-speedy-guide-black-tie-dresses/,Decoding black tie code - A speedy guide to black tie dresses - ComLuv,"I went to a company function last week, with a  , and it shocked me how many women just do not know how to dress for their bodies. The black tie code can be interpreted in so many ways and yet I saw so many women playing it safe and sticking to the classic strapless dress with an A-line skirt. Yawn! Black tie dresses just as white party dresses are like any other fashion items. You dress to enhance what you do have and do like, and downplay what you donâ€™t have or donâ€™t like. Sure, donâ€™t get me wrong girls, dressing for these events can be daunting, but in the immortal words of Gore Vidal â€œ â€ù, here are a few   ideas to help you know what you want â€œsayâ€ù in the Autumn/Winter season of 2013-14. Letâ€™s start with neck lines. Strapless is a common neckline on a black tie evening dress. If you have good dÃ©colletage then embrace the strapless and work that to your advantage. The strapless dress leaves you with a lot of exposed skin across the neck and shoulders, so make sure you wear a   to avoid looking bare. Halter necks or dropped necklines can sometimes be trashy, but if you are blessed with good bosom then work it out. I think the effect of cleavage is all about how you wear it. You can be cheap and trashy with yourÂ Betty Boops out, or you can be that curvaceous goddess If you have a curvaceous figure then embrace your femininity. Mermaid evening dresses are tight all the way down your body, clinging to your bust, waist and thighs. This style of dress creates a feminine and sexy silhouette which suits hour glass shaped bodies. I think this look is very 50â€™s glamor and I simply adore it. Nina Dobrev (AKA the lovely Elena Gilbert from The Vampire Diaries) absolutely worked her curves in a stunning red mermaid dress at the Grammyâ€™s last year; she quite literally sizzled on the red carpet. Yes, low and behold the awesome power of a red maxi dress! If you have a slimmer frame and are lacking in the curve department then a strapless dress that cinches just under the bust is a flattering cut. The floaty bubble skirt then flows from the narrowest point of your waist, giving the illusion of curves. A ribbon under the bust will accentuate your waist as a belt would. A simple satin sheath dress also suits a more willowy frame, accentuating height and achieving a graceful and beautiful image. Mila Kunis was dressed beautifully for her slim figure at the Oscarâ€™s in 2011, in a lilac A-Line dress with lots of layers to the skirt, creating the illusion of curves. If you have a stockier frame then avoid strapless dresses as they expose the width of your shoulders. If you can make your shoulders appear narrower, your whole frame appears slimmer. Little cap sleeves will break up your shoulders to lessen their appearance. Also avoid any bold prints or patterns if you want to appear slimmer. Darker colors will also make you look narrower. Drape dresses most certainly will confuse the eye and direct attention away from a broad mid-section. If you donâ€™t like your arms then you could opt for either a longer sleeved dress, or a little lace cover up. A cover up will cover just your arms without interfering with the lines of the dress at all.

Whilst we all get to grips with the likes of Google+ (by the way liking the idea behind the Google+ and YouTube integration) The world of social media is becoming more and more about building aÂ  Â of how we want others to see us (Iâ€™ve mentioned that it is begininng to become a bit tiresome of reading on Twitter how busy people are, to come across as looking more important), rather than create an authentic voice.

11/12/2013,http://comluv.com/happy-retirement-3-suggestions-bloggers/,A Happy Retirement - 3 Suggestions for Bloggers,"I was 38 on Sunday 1st December last and this got me thinking about my retirement and how I should be planning it! Â It really hit me thinking that I am now just 2 years away from 40 and for the past 20 or so years I have nothing really saved for my upcoming future! Â I have lost count of the amount of jobs I have had over the years. Seems to me the days of doing well at school then getting a well paid job thatâ€™s going to last for the 50 years after that are now a thing of the past. Â Take my parents for instance they worked hard all of their lives working 3 jobs each, scrimping and saving, bringing me and my brother up, Â buying their family home in the hope they both could retire at 65 and have a few good years to do what they had always wanted to do! Tragically my mother passed away on 25th December 2010, Â 6 months after retiring from her Job and now my dad seems to just spend everyday doing the same thing going from pup to pub, Â Hardly a happy and fulfilling retirement hey? Â It paints a sad picture I know but please bear with me as this is not a sob story dear reader! Â Of course a happy and financially secure future is something we as bloggers should be aiming towards, Â but do we really think about it and should we worry about it? Being financially secure for your retirement is a must and my strategy is two fold. In the short to medium term I am going to continue to build my web design and development career here at home and my long term strategy is to build on my current hobbie as a blogger to something that I can rely on in later life! Â But this is just one part of the jigsaw dear reader as there is more to think about like having a fulfilling, Â happy and enjoyable retirement. Ok so like most things you need to plan it and donâ€™t just fall into retirement without thinking of what you are going to do. Â Think of your retirement as a new job or career! Â Go and set new goals and achievements you want to happen during your retirement then actively plan for them while taking into account where you are now and where you want to be. Â Generally people tend to let themselves go a little bit and slow down after retiring which is no bad thing as thatâ€™s what itâ€™s all about, Â But bear in mind to keep healthy as itâ€™s a proven fact that we naturally feel happier in ourselves when we are physically fit. So lets keep up our healthy routines up when we are in retirement! While working on our careerâ€™s we find that we donâ€™t spend time with our friends or our family as much as we would like which is a great shame! Â We are a social animal and we need the company of others to keep our sanity. Â We do not want our retirement to be an isolated and lonely place as this can easily happen! Â I also donâ€™t mean to stay socially active online. Surrounding yourself with human beings maintains your emotional well being and keeps you happy! Â Make time now for your friends and family to keep that flame burning brightly and your social future will be in a much better condition. Â When in retirement we will have a lot more time on our hands so plan to make new friends and go out and meet new people with similar interests and hobbies is something else we should be doing! Â If done right mine and your retirement can be a very social and happy time for us. I currently work from home as a Web Designer & Developer as well as a blogger and this can be bad for both my physical and mental well-being as well as affecting my creativeness especially if I am spending 15 + hours in front of a computer screen or two. Â Your home can become your prison, it can make you feel stifled and isolated and it can stop you from relaxing which means it can turn you grumpy and unhappy! Â So what do I do then? Â Well I break up my day by going for an hours run every morning to keep myself fit, In the afternoon I go Birding down my local nature reserve for an hour or so then in the evening I go for a walk to my local pub for a pint or two with my mates! Your home can be a social place at times but you really do not want to be spend 24/7 there now do you! Â So get up out of that chair and get some fresh air in your lungs and this can refresh and revitalise yourself, your senses and your mental well-being! Our retirement should be some of the happiest years of our lives if planned correctly and thoroughly. Â Donâ€™t just assume you will be happy and fulfilled if you just plan to be financially secure, after all we have worked hard all of our lives so our retirement should be a time to enjoy the fruits of our labours! Â Remember to take an active role in not only securing Â your financial future but also what you want to do when you retire! Have you anything to add to this? Â Do you have other tips, ideas, suggestions or criticisms about my post? Â Are you nearing retirement and have you planned it out or not? Do please let me know dear reader as I would love to know! Â Post your comments below and I will respond to each them as soon as I possibly can. Until next timeâ€_ Phillip Dews",Phillip Dews

If you conduct your research pretty well, you can build a niche site that will earn you passive income for a very long time to come. Before we get started, let me explain a little bit about Niche Site- A niche site is a website that talks about a particular subject, example- if you build a site that is focus on only shoes, it is a niche. You cannot have a site on shoe and then talking about computers, health, games etc. you have diverse from the main topic. Hence it is no longer a niche site but a â€˜siteâ€™. I hope you get my point? You can also follow me on my Blog where i am in a competition with other bloggers on  : You first need to do your keyword research and know the topic of your new site, since this is your first niche site, you donâ€™t want to go for a keyword that would be impossible (or too difficult) to rank. One of such keywords are, weight loss, acne, payday loan etc. Use google keyword planner tool to find keywords that have about 3,000+ local search and then using google.com, you would be able to know if the keyword is difficult to rank for. Before you can use google.com to analysis the top 10 (or top 20) sites in your niche, you need to install seo quake. To know if your keyword is rank-able, check the DA of the top 10 sites, if they are above 35, then you will have a hard time beating them. Also you need to check the PRs of the sites, if all of them have PR of 2 and above, you need to skip it and look for another one. If there are authority sites ranking for the keyword, it will not be worth going for it. (you know Authority : If you have found your rank-able keyword, then it is time to purchase your domain name. You can buy cheap domain on godaddy anytime by using coupon codes.   I always go for EMD or P-EMD. Â Next is to find a cheap host and your site is set.  : After installing wordpress on your new niche site, the next is to install a nice magazine theme and all the necessary plugins. After you have done that, we are now going to write the article for the site. We are going to find the top 5 products in our niche and then review them, the words should be about 400-700 words. Then we are going to write 5 in depth article about the keywords (How to ____) About 10 to 20 articles is okay for a niche siteâ€_ but when it is making money, you can add more articles. If you donâ€™t have traffic to your website, there is no way you will get a sale. That is why a lot of companies out there make money selling SEO Service to site owners. If your keyword is easy to rank, with only on-page SEO, you can get to the first 20. But if you want to stay in the first page, then you need to build some quality backlinks to your site. You can manually build quality backlinks by writing guest posts on niche related sites, commenting on high pagerank sites as well as niche related sites. This should have come before SEO, but I want you to know that   if you donâ€™t rank your site. There are lots of ways to make money from your niche site. One of the popular ways is through Amazon.com, Adsense, Clickbank and Cj.com Since your site is focus on a particular subject/niche. You can look for companies that produce the products and see if they have Affiliate/Partnership program. You can join them because you will get better % from each sales you make. If you do your homework every well, you can make $500 monthly from your niche site.

01/12/2013,http://comluv.com/online-safety-secure-wireless-router/,Online Safety: Do you have a secure wireless router? - ComLuv,"Do you know how secure your home wireless router is? Leaving your wireless network open and unsecure can make it accessible to anyone close to your routerâ€™s signal. The problem is that aside from you, your family and friends; there might also be others connected to your wireless network without you knowing it. Much like using unsecure public wireless connections in airports, coffee shops or hotels, an unsecure wireless network at home can leave you vulnerable to  . Also, hackers can easily gain access to the sensitive information on your computer as well as on other devices connected to your network. Whatever information you send over the Internet via your Wi-Fi can be intercepted without proper security settings. Another thing, people can use your unsecure wireless routers to download illegal documents on the Internet or perform illegal online activities and since theyâ€™re using your IP Address, all their activities are listed as yours. Since you donâ€™t know about whoâ€™s connected to your network, the information will be traced back to you. As part of maintaining Internet safety and keeping sensitive information private, itâ€™s important to check your wireless networkâ€™s settings and make it secure. One important internet safety tip is to keep your home Wi-Fi safe through the step by step process. Each of the wayslisted here increases your level of safety and this helps ensure that youâ€™re getting the highest level of security. Here are some ways to secure your wireless router: All routers come with default login and password combination. Itâ€™s important to change these default settings, especially setting-up a new password. By doing this, youâ€™re limiting the number of users only to the ones who know the passwords, and this is the very first step to securing your wireless network. Itâ€™s really necessary to use encryption on your wireless router. Aside from the fact that it keeps intruders at bay, it also blocks snoops from â€œtaking a peekâ€ù at your network traffic. Â Keep in mind that encryption scrambles all the information you send to a website, so that it canâ€™t easily be cracked, decoded or intercepted by a third party intruder. There are two types of encryption for wireless routers: WEP and WPA2. WEP is the most common encryption type used on almost all wireless routers. WEP can help keep off neighbors and passersby, but since there are lots of free tools available online that can easily crack WEP code, hackers can still hijack your network to gain access to your sensitive information. WPA2, on the other hand, is used on new wireless routers and is more secure than the WEP. This means that older wireless router versions may not use WPA2 unless you upgrade your router or buy a new one. The Media Access Control address, commonly known as MAC address, is a unique ID assigned to laptops and other devices. In short, anything that can be connected to your network or on the Internet has a MAC address. After you change the password, enabled encryption and restart your wireless router, you can connect your laptop again to your network to see its MAC address. You can then filter the MAC addresses of whatever devices you have to your router to increase your level of security and limit the number of devices that can connect to your router only the MAC addresses that youâ€™ve allowed. One drawback of this, though, is that if you have frequent guests coming around and using your wireless network, you might as well add their MAC addresses or temporarily disable your MAC filtering.",Joy

I beg to disagree, itâ€™s not. From the little knowledge I have garnered over the years about writing and from what I have learned from other great writers such as William Shakespeare, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemmingway and so on, I have come to realize that the biggest obstacles for new writers is that they donâ€™t think themselves to be a writer. Youâ€™ve got to develop a belief and an enormous conviction in the inside of you, one that will constantly remind you that you are a writer. If you by chance fall into the same categories as those asking this question, you need not worry again as I would in this article teach you some tips of becoming a writer. Iâ€™m guessing you have something to say thatâ€™s why you want to become a writer, isnâ€™t it? The problem is always how to say it. I still remember when I was starting up as a writer some 3years ago; I had a turf time choosing my form of writing, this makes it really hard to pen anything down. My advice to would-be writers is always, â€œWhatsoever you write, just make sure your heart is in it.â€ù It doesnâ€™t have to be neat or perfect but it should be expressive. Thatâ€™s it. Your writing has to elicit expression. What would people say or perhaps how would they react when they read your work? Would the cry or laugh? Would they get angry? If you have been able to achieve this then it means your writing is worth something. Keep it up! Try this: You may be having some tough time   Itâ€™s not a bad thing that you donâ€™t know what you want to write about. But when you devote time to experimenting, you would soon find out that writing would become very easy. To help my experimentation; I have decided on keeping a journal to jot down some of the ideas I get along the way and it has indeed proven to be a goldmine in my aspirations of becoming a better writer. Donâ€™t miss:  Kudos! Youâ€™ve grown to have strong belief in the writer in you.Â  Thatâ€™s fine. But you must also learn to set up reminders that will shove you back to that sense of  . You would agree with me that itâ€™s always very easy to be distracted doing or thinking about other things when you ought to be in your writing groove. Your reminder could be anything so far it gets you back into the act of scribbling/typing your ideas out. My phone does that perfectly well for me. These indeed are inventive ways to getting started as a writer and Iâ€™m sure if you harnessed it well it would yield you endless success. Remember this truth, what you write and where you go from here is entirely up to you. Are you just starting as a writer or perhaps you already an expert? What is your take about this subject? If youâ€™re new to writing, I hope the ideas highlighted will help you take those first steps, and if you are an expert. Would you please share your opinions on how best to getting started as a writer? Thanks!",Sam Adeyinka

Sonja Jefferson is co-author ofÂ  , a truly valuable book from 2013 that helps others understand the importance of content in todayâ€™s world and how we can turn prospects into buyers and buyers into advocates of our businesses. Sonja is also MD and founder ofÂ  Â â€“ a Bristol-based marketing communications firm that helps businesses win work from the web. Our chat looked at the growingÂ  .  In the days before the web, the word â€˜contentâ€™ didnâ€™t really exist in the same way. It has become an important word in our online world. Content is now a crucial aspect of the buying process. Marketing with content is aboutÂ  , and remember you when the time comes to buy. If youÂ  . Itâ€™s about creating a strong story as a starting point = one that is meaningful to those you want to do business with. . Hereâ€™s a simple example. I was looking for a personal trainer recently and picked up two business cards from my gym. I went straight to their websites. The firstÂ  trainer was no doubt an excellent runner. The websiteâ€™s emphasis is on Â her running achievements. The second trainerâ€™s website was based around a blog â€“ heÂ  Â all the questions that I had e.g. how do you fit exercise around a busy working day. IÂ  Â he could help me. I chose the trainer with the website thatÂ  Â â€“ the trainer with a website full of what we call â€˜valuable contentâ€™. Buyers are increasingly becomingÂ  . As businesses we need to be aware of this. When it comes to marketing, the key is toÂ  , understand their challenges and answer them in the information we share. Itâ€™s about buildingÂ  Â in the first instance. You have to earn peopleâ€™s trust before you sell. This means aÂ  Â for many people. Â We need to dispel the myth that marketing is about propaganda. Â Here at Valuable Content we have a mantra that runs through all our customer communications:Â  . We find that useful to keep us on track. When it comes to your content, Â andÂ  Â win the day. Â Give some of your knowledge away for free. This helps to ignite interest and start the conversations that can lead to sales. It starts with a laser focus on your customers and their needs. Content that gets it right isÂ  ,Â  . Â Thatâ€™s the simple truth at the heart of good marketing. Anchoring your content efforts with a meaningful message â€“ a consistent story that runs through all you create really helps to draw the customerâ€™s interest and get remembered. The Iâ€™d aim for the 80:20 rule of content â€“ thatâ€™s the balance between sales pages and â€˜valuable contentâ€™ on your website (seeÂ  ). And Iâ€™d have a mix of what we call â€˜stock and flow contentâ€™ (seeÂ  ) on the site (more heavyweight guides or whitepapers or video tips that a visitor to your site can take away + more frequent, ephemeral blog articles). Itâ€™s about creating content that helps the customer atÂ  Â â€“ from â€˜just researchingâ€™ to â€˜just about to buyâ€™. Doing someÂ  Â upfront and creating content around the real terms your type of customers are searching for is very important if you want to get found via search.

Design is hugely important here if you want people to engage with your message. But â€˜getting content marketing rightâ€™ doesnâ€™t end with producing great content. You have to do the work â€“ take it out there andÂ  .Â  SEO, starting a permission-based email list, sharing your useful content via social media â€“ these all really help to build awareness and engage.

27/11/2013,http://comluv.com/4-things-candy-buffets-can-teach-marketing/,4 Things Candy Buffets Can Teach You about Marketing - ComLuv,"Iâ€™d like to kick off this small lecture on small business by talking about candy. Specifically â€“ candy buffets. If you arenâ€™t familiar, candy buffets are those decorative spreads of sugar sticks and bon-bons, often presented in apothecary jars, which have taken wedding receptions and other celebratory gatherings by storm recently. At first, these tooth-racking tables of sweets might seem totally unrelated to running a business â€“save for that you might feature one at your holiday party. However, if you take some time to consider the sudden rise of the candy buffet, youâ€™ll notice that many of the principles that make these dessert tables so appealing can also be applied to a successful small business marketing strategy. Specifically, here are a few lessons every marketing guru can learn from a simple candy buffet. 1)Â Â Â Â   . On their own,   might not seem all that appealing. However, when you bundle them up in an apothecary jar, they look  . Nothing has changed â€“ theyâ€™re still just candy sticks â€“ but a little dressing up has made them much more appealing. This is exactly what you should be doing with your company. As a startup, every day is an elevator pitch. You need to present yourself to customers in a way that highlights your best qualities without crossing the line to dishonesty. You might be a bunch of candy sticks at the moment, but damned if you wonâ€™t be the most appealing candy sticks theyâ€™ve seen all day. 2)Â Â Â Â   . A professionally-made candy buffet often features several â€œcenterpieceâ€ù name-brand candies that are complimented by other, more generic brands. Though it might seem like Research has shown that this principle applies to business as well. The best way to make your company stand out from the competition is to acknowledge and embrace them.Â  When you pitch to potential clients, donâ€™t focus on yourself but rather  . Describe the competitors in your field and explain to potential clients what it is that sets you apart. Maybe you offer a more specialized service or your logistics allow for shorter production time. Explaining yourself thusly will make you more worthy in the eyes of your customers and help you create a more intelligent growth plan moving forward. 3)Â Â Â Â   . Â Candy buffets arenâ€™t popular because their respective party hosts advertise them to death. Theyâ€™re popular because they appeal to a desire or need â€“ in this case, partygoersâ€™ sweet teeth â€“ and happen to be available at that moment to appease that desire or need. This is a   that far too often is ignored by small business owners. Your business should fulfill an unmet need in your industry and your marketing strategy should focus on making your target demographic aware of that need. If youâ€™re relying on hyper-aggressive salesmanship to attract buyers then thereâ€™s already a fundamental flaw in your business plan. 4)Â Â Â Â   . Â Thereâ€™s an old saying among entrepreneurs that you should work â€œonâ€ù your business, not â€œinâ€ù your business. What this means, in so many words, is that itâ€™s your job as an entrepreneur to push your business forward. Spending too much time â€œinsideâ€ù your business, making products or managing employees, puts you at risk of stagnation and ultimately failure. For example, letâ€™s say you own a candy company. Your employees should be the ones making the candy while you focus on making the candy  because the buffets are what attract attention to your company. Â Itâ€™s important to focus on the details when youâ€™re just starting out, but your eyes should always be glued on the bigger picture. At the end of the day, candy buffets and smart marketing have more in common than you might think. So the next time you see a crowd flocking around one of these dessert tables at a party or reception, take a minute to consider why the candy buffet is so popular. Then, apply those principles to your marketing strategy. It might sound crazy â€“ but a little out-of-the-box thinking could lead to some very sweet success.",Joe Pawlikowski
26/11/2013,http://comluv.com/greedy-blogger-take-give/,Are You A Greedy Blogger And Take More Than You Give?,"A lot of bloggers understand that blogging is about giving AND receiving. The blog you create should be created to help other people solve a problem in their lives, and the content you create should be valuable. But many bloggers would rather receive than give; and that is where bloggers go all wrong. There are many different ways that I see this every day. If you donâ€™t agree, please tell me in the comments, but Iâ€™m pretty sure that if you are a respectful blogger who tries to give as much as you take, you will agree with the points I make. One of the things that makes me lose interest in a blogger is when they recommend things that have nothing to do with their business. As a reader, I want to know that they are trying to make my life better (even with the sale of products), not that they are only trying to make money on the latest and greatest product. In addition, when I receive more articles, information, and value than I do sales pitches, I respond better to their sales pitches and end up buying what they are selling. It is just human nature to like people who are trying to help you and to be distrustful of people who take more than they give. A lot of people leave comment spam where they try to put a link into the comment. Blogging ethics have taught us that this is really inappropriate. But there is another form of comment spam I recently wrote about a guest post on this site about how many  . One thing I talked about was bloggers giving positive feedback, but I didnâ€™t clarify that the feedback should be on point and relevant to the blog post in order to be attractive to other people. Itâ€™s interesting how many people leave a comment without any grasp about what the post was. Many people want to leave a comment and get a backlink, and so they are quick to scan the headlines and leave a comment that they think is appropriate to leave. And some take it even further and only read the first paragraph and comment on that point generically to sound like they read the whole post. This happens all the time. Almost every blog post I have seen has at least one comment that has nothing to do with the post. Iâ€™m willing to bet it will happen here. In fact, if you actually read this whole post, then you should see this paragraph. If you choose to leave a comment on this blog post, please sign your name after you leave the comment so that we can tell if you actually read it or not. The point is that most people will not read the middle of the post and, instead, try to deduce what is being said from the headlines and beginning. They miss out on valuable information in the middle because they donâ€™t really care. I donâ€™t know about you, but I donâ€™t leave a comment on a blog post that I donâ€™t care about. In fact, I donâ€™t read it in the first place. There are many other that will help you get further with your readers and with other bloggers. I think that the above things are very important to become a successful blogger. I have seen these traits in every successful blogger that I have encountered. In the end, offering value to your readers is important, but offering value to your fellow bloggers is important too. People notice when you read their blog posts and when you are just trying to get a backlink, and Iâ€™m assuming while many people appreciate any kind of discussion on their post, they would rather it be relevant and on topic.",Bellaisa
25/11/2013,http://comluv.com/tips-new-flyfisherman/,Basic Starting Point To Buying Your First Fly Fishing Rod and Reel.,"Fly fishing can be a very intimidating hobby to pick up. There are so many small tricks to know that it can be hard for the beginner to get their foot in the door. For instance there are up to 5 different technical knots to know in between your fishing reel and your actual fly (hook). Now those are easy to find online and figure out, but the whole process can be frightful to the newbie. So here are some hints to get you started easily, including the basic items you will need. Now a fly reel differs from a standard fishing reel in many ways. The reel on a fly fishing setup for trout should be  the least of your worries. The basic point of the reel is to hold line. You wonâ€™t need any fancy drag systems and crazy expensive reels to fish for trout. These reels can become very expensive (up to $1000) and that money can be better spent on purchasing a high quality rod and fly fishing line. You can get a starter fly reel for around $30, donâ€™t expect it to be very fancy, but it will do the job. Due to the standard technique of â€œstrippingâ€ù fish in as apposed to reeling as you would in most fishing situations, you will not need a high quality reel. Once you get serious and start going after really large fish, then you should consider upgrading to a high quality drag system. (drag is resistance applied to the reel as the fish pulls. When the fish pulls with a certain amount of pressure, the reel will release line.) You can apply pressure with your hand to the reel to act as drag (called palming), instead of using a drag already built into much higher priced reels. So My advice to you is if you have a limited budget, buy a decent reel and save most of your money for these next listed items. These are among the most important items in your trout fishing setup. You will find the price range of rods to be huge, and can easily cost into the $1000 range. However You wonâ€™t need to spend that much for a nice one. You can easily get away with spending less than $200 on a rod and you might also get the industry standard lifetime warranty. It might seem expensive at a couple hundred bucks, but you Now this is your most important piece of equipment you can buy. If I were using a 5 weight rod, the I would need to buy a 5 weight line. This seems obvious right, well probably not, if you havenâ€™t fly fished. By using the appropriate weight line, you will ensure that you can cast long distances fairly effortlessly. Just as it is important to use the proper sized line, you will also need to keep in mind that quality fly line is your very best friend. Often times people will spend a lot of money on a rod and reel and think that cheap line will work. This is not at all the case. You absolutely get what you pay for in this department. Cheap line will make casting difficult and will make the process of learning to fish with a fly rod very difficult. You should budget 40-50$ for a good fly fishing line. It will last you a few years and make your casting a breeze.. This is where the manufacturer will put everything you need in a nice little package to get you on the water fast with minimal shopping. You will need to be aware that these kits are not created equal. They frequently include cheap fly line, and inferior rods and reels. They are targeting people who donâ€™t know any better, and are looking for an easy way into the sport. These combos are not always a bad option though for the beginner flyfisherman. There are a few brands such as Redington and Scientific anglers who offer high quality kits that I would recommend at very reasonable prices. You can expect to find nice setups for less than $200. They include high quality gear and usually have videos and instruction manuals to get you rolling. You donâ€™t have to be intimidated with the thought of learning to fly fish. There are a lot of small parts, but once you have the basics you will be able to figure the rest out easily. It is also not nearly as expensive as you might have thought. I could easily write another 5000 words to try to explain this fairly complex style of fishing. But I donâ€™t think I have time to write a book today. I have covered all of the small details of learning how to fly fish on my  . It is a vast subject that can never be fully covered and is a constant learning experience.",dub
24/11/2013,http://comluv.com/discover-secrets-romantic-dates-ever/,Discover the secrets to having the most romantic dates ever - ComLuv,"No matter how creative you can be, coming up with the best romantic date ideas is usually a stressful and time consuming task. Worst of all when youâ€™ve been in a relationship for quite a long time and are probably running out of ideas. When it comes to romantic dates, planning is King, and designing a good plan should be the first thing to do if you want to have an enjoyable and romantic date. Your plan should include; choosing the venue, what to wear, and how to behave. Itâ€™s usually difficult to come up with these romantic date ideas, so Iâ€™m going to help you design a killer romantic date plan thatâ€™s going to make you have the date youâ€™ve always dream of. Sometimes with women itâ€™s not WHERE you take them but how romantic and enjoyable the date turns out to be. Despite this, making the right choice on where to go is something very important to do. When making a choice, avoid places you frequent very regularly as you are likely to run into lots of people you know, who will have to say hi now and then. Also, donâ€™t go somewhere too private cause your date might feel uncomfortable. If you have little information on the kind of places they will love to go to, thereâ€™s no problem in asking the other person for their opinion as to where you should go, after all the goal is to make them as comfortable as possible. Remember that you want your date to be special, so instead of going to a fancy restaurant which they may not like, get their opinion and make your date special. If you prefer choosing the venue, then you have to do your homework properly. This involves finding out what the other person likes and dislikes, and use it as a guide to choice a venue they will enjoy. Iâ€™ve come up wit a few romantic venues which you may consider when making a choice on the venue. There are other romantic places you may consider going to depending on how you want your date to be. When it comes to dressing, dress to impress. Before picking an outfit, you need to bear in mind what kind of date youâ€™re going on, as well as external factors such as the weather, location and time of day. You have to look good in order to make a go. Avoid putting on so much make up, and try as much as possible to be simple, no matter how expensive the things you are putting on are. One very important way to complete your outfit is to always put on a genuine and approving smile. This creates a sign of friendship and makes your date feel more comfortable. Your behavior during a date, especially the first date, has a great part to play in the future of your relationship. The first thing to do is to arrive on time and give your date a warm welcome. In the course of the date, you can talk about the things you like and learn what your date enjoys doing. Donâ€™t turn your conversation into an interview by asking so many question. Remember that your date dressed to impressed you so it wouldnâ€™t be fair to separate without you complimenting their appearance. This is something you should not forget doing. Make your date feel comfortable with your actions and words, and try to be as soft as much as you can. I will like to know which romantic dates youâ€™ve gone to and also what made your date so special. Please use the comment box to have your say.",Ngah Benoit

It was exciting we were seeing each other for the first time after high school, about 10 years ago. Boy! he has grown so big and a father of 2. As a matter of fact, this supper market is his. Heâ€™s just establishing it. John had no idea what a blog is. That was kinda strange to me so I had to educate him after about hours of talks aboutÂ  our families, business, old school days, etc. Quickly as we discussed, a question came up from John. That was shortly I told him Iâ€™m a blogger. He has read about blogging a few times on the Internet but, the term â€˜blogâ€™ was still cloudy to him. So he asked me â€œWhat is this thing they call blog?â€ù lol I fell like I was being given much work here. I wanted to make things so simple for my friend to understand. So I told himÂ  a blog is simply a personal website on which you post your opinions on a certain topic on regular basis. His next question was â€œCan you create my own blog?â€ùÂ  While it is very simple to start a blog, this second question is one of the reasons I started a series of posts on   on my blog. That definition I gave John is simple. I wanted John to understand he can start a blog right that moment and begin sharing stuffs. As we discussed on, I gave my friend 6 reasons to start his own blog There are certainly more than enough reasons to start your own blog today. However, here are 6 quick reasons to begin with: Gone are those days when you have to be a hi-tech geek to be able to set up a blog. Technological growth has made it so simple for everyone to set up his or her own blog. However, you must go through a simple guide. One of my blogging friends, Garen Arnold has a really simple free guide on  You can have your own blog fully running without breaking your bank. All you need is a domain name (Use coupon   to get your domain for   from Godaddy thanks to Andy for making this code available.see here for more  ), web hosting of less than   a year and premium templates of about  . You may also want to get some premium plugins and all this put together might not cost you  . A blog is a powerful business tool. If you have a business, a website without a blog, you are cutting off a great portion of your marketing value. If you want to maintain an active relationship with your clients, keep them informed while gaining new clients, start a blog for your business. Post your business related content regularly. This will largely help drive traffic to your business website which may not be updated on regular business. More traffic, more clients and more profit. Since I started blogging, I have grown so much in knowledge and writing skills. I do a lot of research every week about the topics I write on. The fun is that it is an interesting exercise that keeps me awake and so informed. Bloggers are very informed people. If you want to grow your knowledge on a certain topic, create a blog on it and strive to update it regularly. This is an awesome point and I love it. Blogging is one activity that brings you closer to so many people both in your local communities and online. Itâ€™s a friendship tool that has no racial or tribal discrimination. As a matter of fact, with your blog, you can have friends all over the world. The last time I traveled to Nigeria, I was hosted by a blogging friend. It was an awesome experience spending time with him and meeting his wife and 2 kids. I knew this guy online. We chatted together, posted on each others blog and finally met physically. Isnâ€™t that beautiful what blogging can do? You will have people wishing to meet you everywhere _Ÿ˜‰ Your blog is a wonderful way to make money online.

17/11/2013,http://comluv.com/best-resources-create-ecommerce-website-wordpress/,Best resources to create an ecommerce website with WordPress - ComLuv,"Figured out that you can make an awe inspiring ecommerce website with just WordPress, but not sure how? It is as easy to create an ecommerce website with WordPress, as it is to make a WordPress blog or a WordPress business portfolio. Though this looks like â€“ â€œBig deal! It is just one ease taskâ€ù It isnâ€™t. There are so many resources out there leading to lots of confusion. Iâ€™ve compiled some resources that I find are the best to create an ecommerce website with WordPress in a snap. While visiting an ecommerce store the first thing that the users notice is the ease of use. Hence, the first priority must be given to making the online store as simple and user friendly as possible. All the resources listed here take utmost care of that. So let us have a glimpse into some of the best resources that will assist you to create an ecommerce website managed on WordPress. Selecting a reliable web host is the first and most vital step in setting up an ecommerce site. You must go for a webhost that offers wide array of facilities, while focusing on speed and security. Usually it is recommended to purchase a dedicated hosting if you are aiming at tremendous traffic. But that again depends on the rate of your online storeâ€™s growth. Initially you can manage with a shared hosting though. Read how to choose a   for your ecommerce site, buy getting acquainted with various prerequisites for a host to qualify as the best WordPress ecommerce hosting. A tool to track your visitors is a must since you are about to run a large business. You need to install a tracking script like  . As far as todayâ€™s online entrepreneurship is concerned, it has become too tough to stay in business and â€˜the fittest survivesâ€™. Therefore, tracking the customer behavior and modifying your online store to fit in your trafficâ€™s requirement will always be an unavoidable practice. Such tracking tools enable you to perceive your trafficâ€™s behavior in terms of pages viewed most, number of new and returning visitor and more of this sort. Acquaintance with these aspects make it easy for you to modify your website and your products according to the liking of your target buyers. Link shorterers are so much in vogue due to the fact that sharing long URLs is annoying as per most of the social media users and internet marketers. And hence, now there are lots of services available to make URLs short. For instance, services like  ,   can be used to shorten URLs. Shortening URL will help us in reducing the lengthy URL into smaller ones so that it suits the Twitter cut off of 140 character and people can share them easily. Moreover, long links consume few lines in an email (which could be a newsletter too). A theme that suits your storeâ€™s target trafficsâ€™ liking is necessary. It Also, it is recommended not to go for any free theme because support and features in those will be very limited. Just be sure that the theme you choose is responsive to cater to people who shop from tablets and smartphones too. Payment Checkout solution is perhaps the most essential factor of an ecommerce website as that is where the real business happens. Most of the ecommerce themes do not come with a payment checkout server and you will have to install it manually. Using a Payment checkout solution is the best way to secure the data of your customers and so effective PCSs like Stripe and Mijireh can be used for this purpose. These tools will also help in maintaining your brandâ€™s name throughout the transaction. Content Delivery Networks or CDN are cache creating tools that will cache the static data of your website such as photos of products, and show them as fast as possible when users go through your website. But you cannot cache all the things of your site. Instead, you may cache images using Photon CDN or Jetpackâ€™s new Image CDN. If you use MaxCDN then you will be capable of caching almost all things of your site including images. The same is possible with W3-Total Cache too. Remember the more you cache, the quicker your website loads. Hence it is important to use a CDN on your Website in order to provide a flying site performance. Donâ€™t let your prospective buyer wait. He may change his mind in a matter of seconds after all. Table Rate Shipping enables your customers to outline the shipping rates depending on factors like location, weight of the product, delivery time, etc., so as to adjust with his or her need. To make it possible you can use tools like WooCommerce, WP eCommerce , Cart-66, etc. Dynamic pricing lets your customers be rewarded discounts for different kinds of purchases they make. For example, if a customer buys a product in bulk, you can give discounts to that user. You can also define sale discounts and member discounts as well to boost your sales. To do this you can make use of Gravity Forms that will allow you to set up pricing options for each of your products. If you are using a theme from WooThemes, youâ€™ll find this facility as a built-in feature. This WordPress plugin is used by most of the ecommerce website webmasters to show the related products with a good looking slider with products from the same category as the one the customer is viewing. Using this plugin ensures cross-selling of related products. This WordPress ecommerce plugin adds an extra tab to your WordPress dashboard called â€œEarnings Graphsâ€ù. This page depicts the graphs of monthly earnings for the present year or of a chosen year. The earnings will be calculated from the total cost of all the sales that has been made each month. I have tried to cover all major aspects on an ideal ecommerce website. However, if you know some tool that you think fits in this list, please feel to free to comment below. Weâ€™d always want to expand this list and make it comprehensive.",Foo
16/11/2013,http://comluv.com/sex-count-exercise/,Does Sex Count As Exercise,"According to research, women who exercise on a regular basis tend to have a more active sex life. They are able to reach orgasm at a quicker rate and get turned on easier than women who donâ€™t live an active lifestyle. Furthermore, the more fit a woman is, the more sexual position she will be able to try and the longer the sex will last. Itâ€™s obvious that being fit will improve your sex life, but the question is does sex improve your fitness level? It has been monitored that sex has the same internal effect on your body as cardio. Your heart rate goes up, you get a metabolism boost, calories are burned, and your muscles get a stretch. Sex has even proven to better your immune system and get rid of stress just like going out for a run would do. On average, people have sex for 30 minutes each session. During those time, the individuals could burn anywhere between 50 â€“ 100 calories. The amount of calories you burn will depends on how much effort that was put into it, how much you weigh, the position and duration. A lot of muscles are used during sex. Whether your love making session will count as exercise or not will depend on the position in which you were getting busy. If you are on top, it will workout your legs and arms. The back and forth motion is a good way to firm up your abs, and glutes, which will have a positive effect on your posture. So far, the argument seems to be going in favor of sex being a good way to get a workout but donâ€™t throw away your gym membership yet. There are some other factors to consider. Strength training is defined as giving the major muscle groups in your body a workout where they are used to their full capacity. Itâ€™s true sex targets some of muscle groups, but the impact isnâ€™t vigorous enough for it to count as  . As far as cardio goes, if things are heated up enough, it can spike up your heart rate high enough to burn a decent amount of calories. But, odds are, you will focusing more on the pleasure rather than keeping track of your heart rate in order make sure that it stays at the needed level The bottom line is, sex canâ€™t replace a decent workout routine. If you are not in the mood to go to the gym every once in a while, then lighting some candles, putting up some romantic music to have a good time with your partner is a good alternative. It will pump up your heart rate, relaxes your body and burn a little calorie. But, the effects wonâ€™t be intense enough for sex to be considered a workout routine.",Dash Eva
15/11/2013,http://comluv.com/5-qualities-make-bloggers-catch-dating-world/,5 Qualities That Make Bloggers A Catch In The Dating World,"The more I interact with bloggers, the more I realize that they are great catch for anyone looking for a date. The truth is that serious, long-term bloggers who are single have some qualities that many other people donâ€™t have. Â  If you are  , and you have been down on your luck when it comes to dating, I want you to understand that you have a lot to offer someone, and all you have to do is make them aware about as well. Â  Â  If you are reading this, then Iâ€™m willing to bet you are a serious blogger. You are not just blogging occasionally about your cat or your rants; instead, you are actively trying to make a business out of blogging and you working very hard towards a vision you are holding for yourself. Following are some traits that all serious bloggers share. Â  Â  The ability to give positive feedback while dating is also really important. Two people are never exactly the same, and when you start dating someone you are going to disagree with the other person. How you handle those disagreements is really important. If you are able to give positive feedback or constructive criticism, then you will avoid a lot of negative feelings and fights. But, if you are someone who consistently sticks your foot in your mouth, then you are in for a really rocky dating path that could quickly end up with you being single again. Â  Â  No matter what niche you are in, you constantly have to research topics, read articles, and interact with other people in your niche. By doing this you are constantly learning and, more importantly, growing. Â  A person who expands and grows throughout their life is a very interesting person to be around. They constantly have new things to talk about and they build new habits, beliefs, and dreams in their life. They are constantly evolving and that makes them exciting. Â  In short, you are a great catch in the dating world that is full of people who sit on their couch and watch TV all day long! Â  Â  As a blogger, you probably have many  . Maybe you have goals to reach a certain amount of subscribers or maybe you have goals to make a certain amount of money. Iâ€™m sure you also have visions of what you will do with your business once you reach your current goals. Basically, you are someone who is constantly focused on what you can do better, and that is a hugely attractive quality in the dating world. Â  What is NOT attractive in the dating world is a person who is lazy and never strives to become something better. In addition, someone who doesnâ€™t have goals in life or is actively moving towards them tends to be more pessimistic about life and can be a real drag to be around while dating. Â  Â  In order to stay in the game of blogging, you have to be committed. You cannot blog here and there and expect to be successful. Bloggers have to have a high level commitment to what they are doing and they have to be able to stick to a schedule with no prompting from anyone else. Â  Everyone wants to date someone who understands what commitment is really all about. Nobody wants to date someone who jumps from idea to idea (or person-to-person). Someone who shows a high level of commitment displays a sense of loyalty, and (almost) everyone single person is looking for that. Â  Â  In blogging things go wrong, mistakes happen, and failures are around every corner. Bloggers develop a heightened level of patience (that most people donâ€™t have) thanks to constant tweaking of their business plan, and developing their ability to wait to see their goals come to life. Blogging is a long-term game, and so is dating. Â  A person who displays patience while dating will be a rock-star of the   game. He or she doesnâ€™t get as upset over stupid things and is more willing to put up with occasional bad behavior without making a huge deal out of it. Yep, patience is attractive. Â  In the end, bloggers are a great catch for anyone! If you are a serious blogger and single, then make sure you remember the above five things as you search for someone to date, love, or spend the rest of your life with. In the dating game, bloggers are a great catch, and if you are able to see that, then they will too.",Bellaisa
14/11/2013,http://comluv.com/6-free-easy-ways-great-health/,6 Free and Easy Ways to Great Health - ComLuv,"Our health can be vastly improved with some simple adjustments to our lifestyle. Poor lifestyle habits that have taken root in our lives lead to or worsen ailments in our bodies. Bad posture, rarely drinking water, sleep loss, shallow breathing and lack of physical activity are typical poor habits linked to modern ways of living. Below are 6 free and easy ways to great health. Posture refers to the position of our body and all its parts. This position affects the alignment and balance of the spine, ligaments, joints, muscles, organs and much more. In poor posture (hunched shoulders, leaning forward, stomach pushed out, over-arched lower back, etc.) you are crunching up the disks of your spine and putting a lot of pressure on muscles and joints. Poor signals are also being sent through the body and reflexes are compromised as the nerves in the spinal cord are unable to carry out their processes effectively. Good posture takes the pressure off your joints and muscles, keeps your whole body aligned, engages your abs and makes you feel and look positive and confident. Now straighten up! Practice good posture while sitting, standing, driving, lifting and sleeping. Certain exercises can also help you to achieve and maintain good posture. For example, crunches, arm and torso stretches, quad strengthening and neck stretches. Breathing is already happening without any conscious effort, so why bother with deep breathing? There are immense benefits that consciously practicing deep breathing offer: You can schedule a deep breathing session after waking in the mornings and before sleeping at night. Breathe in deeply through your nose, hold for several seconds and breathe out through the mouth, pulling in your abdomen to release the breath and toxins faster. This technique also makes you relax instantly. WATER IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR HEALTH. Without water every single part of our body and its functions are compromised. Our bodies are 60% to 70% water and this water is being depleted constantly through normal body functions and activities, even in sleep. We can get water from many sources, but only pure water can give us the proper hydration we need. You donâ€™t need to necessarily stick to the 8 glasses a day rule. Get in tune with your body to help you know when your body needs water. You can also drink water at certain specific intervals. For example, drink water when you wake, get to work, mid-morning, at lunch time, mid-afternoon and before you return home. You can have another or two when you go home, but be careful with how much you drink before bed as your sleep may be interrupted by needing to use the bathroom during the night. Pay attention to your activities and your environment (very hot, cold, congested etc.) to help you determine if your body needs water. Another method is to carry with you a 1 liter-sized bottle in the day and ensure you drink it all. Youâ€™ve probably heard the saying â€˜there will be plenty of time to sleep when you are dead.â€™ This should never be taken literally but as an encouragement to actively pursue your dreams. Sleep is one of the most powerful health tools we have available and should always be taken seriously. It restores our bodies, makes us more beautiful and strengthens the processes happening in our brains. As sleep can be a sensitive process, it is essential to address the inadequacies of our sleep patterns. Serotonin (sleep regulating hormone), melatonin (sleep-cycle controlling hormone), the   and non-REM cycles and the hours we sleep are all critical sleep ingredients that give us optimal benefits. Damaging effects of losing sleep include: physical deterioration; rapid aging; impaired concentration and memory and weight problems. In addition, we are moody, irritable and unable to concentrate for very long, making it just a really bad day. You already sleep, so all you need to do is ensure youâ€™re getting quality sleep. Inversion or positioning your body upside down or at least where your heart is above your head is a means to improving blood circulation, improving spine health and rapidly boosting the health of organs and systems. Just by changing around the pull of gravity, the body reaps many benefits. Headstands, handstands, backbends, downward dog, diamond pose, plough pose, rabbit pose or simply bending and touching your toes or leaning/bending back over your bed are some ways to do inversions. You can also get an  , which is an easy and fun apparatus to use. Warning: Inversion is not recommended if you have high blood pressure and suffer from serious eye conditions. For many of us exercise is either a dreaded task or something we just canâ€™t find the time to fit in. While I wholeheartedly also recommend aerobic, strengthening and other types of exercises, stretching is an easy way to include health-boosting exercise into your lifestyle. Stretching can be done within a few minutes, feels and improves daily life, however busy your schedule or the types of activities you do. Patrick, Rosalyn. Detox. Geddes and Grosset 2008.",terrycol

In modern common usage, high energy particles with intrinsic mass are known as  . They consist mainly of 89% protons, 9% radiations and 2% of heavy nuclei of carbon, oxygen, iron and nitrogen. A very small fraction are stable particles of antimatter such as positrons or anti-protons. The precise nature of the remaining fraction is an area of active research. These collectively are called cosmic rays. They travel at a speed nearly equal to  . When these tiny particles of primary cosmic rays collide with the nuclei of the air, they produce new particles called  . Secondary cosmic ray particles also travel at high speeds. The interaction of the primary rays with the Earthâ€™s atmosphere produce a cascade of lighter particles, a so-called air shower. They further collide with other atoms and again create new particles. After several collisions on the way, only very few secondary cosmic ray particles are able to reach the surface of the Earth. Secondary cosmic rays consist mainly of positrons, neutrons, mesons and neutrinos. All these particles are called elementary or the fundamental particles.

Hiring a SEO company to take care of your siteâ€™s optimization can help leverage your web presence. While SEO has helped businesses grow for a long time now, blogging too in the meanwhile has evolved into a big player in the internet marketing arena. So, what should you do to ensure success of your business in these changing times? Letâ€™s discuss some key SEO points to help grow your business online and see how blogging can improve your web presence. Google is obviously the most popular search engine out there. Google Places is where you submit your website to be shown in the local search results of Google. Regardless of your companyâ€™s type and size, itâ€™s always good to grab your free opportunity to get a lead. All you have to do is head over to   and sign in with your Google account. Itâ€™s free to get your business listed, but it has some premium features too if you want go a step further. Sitemaps are required for your website to easily communicate with the search engines. While your site may be loaded with eye catching themes and plugins, the search engine bots have a hard time making some sense out of it. Search engine bots can read only text and basic html. Sitemap is a summary of your website content in the simplest form for the bots. While robots.txt is used to tell search engines what not to index, sitemap tells what you would like it to index. Simply put, sitemap is a simple thing that serves a big purpose and you should implement it on your site to ensure easy access to search engine bots. The The title of a webpage is usually considered as the pointer of its content. If your page has a title like â€˜Homeâ€™ or Welcomeâ€™, itâ€™s time you should seriously consider changing it to something more descriptive and catchy. Search engines look at the title of your page to check relevancy with the search query of users. People are less likely to notice these regular page titles and may even ignore it. It also makes sense to have a catchy title as it can also be useful to make people interested in your business. So, optimize your page titles to stand out. Blogging can be a good strategy for the betterment of your business and to create new leads. It increases your online visibility and the more visible you are, the more customers you get. Blogging is also the best way to interact with your customers and receive feedback. Since social media is emerging as the new factor in SEO, blogging is becoming more of a necessity rather than a choice. If your business does not have a blog, you might be at a big loss since you are missing out on customers, engagement and new leads. Companies that blog regularly get more indexed pages in search engines, and the most obvious benefits of this include more backlinks and higher visibility for your business. The more your company is spread across the web, search engines find it more relevant. People simply donâ€™t visit a business website by typing its address in the browser; so, the better alternative is to be all around them. The more pages your website has, the more likely you are to be found by people interested in your business. With blogging, every time you post a new blog post, you add a new page about your business on the web. In short, business blogging helps you get yourself found by the people you want, and that too at almost zero expenses.",Naseer

Another thing that made metrosexuality acceptable in the country is the constant approval of many women, itâ€™s the idea that men should be taking care of themselves and their health. With this idea, SK already has become a major defining role in the beauty industry around the world. So there is more to South Korea aside from its promotion of men`s beauty hygiene and its being the fast In make ups, there are three trends that many start to emulate now. They are listed below: 1. The gradient lips. This can be achieved through a series of makeup trick. One has to put on a noticeable lip color then start to soften the edges through smudges or through concealer. 2. Puppy eyes. Instead of an upward liner curl, the trick is to point it downward. This creates a sad eyes but cute too. 3. Puffy lids. This is called Aegyo-sal. Though many today would purposely look for a treatment or a cosmetic surgery to be able to look stress free, dark ring free and puffy lid free, Korean women are trying to put back or recreate the little fat under the eyes. They believe that it makes eyes look brighter and younger. Mostly this is achieved through contouring and through some major They are just little things of a much bigger landscape of whatâ€™s hot in SK. Now for the major cosmetic surgery trend, Korea seemed also to sport some interesting things. See below: 1. Blepharoplasty. And the goal is to make eyes look wider,  . Many Korean women and men today are clamoring for this surgery. 2. Rhinoplasty. Koreans certainly love perfectness; a little nose job keeps their overall look complete. Plastic Nose surgery had Korea at the top of those countries who offers it. 3. Lip lift. This procedure involves an operation to lift the lips and facial muscle to form that eternal smile. Some may have critiqued it as homage to jokers grin but it has its unending benefits. Whether you think itâ€™s hot or not still you canâ€™t deny that Korea is now one of the leading trend setter in the world.",Roselen

Affiliate Marketing is actually one of the most interesting ways to earn income online. While you can actually make money in affiliate marketing without having a blog, bloggers have more advantages and can make real money with their blogs. In this post, letâ€™s see how we can boost affiliate commissions and   and  . One of the unfailing ways to make more sales is to promote products you have used and have real proof of their effectiveness. As a blogger, must of your readers trust you and take you for your words. If the success of your blogging lies behind a certain affiliate product, talk to your readers about it and show them how it helps you succeed. They will surely buy it for you to earn the commissions. That doesnâ€™t mean you shouldnâ€™t promote other products though but more sales come in when you tell them â€˜I use this products with satisfactionâ€™ Note that some of the buyers that buy based on your endorsement will always turn to you for some level of support. Before you start yelling and and directing them to authors support page, try to offer some basic support as this goes far to increase trust and keep them reading your blog. It is almost a waste of time to promote products that pay cents except you are sure of mass sales. Personally, if a product does not pay $30+ in commission per sale, something else will have to push me into promoting it. If your audience are interested in mega products that pay 1000s of dollars Another way to boost commissions is to publish product reviews on your blog. This links back to point 1 above. Review products you have used pointing out exactly how you benefit from them. Again, you can also review products you have not used but youâ€™ll have to bring out strong arguments and proofs of usefulness. Be sure to link to product sales page through your cloaked affiliate links else you may not get the commissions. This is an important point that really boost sales and puts more money into your pocket. Buyers love bonuses and to an extent, some buyers buy some products just to gain access to the bonuses offered. Isnâ€™t that a boost? If you are a product creator, you may go ahead and offer copies of your own product as bonus. I have practically put this to use and seen positive result. I offer   and   as bonuses to anyone who buys products online using my affiliate link. This is an evergreen strategy that has proven to be very effective. Though I have not done this on my blog, I personally think it can be effective. The reason is that featured materials gain more exposure and attract more attention. A good idea maybe is to create a section on your blog where you regularly feature some recommended products. Try this out and watch results. The more targeted traffic you get to your blog, the more you are able to make sales and earn more commissions. While search engine traffic generally converts more, you should not neglect referral traffic. Get positively involved in growing your social media reach. Thatâ€™s one source of free referral traffic. Now get involved in these things I have shared and see how your sales and affiliate commissions increase with time. Thanks for reading this post today. Leave a comment and let me hear your thoughts.

Other link building techniques are much safer and can be repeated indefinitely without any risk of Google shutting you down. After all these Google updates some people have given up on all kinds of link building for their websites. I will never give up on creating links to my website as these links bring in real traffic. Building links is also a way to  . Before you spend any time link building, make sure your website contains high-quality content which attracts incoming links. Without high-quality content, all of the following link building techniques are an uphill battle. Worse, even if you get incoming links to your low-quality content, you probably wonâ€™t get many people on your website to convert into paid advertising clicks or actual sales, so all of the effort you put into link building techniques will be wasted. All websites need a base of high-quality content. Link bait is one of my favorite link building techniques because it can kill two birds with one stone. First, link baitâ€”despite its bad reputationâ€”can be high-quality content. Second, link bait can attract dozens or hundreds of free incoming links. Link bait is any content on your site which tempts people into linking back to it. The most common form of link bait is the controversial opinion â€¢Â Â Â Â  Contests, especially contests which resonate with other bloggers in your niche. â€¢Â Â Â Â  Inspirational content with an emphasis on emotion over information. â€¢Â Â Â Â  Campaigns against a shared adversary or for a shared cause. Guest posts are one of the most commonly recommended link building techniques because they work. But before you spend much time guest posting, I recommend that you figure out exactly how much value you get from guest posting. I call guest blogging a   because I am using content to market my own website content. A site with very few backlinks needs to get backlinks quick, so guest posting is an ideal link building technique. But a site with plenty of backlinks doesnâ€™t really need moreâ€”except in one special case: A site with plenty of backlinks can still benefit greatly from backlinks from high-ranking sites, so guest posting for those high-ranking sites can be highly advantageous. One of the easiest ways to get Google-proof links is by linking to other sites, which is called forward linking. If you link to other sites, especially if you link popular articles on your site to other sites, youâ€™ll drive traffic to those other sites. If the webmasters of those other sites pay attention to their website statistics, theyâ€™ll know youâ€™re driving traffic to them, and so theyâ€™ll probably check out your site and then may link back to you (if not today, then when the opportunity arises). But why would you want to send traffic to another site when you havenâ€™t made money from them yet? Hereâ€™s the secret: someone who leaves your site through a link probably wasnâ€™t going to buy anyway. You can test this theory using a simple split test in Google Content Experiments or another testing program: create two versions of the same popular page on your website, one with outgoing links and one without. Youâ€™ll almost certainly find that outgoing links donâ€™t cost you much traffic and theyâ€™re one of the most effective Google-proof link building techniques.",Mitz Pantic

03/11/2013,http://comluv.com/understanding-website-traffic-statistics-using-advantage/,Understanding Website Traffic Statistics And Using Them to Your Advantage - ComLuv,"Understanding website traffic statistics is generally hard for the average person as it seems to be such a technical topic. Lets try and simplify it all.Â Only three things really matter in website traffic statistics: visitors, goals, and referrals. Letâ€™s look at each one separately. Visitors are the people (or humans) who view your page. Typically theyâ€™re unique visitors per day. That means each person who visits your website from a particular Web browser on a particular computer is only counted once per day. Visitors per month is usually the number of unique visitors per day times the number of days in the month. That means a loyal audience of 1,000 visitors which visits your site every day will look like 30,000 visitors in your monthly website traffic stats. Visitors are the most quoted stats, but theyâ€™re not the most important stats. I always say that  . So what matters most is how many of the right type of visitors you get. For that, you need to track goals. Google Analytics and some other website traffic stats software lets you track user activity on your site to find out which visitors perform specific actions on your website. It calls these actions, â€œgoalsâ€ù. If you run an advertisement-based website, you goal is to get visitors to click your ads. If you run an affiliate or product-based website, your goal is to get visitors to buy products. If you run a mailing list-based website, your goal is to get All of these goals can be tracked so you can see not just how many raw visitors you have, but how many of them perform the desired action. Even more important, you can use another part of your website traffic stats to see where these visitors came fromâ€”that is, who referred them. On most sites, most visitors are a bust. They donâ€™t earn you any money. They donâ€™t click ads, buy products, or subscribe to lists. But there are a few exceptionsâ€”a few visitors who do meet your goals, visitors we call customers. Your job is to find the difference between customers and non-customers. Often the major difference is who sent the customers to your site. Every time you click a link on the Web using a non-private browser, your Web browser sends the location of the last page you visited to the page youâ€™re currently loading. This is called a referral. For example, if you search for â€œexampleâ€ù on Google, youâ€™ll be on a page with a URL like â€œgoogle.com/search?q=exampleâ€ù. When you click on a link to example.com, your browser will tell example.com that you came from the page â€œgoogle.com/search?q=exampleâ€ù. Your website traffic stats collects all of the referral information from the people who visit your site and adds it up. More importantly, it also lets you filter the results by only the visitors who completed the goal actionâ€”your customers. You may receive 50% of your traffic from Googleâ€”but you may also discover that 90% of you customers come from blog referrals. If thatâ€™s the case and you continue trying to improve your Google rank, youâ€™ll be wasting 90% of your effort. That is one way of fighting the  , cut out the work that does not produce results and stick to the stuff that does. There are other sections in your statistics, but youâ€™ll get the most benefit from visitor, goal, and referral website traffic stats.",Mitz Pantic
02/11/2013,http://comluv.com/tips-using-twitter-engage-customers/,Tips for Using Twitter to Engage Your Customers - ComLuv,"Nowadays, social media has become a very valuable tool for every business. Twitter is one of the most powerful social media channels for interacting with customers and promoting goods and services. It is not only efficient, but also a very cost-effective marketing tool. Here are some of the ways you can use Twitter to engage your customers: In earlier years, customers usually aired their grievances by making a phone call or sending an email. Nowadays however, many people are more likely to talk about their complaints through social media networks such as Twitter, Facebook or Google+. If not handled properly, such negative publicity can have a very adverse effect on your business. Twitter allows you to create custom searches which will help you keep track of tweets which mention your brand or company name. When you find grievances from customers, take time to respond in a professional way. Seek clarification where necessary and resolve any problem presented. Responding to complaints in a polite and timely way will help win the trust and loyalty of your customers. Besides handling complaints, Twitter is also a great way of keeping your followers informed about the latest developments in your business. You can share information such as changes in physical Anytime you think of creating new products and services, you need to keep your customers in mind.Â  Take time to engage your followers to find out what they really need. One of the best ways of doing this is by taking surveys using Twitter. The information collected will greatly enhance your chances of success. Following and promoting others is a great way of engaging your customers. Look for companies which deal in related products and services. For instance, if your company sells fitness equipment, you may want to connect with another which deals in sporting apparel. You can then post tweets about their products and encourage your customers to buy from them. When you do this, the other company is likely to return the favor. Branding is very important for the success of any company. Having a unique brand will make it easy for customers and prospects to identify your business. Take time to customize your Twitter account with your official company colors or logo. In addition, remember to use your actual business name as the Twitter account name. Your followers might be interested in knowing more about your business. Therefore, you need to take time to create a full Twitter profile which explains the history of your company. Talk about your notable achievements, as well the challenges you have faced. Write short profiles of some of your staff members. You could even post photos of a recent company event. Sharing such information will demystify your business and encourage customers to interact with you.",ckimathim
01/11/2013,http://comluv.com/losing-weight-positive-mindset/,Losing Weight With a Positive Mindset - ComLuv,"Mindset is the first and most important thing that you should make sure is in place before you start dieting and exercising, especially if these two things are well outside of your usual routine. TheÂ  and similar self-talk will get you nowhere, and fast â€“ everyone who tried to lose weight before and had a similar chatter going on in the back of their head knows this. It simply doesnâ€™t work, and itâ€™s becauseÂ  that it wonâ€™t work. Think of something that you enjoy doing â€“ say, playing chess. If you love playing chess, it doesnâ€™t matter who your opponent is, it doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re tired or in a bad mood, you will play every chance you get and you wonâ€™t be making excuses not to play â€“ you wonâ€™t need to. Now think about what it would be like if you had the same attitude towards the activities that lead to weight loss: if you loved healthy foods, if you didnâ€™t think about food all the time, if you enjoyed physical activity. Can you imagine just how much easier it would be to do them day after day, even for the rest of your life? Now, itâ€™s impossible that you just say to yourself: â€œOK, as of today I love this healthy lifestyle that will make me thinâ€ù and to shift your mind altogether just by deciding to do so. But itâ€™s possible to train your mind to eventually start truly enjoying all these activities and to accept them as a part of who you are. It takes some effort, but itâ€™s possible. You can stay motivated in many different ways, and here are some of the most effective ones: This is a huge change in your life, and you can use all support you can get. Let your friends and family members know what youâ€™re up to and ask them to be positive about it (not too positive though, an over-zealous friend can make you feel guilty for skipping the exercise when you absolutely had to, and guilt isnâ€™t a positive emotion). Go online, find support groups and forums and join them â€“ youâ€™re not the only one who struggles with weight loss, and other people can have something useful to share with you. One of the great websites that you could check out is called   â€“ they have this free 30 day e-course made especially to help you establish positive thinking habits about your weight loss efforts and goals (itâ€™s free and no email needed). Being able to see yourself the way you want to be is a strong motivator. Creative visualization is used for many things in self-improvement area, and for a reason: the image we serve to our mind, the image of us being fit and thin, gets stronger the more we practice visualization, pushing us forward and strengthening our belief that we can actually get there. It is said: â€œIf youâ€™ve been there in your mind, you will go there in your bodyâ€ù â€“ and itâ€™s true, try it! Sometimes our mind doesnâ€™t want to cooperate â€“ it simply refuses all our efforts to be positive about the activities involved in losing weight. When you see that yours is this stubborn, itâ€™s OK to reach for some extra help to stimulate the change you want to see. Subliminal messages,  , positive affirmations â€“ they all work by changing the existing, negative thinking patterns and turning them into a positive attitude about your goal. These can be really effective if you follow through with your other actions, and they work in the long run too as they create new beliefs and attitudes.",Thomas Allan
31/10/2013,http://comluv.com/6-point-buying-guide-engagement-rings/,Your 6 Point Buying Guide to Engagement Rings - ComLuv,"image via ( ) Proposing to your girlfriend is one of the most exciting things you will do in your life. Making the decision to spend the rest of your life with this woman is momentous, and the occasion when you ask should include a few things â€” one of which is the perfect engagement ring. Buying an engagement ring is intimate business. It requires knowing what style your future wife prefers and which metal interests her, and it requires educating yourself about the four â€œCâ€ùs of  : color, clarity, cut, and carat. One of the easier aspects of shopping for an engagement ring is knowing your partner. While you might not have paid much attention to the jewelry she has worn in the past, itâ€™s time to take note. Does she wear yellow gold, white gold, or platinum? Not knowing the answer to this question can make buying the perfect ring difficult. Try to get her ring size. If you canâ€™t confiscate a ring to take to the jeweler as an example without her knowledge, try asking her best friend or her mother. Finally, try to understand what style she likes. Perhaps you could bring it up yourself or you could enlist the help of a friend or relative so you know if she prefers princess cut, round, square or ascher. An unlimited budget Going into debt to purchase a ring is not a good idea. It also helps to know exactly what type of ring you want to purchase so you have an idea what you might need to spend. This might mean spending a few months  . Color is perhaps the most important aspect of any diamond ring. The color of a diamond is rated based on letters that start at D and proceed through Z. The closer to the beginning of the alphabet a ring is rated, the clearer the diamond. Colors closer to Z are slightly tinted and less expensive. Clarity is the internal characteristic of a ring. The clarity of a ring is rated on a 10-point scale. The better the clarity, the more expensive and desirable the ring. Many people are fooled by the term carat. Some think that this determines the size of a diamond, but it actually refers to its weight. For example, a 3-carat diamond may not be half the size of a 6-carat ring because more weight is distributed at the top and bottom of the 6-carat ring. The cut of a ring matters because it determines how much light shines through the stone. The way a ring is cut can actually affect its value by as much as half. This is because the way the light shines through the ring makes it more or less desirable. Where you shop for an engagement ring also matters. Shopping at a retailer such as Kranichâ€™s Jewelers means youâ€™ll find the best engagement ring for the best price. You can rest assured that the ring you purchase is of good quality and itâ€™s designed by one of the worldâ€™s leading engagement ring designers. Buying an engagement ring is a much more intimate process than simply heading to the local mall to find a jeweler. The woman you plan on spending the rest of your life with deserves more than that. She deserves your best effort, and a ring that will last a lifetime.",Missy Diaz

This is only the first phase of your keyword research. The second phase can actually be much more beneficial to your goals. The second phase is researching your   which can generate much more organic traffic than your focus Keyword. Long Tailed Keywords contain different variations of phrases that include a focus keyword. If your focus keywords are â€œJewelry Repairâ€ù, then the Long Tailed Keywords would be â€œJewelry Repair Kitsâ€ù or â€œJewelry Repair Stores in New Orleansâ€ù. The more general the niche, the more important it is to find the right Keywords that have the right Long Tailed Keywords. Why you want them: I mentioned above Long Tailed Keywords generate more organic traffic than specific keywords as a whole. They will actually account for about 70-90%% of your sites organic traffic. Finding Long Tailed Keywords is all about finding out how much potential traffic you can generate to your blog. Something as simple as 1 letter can increase or decrease that potential drastically. Using Google Keyword Planner â€œLawn Chairâ€ù generates 2,900 local searches a month.  â€œLawn Chairsâ€ù generates 8,100 local searches a month. Simply adding the letter â€œSâ€ù increased the search volume almost 3x! Do you think researching Long Tailed Keywords, is worth your time? Now of days searchers are using more specific terms when searching online for content. The days of 2 word search terms are gone. One of the reasons for the new Google Hummingbird Algorithm. This means that more and more Long Tailed Keywords are being used in search and Google is claiming to now offer better quality search results. Result Relevancy is the first step in weeding out which may have been considered potential competition and helps drive â€œtargetedâ€ù traffic! Since the new Algorithm, have you noticed a difference in your search results? If you are able to find a Long Tailed Keyword that meets your needs- odds are it has much less competition than the Focus Keyword, which always works in your favor. Less competition means it will be easier to rank higher on Search Engines. The higher your rank, the more clicks you will generate to your site (Organic Traffic). You want to get to the #1 spot or as close as possible, as soon as possible. If you get the number one spot you can expect about 30% of the traffic from that term will be taking a look at Not to bad for one post. Iâ€™m sure you can see the potential. 900 visitors X 10 post = 9,000 hits a month. That is a perfect example and those 10 post may come far between other post. Persistence is a big part of blogging! Finding the right Long Tailed Keywords, along with using White Hat SEO tactics will help you get higher rankings. Your Long Tailed Keywords should describe your product or service as closely as possible. This formula will get you higher conversion rates.  x   =  You are optimizing your post for Targeted traffic. People who want   what you have to offer. A general search for â€œDesk Lampsâ€ù will have a lot of competition that will take a lot of work to compete with, especially if you are just starting out. Now, a search for â€œAdjustable Halogen Desk Lampsâ€ù is a much more specific search that will give you much better chance of conversion. With higher conversion rates, you can also expect to enjoy lower bounce rates and better Time-On-Page metrics. With the new Google Hummingbird update it is much more important to use your Long Tailed Keywords in a way that is natural. Donâ€™t just throw your Keywords in just so they can be in your post. Place your Keywords in the Right Places and try to get a few in your post. If you read over your post and anything seems forcedâ€_ Take It Out! Stuffing your post with your Keywords unnaturally may send red flags to Search Engines. You want to be on the Search Engines radar as an authority, sharing quality content. The last thing you want is to be looked at as a spammer. You may have read about keyword density where you need to post your keywords in your post a certain number of times. There is nothing confirming that this is true. It does make sense that if search engines are looking for quality content that you should have your keywords in your post. For that reason I put them in mine, as long as they are there in a way that is not forced. Keeping your post natural and informative whether it has your keyword listed 6 times or only once will be better for you in the long run. Do you think Keyword Density is an important factor in your rankings? The first step with any website is adding really  .

Thereâ€™s been a lot of talk about how to successfully visualize the positive outcome, how to use positive affirmations etc, but what many people seem to overlook is the importance of  , and yet this simple and beautiful feeling is able to do all the manifesting. Think about it: when are you grateful? You probably donâ€™t feel gratitude for something that you donâ€™t have, or for something that you do have but donâ€™t particularly appreciate, for something you think is bad or not worthy. Being grateful therefore means that youÂ  and that youÂ  Now think about it from the perspective of the Law of Attraction: letâ€™s say that you want to manifest a new job â€“ youâ€™re very unhappy with the current one, youâ€™re underpaid, your colleagues suck, the atmosphere is everything but stimulatingâ€_ So you want a new one, a better one. You visualize it every day, you know exactly what your new office should be like, your new coworkers have great personal relationships, everyone is doing their job without feeling pressure, you fit there beautifully, your paychecks are significantly larger than what youâ€™re currently earningâ€_ All is great, except for one thing: youÂ  You see, if you   that youâ€™ve set things in motion and that this job is about to manifest, you would be feeling grateful for it â€“ yes, even before you have it in reality. If your mom told you that she has sent you your Christmas gift, something that you told her you wanted for a long time, if you knew that the gift was in the mail and that you just had to wait until it arrives â€“ how would you feel then? Your mom has never lied to you, and you believe her when she says that she sent it; the mail service has never failed you before either, so thereâ€™s no reason to doubt that your gift is coming. Imagine it for a moment â€“ something that you wanted really bad for a long time is on its way to you, because your mom has acquired it and sent it your way. I donâ€™t know about you, but Iâ€™d be ecstatic and so grateful to my mom! Itâ€™s the same with manifesting:   confirms that you believe that the Law of Attraction is delivering what youâ€™ve asked for. Itâ€™s one of the most powerful positive feelings that you can attach to your manifesting desire as it says that you bothÂ  that your thoughts have set the Law in motion in your behalf,Â andÂ  the result of your manifesting efforts. Without it, youâ€™re sending a message to the Universe that you donâ€™t really trust its powerâ€_ so why should the Universe bother, if you donâ€™t? Gratitude is, luckily, something you can practice. You know about the   â€“ the better you feel, the more great things you will attract to make you feel even better? This works as a general attitude as well, so the more grateful you feel in your life, the more things to be grateful for you will receive. To increase the level of gratitude in your life, you can make a simple list of the things in it you appreciate and to stop taking them for granted. Your family, your career, your friends, the mere fact that youâ€™re alive and capable of creating the life you want â€“ you surely have something to feel grateful about. Make the list and think about each item on it, think about what your life would look without it. Then switch the focus and say to yourself: â€œI am so grateful that this is in my life as it brings me joy and comfort.â€ù Andâ€_ the next time you start to manifest, donâ€™t think: â€œI would like to change my job.â€ù Instead, think: â€œI am grateful that this fantastic new yob where I will earn a lot more money and feel great while doing it is on its way to me.â€ù Try it, thereâ€™s nothing to lose and much to gain _Ÿ™‚",Thomas Allan
25/10/2013,http://comluv.com/rookie-website-building-mistakes/,Rookie Website Building Mistakes - ComLuv,"The number one rookie website building mistake is starting a website without a plan. But thatâ€™s not the last mistake rookies makeâ€”letâ€™s take a look at them all in detail. Websites donâ€™t cost much money today, but you could waste countless hours website building if you start without a plan. You donâ€™t need a detailed 39 page planâ€”just a short list will do. But your plan must answer these questions: â€¢Â Â Â Â  What kind of people will visit my website? â€¢Â Â Â Â  Why will they visit my website? â€¢Â Â Â Â  Will I make money from my website visitors? If so, how? â€¢Â Â Â Â  What specific steps must I follow to build a website that accomplishes all of the above? Answer those questions with your plan and youâ€™ll be light years ahead of most website builders. Check out my website plan above for some great ideas. Back when I started building websites, all of the professional website builders used Microsoft Frontpage or (then) Macromedia Dreamweaver. Today those tools are antiquatedâ€”nobody who knows uses those tools to build individual webpages. Everyone today uses a content management system that automatically turns text into webpages using a site-wide theme. Content management systems are cheap (most are free) and all of the good ones are easy to use even if youâ€™ve never made a website before. Despite that, rookies who once heard something about Dreamweaver years ago still pay hundreds of dollars for a license. Donâ€™t be that kind of foolâ€”use the modern and more affordable technology. (If you donâ€™t know where to start, try WordPress, the most popular content management system in the world.) There are hundreds of  . They all advertise basically the same features, but itâ€™s a mistake to think they all offer the same service. Think of website hosting companies like restaurantsâ€”they all offer the same basics, but thereâ€™s huge gulf between a McDonaldâ€™s and a four-star chef. When looking for hosting, start by looking at reviews. Then look at the features. Hereâ€™s where a plan can help you find a great dealâ€”look for hosting providers that just offer the features you need for your website. All of the best website hosting companies offer their best rate to people who sign up for one-year or longer contracts, but thereâ€™s no way to be sure you like a hosting company until you try them. For that reason, itâ€™s essential to sign up with a website hosting company that offers a money-back guarantee. Rookies make the mistake of just jumping right inâ€”and then they find themselves stuck with a $200 or $300 contract for service they hate. Youâ€™ve made a plan, chosen your software, bought great hosting, and spent hours, days, or weeks building your website. What could go wrong? Everything. Press the wrong button and you can delete your entire website. Get hacked and you could also lose your entire website. Rookies donâ€™t think about how they might lose all of the money and time they put into their website, but you should. Protecting your website is easy. First, choose a website hosting company that offers automated backups. They will protect you even when you sleep. Then spend a few minutes every week backing up your own website. This is all part of a   you should follow. Backups are easy if you choose a leading content management system like WordPress or Drupal. Just activate the backup section and download a file or two and youâ€™ll never have to go back to website building square one again.",Mitz Pantic
23/10/2013,http://comluv.com/warning-dont-publish-next-blog-post-read/,WARNING! Don't publish your next blog post until you read this! - ComLuv,"One of the most exciting moments of blogging is when your well written article is ready and you are about to hit the â€˜publishâ€™ command button. But often, our articles are only ready in our brains. A lot of things are still left undone and some of these untidy things go a long way to thumb down the post. Before you publish your next post, I recommend you check these few points out to avoid embarrassment and falling out with search engines. You may also have to look at these  Â  as soon as you publish it. Here therefore are the 9 crucial points I recommend; One of the things you must do before going live is to read through your copy several times. Leave your PC and come back to reread. Youâ€™re certainly going to find some silly errors. Sometimes, what you read is not whatâ€™s written. It happens often. You are looking at something and reading another thing in your brain. Thatâ€™s while itâ€™s recommended to read aloud to yourself. This practice actually corrects any wrongly recorded text in your brain and helps you correct errors.Â If you have someone around to check the article for errors, that will be better. ! There are a couple of onpage SEO factors that you must pay attention to before making your article public. Following the recent Google updates, some SEO brains may argue some of these points but I think we still need to consider them. Letâ€™s start with the permalink.  This is actually the url structure of your article. Itâ€™s just below your post title. Before now, SEO experts used to advice having your main keyword in the URL of your article. Whatever Google is cooking, it is still worth using your keyword in the permalink and making it clean and readable.  Â These 4 components certainly have some SEO importance so there is definitely need not to rush over them. Some times, we forget the keywords, description and tags. This has happened to me and I looked dumb. Before you publish your next article, be sure these factors are all well in place.  Categories are meant to help organize posts in different relevant groups. This helps the readers quickly locate the information they are looking for. Poorly categorized blog may mislead the readers and send them away. This plays negatively on bounce rate and time on site. Itâ€™s important you pay attention to which category your post should tie to. Images and videos and some of the components that add value and beauty to your article. However, these also have downsides if you miss the point. While well tagged images can improve visibility on search engines, poorly treated and large image files will add more weight to your page and make it SEO unfriendly. Be sure to optimize your images for SEO and fast Now those of us from areas where Internet is still a luxury, speed is often an issue to deal with. Fast speed Internet connection in such areas always weighs heavily on the pockets of users. This explains while more of us still have dial-up technology. Now avoid hitting the submit button when your connection is too slow. You stand a high chance to lose part of your article. This happened to me and I almost lost a huge part of my post. If you think your connection is not good enough to publish, just wait until all is set. If you want real engagement on your next blog post, CommentLuv Premium is the most recommended engagement plugin. I saw a huge improvement on my blog when I upgraded from the free to the premium version. Now, a lot has been added to the piece to make it even more exiting. Â Itâ€™s a perfect mix of referral and SEO traffic, Twitter and community building plugin. All these in one can completely change your blog positively. We know that creating both external and internal links on your next article will have some SEO benefits. Linking to external resources adds more value to your article and gives visitors more information. Â Linking to another article on your blog increases time on site and reduces bounce rate. These are all SEO ranking factors you must neglect. So I encourage you go back to your article and be sure you have some links to related contents. Are your social sharing buttons in place? I know most blogs now have the tweet, like, Google+, Facebook share buttons in place but you need to double check yours are well in place too. Â This will help your readers share your next article on social media bringing in more traffic. The good news is that most of these social sharing plugins are free. Check on   (by WordPress) Â if you are not sure which package to get. Most of us wonder why we donâ€™t get engagement on our articles. One of the reasons is that we donâ€™t ask for it. There is nothing bad in asking questions in your article, aimed at pushing your readers to react in the comment box. Â Donâ€™t just write like you are preaching in church. Make sure your next article encourages conversation. Make it a discussion board by asking question and encouraging your readers to leave a comment and share the post. Each time you hit â€˜publishâ€™, WordPress sends a ping signal to Google and other search engines to let them know you have a new article on your blog. That doesnâ€™t end there. Hitting â€˜Updateâ€™ also pings the search engines telling them your article has an update. Now the more you update, the more signals you get sent to Search engines. This may turn down on you if you repeatedly update within a close range as these search engines may misunderstand your action and take it for search engine spamming. Be really sure you get your post well set before publishing I hope these points will help you get your next article quite ready before publication.

21/10/2013,http://comluv.com/importance-choosing-right-web-hosting-better-rankings/,Importance of Choosing the Right Web Hosting for Better Rankings,"Once you have written your website and posted it online, you need to get it indexed on Google. No doubt you have considered the SEO ( ) of your site as you wrote it, but now you need to consider other factors, such as how your host server is going to affect your Google rank. The web host consideration is often overlooked by webmasters, because finding a right web hosting is so difficult that it seems irrelevant. It is like finding the perfect car to pull the weight of your trailer without using too much fuel, only to be told that you should have looked for one that has flexible steel axles to take bumps and corners better. In many cases, it is not how much your hosting company is going to push you up the search engine results. It is more about how much damage they can do to your ranking, including but not limited to, getting your website banned from the Google index. Many people think that having your own personalized IP address will help improve your Google rank. Whether this is true or not is unknown, but with a shared host you have to share your IP address with hundreds of other people. There are companies that you can often pay to give you your own IP address. Any decisive proof that private and personalized IP addresses helps your search engine rankings has been quickly denied by the bigger search engines, even though tracking the positive and negative Shared hosts and their shared IP addresses matter not to the nasty spammer. As you know, spammers are often kicked off a search engineâ€™s index because  . Another website may be spamming away whilst using the same IP address as everyone else on that server. When they get banned they take everybody else with them. Your websiteâ€™s visibility could be seriously damaged and there is nothing you can do about it. Your entire server may be banned from a search engine. If you have VPS then nobody is to blame but yourself. On the other hand, if you have shared hosting then you could end up taking the fall (rankings wise) because of the actions of some other jerk on your server. Your server should have a very high percentage of Up-time. If it does not, then your website is going to have portions of the day, month, week, when it does not operate. Your rank on Google will not matter at all if your traffic is getting a â€œcanâ€™t find htmlâ€ù screen when they click on it. If your host is not playing by Googleâ€™s rules, then the sites held within may be due for a serious knock to their Google Ranking. If the server has hundreds of URLs on it that are making it harder for Google to index, then Google may penalize the server, and therefore penalize your website along with it. As I said hosting is very crucial for any business, because a bad hosting can encourage search engines to give low priority to your blog while giving SERP. So do proper research and read reviews about hosting before spending money.",Kulwant Nagi

Whatâ€™s the level of your success? Was it a year of achievements for you? In any case, in this post, I wonâ€™t be talking about 2013. Letâ€™s begging thinking 2014 as bloggers In recent years, SEO and Google the big brother have been so unpredictable. There have been a series of   â€“ Penguin, Panda and Hummingbird tossing our blogs up and down the SERP. Bloggers throughout these updates have learned to diversify the sources of traffic to their blogs. We have learned that relying on Google and other Search Engines alone is tantamount to digging a pit on the way. Page rank that has been an important factor to determine a websiteâ€™s strength was given no attention in 2013. What does Google have for webmasters and bloggers in 2014? Is there any future for Page Rank? Backlinking has been a major activity in 2013. Blog commenting and guest posting have been activities to increase backlinks. Â Will there be a change in 2014? What values will 2014 attach to blog commenting and guest posting? Will there be more attention given to paid guest posting?   With the recent hummingbird update, Google is more of a human being than a bot. Ranking based on keyword is fading out. Keyword density and OnPage positioning are no longer strong ranking factors. More attention is given to content usefulness and relevance. Â Bounce Rate, Time on site and social signals will become reliable messengers delivering 2013 has been a social media year. Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinedIn and Pinterest, etc have dominated social media in 2013. Businesses as well as social courses found their ways to social media profitable. Social media has been a reliable source of referral traffic to our blogs. Facebook fanpages, groups, Google+ communities, Googl+ Hang outs, etc have driven handsome amount of traffic to our blogs. That was 2013. Is there going to be a shift in 2014? Are you working on new social media strategies? Many blogs (WordPress to be more specific) were hacked this year 2013. Securing WP blogs has been a tough talk in 2013. Despite security measures â€“ plugins, server updates, script updates, etc, some hacker still found their path to cause harm.Â  Do you have more worked out security strategies for the next year? Building a community as a blogger is one very crucial factor affecting success in this activity. 2013 has been a year where most of us expanded and networked with many interesting buddies in blogging. Community bulding platforms like Bizsugar, blogengage, etc have been useful this year. The coming year is another year to expand and meet more bloggers. Are you ready? Most of us blog in order to make money. We are interested in generating income from our blogs. We made some money in 2013. Another year is ahead. Have you worked on strategies to make more money? Has the money been in the list this year 2013? A list is surely an important tool in online success. There are hundreds of ways to build a list. Did you build a list in 2013? What are the methods you have in place for 2014? While your list is your marketplace, itâ€™s also an important source of traffic Now leap forward and tell us in the comment box what 2014 will look like.

18/10/2013,http://comluv.com/processed-food-addiction-effects-body/,Processed Food Addiction And Its Effects On Your Body - ComLuv,"There are many forms of addiction. Drugs are one major form of addiction which is a menace to society. Addiction to processed food is another menace not just to your body and health, it can also affect your family and all the other people close to you. Addiction to processed food can have a negative impact to society which is evident especially in the first world and industrialized countries. Since the introduction of processed foods and other ways of serving them, Americans have gone from an all natural food eating country to a fast food nation. Since the late 60s and early 70s, Americans have become bigger and bigger because of its food culture. Big servings of deep fried, sugar and salt laden food topped with more sugar, salt, grease and carbohydrates. Too much salt can result to raised blood pressure and you should be aware of the  . There is nothing wrong if you have a large serving of food as long as you have someone to share it with. The fast food culture pushed foods with too much sugar, salt and other preservatives to the masses for decades. And the result, people getÂ obese with high risks of developing diabetes, heart ailments and other chronic diseases. A number of studies and research at leading government laboratories and Universities suggest that processed food and drinks rich in sugar are not just unhealthy, it can trick the brain in ways that resemble an addiction to nicotine, meth, cocaine and other drugs. The data are so solid and overwhelming that it has to be accepted by the general population as stated by Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. She also said that they have found overlaps between drugs in the brain and food in the brain. The idea of processed food to be addicting was barely discussed by experts and scientists a decade ago but experts are already taking notice now. A study that was made at the Bostonâ€™s Children HospitalÂ  have concluded that processed carbohydrates stimulate regions in the brain that affect cravings and promotes excess hunger. The study that was publishedÂ  in the American Journal of Clinical nutrition studied the effects of high-glycemic foods on brain activity using an FMRI. 12 obese and overweight men between the ages of 18 to 35 consumed one highâ€“glycemic and one low-glycemic meal. The FMRI was performed four hours after each test meal. According to the study, a high glycemic-index meal decreased plasma glucose, increased the personâ€™s hunger and selectively stimulated brain regions that are associated with craving and reward. This research shows what many people experience, a spike in their blood sugar due to rapidly digested carbohydrates followed by a sharp crash a few hours after the spike. The FMRI also showed that a sharp crash in blood glucose can trigger a region in the brain known as the nucleus accumbens,Â  whichÂ  is linked to addictive behavior. According to Dr. Robert Lustig, a pioneer in decoding sugar metabolism and Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of California has made his opinion regarding Â the research. He stated that the research canâ€™t tell if it is a cause and effect relationship between eating specific foods and triggering brain responses or if those responses are linked to overeating and obesity but the evidence shows that the phenomenon is real. He also added that the brainâ€™s pleasure center known as the nucleus accumbensÂ is essential to human survival. Turn it off and humans will lose the will to live. But long term stimulation of this pleasure center drives the process of addiction. When a person consumes any substance of abuse this includes sugar, the nucleus accumbens receives a dopamine signal which in turn is can experience pleasure so the person tend to consume more. A person needs to consume more to get the same effect or high and when a person pulls back on the substance, withdrawal will occur. Tolerance and addiction results in addiction and it is proven that sugar is addictive. Sugar and fats have always been present in the human diet and the human body is programmed to process them. What has changed is how modern manufacturers and producers create foods with high concentration of sugar, refined flour an unhealthy fats without the redeeming levels of nutrients, minerals and fibers. Consuming large quantities of these processed foods are changing how the brain is wired. The ball is on the consumers, itâ€™s either they smart up or get drowned in processed food addiction.",Roselen
17/10/2013,http://comluv.com/artificial-jewellery-demand-gold-prices-touching-skies/,Artificial Jewellery is most in demand as Gold prices are touching the skies.,"Gold Jewellery has been the most desired piece of ornament for women for centuries and even today females are really obsessive for it. No doubt gold is one of the expensive metals and itsÂ Jewellery is considered to be one of the priciest gift a person can give to a women. Although there has been a decreasing trend in the gold prices some months back but still its prices are above reach of people with average income. The precious metal experienced a huge fall in price until last month but it has started to rise once again. The craze forÂ Jewellery cannot be taken from a women and when gold prices are going sky high, what can be done? A very simple alternative to this problem has been developed in the shape of artificial jewellery which looks identical to gold. Skyrocketing gold prices, worsening law order situation, increasing incidents of snatching have affected the goldÂ Jewellery business really bad. People are rapidly shifting to  , as it is The trend ofÂ artificial jewellery shoots up not just because it is inexpensive but is having a huge variety of designs and colors as well. TheÂ artificial jewellery currently available in the market looks even better than the yellow metal and has caused a real drop in the sales of the gold accessories. Locally manufacturedÂ artificial jewellery in the country is of the highest quality and can meet its competitors all over the globe very easily. However, the increase in demand of this cheapÂ Jewellery has taken such rapid hype that the local manufacturers are facing difficulties in meeting the needs. On the other hand, the retailers have resolved this issue with importingÂ artificial jewellery from China and Italy, and it has grown even popular among the lower-income population. Artificial jewelleryÂ in the market includes the entire variety of ornaments, including ear-tops, bangles, rings, chains, nose pins, necklaces, toe-rings, anklets, bracelets and much more. The markets are filled with these items and women are buying them like hot cakes. However, due to the rapid increase in demand of artificial Jewellery, its prices are on the rise as well. Of course its prices are nothing as compared to the gold accessories, yet high quality artificial sets ofÂ Jewellery might cost as much as $100. This demand ofÂ artificial Jewellery is subjected to rising even more if gold prices keep moving towards the skies.",mahnoormalik

Getting a link in their name on their comment to theirs (or more likely, their clients site) is a valuable thing the more links you have to your site, they more likely the search engines will see you as a popular site ..and in turn, the more likely to show your site in the search results well, google says that was how it used to be but I think in way it still is Seems simple right? hereâ€™s two filters that you can add to your functions.php theme file to remove all links from all comments The problem with that though,  If youâ€™re displaying someonesâ€™ first comment with a message of â€˜your comment is in moderationâ€™ then itâ€™s probably showing the links those links tell the spam software that the comment went through (even if you didnâ€™t approve it) that gets you spammed even more maybe even put on a list of â€˜easyâ€™ sites to spam.. oo-er! You could go a bit fancier on your filters and check the comment first to see if itâ€™s in moderation or not.. that way the automated spambots wont see any links on their moderated comments andwill think that your site doesnâ€™t give out links and then they should leave you alone This one has to go in to a plugin though because the callback functions need to be available before the theme loads.. just copy this to a new text file and save it as punch-spammers.php and upload it to your plugins directory and activate it in your plugins page to get it to work. The plugin above may be all that you need if youâ€™re getting targeted by this new automated spam software. You just need to let it know youâ€™re not someone who gives out links to everyone. There is a better option though. Iâ€™ve written a plugin to work alongside CommentLuv Premium that does a whole lot of magic and not only punches spammers in the face, it kicks them right up their butt! ..it can hide all links until someone has made X number of comments .. it can blacklist users who spam too much .. it shows you how many spam comments someone has made next to their name .. it allows you to send a commenter an email with the reasons their comments werenâ€™t accepted .. you can whitelist users so they always get links .. you can even put people in the sinbin so they get their future comments moderated .. and more! Itâ€™s called ABLP or Anti Backlinker Plugin and itâ€™s free for CommentLuv Premium users..

Thatâ€™s the part of making food choice changes and becoming aware of serving sizes, calories, carbs and fats. I use a   to weigh all foods I prepare so that I can track nutrition. My â€œweight lossâ€ù is coming off slowly but I do know that from past experience, and there have been plenty as I have tired everything, from the  , TOPS Club, Atkins Diet, South Beach and the best was   where I lost 34 pounds and kept it off for over 2 1/2 years, was the smallest in my life but because I moved from one state to another I stopped using a trainer and the weight gradually crept on. Up until August 2013, I have not tired to change my diet for at least 12 years with the exception of eating more fresh vegetables and watching what kinds of fats I was using, but THEN, it was all helter skelter eating on every whim. As an example of my day I would start out good, a yogurt and granola, but then my day would go south, I would start filling up on sandwiches with Cheetos, corn chips, dips and the like, and if I was away from home, oh my, I would stop at McDonaldâ€™s and get fries, and a burger accompanied with a regular coke. Nearly 500 calories and 19 grams of fat in one meal. Or if I went grocery shopping I would choose a pastry to eat on the way home. I dont do that now, I make sure I have had something to eat before I go to the store and carry a snack and water with me.

Nothing white, no rice, spaghetti, noodles, flour or sugar. Oh and the flavored creamers loaded with sugar and fat, I stopped using those. Â And if I have drink a soda, it is sugar free, which I now limit to one a day. So what I am learning to do for myself and my family is more about gluten free and using recipes that exclude high carbs, fats and calories, no sugar and low salt, that I usually ended up adding into our foods when I made things like enchiladas, lasagna and tacos. Â Creating a â€œhealthier recipeâ€ù, it will take care of the higher calories in enchiladas from 640 calories or more, (1 serving) and (depending on the additional toppings) Â 33 grams of fat and 41 carbs. To this recipe I am going to share in a reduction to just 83 calories per serving, 19.8 carbs and 1.2 grams of fat and 2.9 grams of protein.

Bake the squash in 1/2â€_ water in pan at 375Â° for 30 minutes, you can check with a fork for readiness. If it resists with fork bake a little longer. Once cooled I use a fork to remove the squash, it comes out in strings and will look like spaghetti. â™_Mix the Rotel Tomatoes into the squash and set aside. (You can use salsa in place of Rotel tomatoes) â™_Brown the turkey and add the chili powder, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and green chilies. â™_Now to start the layering. I spread a layer of enchilada sauce in pan, then if using tortillas add the first layer. For me I made half the pan with tortillas and half without. The family will eat enchiladas in tortillas and I will eat without. Then the next layer with the squash, meat, onion, sauce and cheese. Continue building layers until you use all the ingredients finishing with a layer of cheese and for garnish I used sliced olives. â™_Cover and Bake 30 minutes in 350Â° oven.

Sheâ€™s even the planner behind the lavish nuptials of former Disney star Hilary Duff. image via ( ) With such an impressive background, Weiss has clearly made a name for herself in the wedding planning industry. She recently shared some of the biggest wedding trends of the 21st century, and whatâ€™s causing couples to choose to follow (and sometimes even set) these trends in their weddings. Even though itâ€™s been more than two years since commoner Kate Middleton wed Prince William in England, more brides than ever before are opting to forgo the strapless gowns so popular in the past for a gown with sleeves. The Duchess of Cambridge, according to Weiss, is so lovely, so feminine, and so famous that everyone wants to emulate her look on their wedding day. This effortless, elegant, and lovely look is the inspiration behind thousands of wedding gowns worn each year and the trend doesnâ€™t appear to be dying off. The recent arrival of Prince George of Cambridge only brings the Duchess further into the spotlight, and has made even more women want to emulate her style. When Weiss planned Nicole Richie and Joel Maddenâ€™s wedding in 2010, she incorporated the indoor-outdoor trend into their wedding reception. For the bohemian-rocker couple, Weiss used a lot of animal print couches and decor, and mixed the indoors with the outdoors for a creative look. Everyday couples are using the same indoor-outdoor One of the ways in which couples are using the indoor-outdoor look is by taking furniture that belongs inside and using it outside. This look provides a chic and elegant ambiance to any outdoor wedding ceremony or reception. Couples are also choosing to bring gorgeous chandeliers outside, hanging them from trees and other fixtures to create an elegant ballroom look in the great outdoors. Itâ€™s an increasingly popular trend used by Hilary Duff in her 2010 wedding. She had Weiss hang more than 55 chandeliers throughout her reception. One of the biggest wedding trends that planners such as Mindy Weiss have noted in the 21st century is personalized decor. Couples across the country are now personalizing just about everything they can, from their cake topper to the spotlight on the dance floor to their cocktail napkins. Another huge personalized wedding trend is the  . Couples meet with their caterers and bartenders to create signature, custom cocktails just for their wedding.

The concept of personalized decor and gifts is big on websites such as Pinterest, a site where some women go to plan their weddings virtually these days. Wedding trends in the 21st century are far more luxurious and high-end than past practices.

11/10/2013,http://comluv.com/6-great-reasons-build-computer/,6 Great Reasons to Build Your Own Computer - ComLuv,"If you believe in the death of a desktop PC, I am sorry to disappoint you. Desktop is very much alive and is doing fairly well. No matter how many tablets you might have in your household, or how many cell phones you go through each year, all mobile devices are much rather a complement to the desktop PC than a viable threat. So if you are in the market for computing power and outstanding performance, you should be heading to the desktop aisle. If you consider yourself a smart shopper, you could be thinking of building one yourself. Why wouldnâ€™t you? Here are some great reasons that might inspire you to build your own PC. It goes without saying, you are your own boss when it comes to building a PC. You choose the kind of computer you want to build, select the components you like most, and customize it for whatever you want it to do. With pre-built computers, very often you will have to compromise on something. Whether it is the graphics card that could be better, or the storage capacity of the hard drive that could be larger, the looks of the case, or something else, it is very rare that you would like all the specs. You could upgrade, but why would you want to try to fix something when you could get exactly what you want with a custom build PC? You wonâ€™t save money every time you build a computer yourself. Lower-end or mid-range desktops are already offered at reasonable prices through the manufacturers. They will do great for an average user who needs it for web browsing or e-mail, but it may not be powerful enough for much more. Professional or gaming computers tend to be more expensive. In this case, you are much more likely to spend less by building one yourself. There are many ways to save money when building on a budget. If interested, you can read about it  . You donâ€™t need to have a degree in Computer Engineering to be able to on your The knowledge you gain by building your own PC is extremely valuable. Not only it expands your understanding of how the computer works, but it also can come very handy in future. Knowing your way around troubleshooting or part upgrades can save you both time and money. One of the reasons why the sales of mobile devices are soaring is their extremely short lifespan. Whether it gets old too quickly or breaks, your options of upgrade or repair are very limited or non-existent. You might not even think about what happens to that thing you drop into a recycling container on your way to the store for a new one, but it surely doesnâ€™t magically become completely harmless for the planet. Custom build computers, on the other hand, are much greener for the environment. Desktop repairs are much easier, and outdated components can always be upgraded, thus increasing the longevity of the custom build PC. As a result, you can use the same computer for years before it will need to be completely replaced, which certainly results in less of them getting buried in the landfill. If you ever purchased a new computer from the manufacturer, you should know what Iâ€™m talking about. Even if you donâ€™t pay attention to the kind of programs you have installed on the computer, you will be reminded of some of them soon enough. Whether it is an annoying pop-up window asking you to continue the trial of the program you never needed in the first place, or the application from the manufacturer you cannot establish the purpose for, most likely, you will end up uninstalling and deleting all the unnecessary software that came pre-installed. When you are building your own computer, you have the power to install only the software you want. Building your own computer with the sole purpose to avoid unnecessary software from the manufacturer may be an overkill, but not having to deal with it in custom build PCs is certainly a pleasant bonus. As if the above mentioned reasons are not enough, you might want to build your own computer just for fun. Just like an exciting, but challenging project, custom build computers bring pride and sense of accomplishment to its makers. Although that might not be the kind of fun that suits everybody, there are many people who do it as much for a journey itself as for the end result.",Aliaksandra L

For a web designer itâ€™s pretty easy to edit the themeâ€™s template and add the code anywhere as per the need, however most of the times WP beginners find it difficult to modify the themeâ€™s files. Generally premium WordPress themes comes with built-in options to quickly add header and footer scripts but most of the free WordPress themes doesnâ€™t come with such kind of options. If you are facing any of the above mentioned issues then this guide can be useful for you as here, we have shared an alternative way of doing the same without even touching the themeâ€™s files. The following tasks require you to add the scripts or code to your themeâ€™s template header or footer â€“ The above mentioned tasks are the most common among WP beginners, however there are numerous things which would require the code or script insertion in header or footer areas of your website. Yes, Scripts and codes can be added to theme directly without using any plugin.Â For adding the code in header â€“ Search for the file   in AppearanceÂ   ThemesÂ   Editor and add the code For adding the code in footer, you may need to modify the   file, which can be found at the same place â€“ AppearanceÂ  Â ThemesÂ  Â Editor.

I know most of the SEO experts wonâ€™t agree to use the plugin for each and every task (More number of plugins slow down your website a bit) but still I recommend these plugins for the beginners and for those, who are using free WordPress themes because, I believe that itâ€™s not a good idea to edit your theme files each and every time you wanna add something.",Chaitanya
09/10/2013,http://comluv.com/blogging-distractions-worst-enemy-ways-defeat/,Blogging Distractions is your worst enemy â€“ Ways to Defeat It - ComLuv,"There is no second thought that distraction stops our blogging growth. If you donâ€™t regain control over certain distractions, your blogging career might end. We bloggers often have to overcome these distractions toÂ achieveÂ our blogging dreams. When teachersÂ give a certain project toÂ bunch of students to write on it, what students do? They Google it. We BloggersÂ canâ€™t afford that luxury. We just canâ€™t copy-paste otherâ€™s work from Google, because we are the one whoÂ contributeÂ to Google and the audience. People use search engines to find required information, if we bloggers donâ€™t provide them unique and valuable information, there is no value being a blogger. Those who underestimate bloggers donâ€™t realize the efforts we put in to produce unique and valuable content. Doing same things every day is easy, but creating different things every day isnâ€™t, For example; writing or blogging. In case you think having a good set of English writing skills are enoughÂ to beÂ a blogger, youâ€™re wrong; you need another major quality â€“ creativity. If you notice majority of bloggers, they all have one common quality; creativity andÂ innovativeÂ thinking. This is what differs us from normal people, be proudÂ to beÂ a blogger. Creativity is essential quality to haveÂ to beÂ successful in blogosphere. It is impossible to produce unique content without creative thinking. However, sometimes we get distracted on certain circumstances. Distraction almost kills our creativity. It is impossible to write with upset mood or in aÂ distractiveÂ environment. The cause of distraction varies from people to people. Iâ€™ve listed out some distractions that pull a blogger off track No matter how hard we try to ignore the society, we still get distracted by them. Especially if youâ€™re a blogger work from home; your neighbors might think youâ€™re jobless. They might irritate you with lots of unnecessary questions. In case youâ€™re a student blogger, your parents and relatives think youâ€™re wasting time on computer. They think their son is going off track. I read someoneâ€™s tweet couple of weeks ago on twitter â€“ â€œ â€ù. This is what I hate the most; our relatives give unnecessary advice and distract us. It is okay that they have some concerns about our future, but they donâ€™t realize that doing something which is against our passion is not right. Here we need a hard degree of patience to overcome this kind of distraction. This type of distraction killsÂ the creativity ofÂ a blogger. Yesterday I read a wonderful quote someone shared onÂ facebookÂ â€“ â€œ How true, isnâ€™t it? We often bother about what others think about us, this only makes our matters worse and we put ourselves in a stressÂ position. So it is better to kick these negative distractions, and follow the persons who support you andÂ encourageÂ you. Try to turn these disadvantages into your benefits. For example; see how I wrote this blog Try to find peaceful environment or workplace; this is important because your surroundings do affect your writings. So try to make your environment as much as peaceful. When you no longer think of new ideas to write on, youâ€™ll get distracted, youâ€™ll stress out. Even if you write something, it feels like it is inferior. According to Wikipedia; writerâ€™s block is a documented problem throughout history, it can make a professional writer feel like his work is unsuitable. In this situation, best thing to do is â€“ taking a break. And try to read other blogs and books. If youâ€™re struggling with writerâ€™s block, take a long leave and stop thinking about writing, it can only make things worse. Travelling might also help you to overcome this distraction, since you meet new people and change in environment also helps a bit. And you donâ€™t have to always depend upon books or blogs to find new ideas to write on; ideas can strike from anywhere, while walking, taking shower or while doing nothing. If you over-think, it wonâ€™t be benefited. Be blank and ideas will strike. First thing I do when I get up from the bed is checkÂ facebook, often days thereâ€™ll be an inspirational status message from Neil Patel. It boosts me a bit, and then I check twitter and my emails. And later I check twice or thrice in a day. Thatâ€™s it. I used to waste lot of time onÂ facebook, but since the day I started taking blogging seriously, I stopped it because I was procrastinating unnecessarily. The wasted time is gone forever and it never returns. â€œ â€ù â€“ A.W.Tozer Facebook and other social networks are major cause of distraction for bloggers. Of course it is useful to drive traffic to our blogs, Iâ€™m not denying it. When I tried to figure out the possibilities for my slow blogging progress, I found out social networks are the main culprits. I couldâ€™ve written more guest posts, I couldâ€™ve invested more time on blog commenting etc. Yes, I agree, we useÂ facebookÂ to chat and have fun.Â  But if youâ€™re wasting more time, it is better toÂ minimizeÂ it. And no, you canâ€™t ignore social media completely in this Panda, Penguin and Hummingbird algorithm era. What Iâ€™m saying is it is better to cut off these social media distractions while writing blog posts. Television is another worst enemy for bloggers; I used to watch every cricket match and other sports on TV. Now I realized the drawbacks of it; it is just waste of time. However, it is not bad to watch TV on weekends for some relaxing. Of course watching TV is entertaining, but if you want toÂ achieveÂ something, you have to sacrifice something. It is a simple logic. In case you have games on your computer, then youâ€™re not yet serious about blogging. Computer games are anotherÂ distractiveÂ time-killing thing for bloggers. Delete them. I found these are the main distractions that pull a blogger off track, avoiding these distractions is necessary toÂ achieveÂ your blogging dreams. Initially it might be little difficult to change certain things which youâ€™re addicted. However it is not impossible, you can change certain things before it gets out of hand. What is your main blogging distraction? Did I miss any? Do let me know your opinion in the comment section. [ ]",Adithya Shetty
08/10/2013,http://comluv.com/workflow-automation-can-business/,Workflow Automation: What It Is and What It Can Do for Your Business - ComLuv,"We live in a world that operates on autopilot â€“ the earth spinning in its orbit 24 hours a day, and revolving around the sun 365 days a year, unless itâ€™s a leap year. The average corporate busybody survives a workday comprised of routine tasks â€“organizing files and documents from varied sources, creating charts, graphs and other reports from spreadsheets spanning several different departments, reviewing and approving budgets, expense requests and invoices, resolving IT helpdesk issues â€“ the list can go on and on. Repetition may be the mother of learning, but repetition, too, is the father of boredom that then morphs into errors, mistakes, rework, missed deadlines, canceled contracts, and top talent leaving for life-work balance. Some things are better accomplished by a live person, and some others left automated. A workflow, according to  , is the sequence of tasks required to arrive at a desired outcome, usually involving multiple stages and participants. In todayâ€™s business landscape where software utilization is the industry norm for streamlining business processes and operations, automating or managing a workflow entails investing in an application thatâ€™s either   â€“ both, meaning, the software, like Comindware Tracker, comes with pre-built templates that can also be tweaked according to your specific business needs, eliminating steep learning curves or complex programming know-how. When  , you first have to design a workflow model. The software then takes care of task tracking and administration while providing real-time visibility to all involved parties. This eliminates the need for constant status meetings or project updates just so everyone is in the loop, among many other things. Aside from not chasing your staff away with boring, repetitive work, here are some of the benefits of workflow automation: In the job site, individual processes are becoming obsolete. Jobs are now better accomplished by teams. Big tasks are broken down in smaller chunks and distributed to team members for faster and easier execution. Team collaboration, therefore, is essential. Team collaboration, as you are probably aware, If every task is done right the first time, workflows and projects progress swiftly and smoothly, which, in turn, leaves room for more tasks to be accomplished. If every task is tracked and accounted for, redundancies are eliminated, freeing more staff to do other value-adding activities. Imagine having to go through various files, documents and spreadsheets to secure the raw data you need for a report spanning, say, twelve quarters. Thatâ€™s three years worth of data. If these are scattered across inboxes, hard drives, and stacks and stacks of manila folders, the report is going to take you a good bit of time to complete. Automating your workflows allows you the benefit of a single repository, making your data search a relative breeze. For a project or department manager, knowing the status of tasks assigned to his/her team as they happen is a must. Real-time visibility allows him/her to determine whether or not deadlines will be met on budget and according to specifications. With knowing comes the power to devise mitigating actions, if needed, to ensure that everything goes as planned. Through workflow automation, you get a central dashboard that provides managers this level of visibility. Further, built-in but customizable charts, graphs and templates make reports generation relatively instantaneous. If you have top-notch database management, plus an efficient reporting tool, discovering best practices and areas for improvement doesnâ€™t have to mean jumping through hoops. The ever-growing prominence of Web 2.0 applications has empowered customers in ways unheard of decades ago. Using role-based access controls (RBAC), you can grant your customers access to information that will help them better understand your products and processes, and a platform that affords them the chance to air their views that can, in turn, help you better what you offer. Your supplier/vendor partners can similarly be allowed access to data that concern them, speeding up transactions entered into with them. Businesses, big or small, are continually finding ways to cut down on costs. Errors, reworks and whatnot do not obviously contribute to this goal. Having a reliable software solution in place saves you not just time but the added cost of having to redo erroneous tasks that, if not spotted at the earliest possible instance, may cause your business to lose more money by failing to meet deadlines. Automation may sound a tad too mechanical, if youâ€™re all for personalization. But if youâ€™re to survive in todayâ€™s business landscape, streamlining routine processes to maximize your resources sometimes is a no-brainer.",Maricel Rivera
07/10/2013,http://comluv.com/googles-new-guidelines-help-digital-publishers/,How Google's New Guidelines Help Digital Publishers - ComLuv,"Say â€œGoogleâ€ù to a website owner, and you might get get a reaction as though youâ€™d said â€œboo.â€ù In the last few years Google has rolled out a number of impactful updates that have changed the face of their search results pages. People who prospered on the backs of Google for years have found themselves facing lean times. Google doesnâ€™t want to display certain kinds of sites any more, and it is becoming increasingly aggressive in removing them from its index. Yet digital publishers have little to worry about. A well-run and well-managed digital publication might actually benefit from these new guidelines. Because they trade in quality information, and donâ€™t merely use content to point people towards commercial ventures, they remain purer in Googleâ€™s eyes. High quality digital publishers got a boost in 2011 when Google released its  . Algorithm updates were nothing new to Google; theyâ€™d deployed many in the past that had nuked a huge number of sites they considered spammy. But nothing hit quite as hard as Panda. Except for a number of mistaken instances, this was quite a boon for digital publishers who wanted to rank for Google queries. The main purpose of Panda was to root out thin content. If you can remember back to before the Panda update, you might remember searching for a certain topic and seeing a number of related, but extremely poor, results. Some might give you a bit of your answer, others might try to get you to buy something via an affiliate link. The solution was to search in Google News, which can be just as flooded with results. Once those thin-content sites, ones that offered no value through content, were eradicated, digital publishers started ranking higher for queries related to their content. Google has now built Panda into its algorithm, so it will continuously purge these low-quality results, handing the advantage back to the publishers that create quality content. Whenever Google rolls out an update, it notes the number of queries it affects. Typically this is a very low number, perhaps 2-3 percent of queries. Of course, given the sheer volume Google experiences every day, the actual number of queries affected is very high indeed. With their Penguin update, which targets link schemes and low-quality linking, Google has most greatly affected commercial searches. That can be good news for information publishers. Thatâ€™s not to say that digital publishers have completely avoided Googleâ€™s wrath here as they did with  . Many digital publishers were led down the dark passages of SEO and paid firms to obtain thousands of spam links. The driving idea behind the latest Google updates is to clean up search results that were once dominated by content-thin sites that exist only to make money via affiliate referrals. If your site makes money selling its own products, such as conferences, or works just off various ad revenues, then you have little to fear. You will find that those sites are affected far less frequently, and that they are easier to recover when penalized. Not only has Google worked to remove low-quality content from its index, it has also started working to promote higher quality content. This goes beyond the basic snippets that you see with typical searches. Those provide information about a website, or perhaps a quote from the content that is relevant to the search query. Yet sometimes it is difficult to discern the type of content lies beyond that link. With a new feature, Google has given even more power to digital publishers. For many broad searches, you can now find a section called  . It appears at the bottom of the first results page, so these links do not appear in premium real estate. Nor is there any way to click and find more in-depth articles. It seems that each section is limited to three for the time being. Yet to be in that three can lead to a great uptick in search traffic. A listing in the in-depth section sends a particular signal to users, which can lead to not only more clicks, but clicks from people who will stay on your website. Why have publishers, for the most part, withstood the avalanche of Google updates? While there are many reasons, the one that stands out involves commercial intent. When Google issued these updates they were clearly targeting a certain types of sites, the kind that exist solely to sell you something, usually through a third party. While there is sometimes value in that, people would prefer their search results to send them directly to the merchant. Since much competition has been wiped, and since Googleâ€™s rules are much clearer now than they have ever been in the past, current digital publishers can start taking advantage of the new frontier and find new ways to monetize their sites. Implementing affiliate codes, for instance, is much easier now that much of the competition has been erased from the Google search results. But thatâ€™s just one advantage. Digital publishers can engage in a more natural form of SEO, which many are now calling inbound marketing. Many digital publishers do this quite naturally, by sending the right signals. Now they can take advantage by starting to sell products of their own. Itâ€™s easier than ever to   with services like Intuit, so commercialization naturally follows. And letâ€™s be honest: almost all digital publishers are looking for ways out of the typical CPM ad scheme. If that means selling products to end users, we should look at it as an opportunity for change.",Joe Pawlikowski

You have to be consistent, and create regular content; and your work isnâ€™t even done once youâ€™ve created that blog post because now you have to go and share it to your social media profiles. If youâ€™re tired of feeling like your blog posts get written and then immediately disappear into the Webâ€™s either, here are a few ideas for new ways to help you get more attention on social media sites and bring in more readers to your blog. This may seem obvious, but itâ€™s worth saying because thereâ€™s always more you can do to generate chatter around your content. If you want people to pay attention to your blog, you have to give them a reason to. Encourage visitors to leave comments â€” and then actually respond to them!

If you want to give your current readers a reason to share your content to their personal profiles, you can encourage them with a  . The Internet is vast, and even if you run a niche blog there are almost certainly other blogs out there tackling the same topic. You might have a unique aspect to your site, and a little competition isnâ€™t a bad thing, but having a â€œme vs. themâ€ù mentality doesnâ€™t help anyone. If youâ€™re producing content within a specific industry, a success for someone else is a success for everyone, because it brings more attention to your field. Reach out to other blogs over social media, promote other people who are creating similar content by sharing their work (theyâ€™ll probably promote you in return), and work together to create new, interesting content. Bloggers (and any kind of online business for that matter) tend to get stuck on the major social media sites like Facebook and Twitter â€” and thatâ€™s pretty much where their online marketing plan ends. There are obvious benefits to being on Twitter and having a Facebook page, but if youâ€™re looking to remain relevant, you should go where the crowds are. New social networking sites are popping up all the time, and new trends in blogging are worth your time. The more you can   and experiment with creating new kinds of media, the more likely that unfamiliar people will stumble across your blog.

Experiencing a rewarding feeling of accomplishment that comes with two bonuses â€“ expanded knowledge of technology and a computer customized to your needs â€“ is priceless. The only price tag you will end up with is the one for the computer parts. More good news for PC builders: contrary to what most people believe, you can actually save money by building your own computer. However, you have to do it the right way. Here are some tips to help you save money next time you decide to  . If you are looking to save money on computer parts for your build, chances are, you wonâ€™t have the convenience of picking them up from one place that same day. Every experienced builder will agree that, more often than not, in order to avoid overpaying for some parts, you need to spend some time looking for the best deal. Because there are quite a few parts you will need to pick up, chances are, you wonâ€™t find all the best priced items in one place. Just a few of my favorite places to check out for products on sale: Amazon, Newegg, TigerDirect, Fryâ€™s Electronics, Best Buy, Micro Center, NCIX. Just when you are done hunting for the best price, you might find that you have one too many different places to order from. While you can save money by ordering parts from different sources, do not forget to take shipping into account to check if you still have a good deal. Sometimes it can be a good idea to ask if the retailer is offering to match the price of the competitor, even if you donâ€™t see any statement on the web site. It is always worth asking, you just might save yourself some money and hassle. It ridiculous how much money some customers miss out on just because they are too lazy to mail those rebates in. You are about to build a computer with your own hands, and figuring out how to mail the rebate in is too complicated? Really? Very often the retailer or the manufacturer will offer two or more computer components in a bundle for cheaper than when sold separately. Sometimes there is an option to buy a barebones kit, which is just a set of all the necessary picked out for you components to build a PC. Although you might score a great deal, make sure that you are completely happy with the choice of parts. Many of those kits are great to practice building your first PC or assembling a basic system. Very often it will be about the same quality as an average PC that you can buy prebuilt, but you would need to put this one together yourself, so pay attention. The CPU and motherboard combos are more popular. Without going into endless debate over which is better â€“ Intel or AMD â€“ for those looking to save some money on a custom build PC, it is a good idea to give preference to AMD. With a great variety of CPUs, motherboards, graphics cards, paying less for AMD doesnâ€™t have to equate to getting less. I have personally met many AMDâ€™s loyal customers who swear by the quality of the brand. If you have always been on the other side, this is your chance to give it a try, and save money too. If you are looking to save cash but still want to get the performance level hardware, try to plan ahead. Decide which components have to be purchased right now to have the system up and running, and what parts can be added or upgraded in future. Components like additional graphics cards for SLI/Crossfire, extra hard drives for a RAID, SSDs, interface cards are not always a must have in the very beginning. It may be a good idea to postpone purchasing those until they go on sale, or you have more money saved up. It is crucial to know what the future PC is going to be primarily used for, because sometimes this is what really determines whether you will save money by building a computer or not. A lot of users are becoming accustomed to staying connected wherever they are, so the sales of mobile devices such as laptops, tablets, hybrids are up. In order to lure the customer into acquiring or upgrading a desktop, the manufacturers have to offer a great deal. The most popular kind of desktop is an average PC for home and office designed to perform non-challenging tasks.

23/09/2013,http://comluv.com/blogging-ruined-social-life/,Has Blogging Ruined Your Social Life? - ComLuv,"It is the desire of every blogger to succeed in whatever niche he finds himself. This is a conscious thought that keep the feet of bloggers firm in an attempt to ensure that success is guaranteed and maintained. Time and enormous resources are sacrificed to make sure our blog hits levels of previously unseen heights. This isnâ€™t bad as all successes are accompanied by various degrees of sacrifices. But when our social life is sacrificed a lot of things can go wrong. Blogging is great and so much has been said about it, but there are only a few articles talking about how you can manage your blog and your social life. A blogger who spends too much time on the PC is likely to be faced with depression and lose more real friends. Your entire world can be turned around if you fail to manage blogging and social life effectively. As a blogger, you know you are loosing or have altogether lost your social life if; Managing your social life means creating a system. A S.Y.S.T.E.M is basically anything that Saves You Stress, Time, Energy and Money. It will let you blog like a pro and not impede on your social life. I have lost count of how many real friends have become total strangers to me because of my desire to make blogging work. I could also recount how embarrassed I was when female folks keep complaining that I am not romantic :). All I think about is blogging and anyone against this thought was an automatic enemy. I was almost consumed with depression after several failed attempt in six years to make blogging work. I had ruined my social life and it was more demanding to regain it. I have achieved considerable success and I am will to let you know how. The first thing I will need you to do is to pick up your phone and call a few friends, inform them of your desire to schedule a visit. Set a date each for each of your friends and make sure you fulfill all of it. Do not take a Notebook along with you because you are not going to discuss blogging, you are strictly and simply going to hang out and probably visit one or two places to engage your sights. I know you can argue that fun is fun. You are wrong, I love you but you are wrong. The real Fun is not screaming over a hilarious comment on your blog, fun is when your physical body reacts with your physical environment. A lot of bloggers seriously aspiring for success and pro-bloggers in the likes are single and the only reason this is so is because they have made blogging a soul mate. But in truth, your blog canâ€™t quench your emotions, you need someone to be there who would share in your pains and help you solve your hearts burning desire. I have seen a few female bloggers who are successful but continue to live in depression despite the money that constantly enters the bank account. A soul mate can really do a lot. I donâ€™t have one yet but I am seriously searching. _Ÿ˜€ This is one of my favorite; you know it can be frustrating spending an entire week researching an article and once published, you put your faith into thinking that everyone would love it. Unfortunately, the reverse is the case, your readers donâ€™t seem to care and the interaction is lower than usual. I know that feeling I have been there severally, it can be really frustrating, and can cause depression as well. How do you overcome this? Shut down your PC, turn on your gaming console and TV, engage your self in game mode.Â  Put on some rock music too. That should help. If you spend a considerate amount of time on the internet, you canâ€™t ignore  . These exercises go a long way in improving your health status. Blogging, if not properly managed can do more harm than good, it is best practice to know a prevention than searching for solutions to problems. Making new friends in a gym is important. You need to care more about humanity, make new friends and show sincere effort into knowing what their life aspiration is. In few months, I have had a couple of new â€œrealâ€ù friends. One of the guys talk so much of cars and driving; at first it was boring listening but a conscious effort not to make him look bad propelled me into incredible knowledge of cars. I have equally shared some of my experiences on the blogosphere with him. Itâ€™s fun. Seriously. After re-evaluating my life, I realized I had started receiving less calls from friends because I never remembered to call them. Friends will stop calling once you donâ€™t reciprocate the gesture. A lot of things were going wrong, feeling depressed when I see a dip in traffic and all that. I spent almost my entire life every day on my blog(s). And then, something happened. I wanted to go for a party and I realized I didnâ€™t have anyone to call. I was just like, WDF!. Immediately, I started to find ways to balance my social life and my blog, I started working with time management and thus far the progress has been tremendous without negative effects on my blog. Now, I really love to read your experiences and how do you see the social aspect of your life in an attempt to be a successful blogger. _Ÿ™‚",Nosa Ero Nosa

21/09/2013,http://comluv.com/get-respect-work-lesson-ink-master-tattoo-artist/,"Get Respect At Work Lesson From ""Ink Master"" Tattoo Artist - ComLuv","Putting your reputation on the line to earn the title of â€œInk Masterâ€ù tattoo artist is a high-profile way to get respect at work. The â€œInk Masterâ€ù competition features 16 top tattoo artists vying for a $100,000 prize plus an editorial in â€œInkedâ€ù magazine. The winner is entitled to all the honor and respect of being bestowed with the coveted title of Ink Master. With that much at stake, tension runs high when itâ€™s time for the artists to complete a challenge to determine whether they can stay in the competition or not. The people receiving the tattoos are referred to as â€œhuman canvasesâ€ù. A recent segment of Spike TVâ€™s â€œInk Masterâ€ù reality TV show featured a battle between Canvas Natalie and her tattoo artist,  . If this situation had taken place in Jamesâ€™ familiar surroundings, at his shop and speaking with a client, Canvas Natalie would probably have been shown the door much earlier. Clients have to be pleased with the permanent tattoo on their skin. Not being able to agree on the design is a clear indication to move on. Respect for your client and respect for the artist have to be balanced before any skin is exposed. Artist James was in for a challenge when he met the woman assigned to him. Within a time limit, each artist was to design a phoenix tattoo, get agreement from their human canvas and apply the tattoo. The conversation between James and Canvas Natalie didnâ€™t start off well. Tension was high during the design phase. The partnership deteriorated in the moments leading up to the starting bell. Without a level of confidence, neither the canvas nor the artist was willing to continue. Basically, that left James Danger with no one to tattoo. He ended up being sent home. What could James have done differently to calm Canvas Natalie down? At one point, his hands were shaking. Bad sign for a man about to start a tattoo. Shaking hands indicate emotional upset. Canvas Natalie made no effort to stop her bullying and belittling behavior. It was obvious she had taken control of the situation when she questioned whether she could trust James to tattoo her. At that point, the game was over for James. Natalie did not accept his design. She showed no respect for Jamesâ€™ ability to complete a tattoo. Natalie wanted a tattoo that she would be satisfied to live with for the rest of her life. It wasnâ€™t going to happen with James. There was nothing he could have done. Even tough-looking tattoo artists like James Danger Harvey have trouble handling bullies. When someone launches an attack from a position of safety, knowing that you canâ€™t attack back, thatâ€™s called bullying. In this case, Canvas Natalie demonstrated her lack of respect by becoming combative, verbally advancing on James.Â  She reminded me of a fighter throwing punches. Instead of partnering with her tattoo artist, Canvas Natalie acted like James was her opponent. James, did his best to defend himself. He fought back (verbally) as best he could. But finally, he gave up and said, â€œMaybe Iâ€™m not the tattoo artist for you.â€ù James could have chosen to go toe-to-toe, exchanging verbal strikes with Natalie. But why? He was already caught in her trap. He remained as professional as possible and kept his integrity. Here is the video link to watch the battle   Ink Master: Elimination Tattoo: Phoenix: Part II Whatâ€™s the best way to handle this kind of â€œno respect at workâ€ù confrontation? People like Canvas Natalie are never going to be happy with you or respect your work. Minimize the time you spend with dominating people like Natalie. Have you ever been in a situation like this? How have you handled it?",Cheryl Ragsdale
20/09/2013,http://comluv.com/exercise-lower-stress-levels/,Exercise to Lower Your Stress Levels,"Youâ€™ve probably heard it countless of times before â€” you can get a lot of benefits from exercising, and one of these benefits is reduced stress. However, if you and millions of other people know the beneficial effects of exercise, then why are there still so many people who are stressed out, dealing with fatigue, and are developing all sorts of diseases? We know the solution (exercise), so why are we still where we are now? Itâ€™s simple. We know whatâ€™s good for us and what weâ€™re supposed to do, but we choose not to do it. You wonâ€™t find the experts disagreeing on this statement: Exercising is the best way you can manage stress. This is pure, simple fact. Many studies have been conducted to prove that exercise helps to relax the mind and body, improve cardiovascular system, burn fat, bring more oxygen into the body, lower risk of developing diseases, reduce blood pressureâ€_ the list goes on. When your body is experiencing stress, many chemical reactions happen in anticipation to the â€œfight or flightâ€ù response. In prehistoric times, man either responded to stress (e.g., an animal attacking) by either running away from it or fighting it in order to survive. Today, however, weâ€™re bombarded by different kinds of stress, and while we donâ€™t need to fight off a tiger or a bear, we canâ€™t right off the bat burn off our stress or negative emotions. Many of us tend to bottle up these emotions, and doing so creates a host of physical, mental, and emotional problems. If you find yourself irritable, worried, anxious, depressed, hostile, angry, or frustrated, turn to exercise. You can use exercising to let out these negative emotions. Whack that ball as hard as you can with your tennis racket, run a few extra laps around the track if it will help you feel better, or perhaps hit that punching bag a wee bit harder this time. When you exercise, you allow your body to take control of that fight or flight response and regain its balance. Exercise has also been found to improve a personâ€™s self-esteem. If youâ€™re more energetic and looking more fit, youâ€™re more confident to face people and be in a more social situation. You know you look good so you have more confidence in yourself.   to find out some other great reasons of why you should exercise. Walking, swimming, running, and cycling are considered forms of  . They all use the major muscle groups. Aerobic exercise promotes a stronger cardiovascular system. It does this by increasing your heart rate and bringing more oxygen into your body. In order for you to maximize the benefits that can be had from aerobic exercise, make sure you exercise at 60% to 80% of your target heart rate for 20 minutes or more. Do this three to five times per week. So whatâ€™s your target heart rate? To compute for your target heart rate, subtract your age from 220 and multiply the result by .6 or .7 (60% or 70% intensity). The resulting figure is your target heart rate per minute. Divide that by 6 to find out your 10-second pulse count. If you want to lose weight, youâ€™ll want to do aerobic exercise because it burns the calories. Make sure you stick to a healthy diet and youâ€™ve got a recipe for success. A pound of body fat is the equivalent of 3,500 calories. So in order to lose a pound, you need to burn at least 3,500 calories. Anaerobic exercise, on the other hand, promotes muscle strength and power. There are two kinds of anaerobic exercise:  . Isotonic exercise makes use of your muscles to contract against an object by way of movement. Another name for isotonic exercise is resistance training or strength training. Weight lifting is a form of isotonic exercise. Isotonic exercises promote stronger bones and muscles. It also promoted better tone, prevents injuries, and shapes and sculpts the muscles. Isometric exercise, on the other hand, is the opposite of isotonic: it involves contracting the muscles against resistance minus the movement. An example of isometric exercise is lifting a dumbbell and holding it in a position. Youâ€™re essentially isolating a particular muscle. To maximize your strength and build muscles that are strong, lean, and healthy, do both isotonic and isometric exercises. Perform exercises you like and you can do for a minimum of 20 minutes for at least 3 time a week. Five times a week of exercising is recommended. You donâ€™t necessarily have to hit the gym each time. Exercising can simply be walking around the block or dancing for half an hour. The key here is to make sure youâ€™re active. If youâ€™re just starting out, make a commitment to exercise for 21 straight days. Twenty-one days is how many days, according to research, it will take you to get into a habit of doing something. So try exercising for 21 days. At the end of 21 days, see how you feel. In terms of your stress levels, how stressed do you feel. Your stress levels are most likely to be lower. Youâ€™ll also feel like you have more energy than ever before, and youâ€™ll notice a change, no matter how slight it is, in how you look.",monsy

It is essentially very important for   If you are going to start your blog, then I would suggest you to pic a unique and original name. The one with some meaning and some value to it. There are many big names like mashable, techcruch, plentyofish, shoemoney and many more. Consider registering .com domain (Get a cheap domains and hosting at  ). If for some reasons it is not available, you can go for .org or .net website. There are many famous blogs/website which have .org and .net extensions. Having a domain name which is short, memorable, easy to spell, meaningful and off course on the topic. It is not that hard task to find a name matching this criteria. Competition is really tough out there. It will help you to compete with millions of blogs. Niche of your blog is really important and a key factor. I always recommend people to go to unique content and write original article. We are talking about the niche of the blog/website. If you are passionate about something you must write about it. Many time I saw people are making there site multi-topic. Even big sites are not doing that. I am sorry I am not judging you but focusing on single topic can be easy rather than several topic. If you have a team of writers with you . You must do it. Big sites like tech cruch, mashable, gigaom, Problogger , lifehacker are single topic. They publish article on single topics. Having specific topic blog can help you target users. You can also perform good SEO and you might So if you planning to launch a blog. Stick to the single topic. Donâ€™t go for multi-niche site. Beside that I would suggest for creating a separate site for that. Moving on to the next topic. There is a saying that â€œfirst impression is the last impressionâ€ù. But people usually donâ€™t take it seriously. It is the common thing which is consider to judge a blog. If you have a fantastic theme, professional logo and nice way of content presentation. I am sure people gonna like it. If we take the example of some big brands they have everything so perfect. Layout , design, logo, content presentation everything is so perfect. It is like a picaso painting you can stare for hours. Go for a premium theme. There might be thousands of blog running on the same theme. Tweak you theme , play with colors , may be change the fonts. It is not because you are obnoxious but you are doing it because you want to stand out of the crowd. Use your logo on social media sites. Facebook fan page, twitter, pinterest, google +. If you have newsletter use your own font and logo for better presence. There are many ways to promote your blog through social media, commenting , guest posting, forum posting and many more. Where social media will help you in connecting targeted audience. You can ask your friends to follow, like and subscribe to your blog.

It is the easiest way to build authority for your blog. You gain the attention of both blog admin and blog users. This is the proven way to gain some traffic to your blog.

As parents, we want the best for our children, but trying to convince them that should eat vegetables because they are good for you, will only fall on deaf ears. They donâ€™t care if the food that they eat is healthy, they just want it to taste good! The earlier we start introducing our kids to different varieties of veggies the more receptive they will be to eating them later on in life. Here a few ways to encourage your kids to eat more of the good foods that their bodies need, to develop and function the best that they possibly can. Kids love to be given important jobs to do, so helping them to   and giving them the responsibility of watering it, is a great way for them to not only learn about nature, but also to gain an interest in vegetables. If they have watched them grow, they are more likely to want to eat them! Or at least try them. A big pile of boring veggies isnâ€™t appealing to most adults, let alone kids. Cutting them into bite sized pieces or sticks, makes them easier for little mouths to eat. Cookie cutters are a great way to cut veggies into fun shapes that kids canâ€™t resist. Something as simple as adding some extra flavours to vegetables can make a huge difference to the way kids feel about them. Bacon or garlic are a fantastic way to add more flavour. Why not give them a yummy sauce to dip them in? Ranch dressing is quite popular with kids because of its creamy texture. Or for a healthier option try hummus! As frustrating as it can be getting our children to eat their vegetables, try not to force the issue or bribe them with dessert, in an attempt to get them to eat them. This will build on the negative opinions they already have about veggies and will make the whole process harder. Keep it fun and light and you will be amazed at how adventurous their little taste buds will become!",karengodfrey

Recently, we have seen that Sony is also working in this regard and have introduced Xperia Z Ultra with a whooping 6.4 inch display. It went out to be a great success for the company and now we heard multiple news about new Sony device named Xperia i1 Honami. According to the news, the device will be launched later this year. Well we havenâ€™t heard anything officially from Sony itself regarding the Xperia i1 specs but according to the news and resources, following is a compact list of things Xperia i1 will have at the time of launch One might ask why need to buy this one when you have a lot more other options in the market available. Well, we cannot compare it with every other set in the market but following is a quick review of what this beastly Xperia i1 will have in stores for you Unlike any other device, Xperia i1 will have a 20MP camera with G Lens that is being used by Sony in their mainstream digital cameras. The device will also have a focal length of 1/2.3â€ù that is great for close up shoots. You just cannot estimate the power of the Snapdragon 800 coupled with the 2GB of RAM. The device is a mighty beast in its category and can literally play all apps without any lag or distortion. The onboard Andreno 330 GPU also gives additional power to the mobile to play graphics hungry games without any lag or slow speed. This is one of the biggest things to note in the new Xperia i1 Honami. There is hardly a mobile phone having a 5 inch display with a 3000 mAh battery. Clearly this indicates that Sony also focused on the need of people who want to play games on the large screen of their smartphone while not worrying about the battery being drained out. We have seen wonders of the BRAVIA Engine 1 in earlier sets from Sony and we saw how it changed the viewing angles to a dramatic cinema like experience while watching movies and videos etc. BRAVIA Engine 2 is promised to bring even more performance boost and will clearly outclass any other smartphone in this category. If you are full multimedia user, who likes to play games, listen to occasional music or even watch movies on their smartphone, then Xperia i1 Honami is the perfect fit for them. A device of this caliber is hard to come by and when it comes, you should quickly grab it before time runs out. Sony Xperia i1 Honami is due to be launched on September 4 in Germany.",SAJID

However, there are many bloggers who are doing this absolutely the wrong way and that isnâ€™t very good indeed. Still puzzled and have no idea what are the advantages of commenting on other blogs? Hereâ€™s a list of them: Seeing the above, I bet they sound great for your blogging career right? As a blogger, you would always want to be known as a very supportive blogger and there is no better way than leaving comments on other blogs. Here are 6 tips or guidance when it comes to becoming a good commenter. This is one of the biggest mistakes I ever seen in this blogging industry. I saw so many bloggers leaving comments just to get backlinks. Comments are meant to be constructive and personalized instead of â€œHi, thank you for your comment and byeâ€ù. Talk to the blogger and give him or her some of your insights. It doesnâ€™t matter if you hate it or like it. Just tell them what you think. Leaving a poor comment doesnâ€™t only reduce your credibility as a blogger but also increase the chances of being labeled as spam. If you are thinking of leaving a comment, make sure you are leaving a constructive one instead. Avoid commenting in less than 10 words. You are not required to leave a comment that has like 100 words long but at least, make sure you leave some quality insight about the article. Personally, I try my best to leave at least two paragraphs per comment given. Bear in mind that leaving an overly long comment could easily make readers lose interest in the topic. Very short comments usually show to others that you are (most likely) looking for a backlink and that isnâ€™t good for your reputation. Furthermore, short comments donâ€™t leave much of a discussion too. Have you ever come across an article that is valuable to you?

Relevant content that relates to what you sell is essential for content marketing and the content must educate people so that they know, like and trust your business.

If you have been blogging for some time now and need to   this post will help you discover 6 ways to supercharge your blogging career right now! While the blogosphere is getting bigger day by day, there is the need to stand out among the masses of bloggers and writers by sounding a voice thatâ€™s big enough to be heard. Today, I am happy to be associated with bloggers who have defined what they want and pledge to keep sharing what works for them and not just some generic thoughts which goes into a recycle process. I would like you to ride with me as I unveil  which you can start applying right now to supercharge your blogging career: Sorry to say this, but itâ€™s a fact. Most bloggers are still locked up in their cubicle because they are robot oriented (programmed to act only when asked to). The days of robot blogging (folding your arms and waiting for things to happen) are gone; today itâ€™s creating and pushing what you have created towards the BIGGER PICTURE. If you must break out of that cubicle which has been stopping you from excelling as a blogger, you must say no to robot oriented blogging and start creating. Creativity is productivity! Pause for a moment and ask yourself this question: What new ways can I add value to my blog? (Hint: Think of one common thing every other successful blogger is doing and find new ways of doing it better using a new technique other than the traditional method) The new method you employ may sound stupid at first but thatâ€™s what I call being creative and with time if you are true to your course it will stand you out. Youâ€™ve chosen blogging as a career and so do it with pride! Let some passion into your blogging activities, that way you will never digress or allow yourself to be pushed to the wall. It doesnâ€™t matter if you started blogging few minutes back. What matters is how prepared and determined you are in terms of becoming a goal getter.   with pride is one way of adding value to yourself and telling the people you write for that you are on top of your game. Above all, blogging with pride will keep you thinking of ways to do new things because you have positioned yourself as an expert and so have to deliver. Sometimes, you need to subject yourself to certain conditions to keep acting as a reminder to your course. This is what I like to call Â â€œwriting for the wants of your audience and not their needsâ€ù It might surprise you if I tell you that I no longer believe in this trendy thought of writing quality content or putting it ahead as a redeemer of your blogging success! I stand to tell you that nothing online today is quality especially when it is seen as a standard. What we read today are all generic content (content already written but worked on again to bring out new meanings still pointing to one thing). If you ask me, the only thing I call quality content is a content that is resourceful and helpful, in other words a content which solves the The blogosphere is a community of bloggers filled with talented bloggers. Make yourself known by connecting with the like minds in the community. One better way of connecting with like minds is guest blogging.

If I do what I am doing on Comluv on other bigger blogs in my niche, one thing is for sure, I will be growing a community of readers and at the same time showing off my expertise which at the end of the day positions me for greater achievements. The ideal thing to do has always been never to walk alone; there are brains who started doing what you are doing today for a very long time. Take a chance of connecting with them by writing or  , if you get denied the first time, try again and learn from your mistakes. Itâ€™s worth walking with the like minds in your niche. Whenever the thoughts of giving up come to your mind, remember the words of Stephen Kings: Even though the blogosphere has become a crowded market does not mean you canâ€™t supercharge your career in it. Every now and then, blogs are created and the smart ones with dreams take up the league. When you dream of becoming the best in what you do you make what you do a market where everybody will want to stop by to shop. When I started my blog, I dreamt that in less than 2 months I was going to guest post for the master bloggers   and   and guess what? My dreams paid off! I actually got published in less than 2 months of launching my blog. This is what dreaming BIG can do for you, so give it a shot; itâ€™s a sure way to supercharge your blogging career.

If the owner of any blog is accepting the guest posts this doesnâ€™t mean that he will give his readers bad quality content. Every blogger has a schedule for blogging and because of other work he/she canâ€™t update the blog regularly. So, the guest post is the only way left to regularly provide fresh content to the readers. As I said above all bloggers are having a schedule which they have to follow as they need to do a lot of work which includes â€“ E-mail support, attend meets & conferences,Â  update other blogs or community forums and other projects. They need to make sure that they donâ€™t disappoint their readers as readers are the soul of every blog whether it is new or old.   are mainly for: There are many reasons for the rejection of your guest post on any authority blog that you applied for. As because rejection depends on many terms and today I am going to tell you those reasons that why your   are not accepted after many attempts. You have to know that the blogâ€™s owner for which you do guest post is a kind person. So, the question occurs in your mind is what other things are stopping the blogâ€™s owner in the way of  . You have to understand that every blog has its own guest post rules and regulation which you have to follow in order to get your post accept. If you donâ€™t respect the blogâ€™s guidelines then the admin will straight away reject your guest post but you saidâ€_ why they do this? This happens because the blog for which you are doing guest post is a high authority blog and the owner make day and night equal to stand on that much The reality is that you never read the guest post guidelines and this leads to the quick rejection of your guest post. Most of the bloggers donâ€™t take care of the guidelines and they just do the guest post. The admin doesnâ€™t make a delay of single second to reject your guest post and throw it away in the trash. Remember that any blog for which you are doing guest posting is having a great reputation. Although the owner doesnâ€™t have much time to write content for his audience, but this canâ€™t make him eager to accept your guest post. It is better that any blogger doesnâ€™t update his blog from weeks rather that giving   to his readers. If you write a post full of grammatical errors, wrong phrases, non-understandable language etc. then it is not going to be accepted. If you are thinking like that then you are wrong as admin has enough time to read the entire post carefully. Make sure that you write informative post with quality content which contain good SEO for well rankings. You have to make sure that you write a post which is beneficial for the readers. If you are thinking that you can fool the blogâ€™s admin then you are wrong as every blogger is very smart. If you are a content writer and working for a website to build links backs then your post will not be accepted ever because guest post opportunity is only for bloggers. As one blogger can understand another blogger so, you have to make sure that you donâ€™t link to unwanted websites. Donâ€™t post those links in your guest post otherwise you will not be accepted as a guest author on the blog. This is also a guideline for any blog that you are going to guest post for as no one want spam and junk links to be inserted in his blog. So, what you say about these reasons, these reasons are the main faults that we made while guest posting on other blogs.

Hailed as the land of the Vikings, Swede has a very rich history and culture. Plan a visit during summer or fall and you will be greeted by amazing natural beauty. We do have to warn you though, living in Swedenâ€”even if it is just for a short spellâ€”is definitely not cheap. Luckily for you, we have some tips to help your travel budget go just a little bit further in Sweden. Book your travel as far ahead as you can, because otherwise you will be paying premium price for train and bus tickets. Bus fare will typically set you back $35-50, although it is possible to get bus tickets for only $10 if you book a month or more in advance. If planning ahead is no longer an option and you know that you will be moving around a lot, then buy a rail passÂ  you arrive in Sweden. If you are lucky enough to have friends and family who can welcome you into their homes, go for it. Otherwise, save a lot of pocket money to be able to stay in a prime hotel. Even hostels can be quite pricey in Sweden, starting at around $35 a night for dorm accommodations plus a $6 surcharge for bed linens. Budget hotels cost about $65 per night in a double room and shared apartments donâ€™t really go for much cheaper than that. If you are up for an adventure, try camping; this is free in most spots in the country although there are some parks which charge $8 per night. It might also be worth your while to look into room sharing options. Simple typeÂ   into a search engine to   that you can live with for the duration of your stay. Accommodations are not the only things which cost an arm and a leg. The same goes for food and transportation too. The nicer restaurants which offer sit-down service will generally charge $20 for an entrÃ©e. You neednâ€™t starve though; The Swedish government places heavy taxes on hard liquors so the prices for alcoholic drinks are quite sobering. Luckily, beer is quite cheap at $6 per mug at the local drinking holes. And speaking of drinking, buy a water bottle and just refill it as you go. Tap water in Sweden is potable and there really is no need to throw away $3.50 for every bottle of water. And lastly, if you look forward to visiting Swedenâ€™s museums and tourist attractions, it may be worthwhile to buy a City Tourism card. For a fixed price, the card gives you free access to the majority of the museums and unlimited use of the public transportation system (buses, subways, even ferries). Â The City Tourism card is available at all major destinations in the country. If you intend to stay for a longer duration, like for a week or more, it is wise to invest in a SL card and buy museum passes separately. When packing for Sweden, we strongly remind you to pack comfortable shoes so that you can simply walk or take the subway whenever possible. Trains run 24 hours a day anyway, and you can avoid paying steep cab fares if you really want to. Some of the notable destinations in Sweden include Stockholm, Lapland and the Bohusland Coast. If you are headed up north for an unforgettable experience, you can try staying at the Ice Hotelâ€”which is essentially one giant igloo where everything is made up of frozen water. It features an ice bar and an ice dining room. The guests sleep with big fur blankets placed on top of ice beds.",Ali Asjad

Well today I am taking an imitative to become a responsible blogger and this post is all about blogging withÂ  . Information and technology is developing day by day and everybody is affected by that.Â BloggingÂ term is now familiar to everybody who use computer. There are millions of blog around the world and few of them are actually famous. This is the era of competition. You will find your rival everywhere. If you are a blogger you must understand the term competition. So how can you stand out of the crowd and actually make a good impression on your readers. Well responsibility is all you need. Â with responsibility is essentially very important if you are a blogger. Â is definitely one of the best products of the advancement in IT and Computer Technology. This innovative social media platform seems to be part of every citizen. Â It is very influential especially if the one who blogs is a public figure. You can interact with new people everyday using internet, you are sharing your thought, ideas and points of views. You can build a community. I saw it many times when people start a blog with lost of expectations. They are working really fine in the beginning and doing their work responsibly. Later you start to loose your blog, you are leaving it behind. You got frustrated and left it. I am not saying that blogging is easy but you most know one thing that   is not too hard. Everything requires hardwork and dedication. No one get success over night , you have to push and try everyday. Blogger are making blog and making new links everyday without even thinking of the impact of that particular article on readers.Â Knowing the power of social media nowadays, it can be beneficial or detrimental to other people. Â you can follow some steps to become a potential and responsible blogger. Content is the king. As we all know and I always say that. You content should be unique , genuine and most important verified. If you are giving information about something make sure your information You can optimize your content visibility with the help of SEO. If Content is the king then SEO is the queen for any blog. It is good to write unique and original content. But it does not make any sense if no one is reading it. Readers are the backbone of any blog. It is readers who is responsible for your success of your blog. You cannot simply leave them _Ÿ™‚ Create a good environment around your blog. Answer them and resolve their queries. I have seen many bloggers who has 10-20 comments on their blog post and they didnâ€™t reply to one. If you have pretty much big blog you can not reply to each person. But if someone is genuinely asking something you must respond to him. Many people suggests that it is good to make backlinks for your blog. It will help you gain good PR, good Alexa ranking and eventually drive more referral traffic on your blog. Â So it is great to allow other to create backlinks and help them. Answering their question will create a relation and it is a good thing. Do create a disclaimer and privacy policy for your blog. There are many online Privacy policy generator which can help you. Or you can write one by your self. Keep your blog transparent with sponsored posts and affiliate links for you to gain their trust. If you are going to republish something on your blog. Make sure about their copy right policies. Do not avoid them and keep your blog safe from these. Having transparent blog will help you in getting Adsense approval. Now a days it is hard to get Adsense approval.Â Keep yourself updated with the latest news, events, trends so that you will not be left behind.Â Keep on learning and improving to keep abreast with the stiff competition. Now it is up to you. How you take this advantage and actually turn to a responsible blogger. It will help your blog grow big and perhaps you could make some extra money.Â If you only know how to play the game, you will win more friends, learn more new things, and on top it all, you will earn a lot. If you want to take your   skills to next level.vJust be fair enough and be responsible a blogger.",Ashish Kumar

28/08/2013,http://comluv.com/how-to-and-why-prepare-for-next-summer-now/,How To (and Why) Prepare for Next Summer Now - ComLuv,"Labor day quickly approaches, marking the unofficial end of summer. A few weeks remain, at least as far as the lunar calendar goes, but for most of us Labor Day marks the end of beach trips and half-day Fridays at work. Soon enough the leaves will start changing color, snow will fall, and weâ€™ll all be pining for the days of sun and 90 degree heat. You donâ€™t have to leave summer behind quite yet, though. There are plenty of good reasons to not only enjoy the last passing moments of summer, but also to get your act together for next summer. You know, so that you actually act on the things you say youâ€™re going to do next summer. Everyone wants to throw the summer party that people talk about for the next year. Not only does it give you points with your friends and family, but it makes them want to come back for your future parties. Throwing the perfect summer party takes plenty of planning, so youâ€™ll benefit greatly from starting now. As a bonus, if you set up your house for parties now, you still have the chance to throw one memorably party this summer. Even if itâ€™s not Labor Day weekend, there will still be a few warm weekends in September that are ripe for grilling and outdoor fun. Consider that a precursor to your magnum opus next year. Head to big box retailers and outdoors stores to check out the sales they have going on. Theyâ€™re all marking down nearly every summer item, so there are great deals to be found. This is especially helpful for big-ticket items like   and grills, which can be 50 percent off, or even more, at the end of summer. If you donâ€™t buy those things now, youâ€™ll regret it when you see the price tags for new items next year. Chances are that regret will lead you to hold off on purchasing them, meaning youâ€™ll miss out on your ideal party. At the end of the summer youâ€™ll again see those sales, and again kick yourself for not making those purchases last year. Summer is all about getting away, whether itâ€™s for a few weeks or just a few days. It might be hot and muggy in your town right now, but chances are youâ€™re Yet any kind of summer getaway requires advanced planning. Many vacation spots get booked a year in advance, so if you want to have access to the very best destinations you need to start planning now. Thankfully, with online research it has become easier than ever. Check out travel sites to find   to get a good idea of the hottest destinations. Run further searches for destinations you know you want to try. You probably canâ€™t book online at this point, but with a little googling you can find the best spots and call them to see if theyâ€™re taking 2014 reservations now. The last thing you want is to come up with a great vacation idea only to find that the place is booked up. Jump-starting your planning now also allows you to gather all possible ideas, so youâ€™re not scrambling for something next year. Whether youâ€™re married or single, 20something or pushing 50, you probably want a beach body. Thereâ€™s just something about striding out onto the sand, feeling confident, knowing that few, if any, look better than you do. It is a nearly universal human tradition to, at the conclusion of each summer, vow to enter the next beach season in great shape. Yet so few do it. The problem is that people greatly, egregiously underestimate how much time it takes to transform your body. If youâ€™re 30 pounds overweight, youâ€™re not going to drop that extra flab in the few weeks before your vacation. Worse, it gets even more difficult as you age. The only solution is to start now and hope for the best. In order to make this transformation in about eight months, you have to start with  . Take a few months working on that. Then progress a bit. Once you hit late March or early April, itâ€™s time to go on a beach-body-specific workout plan. At the same time, you have to start eating differently. As they say, abs are made in the kitchen, not in the gym. Because if you donâ€™t do it now, you never will. Itâ€™s really that simple. If you want to avoid guilt next year when you didnâ€™t reach your goal of having a beach body, youâ€™ll start in now and dedicate the next eight months to that goal. Once you know how good it feels, then you can decide if itâ€™s worth all that time and effort for the following year.",Joe Pawlikowski

Look no further than last summer when Martin Lewis, creator of MoneySavingExpert.com and the peoples champion of all things consumer, sold to price comparison website MoneySupermarket for Â£87 million. To stand for peopleâ€™s rights, rather than penny pinching, and being a source of information helped position thisÂ  Â as a trusted consumer powerhouse. No matter what industry you are in, when you understand your marketplace and what they want you are then positioned as a trusted source of information. To keep things in a simple formula: This isnâ€™t about broadcasting A value first landscape is becoming all too apparent. According to Earnest Agency, 72% of B2B buyers are most likely to share useful content via email. The premise is simple, if you provide something to people that is intended to make their lives easier/better/quicker/simpler/happier then the chances of your product being regarded in higher esteem than your competitors is apparent. Providing information that others share is the nirvana that weâ€™re all reaching for and takes customer understanding to a new depth and to strengthen the relationships that weâ€™re looking to build. We all have the ability to produce highly focused information, whether in print or digital format, that targets the needs of customers and prospects with whom you want to build long-term relationships with.

Their hesitation, of course, isnâ€™t without merit. However, in some industries, using mobile devices while on the job actually helps employees get their work done more efficiently and, for wirelessly connected devices, even enhances operational performance. Here are some of the industries to which mobile device usage and connectivity actually serve to enhance business operations: Itâ€™s easy to understand why and how important mobile usage and connectivity is to the shipping and delivery industry. When the main goal is to get packages transported to and from locations, having a connected mobile device on hand (for tracking and swifter communication between parties) helps to ensure customers and bosses that no packages should get lost in transit. In the construction and repairs industry, personnel are frequently being sent to travel to various locations to address a customerâ€™s concerns, resolve a technical issue, perform upgrades or installations, or to do a survey on a particular construction site. With the use of connected mobile devices, staff in the field and the office can communicate, relay information and pertinent work orders Hungry people, especially hungry people that have to wait a long time before they can partake of their meal, are not a happy bunch of customers to explain to when the food they ordered over an hour ago seems to have gone amiss. This might seem like an extreme example, but cases like these make the bulk of complaints addressed to restaurant contact centers. And as usual, the culprit can be traced down to faulty communication between customer and delivery agent. The delivery personnel could have either encountered some significant road blocks, like a) security wonâ€™t let them in a customerâ€™s village compound, b) nobody is answering the door, or c) they simply just got lost. A mobile phone with reliable signal reception can reduce these setbacks, help the delivery personnel relay necessary information and efficiently achieve delivery schedule goals. As the examples above illustrate, not only can access to mobile connectivity be considered a competitive boost to these businessesâ€™ operations, it can actually be seen as a necessity. Mobility, however, can only be effective with a reliable mobile signal, for the phone loses its contribution to business operations if it canâ€™t actually make a decent enough connection to communicate with. Having a consistent and reliable signal is an absolute necessity for industries that engage in mobile business practices. Being reachable to customers, accessible to office staff and workers on the field is a key to avoiding delivery and production delays. And while mobile carriers do everything in their power to give their subscribers the best possible phone signal coverage, when their best just isnâ€™t enough, investing in add-on technologies such as  , especially when your business most needs it, is a sound strategy.",Maricel Rivera

21/08/2013,http://comluv.com/why-your-articles-must-reflect-the-purpose-of-domain-name/,Why your articles must reflect the purpose of domain name! - ComLuv,"Blogging is a vast field. Imagine an internet world having more than 33% of total worldâ€™s population and you are one of them. Internet world literacy rate should be 100% as an illiterate one canâ€™t use how to write a blog or browse the internet. Blogging is one of the most used platforms in the world. People related to different professions use this platform to show what they think, how they think , how they work , what are their expertise, ideas, innovations, creations etc. You may have all the abilities mentioned above but sometimes you may think that there is something from which you are deviating. This something is your domain name! It is very difficult for someone to concentrate on a single purpose but there are many ways to make your belief dismissed. Well there are many reasons that your majority of articles must reflect the purpose of your domain name. Letâ€™s discuss the main points but note that this   is not for those who have multi-niche blog or website. Ultimately your bounce rate will increase if you have no related articles to the domain name. It is just like you have Major Rank in army and you are selling fruits in the market. It shows that an army man is deviating from his purpose. Suppose you have the blog name like techcrunch which is showing that there must be articles related to technology, users visited it and found articles on business, management and travelling, obviously you lose your tech-geek readers, you bounce rate increased and you will be left for the crawlers who donâ€™t care what you are posting. Indeed there will be indexing problems, if your site is all about technology, your sitemap shows the post-format, tags and archives As a blog owner, you need to be a part of specific niche circle in   networks. A technology guy canâ€™t talk in business circle and vice versa. You need your voice heard clear and loud then you need to be a part of your niche circle. Have you ever heard lion romanced a puss? Yes! It is possible if the lion wants to deviate from its purpose that is; meowing instead of roaring. Well it looks awkward. All I want to sayâ€_ ROAR! Otherwise no one will hear you. But hey! Roar in your circle, never do it in otherâ€™s circle. They will flee. I explained it in bounce rate but specifically I want to mention some words on it. Never make your website for bots. The raking which came from your readers canâ€™t be wrong. Digg.com is one of the most used social website for technology, politics, breaking news and entertainment once valued 200million dollars and sells for 50 thousand dollars. Decrease in price may have effect the readers and contributors but still it is one of the top 1000 websites in the world. They achieved their target not by the bots and crawlers but by the readers. They have maintained the purpose since it was born and millions of people still love to visit Digg. As an owner you have to work hard on your domain name purpose. Later on you can recruit editors and contributors which can help you to grow your website. It is not necessary that you have to keep all the data on your website 100% related to your   and description. Suppose you have technology site. Technology has sub-categories like Physics, astronomy, tech news, smart phones, gadgets and reviews etc. We have unlimited categories in every niche. A business site can be used for traveling articles if they are providing hotel reservations and facilities in different countries. The conclusion is, your majority of the site portion must reflect the domain name otherwise read the article once more. Happy Blogging.",Osama Zia

The shiny toys being all the social media platforms that want us to interact, converse, rate, share and be part of. On top of this, many businesses have been created by being self pronounced as a â€˜social media expert.â€™ Lets just stop there, to be an expert takes years of study and practice, to be an expert in a medium that has been around for less than 10 years, is more akin to being a â€˜social media enthusiast.â€™ We still see many instances of Twitter being used as an interruption tool to boast and LinkedIn as a platform to gloat, rather than as mediums to help, advise and add value to their target audiences lives. The problem with communication platforms is not necessarily in what you say, but how you say it. Take a look at the image at the top. Two years ago, QR codes were common usage in all forms of print to direct traffic via a simple reading device to link to a particular online page (just because you could do and it was really easy to get a QR code). This is from this weeks visit to London, where the Northern Line has a tube card advertising contact lenses. Since when were we able to get a 3G signal whilst on the London Underground? Keeping the theme of bad communication, I have also seen a QR Many business owners are not trained and made to understand how to make communication platforms work for them, why should they, if their key strengths are in other areas. To many, it is a case of getting the â€˜toyâ€™ and diving straight in. Sometimes, itâ€™s just the right application and the simplicity of an idea that goes beyond any popular digital platform (where businesses simply blend in with the crowd). Take for example, this message for my local sandwich shop, in Poole, â€˜The Dorset Sandwich Company.â€™ Recently, a very unfortunate accident happened when a car was parked nearby without the hand brake on. The car rolled down the hill and crashed through the sandwich shop window. The damage is clearly evident, where the once pristine shop front window is now replaced by plywood boards. But itâ€™s not the boards thatâ€™s the talking point but the â€˜drive through application rejected, business as usualâ€™ chalk board that is outside the shop. This simple device (a chalk board with a chalk message) has meant that the sandwich shop has received extra exposure from an unfortunate incident from the local press to reading this now on a blog that has a large number of readers and a reach far beyond the local area. Sometimes, itâ€™s not a case of jumping on what youâ€™re told to use because everyone else is, but to embrace the power of an idea.   will always trump conformity, itâ€™s up to us how we deliver our message.",Mark Masters

If you want to stand out from the millions of blogs online today, then it is absolutely essential and important that you think hard before you launch your blog online. If you   only because you think that it is the â€˜coolâ€™ thing to do or because your chosen blog topic is within a â€˜sizzling hot nicheâ€™, chances are you can expect to find yourself faced with a few challenges in the future. It is important to know that being a follower is the quickest way to fail online. Why? Because by following what someone else is doing you may fail to be true to yourself -hence why you are more likely to experience more writers block, a decrease in motivation and an overall sense of apathy after the rush and excitement of   has long gone. If you are planning to start a blog, remember to always be honest, open and transparent â€“ Whatever you do remember to ALWAYS BE YOURSELF. If you try to hide behind a facade that youâ€™ve created (because you think that it is the only way you will succeed online), you risk failing in the long run because you can only play someone that you are not for a very limited amount of time That is of course before people start to call you out on your â€ùactâ€™ or you tire and exhaust yourself entirely from having to putting up a show!

Remember to always structure your blog posts in a way that makes it easy for your readers to navigate and read through your articles. Also remember to spell check and structure your sentences in the proper way. Many   deliver quality with every written post and with any content produced. When people feel as if you are offering them something that they can use and they feel as if it is something that will help them to better themselves or their craft, you are more likely to gain a loyal readership and your content more likely to be shared in social media websites. If anybody who stumbles across your blog feels as if you are just regurgitating unoriginal, useless information that they can easily find elsewhere, -well then, your blog risks losing its credibility and your content can tank in value. What are you known for? Is it your controversial voice? your satirical humor? sly sarcasm? free guides ? etc.  , it is important to find something to offer your readers that will help you to distinguish and set yourself apart from other bloggers in your area of expertise/niche.

13/08/2013,http://comluv.com/top-best-4-free-services-to-share-your-files-easily/,Top Best 4 Free Services To Share Your Files Easily,"Do you want to share some files which are really important to you and want them to securely reach in others hands. This could be any personal or professionals files and documents. To share these kinds of files people usually send email to each but here comes the biggest problem that emails limit the size which means you can not send a larger file to anyone. People have a real hard time searching good file sharing services but I am going to help you by posting a short review of top 4 file sharing services which are worth using and I will give my personal opinion about them. You just need to create your account and start sharing the important data. You give me your comments and recommendations about which service you like in your comments. So letâ€™s start. Google Drive is one of the most popular and best service started on 24  April 2012 with an aim to allow Gmail users to share large files using Google mail service. It provide you with a free 5GB backup and limits the maximum upload size to 10GB. The question is that if we have 5GB space then how could we upload larger files then this. For this they have introduced some additional storage plans at low prices on monthly basis. They offer 25 GB for $2.49 per month, 100 GB for $4.99 per month and up to 16 TB of storage. It alsoÂ has applications for desktop, smartphone and tablets. So this means availability of it is everywhere. Letâ€™s come to the main thing that how can we share files. GDrive only allows you to share through its Web app share files as an email, and can also specify how much access someone has to the file. For example, you can share a file with someone but only let them view it not edit it. To access Google Drive it is must to have an account with Gmail. Secondly, it is made for users to share files via email. Overall it is a great service. DropBox is again a free service which provides file backup and sharing features. You need to register on their website and they provide you with 2GB of free storage but they gives you simple options to extent it. For example, you can get 125 MB of extra storage if you connect your account with Facebook, and 125 MB of storage if you connect with Twitter. You Additionally they have also upgradable plans with larger storage spaces. Dropbox plans are started at $9.99 per month for 100GB, and up to $49.99 per month for 500 GB.Â It has a desktop client with smartphone application availability. You can access it on your tablets also. Its supported platforms are Windows, Mac OS, iOS and Android. Dropbox lets you edit a number of file online on its web client which is a good feature for many people. You do not have to first download a file and then edit it. They support many file types including PDFs, documents, video, photos, Photoshop files, and music. Dropbox allows you to share files using a simple link. You just copy and paste the link and share it. Mediafire is considered to be the most reliable file sharing service. They have provided me with a 50GB free storage and the best thing about them which I like are there super-fast servers. The founders of Mediafire started it with an aim to allow sharing of larger files. Mediafire also has premium plans and an enterprise plan but what I think is that 50GB of free storage is more than enough for a single user. They limit the upload size to 100MB. They have smartphone applications which allows you to access your sites anywhere but what I have seen is that these apps are not so much popular. You just need to register, upload your files and get sharing link from them and share it. You can also make your folders public so anyone could come and download the file they want. Replitz has been just in the market with a simple easy to use script. They have been launched in beta mode and are working on finishing their final script. They have a simple Php file upload system which allows you to upload files without registration.Â You just upload your files, get a sharing link and share them. Soon much more new features are coming. The best thing which I like about them is there fast servers and they do not limit the download speed and impose waiting times like others. You might be thinking that the above services also do not impose any restrictions. That is true and that is the reason they are above it but services like Uploading.com, Hotfile.com makes it difficult for files to be shared with free users. That is the reason I am sharing this service with you. You should provide your comments regarding this service and help improve it.",Hamza Ahmad
13/08/2013,http://comluv.com/why-not-to-quit-blogging-even-if-you-dont-get-good-results/,Why not to quit Blogging even if you donâ€™t get good results - ComLuv,"Every now and then we come across a newbie blogger who says these words â€” â€œIâ€™m going to quit blogging, Blogging is waste of time, I canâ€™t survive in this blogosphere, there is huge competitionâ€ù. Obvious thing we see here is self-doubt. Like pros say â€“ â€œworst thing you can do to yourself is self-doubt your abilityâ€ù Blogosphere is not a casino center, not a gambling field either. Blogging needs passion; Passion to learn new things, passion to read, passion to write. We often hear the suggestion; run behind passion, not behind money. Somehow we often ignore this phrase, thatâ€™s where we fail. We only do what the society guides, even though we donâ€™t like it. The trick is to build passion for blogging, if you donâ€™t consider it as a passion you are likely to fail. I hear a lot of people saying â€“ â€œI am not an expertâ€ù. Well, we forgot the fact that no one was born expert. Experts believe in their ability and hard work. They donâ€™t doubt their ability, they donâ€™t skip information. Remember, everyone has the ability to become expert. Blogging does take a little time to perfect it. Iâ€™m not a pro, but I keep learning every day. One thing you What? Critics forced you to quit blogging? Thatâ€™s too bad. But hey, why are you bothered about your neighborâ€™s dogâ€™s remark? sorry, thatâ€™s harsh. What iâ€™m trying to say is critics should be the last reason to you to quit blogging. Critics should encourage you to do more, not discourage. Blogging is all about hard work. The more you work the more good results you get. There is always room for improvement. Without hard work, youâ€™ll obliviously donâ€™t get good results. Not getting enough motivation? Well, that should not be the case when youâ€™re online. Read some motivation quotes from entrepreneurs. Read some blogs like SmartPassiveIncome and WritersInCharge.  â€“ Richard Branson Many people often say that they donâ€™t understand anything about blogging, this happens only when youâ€™re not interested in it. You need to show interest in it. If Blogging is impossible, in my opinion, everything else in life is impossible. Donâ€™t think that blogging is only for writers or authors, anyone can write like professional. Youâ€™re feared to express your inner voice. Youâ€™re feared to write your opinion in words. Overcome this fear, conquer it. Then see the difference. Blogging is all about sharing your words and opinion. This is what many people do, they donâ€™t write from heart. They just write to fill the pages. This attitude might force you to quit blogging, so always try to write from heart. Blogging takes immense effort and dedication. As I mentioned above, initially you wonâ€™t get good results, it is natural. Never give up, try to increase your strength and continue your efforts.",Adithya Shetty

11/08/2013,http://comluv.com/the-only-guide-you-need-to-create-quality-content/,The Only Guide You Need To Create Quality Content,"quality content makes a blog successful. The structure of the content itself can still vary, from articles to reviews to â€œhow toâ€ùs, so â€œqualityâ€ù in and of itself does not hinge upon the actual type of post as it does the subject matter. If you dare to go against the grain of your niche, you should be able to grab some attention. But itâ€™s a complicated process, more complicated than just going against the pact. Quality writing can be divided into a few categories:   and  . Typos, spelling errors, and bad grammar, no matter how original your content is, will destroy your post. You lose a lot of credibility as a leader within your niche if you canâ€™t even spell properly or punctuate correctly. While many people would hire proofreaders for this process, I think you as a blogger (even if youâ€™re not a native English speaker) should take the time to learn proper grammar. Take a class, read a textbook, go through online tutorials, hire a tutor. This will in the long run make writing a much less time-consuming task, and it makes you a better conveyor of information. For many writers, even English native speakers, a postâ€™s writing can be grammatically perfect but still difficult to follow. This is because the attention span of most readers now is extremely short. Any sort of writing that is unnecessarily long or wordy will be overlooked. While an academic paper will congratulate you for your wordy language, your readers certainly will not. One of the biggest problems I see is the overuse of prepositional phrases. For example: â€œWriting should be simplified to make readers want to read our content more for traffic in order to become The meaning of the sentence is lost when I pack so much information in there. Break up sentences. Weâ€™re at the heart of quality content. Once youâ€™ve mastered your basic writing skills, you can be more free to put your heart into your posts. Always think: what will be interesting to readers? What should they learn after theyâ€™ve read my post? Something should draw your reader to the content itself. If youâ€™re a tech blogger, then maybe your review on the new Nexus will intrigue them. Once theyâ€™ve finished reading, they should gain a better understanding of the tablet and know better whether or not they want to buy the product. Fresh should mean it comes from your own opinions and worldview, not necessarily taken from another blogger. To do this, keep a tab on what other people are saying within your niche. Even the most controversial and the â€œhottestâ€ù topics canâ€™t win readers if you yourself are not interested. Readers will know when you put your heart into your writing. You wonâ€™t be able to stop writing. You will be putting material in that is truly from your personal experience, and not just a rehashing of what others are saying. If youâ€™ve got a good following already, then readers should be pretty interested in you. If you havenâ€™t talked about your own experiences yet, you really should put yourself out there. Even if youâ€™re just an information blog aimed at educating your readers, you shouldnâ€™t let that hold you back. Write about your life, get a small memoir going through your posts. It makes you more likeable and connected to your readers as not just an informer but as a human being. So the first step is your writing. Develop your grammar and your language and then start working on your actual content. You should notice that you will start forming your own tone and style in your writing. The content should be fresh, well-informed, and easy to relate to. This will get you a nice readership going and get your reputation in tip-top shape.",Amrik Virdi

09/08/2013,http://comluv.com/3-reason-why-i-moved-from-blogger-to-wordpress/,3 Reason Why I moved from blogger to wordpress - ComLuv,"I started my blog in April 2013. I was not intended to choose the blogging as my career but according to me, blogging is a career even If itâ€™s limited to hobby. At first I was on blogger because I was well aware of it. Blogger is easy to customize, you have complete coding at one place and you can change or edit anything without opening your hosting cpanel, domain dashboard etc. It is very easy to manage the sidebars, widgets, ads and layout in blogger. Blogger is owned by Google so it makes it more convenient to verify your ownership through single email submission, make followers through powerful feedburner, integrate Google comments through your dashboard and some other very attractive features. If this was all I got, so many benefits, why I changed my blogging platform then? Do wordpress have all these advantages? If I say No! There should be some reasons why I moved my blog from blogger to wordpress. This is weird if I say I migrated to wordpress due to layout, but this is the fact. My blog is a multiple-niche blog and I was searching for retina based theme or the template with category wise homepage division. During all my research I was unable to find exactly what I was looking for. Blogger templates are divided in to two categories. There is no other category in blogger templates. Even if there is category for magazine, it is very difficult to manage it. You have to manually add different categories from the Html Editor or you have to widgitized the whole blogger template. Blogger is not for plugins. If you are saying sidebar widgets are plugins, seriously we are not dumb. If you have no Idea what SEO is? You have to learn it from different sources. You will read books, online tutorials, videos etc and after it you will be able to make your post SEO Friendlyâ€_but wait for a moment, you are limited. There is nothing to measure how much your article will be SEO friendly in blogger. In wordpress, letâ€™s take only YOAST SEO plugin. Giving you a complete idea of how much your article is SEO friendly even if you have no idea what SEO is, Yoast will check it for you. It will tell you add your keywords here, here and here. If you havenâ€™t purchased your template and itâ€™s a free version, no problem. There is author plugin, Custom header plugin, Share your article plugin and so on so forth. Decorate your free template with unlimited resources. Are you kidding me? No Iâ€™m serious. Have you ever tried to install commenluv on your blogger blog? It looks weird. Like you have installed something forcefully. If not, try disquis. If your Post Area is less than 450px It will flow out from the main layout. Blogger default commenting system in complete failure, outdated and dull. We have advance commenting system on wordpress like livfyre, commentluv and disquis. Specifically if I say commentluv through which the readers can show their work as well, Â very easy to use, Â no need to link your most recently work as commentluv will do it for you, you can make your link dofollow by different options like sharing it on G+, tweeting etc. In fact you can get readers who want to comment if you are providing them backlinks. Isnâ€™t it a fact? WordPress has unlimited resources. From the past few years blogger hasnâ€™t bring any update to their users beside the HTML Editor and Google commenting system upgrade. Meanwhile, wordpress is going for another update plus all the resources are updating on regular basis. It is not necessary that everyone should be agreed to my points but all i want to say â€_ Blogger S*cks.!!",Osama Zia
06/08/2013,http://comluv.com/social-media-is-our-comfort-blanket/,Social Media Is Our Comfort Blanket,"The world of social media isnâ€™t necessarily social. To many it serves as a comfort blanket where it shields from being public. Social media doesnâ€™t change anything, itâ€™s another method of talking with a long-term goal to build conversation, interaction and connection. However, it also becomes a lazy route to think that all roads lead to Rome (or all roads lead to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ etc). Do we really think that the world of social media will help us lead better lives? What the plethora of platforms show is that it becomes easy to hide behind a faceless product and then dictate a message to your audience. A recent example I seem to be finding on LinkedIn over the past few weeks are direct messages that say: A number of the requests are from people I have little relationship with, but by pressing a button to send to a host of email contacts becomes a warm Communication has shifted in a world that is now connection invitation overload. Our challenge is to find our own voice,Â  Â and become comfortable with it. The social media platforms are fantastic at building relationships and conversations, itâ€™s just a case of using them in a way that positions you as a leader in your marketplace. Taking warmth in connectivity but being shielded from being social and representing who you really are, is a recipe to merely blend in with everyone else. Take a look at your Twitter timeline and look at those who are selling their product and dictating a message, as opposed to adding value and information to those that are part of your community. People do business with those they know, like and trust. This hasnâ€™t changed in hundreds of years, the only thing that is different today is that weâ€™re not limited geographically. Itâ€™s time to kick that warm security blanket off, be present,Â  Â and champion being normal again. Image: Courtesy of Flickr â€“ sewtobed",Mark Masters

04/08/2013,http://comluv.com/how-do-you-build-a-world-class-email-marketing-strategy/,How Do You Build A World Class Email Marketing Strategy?,"Email marketing has grown in leaps and bounds. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are an average Joe in blogging or running a Fortune 500 company. You need to know email marketing. Email marketing â€_ as the name goes, is all about using email to your advantage. This means that youâ€™re going to market your products, sell your products and sending out vital information using this electronic mail. What makes it so important is the fact that for every email you send out, it will be the deciding factor whether you are able to pull the customer or reader back for more (and probably, closing a sale). You may have a killer plan or maybe a proven strategy that will work. However, you ainâ€™t going anywhere without the right email marketing service. For me, an email marketing service is more than just a tool. It is suppose to be your partner in crime when it comes to email delivery. With so many different email marketing services available, here are some guidelines for you. A good email marketing service should have these features: When it comes to email marketing, it is a no brainer that every email send out is accounted for. This means that you need to make sure that your email goes to the right people â€_ yes those people who are willing to do two things; Open the email and read the content. If you are not able to achieve both of them, you basically wasted your effort. Letâ€™s take an example of WPBeginner. They have a very different sign up option which offers subscribers to sign up for only newsletters they would want to. So, what does this means? The most basic lesson for email marketing is you need to know the reasons behind your readersâ€™ sign up. Once you are able to figure that out, youâ€™ll be able to  . Ask yourself the reason(s) you do email marketing. Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll wait.   Now that you figured it out, could the reasons be either sending newsletters, sales pages or maybe keeping your readers up to date with the latest scoop of your website? The above are pretty common and we are in a market where we canâ€™t afford to make our readers feeling bored. So, put on your thinking hat and start thinking out of the box â€_ YES, NOW! You want your followers to be â€˜always on their toesâ€™ waiting for your mail. So, donâ€™t make it just another email. Make it unique! Yes mate! You want to make sure your readers are opening all the emails they received from you and everything goes harder with the new Gmail tabs. Oh câ€™mon! Admit it! You need more than just a great title â€_ you need a KILLER title for Christâ€™s sake! When a reader receives an email, he or she would have less than 5 seconds to decide if the email is worth opening. With a killer title, you are going to increase chances of email open rate. Furthermore, whatâ€™s the point of email marketing if you are getting 0% open rate right? When it comes to email marketing, there is nothing better than split testing. So, what is split testing all about? Split This is an experiment done to measure on the open rate and click through rates (CTR). Data obtained from split testings will determine which method, word, sentences or even colour that produces better results. You can find a detailed write up on split testing posted on CopyBlogger  . Have you ever experienced receiving tons of email marketing when you are asleep? Those annoying notifications etc? Well, I personally experienced this recently and trust me when I tell you that it is no fun at all. Therefore, if you are doing email marketing, make sure you are sending out those emails at the right time! I scheduled all my emails to be send out on specific days and time. Why? Hereâ€™s my concept: Most of your readers are working adults (letâ€™s assume). Obviously, you donâ€™t want to send an email to them during morning meetings etc. That will be so â€_ awkward right? You decided on a killer title which will create more than 85% click through rate. So, whatâ€™s next? The next rule is to convince your readers to read and instead of just skimming through. Skimming is a process where readers will basically read the headlines in the article (if any) instead of the whole email content itself. Now, you need to write subheadings that are: The concept here is rather simple. For each point you have, make them as subheading with different sizes and probably colour. The longer the reader is reading your email, the better the chance you will get the click rates (if you are an affiliate marketer) and possibly sales. So, if you want to use email marketing effectively, think like a reader. If you want to perform great in email marketing, you should not just think about marketing. Instead, you should take the opportunity to get engaged with your followers with the newsletters. Ask them questions, feedbacks and even surveys to understand what they really looking for in an email. It is always easier to exceed a customerâ€™s expectations if you know what the expectations are. if you are sending out emails with the hope that at least â€˜someâ€™ will be happy with it, I would consider that â€_ chicken running without head. Hereâ€™s a few questions which you can ask your readers: Whatâ€™s the point of subscribing to your emails or newsletters if your readers could get the same information on your website?

01/08/2013,http://comluv.com/disqus-vs-commentluv-commenting-plug-ins/,Disqus VS CommentLuv Commenting Plug-ins - ComLuv,"It seems to me lately that everywhere I have been going I run into the Disqus comment plug-ins on other blogs. I really canâ€™t help but wonder, Why? Why in the world do we have numerous websites that are using Disqus on their blogs? Thereâ€™s a lot of crippling factors you just donâ€™t understand about Disqus being present on your blog and just how much it can hurt your blog. : I donâ€™t know how many times this has happened to you. But for me, itâ€™s a consistent thing. I want to commentâ€_I waitâ€_I want to commentâ€_I wait..I JUST WANT TO COMMENTâ€_Still waiting! It just doesnâ€™t load! I have something to say but 80% of the time it refuses to load, I sh*t you not! Also, you have to think about it from an average Joeâ€™s viewpoint. How do you think they feel when they come to your site and notice Disqus is still pretending to load? Iâ€™ll tell you how they feel.  They say to themselves â€œThis website is the pits! It canâ€™t even load comments right!â€ù People are blind, assuming, and cranky animals! You have to take that into account when you run a blog. Itâ€™s true that if youâ€™re get a lot of comments and the comments are not next page surfing friendly like mine is due to my theme. That it can bog down your page or post load times. It can also take forever to scroll down your huge list of comments.Â  so your user can comment on the blog post itself. So the disadvantage to CommentLuv is..too many comments! Iâ€™m not really seeing that as too much of a disadvantage if you ask me.  Now once you get Disqus all setup with your own personal Disqus account! I have had no problem signing in and commenting.   However, I can tell you that when I used it previously when I wasnâ€™t a webmaster.Â  I would only comment as a ! Why? Because using it to sign in with one of my social media accounts was just not working out for me half the time! It would result in me losing whatever comment I just wrote after I finished signing into my social media! Often making me say   Also, is the average Joe going to want to register with Disqus just so they can comment on your blog? The answer is simply  Now the only problem with CommentLuv is actually not really CommentLuvâ€™s problem. Itâ€™s the WordPress default commenting system. It asks for a â€œWebsiteâ€ù. I have clear indications on my blog that you do not need to fill out your website to comment. However, this can be extremely helpful for not only webmasters but for people boosting their social media. Other users can put in their Facebook URL or Twitter URL as their website and connect with other people that way. On my blog thanks to CommentLuv. I allow people to put in their Twitter Username and I also have a little button next to the input field asking if they want to follow me on Twitter.Â  Talk about something so user friendly for the both ends, itâ€™s incredible.  Something most webmasters overlook is a feature of Disqus that makes you lose traffic and you donâ€™t even know it. Yes, you heard me right.  CommentLuv isnâ€™t distraction free. Given that it lets users leave a post to one of their websites below their comment. Something might catch a users eye and they will no longer leave the comment on your blog, itâ€™s true. However, for webmasters this is important because they can also leave a post below their comment and makes it a treat to comment on your blog. Also, for me personally. I usually visit the commentatorâ€™s posts that they leave with their comment on my blog  and I myself will comment on their blog post. You see?   Sometimes it will lead into a comment frenzy between two blog owners. How amazing is that? Iâ€™ll tell you,  Disqus handles blog moderation differently because  . Because of this feature.. most just simply allow commenting with zero moderation. Do you want some ugly, hateful, and gross troll comments below your post? I donâ€™t think so. The fact is, itâ€™s not even worth having comments if you canâ€™t moderate them. Look at YouTube, thatâ€™s the perfect example of UN-moderated comments. Just a bunch of trash talking and fighting.  Thereâ€™s really not much to say here.   just like you always have before. Itâ€™s the perfect system allowing you   over what youâ€™re doing with your comments. Not to mention CommentLuv comes with WASP which filters out spam comments which you also have  . So once again, I have nothing bad to say about CommentLuv Disqus has no sharing. It allows you have your posts below the comments for your site or you can use other peoples posts for advertising revenue. Is this a bad idea? Of course it is. You just need a related post widget if you want to do this better and more effectively on your blog. As for the advertising revenue, Itâ€™s pretty much useless. Itâ€™s unused. How many times have you went to the very bottom of a page and decided   and clicked off! My point exactly. Commentluv can bring in I kid you not. When I comment on someoneâ€™s post and someone has CommentLuv Premium allowing for social media sharing. Do you know what I do? I share on every single one of them   Why? Because it makes me feel good! It also makes the author or webmaster extremely happy with you and will often  Do you understand why thatâ€™s so important to your blog with SEO? Just trust me social media is very important.",Scott Craighead

27/07/2013,http://comluv.com/identity-theft-through-wireless-networks-how-does-it-happen/,Identity Theft through Wireless Networks â€“ How does it happen - ComLuv,"Accessing the web from any location has become even more possible with the prevalent use of wireless networks. You can easily find Wi-Fi hotspots in coffee shops, malls and hotels which you can use to connect to the Internet. Many offices are using wireless networks as well to easily share their Internet connection among company workstations. These days, most homes also set up their own wireless networks to enable several gadgets to have access to the web. Some homes have multiple computer systems, laptops, tablets and smartphones so sharing Internet connection through wireless means is very ideal. Setting up a wireless network is also pretty affordable and easy: all you need is a good Internet connection and a router. You can set up your network on your own or ask your provider to do it for you. Because itâ€™s cheaper to set up a wireless network, a lot of businesses offer free Wi-Fi as a standard service perk when you patronize their establishments. Itâ€™s also a good way to attract more customers to visit their businesses because they have free Internet. However, these wireless networks have opened a venue for criminals to easily commit  . People donâ€™t realize the dangers of using a wireless connection because they consider it as convenient. Unfortunately, this is one of the main reasons why some people fall prey to ID theft and fraud. Using an unsecured network when dealing with sensitive information isnâ€™t safe; instead, youâ€™re only inviting hackers to intercept and steal your personal and financial data when you do so. A criminal doesnâ€™t need a lot of your personal information to commit ID theft. Basic information like your full name, date of birth, social security number, address, past employers, and the high school you attended can all be used by the criminal to establish a new line of credit under your name or to access all of your accounts. Unfortunately, these details are among the data you send out when youâ€™re using the Internet, making it easier for hackers to steal your identity and use it for fraudulent activities. You should be aware that using Wi-Fi hotspots to connect your tablet, smartphone and laptop to the Internet is in itself very risky; and by making bank transactions using these gadgets, youâ€™re only increasing the risk of becoming a victim of ID theft through gadgets. This is because portable devices such as phones and tablets have little protection against spyware and viruses, not to mention Wi-Fi hotspots are a hotbed of activity for cyber criminals. But how do hackers commit identity theft through wireless networks? Here are some of the methods they use: Wireless connections that are visible, unencrypted, donâ€™t use passwords, and have no security in place are the easiest targets. A hacker can scan for available networks, focus on one or several Fraudsters can also create a â€œtwinâ€ù wireless network that looks just like the wireless connection offered at several public places such as cafes, malls, terminals and hotels. Wi-Fi hotspots at locations like these attract hackers because of the amount of users surfing on unsecure connections. The criminal monitors all data that pass through the network, especially email and bank account passwords, credit card numbers and other personal information. Another way criminals obtain information about you is by creating fake pages that ask for details like your address, date of birth, credit card number or other banking information. These details alone can be used by swindlers to commit ID theft or fraud. As far-fetched as it sounds, criminals are now using social sites to find their targets. Most people are not aware that posting about their vacation plans on these sites make them prime targets of identity thieves. Theyâ€™re unconsciously broadcasting that they wonâ€™t be as focused as they usually are about monitoring their credit card bills for suspicious activities. Schemers also know that travellers are good targets for ID theft because theyâ€™re distracted with their travel plans. Theyâ€™re also using wireless networks (both secure and unsecure ones) a lot to access their social accounts, emails or even bank accounts. Even with the rise in identity theft cases (reaching about 9.9 million victims a year), itâ€™s possible to avoid becoming a victim of ID theft. Here are some ways to protect from ID theft when using wireless networks: To minimize the risk of becoming a victim of identity theft, you have to make sure that your wireless home network is secure, and that you donâ€™t make bank transactions or deal with sensitive information when youâ€™re using public Wi-Fi. You donâ€™t have to be tech savvy to do these; you just have to know and follow the ways to protect from ID theft. Are you a victim of ID theft or fraud?

21/07/2013,http://comluv.com/weight-loss-what-it-really-takes-to-lose-weight/,Weight Loss: What It Really Takes To Lose Weight,"I have struggled with weight loss since I was young. Iâ€™ve never been majorly obese, but at 5â€™4â€ù I have bounced around between 140 pounds to 200 pounds for 17 years. What usually happens is that I focus on weight loss when I have a vacation or event coming up, and then after that occasion or event is finished, I gain the weight back. Intellectually, I know how to lose weight (or else I wouldnâ€™t be able to do it repeatedly), but I have never been able to admit that healthy eating has to be a lifelong commitment. I decided that I canâ€™t ignore the truth anymore. Besides illness, aging, and reaction to certain medications, weight gain happens because we eat more than we should. It is really a matter of putting more calories into our bodies than we are exerting. Most of us enjoy eating fried or   in our staple diet, which always have an abundance of calories that are very hard to burn off during the day. However, in the past little while I have been eating a fairly healthy diet â€“ but I have been eating too much of it, which proves that overeating healthy food can result in weight gain too. It is simply a matter of consuming too many calories in your daily diet. I kept telling myself that it sucks to have to control what you eat and â€˜dietâ€™. Why canâ€™t I have that extra bowl of chili? Why canâ€™t I eat an extra sandwich? Even though I get stuffed, I enjoy the food. Right? The truth is that I was actually lying to myself. I didnâ€™t enjoy the feeling of being too full. It wasnâ€™t as satisfying as I thought it was going to be, yet I kept eating because I didnâ€™t want to deny myself. There were other lies too. I told myself that a few extra pounds wasnâ€™t the worst thing in the world, and weight loss wasnâ€™t on the top of my list. I told myself that wearing flattering clothing was for other women, not for me. I told myself that I was happy with my body, even though I hated the way I looked in the mirror and knew I secretly wanted to lose weight. In short, I was lying to myself in order to avoid facing the truth. After I found out I was going on vacation in a few months, weight loss became my focus. I had to stop lying to myself about the diet I was eating and pay attention to my choices. And, at that point in my life (finally!) I was able to clearly see the truth behind my lie. I didnâ€™t enjoy overeating; in fact, I figured out that I actually enjoyed having some self-control over my diet. The truth is that: â€¢ I enjoy NOT over eating. â€¢ I enjoy making healthy decisions for my body. â€¢ I enjoy eating delicious food in smaller quantities. â€¢ I feel good about myself after I eat healthy, instead of stuffed or regretful. â€¢ I feel better about my health simply by eating healthier. â€¢ I have a better body image simply by eating healthier. The point is â€“ the ability to practice self-control over my diet, and eat less food than I was eating before, has made me feel better about myself than before. In addition, my weight loss is coming along pretty good. Iâ€™m not a weight loss expert by any means, but once all of the lies cleared from my head about my diet, and I started focusing on weight loss, it became very clear, that in regards to diet, there are certain things that have to be done in order to lose weight. Whatever lies you are telling yourself â€“ stop. If you are like me and told yourself that a little extra weight wasnâ€™t the worst thing in the world, then take a peek into your future and talk to your future self to learn what they think about that extra weight. They may suffer from weight related disease, or they may just have a lot of regret about not being comfortable in their body for most of their life. Figure out the lies you are telling yourself about weight loss and confront them head on. We all have the ability to practice self-control in our diet. We all have the choice to stop eating, to make healthier choices, and to say no. The trick is to make self-control a good thing and not a bad thing.   can really work for controlling diet and encouraging weight loss. For example, instead of telling yourself that you are denying yourself an extra piece a cake, tell yourself that you are working towards a healthier and happier you. I guarantee the craving for the cake will go away, but the satisfaction you get from practicing self-control in your diet will not. I think there should be a diet out there called the â€˜consistent dietâ€™. Eating a healthy diet and maintaining weight loss is just a matter of consistently eating the same way. That means that you canâ€™t look at it as a â€˜temporary situationâ€™ to look the way you want to look (as I have done many times in the past), but rather view it as a happy and healthy way to live life. Be consistent with your self-control and healthy choices and you will never have to â€˜dietâ€™ again. Our unhealthy diet does not just affect us. The scary part is that we are teaching our children bad habits and they are suffering the consequences. According to the   website, obesity in children has more than doubled in the past 30 years. I was watching a documentary on HBO called the  , and it mentioned that if we keep going the way we are going, our kids are going to die before us due to diet related diseases. That is some scary stuff! Therefore, weight loss is not just about getting the body you want, gaining self-confidence and becoming healthier; it is about demonstrating to the younger generation that a healthy diet is full of joy and satisfaction.",Bellaisa

Summer is actually the best time of year to buy a car, no matter what youâ€™re shopping for. Deals abound this time of year, whether youâ€™re looking for a brand new car, a new car from the previous model year, or even a used car. While we have a tendency to hem and haw when making such significant purchases, if you find yourself in the position of needing a new car you probably donâ€™t want to wait much longer. It seems the model year for cars creeps earlier all the time. Growing up, I remember seeing model-year-end deals starting in September. Now they start as early as July. Thatâ€™s great news for those seeking new cars, because it means great deals. Manufacturers want to clear out the previous model year so they can focus on the new one. The end result is a favorable situation for   consumers. There are two major types of deals youâ€™ll see on new cars from the previous model year: . When I was a kid they called them factory-to-dealer incentives, but that term seems to have transitioned to merely rebates. The manufacturer, wanting to clear out previous year models, offers dealers rebates when they sell these older models. That is to say, dealers can sell them for a lower price than they paid for the car, because the manufacturer is reimbursing them. For consumers, this means a chance to negotiate. The dealer will always supply you with a copy of the invoice â€” the invoice price is technically what the dealer paid to put the car on the lot. If there are rebates going on, you can negotiate below the invoice price, sometimes significantly. Make sure to start out with a price well below invoice, and be prepared to walk away. If the dealer senses you might actually leave, you could walk away with a great deal. Some dealers offer zero percent APR on purchases of previous model year cars. This essentially means that you pay the price agreed upon, with only tax and registration adding to the bill. In other words, you get a cash deal that you can spread over five years. Itâ€™s hard to beat that. The big warning with zero percent APR deals is  . If you default on even one payment, you might get stuck paying an enormous interest rate on not only future payments, but also past payments. Also, be sure to verify that you indeed qualify for the zero percent deal. A shady dealer might lure consumers with a zero percent deal, only to shove a contract under their noses that provides 8 percent APR. Why buy a brand-spanking-new car when you can get last yearâ€™s model for a far cheaper price? for starters, it is considerably more valuable right from the start. No matter when you buy a 2013 model car, it is still considered a 2013 model. If you bought it at the end of the 2013 model year, you will realize the same resale value as someone who bought the same car at the beginning of the model year (mileage may change the valuation slightly, but only slightly). This is a huge incentive for those who frequently trade in cars for newer models. Consider this as well: the manufacturer has to make improvements with each yearâ€™s model, or else no one will buy it. So while you might find value in the previous model year, youâ€™ll find undeniably better features in the new model. This can include trivial features, such as the radio and sound system, but it can also include essential elements such as fuel economy and horsepower. Safety features will also be up to the very latest standards, a significant consideration for many car buyers. If youâ€™re going to buy a car in the summer, and you have enough money to buy a quality model, youâ€™re probably better off going with a new one. There are plenty of good deals on used cars, and many dealers certify them and offer warranties, but you just never know how the previous owner treated it. Many serious problems can be painted over, so you wonâ€™t notice until youâ€™ve owned the car for some time. Still, there are summer values to be found in used cars, especially if you live in Northern regions that have  . A car owner might seek to upgrade a regular four-door sedan at the end of a model year, upgrading to an SUV to better navigate the snowy weather to come. Dealers do offer trade-ins, but you can almost always get more money by selling directly. In other words, late summer is the time to be on the look out for cars parked in driveways and yards with for sale signs on them. You can certainly negotiate down the price, and if you pay cash you can get it down considerably. At the same time, you can usually get a decent car. Again, used isnâ€™t the most reliable way to buy a car, but if youâ€™re low on funds and want a deal, end of summer is a great time to pounce.",Joe Pawlikowski
20/07/2013,http://comluv.com/is-it-possible-to-manipulate-your-dreams-with-lucid-dreaming/,Is it Possible to Manipulate Your Dreams with Lucid Dreaming - ComLuv,"Of course we would all love to be able to make sure we score with that beautiful or handsome significant other that keeps appearing in our dreams. But it just never seems to happen that way, the dreams always seem to end just as theyâ€™re getting good. But one particular psychologist by the name of Alan Worsley has discovered he can control his dreams by way of  . Letâ€™s dig into that a little bitâ€_ , a psychologist of St. Thomas Hospital in London, claims to be able to manipulate his dreams as easy as snapping his fingers. While dreaming,   has created fantasies of soaring through the air and being able to pass a knife through his wrists without a single scratch. He has become so good at the manipulation of his dreams that he can even outline specific tasks he would like to achieve during his dreams and they will happen. He has been tested on his claims by having electrodes attached, confirming heâ€™s in a dream state, but is still able to perform actions such as counting things, moving of his arms and legs, or even speaking aloud while dreaming. The tasks that   is accomplishing are known as  . This is where the dreamer is fully aware that they are dreaming, and by knowing this, they have the ability to manipulate their dreamworld. Even though this is not the first known case of true  , scientists still try to dismiss it as a hoax or fantasy. But scientists have been able to prove his ability to react to outside stimulus by sending a small electrical shock to his body while he remains in a dream state. After receiving this electrical shock   was able to respond by giving them a small predetermined signal. In this case it was five rapid eye movements. This experiment confirmed that the     is in fact possible. I know this is a little hard to understand, but basically Worsley and the scientists arranged that when Worsley felt this electrical shock while dreaming, he was to give them the signal showing that he felt it. Keep in mind that when I donâ€™t know about you, but when Iâ€™m asleep and dreaming like a baby, I donâ€™t normally know to react to outside stimulus as instructed. Sometimes this will happen in some ways but itâ€™s very rarely controllable. There are many different applications possible with controlled dreaming. For instance another dream researcher from Stanford University in Palo Alto trained himself to ensure he would not wake up while having nightmares. He actually wakes up   the dream rather than waking   it. This has allowed him to actually face his fears that are encountered while dreaming. That kind of goes against the theory that you will always wake up right before the terrible happens. This would also prevent the dreaded recurring nightmare syndrome. He also pointed out that our   are a compilation of our complete knowledge and experiences gained in the waking life. Suggesting that when dreaming we may be able to give complete accurate descriptions of people we encounter, such as eye color, height, weight etc. But if we were asked to do this in the waking life, we rarely remember all these details. So how is all this beneficial or does it have a practical purpose?  , that we can control, would give us the ability to tap into hidden areas of the mind and discover great knowledge to gain insight for daily problem solving and emotional repair. Because   would give us complete insight to every aspect of the problem at hand, nothing would go unnoticed. One great example of   and itâ€™s benefits was when Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev used hidden knowledge to discover the periodic table of elements. But letâ€™s keep in mind that there are many other scientists, inventors, authors, medical professionals and psychologists that have used information found in their   to complete major projects that have changed life for the common man as we know it. So now youâ€™re probably all thinking, â€œHey, I want to dream like that tooâ€ù, and I am included in that. But my research has shown that   at this level can be accomplished, but it takes years of dedication, discipline and meditation to perfect. But it is very achievable if you can dedicate yourself to the goal. There are many exercises and habits you can focus on to begin your path to   and the ability to  . In fact there are so many that this post would be much longer than any of you would prefer if I tried to list them all. I did mention a few things you can do to start your journey, in my post  , feel free to check that out to get you started. But donâ€™t forget, there is a wealth of information in this digital age available to you if youâ€™re interested in perfecting this process. Are you a Lucid Dreamer?

But I did that with a purpose and what I am going to talk to you about has to do with waterâ€_ And I simply couldnâ€™t find a better way to start this than with that clichÃ© sentence. Everything happens for a reason, so did my beginning of this textâ€_ There we go again. I think that I should stop with the clichÃ©s. But I really did start like that for a specific reason. But weâ€™ll deal with that slowly, no need to rush it. Anyway, we already established how we need water in order to survive, an obvious thing really, but we havenâ€™t said anything about the containers for waterâ€_ You need those as well, as you sometimes need to store or carry water with you, especially during the summer, in the terrible heat. Todayâ€™s global weather is so messed up that you really need to be extra careful, especially in the heat. Half a decade ago it was possible for a completely white person to stay in the sun and barely get any sunburns, whilst today, you get 2nd degree burns, if not worseâ€_ This comes from personal experience and trust me, those burns are really, really uncomfortable. You donâ€™t want that, so watch yourself out there. The same goes for extreme coldsâ€_ Anyway, the topic at hand is storage of water, so to say. Specifically, the bottles, the ones which we are very familiar with, since most of the water that does not come from our own faucet, comes in bottles and we buy it somewhereâ€_ The sad thing is that most of those bottles which we buy are made of plastic, and plastic is, as we all know, very bad for the environment because it takes ages to dissolve. That wouldnâ€™t really be a problem if mankind in general would learn not to throw these bottles wherever mankind pleases. I say mankind because that is the case really, since we are destroying We do recycle them, people are educated when it comes to this, but it seems that it isnâ€™t enough since we can all see plastic everywhere. This is plastic in general of course, since itâ€™s not just the bottles that are being thrown everywhere. Each human being should simply have in mind that he is not just an individual, but a part of a whole, a part of a living and breathing organism called Earth. We consider ourselves to be above the entire ecosystem only because we are the smartest and can control everything else. Yet we forget that we depend on this system and the forces it controls that are unbelievably uncontrollable. One, big enough natural disaster can eradicate the entire human race. And we should fear this, as more and more disasters are occurring every day around the globe. It is as if the planet is punishing us for our irresponsible behavior and cruelty. If it is, then let it, since we deserve that. The point of this is that since we are not good enough at disposing plastic, we can try and not use it entirely. In this specific case, the plastic bottles can be exchanged for steel ones. Or those made from aluminium or those made of stainless steel. There are plenty of these to go around and are much better that the plastic ones. Most importantly  , because people want to dispose of these as they are more useful, and everyone would want to keep them, especially if they are pretty â€“ and they are. There are many of these and they are pretty. Another good thing is that they can be used for a much longer period of time than the plastic ones and they canâ€™t be damaged and destroyed that easily.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

14/07/2013,http://comluv.com/reputable-seos-offer-guaranteed-seo/,Reputable SEO's Offer Guaranteed SEO,"To most people it only makes sense that you donâ€™t charge someone if you canâ€™t do anything for them, unless you happen to be a horse racing venue or a stock broker. In those cases we all know â€œpast performance doesnâ€™t guarantee future results.â€ù Â Even if thatâ€™s not obvious to everybody there are laws that make stock brokers tell you as much so you wonâ€™t get fooled by them into thinking their past successes are necessarily repeatable. They seem to think they have taken the moral high ground in saying reputable SEOâ€™s donâ€™t guarantee rankings. Â If you read their statements, Rand Fishkinâ€™s   and Googleâ€™s  , it seems apparent they have some legitimate beefs about illegitimate SEO practices but the end result is everybody in the SEO industry is either afraid to do the right thing or they use their statements as an excuse to keep clientâ€™s money if they canâ€™t do their job. Â This tells me Rand and Google failed to anticipate what reputable SEO companies SHOULD be doing and have lumped them (us) in with all the disreputable shysters in the industry. SEOâ€™s are hired to at least get a website to Google page 1. Â If they canâ€™t get you there thereâ€™s not much point in giving them your money because it doesnâ€™t do much good to be ranked any lower than page 1. Â Only 10% of searchers ever get past page 1 of the Search Engine Results Page (SERPâ€™s). Â If they take your money and you donâ€™t get any better than page 10 or even page 2 then what exactly did you hire them for and why are they keeping your money? You pay an SEO to perform a service and that service is supposed to get you more business, right? In what other industry that does not involve gambling are companies encouraged to keep your money if they canâ€™t meet minimal performance standards? Most of us believe if we hire a company to perform a service and they canâ€™t do their job we shouldnâ€™t have to pay them, or at least only pay half of their fee like we do for someone we hire to paint our house or install a sprinkler system. A reputable SEO company isnâ€™t going to hide behind the we-donâ€™t-have-control-of-the-Google-algorithm excuse. Â Sure, we know no one can control Google, has preferred submission status with Doesnâ€™t that sound reasonable? Â Doesnâ€™t that sound like what a reputable SEO company would do? Iâ€™m not talking about guaranteeing number one placement on Google SERPâ€™s. Â Iâ€™m just talking about guaranteeing, at the very least, what an SEO company is being hired to do, at the very least, which is get you to page 1. Â I donâ€™t think a reputable SEO company is going to keep 100% of their fee if they canâ€™t do at least that much. Â They may charge you something, both for doing the work and to keep from getting stiffed the entire fee if they end up with a disreputable client, but not keep it all no matter what. Â In my mind that just isnâ€™t what a reputable SEO company does any more than what a reputable company in any other industry outside of gambling does. SEO companies are like a bunch of lemmings following each other off the cliff. Â If Rand Fishkin at Moz, probably the biggest name in search other than Googleâ€™s own Matt Cutts, says reputable SEOâ€™s donâ€™t offer guaranteed SEO then everybody just goes along with it, right or wrong. SEOâ€™s, we have statistics. Â We have history. Â We know if what we do works, right? Â If we didnâ€™t know that it works what business do we have in selling our services? Â We even know enough to know if we can be more competitive than another company selling SEO. Â With all of that we should be able to figure out how much itâ€™s going to cost us if we for some reason canâ€™t perform at least a minimal service, such as getting someoneâ€™s website to Google page 1, and then adjust our prices accordingly, just like an insurance company does that knows how much more risk is involved in insuring a teenage boy verses a teenage girl. We are smart enough to figure this stuff out, right? You may by this time realize that even though their is a risk involved in guaranteeing SEO services itâ€™s a calculated risk and itâ€™s the right thing to do. Â If youâ€™re with me this far my hat is off to you. Â You are one of the few who are smart enough to see through this you-canâ€™t-guarantee-seo baloney. Â But are you brave enough to be considered by many in the industry to be taking the moral low ground rather than be though of as taking the high ground which they think they occupy? Â Are you brave enough to do the right thing regardless of what others say, even if they are the biggest names in the industry? Your customers, who demand better of you, will thank you.

Thatâ€™s why many of internet marketers and SEOs always develop a new method on how they will become unique and popular on what they are doing to succeed in their industry and to establish a long term method they will benefit from. However, in the new form of online marketing where search engines are involved, not all strategies always succeed and benefit a website, product or organization in the long run. Despite the advice and recommendations of search engines to avoid manipulative links of some SEOs, they are still keeping it in practice and sleeping walking their way to website penalization. Actually, at some point, some of these strategies would only work for a short period of time and after search engines discover these scheming actions of SEOs, manual or algorithmic penalty will follow which is really bad thing to experience online.

Unfortunately, this approach was eliminated by Google when they launched their penguin and EMD algorithms back in 2012. Therefore, this approach can have a negative impact for any website that would attempt to build links using keyworded anchor text. But this does not mean that every website that would attempt to use this approach will automatically be penalized in search; they may not just rank well Â â€“ This approach was literally abused by many SEO practitioners and SEO firms to increase the link popularity of a website. Most  s are to intentionally build a huge volume of incoming unnatural links to their website in a form of massive article directory submissions, web directory submissions and social bookmarking where links be easily built in a short period of time. This approach was very unethical and Google had no choice but to put an end to this unethical action of SEOs to manipulate their website ranking. Â â€“ Another form of strategy that can lead to website penalization is to have many links in-content of the website. Most SEOs would attempt to include three or more links in content of their website to manipulate the flow of link juice coming in to every pages of their website. Actually, this approach should not have negative impact to a website but since many SEOs started to abuse this great benefit of having links in-content, Google decided to put an end to this and starting to penalize websites that are practicing this approach. Â â€“ Another dangerous form of building links to manipulate a website ranking is to link a website to another website that is entirely irrelevant to the linking page. This method was widely implemented when search engines were not very strict when it comes to linking pages. However, when search engines took more serious approach in this matter, the results of irrelevant linking will absolutely damage the ranking performance of the website in search engines. Since the world of search industry is becoming more and more complex, it is imperative that we should not rely on one and old school approach to market a service online. There are many   that we can freely use and benefit from to standout in our market competition and we should take advantage of it really well and avoid using the old ones as it will penalize our website.",Joseph Gojo Cruz

First of all, the way you organize and design your home reflects your personality. Letâ€™s start from the way you decided to paint the walls. If the walls in your bedroom are white or light blue colored, it means that you are a peaceful, open-minded, and nice person. But, if your bedroom is dark red or dark blue, it means that you are a bit closed or a tad aggressive. The same is with furniture and ornaments you keep â€“ the stuff you place somewhere in order to reflect who you are. Secondly, your house is a place where you spend at least a third of your day. It is warmly recommended that you make it a nice place to be in. You should focus on keeping it clean and you should also focus on making it more interesting. If you feel nice at home you are more likely to do your work with more enthusiasm. Just imagine sitting on a couch that is filled with dirty clothes and watching TV. Not nice! Here are some very useful tips on how to make your home a better place to live. A mosaic is a group of small pieces of colored stone, glass, marble, or terracotta. These pieces are organized in a specific way in order to make a pattern or a picture. So, a mosaic is the art of making a surface look like a picture. How can this help you decorate your home and how can you make something useful out of it? Itâ€™s very simple â€“ stone mosaic tiles! Stone mosaic tiles add a touch of elegance and creativity wherever theyâ€™re put in the house. If you put these tiles in the kitchen, they will inspire you while you cook. If you put them in the bedroom, they will be the first nice thing you see when you wake up. If you put them in the hall, they will be the first thing your guests will see when they come to visit you. As you can see, with stone mosaic tiles you can The art of mosaics goes way back in history. The earliest examples were found in Abra, Mesopotamia dated back to the third millennium BC. They were made of colored stones and shells. Today, many mosaics are made of marble, and marble mosaics are widely used in architecture. Some mosaics are even made out of pure gold, but with a layer of glass on top of it (so the gold cannot be scratched). No matter the material, a mosaic that was developed thousands of years ago has stayed very popular until today, and you can have it at home with stone mosaic tiles! An aquarium is in fact like a piece of furniture when it comes to decorating your home. Why is it the second best thing to have? Hereâ€™s why â€“ aquariums are excellent stress reducers! Looking at an aquarium for only five minutes can help you feel relaxed and stress reduced. Itâ€™s better to get a bigger aquarium that includes an oxygen pump, because the sound of air running through water is also very relaxing. Useful tip: make sure you get a plant for each room. Plants will give a natureâ€™s touch to your home. If you have a computer in your living room, put a cactus next to it. Cacti absorb radiation! Keep your place clean at all times! Remove dust daily. Not only does it not look good, most men are allergic to dust, itâ€™s just that we donâ€™t even notice it, as itâ€™s a mild allergy. Still, it can affect our overall quality of life in our personal living space, so donâ€™t be lazy about cleaning it up. To sum up, your home is who you are. Donâ€™t let it be a dull place.

But if you, as a human go serious thinking of the travel in the space, you should always be aware of the  . It is not that simple to travel in space by any ordinary human being due to many adverse conditions prevailing in   such as zero gravity, weightlessness, direct exposure to harmful radiations, to name a few, which we humans are not addicted to in our planet, earth. Almost all of the effects caused in outer space are caused because we humans in our earth have to do most of our works sitting or standing, working against the gravity. As we know that there is no such factor in outer space, the astronauts which travel in space do not use their bodies (particularly bones and muscles) to that extent because they do not feel any need using them. This results in adverse conditions to the humans in the space. The human body is designed as such that the motion of blood from lower to the upper parts have to work Some of the other minor effects of the space travel to the human bodies may include vomiting, insomnia, malaise, dizziness and more spherical shapes of the red blood cells. The space travel may also result in the lesser immunity of the human bodies to the diseases. Also, as the spinal bones have not to work that much hard to which they are addicted in earth and due to zero gravity environment prevailing in the space, astronauts grow up to two inches taller in space which results in the back aches. However, as stated earlier, all of these effects are not persistent but the space traveller return to their original state some days after they come back to the earth. Last but not the least, Space radiation exists in the space environment. On the Earth, the atmosphere and the earthâ€™s magnetic field provide a shield for human beings, and prevent space radiation such as the ultraviolet rays from penetrating to the Earthâ€™s surface. But, due to the absence of any such shielding in the space, astronauts are subjected to greater amounts of these harmful radiations. Whatâ€™s actually happening in the space is that the cosmic rays are slashing through the brains of the astronauts. Along with the solar flares, these rays travel rapidly and tend to expose astronauts to higher levels of ionizing radiation. This form of radiation can damage atoms in human cells, leading to decreased immunity against general diseases also and a higher risk of cataracts, cancer, heart disease, damage to the central nervous system and brain damage. So, next time when you go serious to think about the space travel, as a human being, go through the after and the on-travel effects of the travel as well.",Yogesh Pant

Now, you are probably thinking: â€œI will just email or IM all people in my contact list and spread the wordâ€ù. Right? Wrong. Not only do you risk turning down potential buyers, but you can easily end up in spam folders and never get your message round, or in the worst case scenario, you will get blacklisted and no message of yours will ever reach the intended address. Furthermore, it takes time to create a good message to distribute, and time is money, so you actually lose money before you even get the chance to make it. Does this mean that you should give up sending emails to a bunch of random people? No, of course not. Moreover, email has turned out to be an even more direct and personal form of making sales, even more than social media, not to mention its cost-effectiveness. What you should do is devise a good message, make it more open, create a relationship with your customers, have a distinctive voice and tone so you will be heard and remembered. Once youâ€™ve done that, you should focus on reaching your audience. Sending spam can ruin your reputation and bring down your business. Like we said before, careful when emailing your buyers. There are a few traps you should know about and how to avoid them. They may save your business and boost your sales, or may cause your money to go down the drain and ruin you. The first is known as unsolicited email, opposed to permission-based email. Unsolicited commercial email, commonly known as spam, is any message or post, regardless of the content, sent to recipients who never requested it. Now think about it, would you like to receive daily posts or emails about issues you are not even remotely connected to, or do not interest you? Probably not. That is why you should Permission-based email is any commercial message, newsletter, or posting sent only to recipients who requested it and can choose to opt out of receiving the email. Aye, thereâ€™s the rub! When done right, email marketing can be a powerful and effective marketing tool. Permission-based email marketing is used effectively everyday by hundreds of thousands to build their brands, increase sales, and strengthen relationships with their clients and members. And do not forget the most important thing: potential clients ASK to receive all these information. OK, so we made it clear what to do, and what not to do. But how to do it? How to make a permission-based email list? One of the easiest things to do is to create a sign-up form on your website. All over it. A sign-up form is a simple form placed all over your website where potential customers can leave their name and email and receive newsletters from you. Once you have done this, you can give the opportunity to your customers to spread the message among their friends. In no time, your permission-based email list is expanding. Promote your newsletter in other newsletters. You will not be spamming anyone, but your message will still reach a great number of potential customers. Your customers need to develop a trustworthy relationship with you, they need to be convinced that your product is the best money can buy and feel happy about it. So, before you engage in your sales commercial, consider the   can bring you. Ruin your business, become discredited among clients or build a strong lasting relationship with your customers.

29/06/2013,http://comluv.com/event-organization-plan-it-to-perfection/,Event Organization - Plan it to Perfection,"Many of us have had a chance to be invited to a certain event. As a guest, we get to see how everything works fine, we donâ€™t feel any pressure; mostly we just enjoy all the things that an event offers us. But have you ever wondered how much work, commitment, patience and nerves go into event planning? People think that is a piece of cake, but actually it is much more than that. When a certain festival, ceremony, party or a similar event needs to be organized you need to have certain things in mind like budgeting, all sorts of permits, location, dates etc. Starting point for anyone who wants to plan an event is their budget. This is one of the most important things because all of the other preparations start here. Food, drinks, licenses, entertainment and every other single thing that you will be paying for should be put on a paper and calculated, because, after all, you donâ€™t want to end up in the red. Another important thing for an event is a date when it should happen. Always be sure to have several dates at disposal, that is, book a few days in your head, in case something goes wrong. Of course, if such an unfortunate thing should happen, you must bear in your mind that all the other onward arranged parts of the event like music, entertainment, staff etc. should also be at your service even if the date changes. If you are planning an event that should occur under the open sky, you should take into consideration the weather and book a date according to that. After you have decided when this event should take place, it is time to think about the selection of the site. A site for events mainly depends on the purpose of the event. If it is a graduation party or a wedding, or some other form of local events one should try considering a restaurant or a hotel hall, but if it is a festival or a sports game much bigger space is needed. You should think ahead of the possible number of the people that will be visiting your event and find appropriate place where it wonâ€™t be too crowded, but Now, there are a lot of other smaller, but equally relevant things that you should take care of. Permits for alcohol and insurance licenses need to be acquired earlier, because it takes a little time to get the allowance. If your event is taking place somewhere outside the city or in a place where the transport is an issue, you should provide a means of transport to the place of happening. Â Additionally, for those who will come to your event by car, you should provide enough parking spaces. It is fashionable to have some food and drinks served and it is also necessary if your event is going to last more than an hour. There are catering services that will not only bring and make your food, but they offer you their stuff to parade through the people and serve food and drinks. A sort of entertainment and a little bit of music (unless it is a music festival, then there should be a lot of music), is a must at every event. According to the needs, the theme of the event and the sort of people that will be present, you should pick the best option and choose among all of the genres of music. Some people think that decorations arenâ€™t important, but subtle and original decorations will certainly give a special touch to your event. Again, you can choose this as an excuse to show your creative side or, if you donâ€™t like to be bothered with such things, you can always hire someone to do that for you. If your event is the kind of event that includes sitting, eating or similar, do not forget to provide enough tables and chairs for your guests. As you should care about the safety of your guests, you should secure the place and have a medical support within your reach. Electricity, utilities and cleanup are very important, so be sure that those things are taken care of. A huge advantage of event management is that you can expand your budget by promoting someone. Your event can be sponsored by people who want you to help them advertise their services. For example, many architecture companies use   in their own premises, that is, an event is taking place at the location built or designed by a certain company. This way, both sides profit. The person who is making an event has his/her budget expanded or at least they get to have a free space where the event is going to happen. On the other hand, we have the company which is promoted this way, along with all the additional advertising material such as posters, billboards, or some items with etched logo of a company. All that is left for you is to make a guest list and enjoy the feeling of accomplishment when the event that you planned is running smoothly.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

It is best to plan your meals ahead â€“ plan when and how much you will eat and prepare as much of it in advance as possible. Regularly exercising is crucial. If you arenâ€™t making your body work, you arenâ€™t spending any calories, and no matter how little you eat you wonâ€™t be losing any weight. Regular exercise and regular, moderated intake of food are keys to losing weight fast. You can plan to pump the iron three times a week, run or swim another three times per week, play squash, basketball or whatever with a friend once a week and regularly take half an hour or hour long walks. That should be more than enough. Resting yourself properly is extremely important. Without rest your muscles wonâ€™t be able to recover, and you will be more prone to stress. When you are stressed out you tend to lack the discipline, and are also more likely to just eat unhealthy food so you can calm yourself down. Be sure to get enough rest between workouts and the work that pays for your lifestyle, and also make sure to get plenty of natural sleep during nights. I hope this short post helps you take the plunge and start taking off that excess weight thatâ€™s been there for a while.",Thomas Allan

The future of successful business is bound by trust and collaboration. Whilst we love the heavy self gratification of â€˜ .â€™ (yesâ€_that is what someone said, but I donâ€™t think they were referring to Napoleon Hill) and â€˜ â€™ (yesâ€_that is genuine), these are comments from people believing that defiance is the way to build a successful brand. This all represents the absolute opposite for what is required to prosper in business in todayâ€™s society. The old school ways of dominance, arrogance, strength and self reliance can now be put into a box on one side of the room and in itâ€™s placeÂ generosity, vulnerability, sincerity, honesty and co-operationÂ take centre stage. Out the door goes the corporate What we see on BBC1 at the moment are groups of people dreaming about security by complying with a world that once existed by scrambling up the corporate ladder (where that ladder in fact belongs to someone else). What matters in todayâ€™s world is to stand out, not fitting in, by championing something in a way that isÂ  Â with others. By working collaboratively with others can add far more value than ever before. What you represent in your business is not what your product offers, but who you are and what you stand for.

24/06/2013,http://comluv.com/end-procrastinating-today/,End Procrastinating Today - ComLuv,"Ending procrastination may seem like something that canâ€™t be attained. Youâ€™ve likely procrastinated for a long time, and are so used to it by now that you canâ€™t imagine yourself being productive. But, there is a way, and here are some tips that will really help stop procrastinating, if you put them to use: If work seems overwhelming, you may have made too little breaks. For example, working on the computer may strain the eyes, so you need to get up every 30 or 40 minutes and take a few minutes to rest your eyes properly. Otherwise, even if you are not tired, it may seem so if you just strained your eyes. Taking a few minutes break every once in awhile, stretching yourself and taking a short walk around the office will refresh you and help you get ready for the next chunk of work. This is one of those undervalued tips that people often read and never put into action. Namely, if you are lucky enough to choose your work space, choose the one that is full of light that energizes you and fills you with positivity. Otherwise, try to make your workspace as pleasant as possible. Bring in plants, pictures that inspire you, like those of your family, clean the clutter! Clutter in the office can clutter your mind too, even if it may not seem so at first. Setting realistic goals is important. You may want to be the emperor of the world, but you certainly wonâ€™t achieve that without breaking your goals into small, actionable tasks, and break those Making your task actionable is the key. Something you can do right now and ideally doesnâ€™t take longer than an hour is perfect. Prioritizing tasks is just as important as is making them actionable. If you want to be a pro sportsman, you canâ€™t put anything but practice and eating right first in your life. Youâ€™ve got to give your whole self to your goal. When you do, itâ€™s easy to figure out what your priorities are. Even if your goal is just short term, in order to be more efficient you need to sit down and write down what steps you can take, in small chunks like described above, and after that sort them by priority â€“ the ones that you need to do first and canâ€™t do without are your top priority, of course. For example if you are writing a post â€“ first you would make subheadings that would help you know in your mind what you will write about in general, then would come the research, and after that the first draft. Second, third draft and so on come later, and are far less important. If you can always be positive, then there is nothing you wonâ€™t be able to achieve. Many people remain positive by using positive affirmations which they repeat to themselves each day either when they wake up or just before they get to sleep. Positive affirmations can also help people  , among other things. Finding your sweet spot means learning about yourself. Figure out what the best time to get up is for you. What foods feel best when you eat them? Who out of the people you know motivates you best, who and what gives you the most energy? It may take some time to figure out what your sweet spot is, but itâ€™s well worth it in the end, as you will at least double your productivity.",Thomas Allan

If you never thought about this before, I am sure you would have a conviction after reading to the very end of the last line of this article. So put on your seat belts, remain focused and avoid anything capable of distracting you while you read. A lot of bloggers are just doing blogging for the fun of it. Some are into the business because someone else has shared his testimony as to what he was able to achieve financially with his blog. In a nutshell, those guys are here to experiment; they want to see if what they were told was true. They are not too sure if they got the right information. They are also not sure whether it is really possible to  . Blogging keeps attracting a lot of people who are even convinced within themselves they are not good bloggers. They adopt every unthinkable survival tactic like content scraping, plagiarism, blackhat techniques, keyword stuffing, etc. to fit in and try to make a living in the blogosphere. Unfortunately they forget the fact that whatever you do in the wrong way would fade away sooner or later. The economic hardship, coupled with the high unemployment rate has made a lot of people become desperate to survive at all cost. The fact blogging has become popular in recent years and has turned several people into millionaires has made everyone feel it is a place to make decent money, with or without hard work. Come to think of it, it is not every blogger that made money online that actually made such money through the â€œwhitehatâ€ù method. Some made theirs the other way round. Their own testimonies have not really helped matters. However, with Googleâ€™s frequent change of algorithm, hard times await those bloggers who want to earn decent money without total commitment. Having looked at both sides of making money, itâ€™s time for us to get down to real business. So sit up properly because the plane is about to ascend into higher altitude (lol). You want to earn some passive income and take care of your numerous financial responsibilities, right? Then letâ€™s look at how you can build your money earning empire from scratch to the top:  Did I say it is possible to make money with your blog? Yes, I did! To start with, passion is critical to your financial success. To be able to start and then remain committed and focused, it is important to blog about your passion. Hard times would certainly come during the formative years of your blog, but it is the passion you have in your chosen niche that would keep you going. It is the passion that would keep the true blogger writing without being frustrated when the money does not come as expected. Passion would provide the impetus, the desire, the motivation and the inspiration to keep going. The rules of passion to observe here include: i.Be passionate about your niche. ii.Never blog about what you have no passion for. iii. Add passion to your writing tone and style. iv. Accept all temporary setbacks with passion. v. Treat your blog readers with passion. vi.Answer all questions with passion and vigour. If you add passion to every aspect of your blogging, the sky would be the starting point of your blogging success.  You are in the process of building a financial empire with blogging. The money is not going to come immediately. The potential to make money is already there. The money is locked up in your content; the more you write content and provide lucrative business ideas, the closer the money comes to you. The regularity of your writing and the quality of the content would bring the cash out faster than expected. So update regularly with the whole of your heart. If you blog about a particular topic and it brings you a thousand visitors, donâ€™t sit back to pop champagne. Never rest on your oars because failure to continue with the updates would make the visitors dry up in no distant time and return you to the status quo. Forget about money for now. No Google Adsense, no affiliate products, no e-books or anything else should be promoted on this blog yet. i. Blog regularly",Efoghor Joseph
22/06/2013,http://comluv.com/high-fiber-vegetables-debunking-the-mistery/,High fiber vegetables: debunking the mistery - ComLuv,"Although a regimen of regular exercise and eight hours of sleep each night assist in achieving a healthier lifestyle, a well-balanced diet Â that includes high fiber vegetables will maintain a properly functioning digestive system.Â High fiber vegetables, both soluble and insoluble, perform distinctive functions for fine-tuning several regions of the bodyâ€™s digestive system. There are two major types of fiber recognized by most scientists: soluble and insoluble. The digestive system turns soluble high fiber vegetables into a soft gel-like form as they travel through the digestive tract. This soluble fiber assists in lowering harmful system levels i.e. cholesterol and glucose. Although high-fiber is a complex carbohydrate, the digestive system does not break down the substance, therefore avoiding the increase of glucose levels while at the same time allowing the body to adjust positively to natural insulin levels. A diet rich in high-fiber vegetables naturally regulates glucose levels. Additionally, as the fibrous substance passes through regions of the digestive tract, cholesterol levels optimally adjust as well. This process helps protect against harmful conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure and complications resulting from diabetes. Another form of high-fiber food is insoluble fiber, which does not break down or become absorbed during the digestion process, rather remaining in bulk form. This form of high fiber roughage greatly benefits the bodyâ€™s digestion system while conditioning the bowels, colon, stomach and small intestine. The high fiber vegetables within the insoluble group travel through these regions of the body, cleansing each area as they pass. Found within the stomach are good bacteria and bad bacteria. The â€˜good bacteriaâ€™ is essential for fighting sickness while â€˜bad bacteriaâ€™ can increase fat and sugar levels. Insoluble fiber or indigestible roughage removes harmful toxins and bacteria while leaving behind the beneficial amounts of bacteria the body needs for proper regulation. Moreover, high fiber foods assist in regulating bowel movement and help towards correcting irregular bowel conditions such as constipation or diarrhea. Vegetables rich in high fiber provide an excellent resource for fighting and relieving inflammatory conditions within muscles, tendons and joints as well. Top high fiber foodsÂ include increased levels of antioxidants, the very substance that alleviates inflammation. The antioxidants within the fiber attack and remove inflammatory compounds while also improving painful conditions caused by inflammation. Further benefits of a high fiber diet help to regulate optimal weight levels. Both insoluble and soluble fiber takes longer to pass through the stomach, which allows the individual to feel full sooner, with fullness lasting longer than a diet high in fat and sugar. Diets consisting of foods high in sugar and fat provide a short and false feeling of fullness, increasing the need for ingesting more. Consuming vegetables high in fiber assist in controlling weight gain by reducing over-eating during an average meal. As with any substance, moderation is the key toward achieving and maintaining a healthy body. The average adult should only consume between 30-35 grams of high fiber vegetables daily. It is also important to consult your physician for ensuring the appropriate fiber intake necessary within your personal dietary plan. Each individualâ€™s dietary requirement varies and a licensed physician can provide the proper guidance. A trained professionalâ€™s supervision is important for overseeing and avoiding harmful interactions i.e. allergic and medicinal complications.",Adrian Ion
22/06/2013,http://comluv.com/stupidities-that-you-should-avoid-while-using-facebook/,Stupidities That You Should Avoid While Using Facebook - ComLuv,"Have you heard about Facebook? I know itâ€™s a stupid question because anyone who has internet connection must have used Facebook or at least have heard about it. But while using Facebook, we often commit certain kind of stupidities that proves us a fool. Facebook no doubt, is the best way to share your thoughts and ideas, remain connected with friends and relatives, but this connectivity sometimes becomes the reason of embarrassment. Facebook is like an anonymous world where everyone is unknown to each other except friends and family members. So, to take advantage of this anonymity, some people use negative activities to just promote their thoughts, ideas or whatever they want and because of lack of awareness some of us easily become their prey and then face embarrassment. Sometimes we our self, commit such foolish and idiotic acts that are pure form of awkwardness. Below are some stupidities that we should avoid while using Facebook. It has been observed that some culprits, by representing themselves as Facebook employee, demand money in order to continue using Facebook by posting warning messages and by other methods, targeting specific user profiles. So, make it solid clear in your mind that Facebook is totally free to use. Facebook never charge its users. The only source of income for Facebook is advertisements that are shown on the website. So, whenever you encounter such type of message, just let it go. Most of you must have seen messages saying that â€œThis child is suffering from cancer. Facebook will donate 1$ to this child for each like.â€ù So, remember Facebook is not a welfare organization. This is just a trick to increase the visitors of Facebook page. So, donâ€™t waste your precious time by liking and sharing such type of messages and photos. Few months ago, I came across a picture of Bill Gates holding a card which says that Bill Gates will give $5000 to anyone who will share this photo and I was shocked and laughing at the same time that almost 50,000 people have already shared that photo and might be waiting for the money. Bill gates will become the poorest person on earth if he starts such campaigns. This is only one example. There are many other cases in which money is offered for just sharing the message. These types of messages are not more than just Playing games on Facebook is a latest trend and it is not a bad activity either. Even I play games on Facebook but sending unnecessary invites to your friends is like force someone to have a shower in a cold night. Sending game invites to your friends annoys them and it could end the relation with your friends. This can cause your friends to un-friend you from their friends list. So, avoid unnecessary game invitations and try to send only them who are very close to you or who also play the same game on Facebook. There are millions of photos and messages posted on Facebook every day and not all of them are factual. So, donâ€™t believe on every picture and message and make sure to confirm their originality before sharing. For example, if you a see a health tip posted by someone on Facebook, so donâ€™t even think to implement it before verifying it by an expert. Similarly, people often post pictures and write captions which have relation no with the picture. But because of lack of awareness, users believe on those pictures and start writing comment and sharing with their friends. Malware can be in form of pictures or videos on Facebook. Malware always seems to be interesting because if it is not then it is not malware. Malware often contains stories and visuals that are far from reality and boost curiosity and when you click on one, the rest will be done by malware. The story automatically shared with your friends and if clicked by one of your friend then it will reach further to your friendâ€™s friends and the chain continues. The conclusion is that we cannot blame Facebook for these nonconstructive activities. Facebook was developed as a social network and to provide opportunity to remain connected with friends and relatives, to share our ideas and thoughts. But negativity is everywhere. Everyone who uses Facebook must have awareness about every positive and negative aspect of Facebook and utilize the biggest social network accordingly.",Usama Rehan

Well, I can give you a sneak peek but I have to tell you before hand that, I am not making huge money. I donâ€™t have a Nissan GTR. Yet. I donâ€™t have a big house with a personal gym room and Olympic size swimming pool. How I wish I do. _Ÿ™‚ To be frank, what I have   is the online income that is just enough for me to work at home and take care of the baby. With that being said, my wife is still working for others and experiencing the kind of disturbing things you get when you are in a job. I expect that she can resign and work at home (on what she likes) too probably in another 4-6 months. So you see, I am just like you (so do all successful affiliate marketers when they started their affiliate marketing business) working the way to be a successful affiliate marketer. But in the near future, I believe we will be able to reach our goal. So if you still want to see how my day is, then  â€_ My days usually started with the baby cries and then are the chores to clean, feed and set him down in his walker. Once those are done, only I am able to start my computer and the 1  thing I do is to check my email to see how much I have made for my affiliate marketing business. Sometime when I look at those wonderful emails, I will recall the time when I have to bang myself to the wall because my email was full with training, sales offer and other stuff instead of sales confirmation. I think some of you can relateâ€_ Once the fun of checking with the numbers is done, is time to read the emails from my outsource team. If you have been reading my post here, you should know that I also drive traffic with solo ads, banner ads, article marketing and other outsourcing stuff. I have to spend time reviewing the result and the delivered work from the freelancers. Iâ€™ll need to manage the portals and outsource talents for anything that need to be fixed. I am lucky that thing is smoother now compare to the early days when I started outsourcing and building my team. At that time, I have to constantly communicate with the freelancers to get them to see what I want. It was a huge hassle. Freelancers come and go because we canâ€™t seem to understand each other. If you are doing the same thing now, I recommend you have a video chat using Gmail and share documents with Google Docs to get things done more effectively. Usually when I finish the reviewing job, it is almost noon and I should have brought the baby in and out Life as an affiliate marketer is tough. To be an affiliate marketer with a baby around is even more challenging. Thatâ€™s why I need my nap time too. One good thing about the baby boy is that he can only stay asleep for an hour or so during noon. This makes him a wonderful alarm clock. _Ÿ™‚ Once I settled him after we woke up, it is time to put in my own effort for my business. The only thing I am still doing myself is writing for  , guest blogging and social media publishing. This seems to be a very challenging task to many people but I seem to find serenity in writing. For the guest blogging, ComLuv is my only portal. I have to give some credit to ComLuv because many of my guest posts at ComLuv were able to rank up page 1 at Google. So, if you are just reading this and wonder how you can get more traffic to your website, Â _Ÿ™‚ I have to admit that I have been slagging with the guest posting. I am not finger pointing but with the little boy around, some time I just have to spend more time looking after him instead of letting him crawl around unsupervised. I have heard too many scary stories due to parentsâ€™ negligence. After finish writing, I will dedicate 1-2 hours for my social media publishing. Because I canâ€™t be in the social media platforms all the time, I use some social media management tool namely   and   to help me manage the portals. I can only say these tools have helped me a lot to free myself from attaching at the laptop. For your information, you need to leverage on technology to be an affiliate marketer with productivity. So when I am done with all these work, it is time to prepare the ingredient for dinner for the family and get the little boy to shower. My wife will then cook the dinner when she comes back from work and relief me of some of work for the little baby. Thatâ€™s when I can have a breather. I have spared you from the nitty gritty stuff about taking care of a baby because I donâ€™t want to bore you. But in reality, it can be really taxing. I hope so too. Unfortunately we still need to run some house chores, watch baby channel, read to the boy and get him to sleep. It is only when he is asleep that I can talk to my wife or continues my affiliate marketing work. Putting the finishing touches to these tasks will usually keep me occupy until 1am. Then before I go to bed, I will spend roughly an hour reading, watching and listening to motivational materials to keep me charged for my goal to be a successful affiliate marketer. With that, I am going to leave you with this 12 minutes video about the early life and success of the great Arnold Schwarzenegger. [youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJPRj19OU-w]",Michael
20/06/2013,http://comluv.com/you-are-as-rich-as-you-allow-yourself-to-be/,You Are As Rich As You Allow Yourself To Be - ComLuv,"We can achieve anything we set our minds to. If you wish to become rich, you can do that, but you will certainly need to make lots of changes not just in what you do, but also in how you think. Here are a few things rich people have in common when it comes to the way they think: Rich people are always on the lookout for opportunity to grow. They take risks easily, especially when they are afraid, as fear signifies that this is the field that you will most benefit from when you conquer it. When you donâ€™t allow yourself to take any chances, you donâ€™t allow yourself to find out your limits and you never get to surpass them. Furthermore, when you are not going forward, you are going backwards in life â€“ there is no stagnation! Rich people love the things they do, they take pride in their work. They also love their dreams and are inspired at the mere thought of their goal. If you donâ€™t have a dream that inspires you, the first step you need to take is to search deep into your soul and find where your inspiration lies. When you are not inspired by the place at which you may end up at, then there is no interest to hurry to get there. Rich people realize that they are solely responsible for everything that has happened, does happen and will happen in their lives. The seeds that you plant will grow tomorrow, or in a year, or ten years from now. You are in control of what you plant today, and what you will harvest tomorrow. Rich people always, always focus on the positive. It is so easy to get caught up in the negative mindset, to curse faith when things donâ€™t go your way, to cry and moan and complain. But behavior like that just invites more of what you donâ€™t want into your life. And being positive and thankful invites more of positivity into your life as well. Rich people are happy. When you are positive and do what you like, when you have some results behind you, it may seem easy to be happy. And it likely is. But real happiness is not in the place you are at the moment. Real happiness lies in the roads you take to get there. No matter where you end up, you will always crave for that next step. You can never stop and stand still, as when you do, that is the moment you will stop being happy. Rich people always thank those around them. They thank the universe for being so kind to them. And because they are so thankful, they invite more happiness, positivity, luck, growth and happiness into their lives. Rich people get bombarded by negativity just as much as you do. So, they know that they need to use something to help them think positively and something that will offset that negativity. So, they either use  , positive affirmations, NLP,  , meditation, or any other practice that makes them feel happy and remain positive. They take at least thirty minutes out of their busy lives just for themselves and their little shrine of positivity, but those thirty minutes are enough to fill the whole day with an aura of success.",Thomas Allan
19/06/2013,http://comluv.com/what-are-your-options-when-choosing-a-hosting-solution/,What Are Your Options When Choosing A Hosting Solution?,"Choosing the right website hosting solution can sometimes very easily mean the difference between life and death for your website. There are a few options and each has its own perks and benefits, but also downsides, which is why you need to choose carefully. This is why it is necessary to plan ahead and see the full potential that your website can achieve. Should you think that you stumbled into these waters unprepared and have no clue as to what your options are, I will try to solve some mysteries regarding hosting and how it functions for you. Primarily, I will list for you some of the most popular solutions that can be found. They will be ordered according to the quality of service that they provide. I will, later, go on and explain each of them more broadly, just so that you can skip wandering through the dark. The four most popular hosting solutions are: There is still a debate going on about whether cloud or dedicated provide better service, but, in my opinion, cloud hosting provides a bit more pennyâ€™s worth than dedicated, as I will explain later. Shared hosting means exactly what you think it means. There is a server somewhere out there, and you pay for a piece of that server to be yours. That server is shared with a few other users and they all use its resources. This, of course, means that the security is rather low. Also, you will have little, or no, control over the setup of the server and your capabilities will be quite limited. Because of all this, this is not the option that would be recommended for anyone aside from people who own websites with little to average traffic. For them, this is the right solution, because it comes cheaply. VPS (or Virtual Private Server) hosting is somewhat similar to the shared hosting option. It is similar because, once again, you pay for a container on a server which is shared with a few other people. However, the difference is that, within this container, you get allocated resources just for you. These resources include disk space, RAM, Bandwidth and CPU. With these, you are free to do as you please, and no amount of traffic that the other users experience will take these away from you (unless the whole server crashes). Also, another better thing about this type of hosting is that you get to use the control panel, which will enable you to adjust just about Here, we come to a solution which involves you obtaining a complete server just for yourself. This server gets stored in the data center of the provider and you have all the benefits of having your own server machine. You have the option of choosing the level of support that you require, which ranges from full to none. If you wish, you can have your own people look after the server, as long as you do not physically damage it. Using your own server also allows you to have full access to it, you can change whatever you like on it (yes, this includes the operating system, as well) and, of course, you will be completely protected. The biggest problem here, however, is hardware change. If you wish to change something in the machine, you have to power it down, change and then power it up, again. This might sound simple, but it isnâ€™t, and it can easily get more complicated. And, should anything happen to the machine, you will have to rely on the backup of your website (if you have made one). This is the youngest member of the hosting family. It is, also, similar to shared hosting, but, the key difference here is that you do not share one server, but a group of servers (or, a cloud). This brings new possibilities, such as taking as much resources as you need. Should your website experience a great spike in activity, you will be able to allocate more resources from one of the servers and you will not have to suffer any downtime. The flexibility with which   operates is its primary advantage over all the other solutions. Also, this means that, instead of paying ahead for the resources, you pay for what you have used. Operating in a cloud also enables other servers to cover for one malfunctioning machine, which means that, should one of the servers crash, your website will remain up and running. So, hopefully, I have managed to clear up some confusion about the different options and web hosting services. All of these hosting solutions are available to anyone who can afford them, it is up to you to decide which one suits your needs the most.",Ivan Dimitrijevic

But the Abominable Snowman is not just a hairy upright beast reaching heights of 7 plus feet tall. Apparently there are clans of these things roaming the Tibetan-Himalayan area. Another popular name for the Abominable Snowman is Yeti, and supposedly theyâ€™ve appeared in many different sizes. Ranging from small, large and extra-large. But according to witnesses of this beastly monstrosity, the larger variety are the ones most closely related to Bigfoot. I believe the Everglades call him the Skunk Ape as well. Although the Chinese ape-man bears a strong resemblance, there seems to be many variations of these creatures. Is it possible these may all be geographically different races to one single species? Or possibly there are several different types that have absolutely nothing in common with one another. Set aside them walking in an upright position and bearing lots and lots of hair. There are many activists that will fight against the notion of killing a  , or  , simply for study purposes. They see it as an act of murder or maybe further endangering a small population of creature. But according to John Green, a well known bigfoot hunter, â€œThere is not the slightest possibility that Sasquatches can be considered human or near-human, neither are they an endangered speciesâ€_â€ù According to Green there are tons of these creatures roaming about the wilderness. He believes them to be a gentle creature, that would do no harm to man. Theyâ€™ve simply been monsterized by folks that canâ€™t imagine them being a normal part of the animal kingdom.

Their explanation for itâ€™s elusive nature is that the creatures lives so far out of human civilization that they just arenâ€™t seen very often. Supposedly, the   makes itâ€™s home deep within the Himalayan forests, not in the snow zones as the stories go. Eye witness accounts have pointed out that the Yeti is known for moving about on all fours and is capable of swinging from tree to tree. Itâ€™s only when the creatures venture close to the snow regions that mountaineers are able to catch a quick glimpse or spot their tracks. Rumors say that itâ€™s at this point where they will rise and walk upright in an attempt to scare off any enemies. The   is said to be a lot more curious than itâ€™s Asian counterpart, but does live a very reclusive lifestyle all the same. Living in the United States myself, I hear many more stories related to this area about people having encounters with Sasquatch ( )Â  which is said to be basically a distant cousin to the Yeti or Abominable Snowman. But the stories around this area are not nearly as gentle. Many of the eyewitness accounts in the U.S. consist of horrible encounters where people were attacked or had things thrown at them by these creatures. Once again this could all be sensationalized propaganda to gain attention by some, but normally where there is a myth or legend, there also lies some truth. I wrote a post on   quite some time ago that goes into some detailed accounts by witnesses, or victims, how ever you wanna look at it. But some of these horrific tales are quite scary. According to researchers in my neck of the woods, the Sasquatch is supposed to give off an extremely foul odor and has a terrible sounding howl. I know if I was in the woods and heard something like that Iâ€™d be running for the hills. The smell alone would probably be enough for me to high tail it out of thereâ€_lol So, we donâ€™t really know what to think about all this, whether these creatures are actually real, or maybe some fantasy stories blown way out of proportion. But why have we never found any bones, or grave sites? No remains of feeding or excrement like you would expect to see from any woodland creature. Is it possible this species is intelligent enough to bury itâ€™s dead deep beneath the earth? Could they be covering their tracks that well? Native American tribes have suggested they have some mystical powers that makes them invisible to man. Have you ever had an encounter with a Bigfoot, Sasquatch or Abominable Snowman? Are all these creatures of the same blood, just different races of different regions? Help me to uncover this mystery in the comments below.",Robert Tuttle

If your diet isnâ€™t that great, those blood and urine tests will rat you out in no time. But what about the important stuff, like your risk for heart attack or stroke? A traditional annual blood test wonâ€™t necessarily measure inflammation risks and the health problems that could come with it. But thereâ€™s one inexpensive way to find out; you just need to ask. Inflammation, in its natural state, is good. Itâ€™s the bodyâ€™s fight response to invaders. Whenever we get a cold, the flu, or even a cut, the body sends out these cellular soldiers to make repairs. This is the reaction you see when you see that red swelling on your skin. The   starts with a cut or bruise. Next, the body calls for elements to heal this cut or bruise and to get rid of any foreign substances that donâ€™t belong. Once â€œthe teamâ€ù is recruited, repairs start and that leads to moving substances from place to another in order to mend the site. Lastly, with the movement of these mending agents, there is fluid accumulation that slows the flow of blood and localizes the problem site. The good thing about the excess fluid is that it dilutes irritants and neutralizes toxins that may be present around the wound. Thatâ€™s why sites around cuts and bruises get really hot for a time. After things are on the mend, that heat dies down and so does the redness, swelling, and pain. Thatâ€™s the good, natural process. So, what happens when the body is in a constant state of â€œfightâ€ù? When that heat part doesnâ€™t go away, thatâ€™s when inflammation can become dangerous. The danger is more cumulative than immediate. Soldiers that are meant to protect your body from harmful invaders, wind up attacking the body itself. The inflammation process destroys tissue which leads to more inflammation, and the cycle goes on. This constant destruction can affect: To find out your overall risk, you can take a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. A CRP test is a simple, inexpensive blood test that measures the level of overall inflammation in the body. Now, everyone has some form of inflammation happening; so no one is going to be completely clean. First time results can be used as a baseline against future inflammation and activity. The rule is that anything below 10mg/L is considered normal. Based on these results, your doctor can run a high-sensitivity CRP blood test, that is more strict; anything below 1mg/L is low risk, anything above 3mg/L is high risk, and anything in between is average. If youâ€™re still high risk after that then your doctor may request more extensive tests to find out whatâ€™s really going on. CRP test results can change based on lifestyle. If you are a smoker, your inflammation risk is usually higher than non-smokers. Other risk factors include blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and physical activity. Getting those antioxidants in your diet can also help as free radicals cause inflammation. Bottom line is, just because you may be in the high risk range, doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s over. You can make changes, get better, and reduce your chances in the long run. All it takes is one simple CRP test that costs less than a movie ticket.",Dianne
13/06/2013,http://comluv.com/4-rooms-4-small-project-for-an-improved-home/,"4 Rooms, 4 Small Project for an Improved Home - ComLuv","The big secret to home improvement that many people donâ€™t know: little upgrades can make big differences. So while you save your pennies for the big projects, like remodeling your kitchen or finishing your basement, you can continually improve the look of your home by undertaking smaller tasks. Given enough time you could probably come up with dozens of improvements for each room in your house. But in reality, each room really needs only one upgrade to make an impact. In this post weâ€™ll explore four major rooms in your home and the one improvement that can make the biggest difference. When you look around your living room it might seem as though you need to change everything. With a new carpet, new sofas, a new entertainment center, and maybe a new TV you could really spice up that frequently used room. Not only would your family appreciate the upgrade, but so would your guests. And yet, it would cost several thousand dollars to make those upgrades. It is, in other words, a long-term project that requires plenty of saving for the average family. It might not seem like the case, but when you make the change youâ€™ll notice it. The one piece of furniture that really holds together a living room is, wait for it, the coffee table. Itâ€™s a small piece of furniture, maybe not noticeable when youâ€™re looking around the room. Yet it can make a huge difference in how your living room appears. If you do it right, it wonâ€™t cost you more than a hundred dollars or so. Upgrading the coffee table wonâ€™t solve a problem like the carpet not matching the couch. But it can turn a plain, drab room into a livelier one. Why does the coffee table make such a difference? Because it sits in the center of the room. Everything arranges around it. And so while you might not notice it unless youâ€™re looking for it, you can also use the coffee table to upgrade your living room. Have you ever gotten an estimate on replacing your kitchen cabinets? If you have, you know the bill shock that comes with installing  . For an older home with dilapidated cabinets the cost can be well worth it. Yet there is a way to change the appearance of your kitchen without spending the truckload of money youâ€™ll need for new cabinet installation. The doors are really what people see. With new cabinet doors, plus some sanding of the frames and some paint, you can change When people think about remodeling their bathrooms, most often they think about two things: tile and wallpaper. After all, those two aspects add color to the room. Theyâ€™re also things that stick out when they get old. Nothing makes a bathroom look dirtier than peeling wallpaper or tiles decaying grout. And really, if the grout is decaying and the wallpaper is peeling you should probably replace them â€” though you can always  . But if not, there is one other bathroom piece that can change everything. Some day, some home improvement company will create a tool wherein you can upload a photo of your bathroom and then replace the vanity with a new one. I think it would convince many homeowners to scrap plans to retile and wallpaper their bathrooms and go with a new vanity. This one might be a bit more expensive than the other improvement, but you wouldnâ€™t believe what kind of difference it makes. As a personal anecdote: when growing up my parents always hated our bathrooms. We rarely had guests because of this. When I got older and they came into more money, they started making improvements around the house. Like most people, they retiled and wallpapered the bathrooms. They looked nicer for sure, but the new tile and the new wallpaper put an even bigger emphasis on the ugly vanity. One weekend I came home from college to find new vanities in both bathrooms, and I couldnâ€™t believe how different they looked. The difference was far greater than when they did the wallpaper and tile upgrades. A little paint can change the look of any room, but in no room does paint stand out more than in a bedroom. Thatâ€™s probably because bedrooms are small, enclosed areas. The walls are all near each other, and so the pain really stands out. Merely painting a bedroomâ€™s walls can completely change its look and feel. So take inventory, decide which color looks best, and take the plunge. Between paint and supplies you can probably get away with a bill under $200, with each additional room being that much cheaper (because you wonâ€™t have to buy brushes, drop cloths, and other supplies). Want to spend a bit more and make a bedroom really pop? Hereâ€™s a post about spending $400 on a  . The before and after photos tell the entire story here. And, again, if you want to do more than one room youâ€™ll spend less than $400 on the second, because youâ€™ll have supplies leftover from the first.",Joe Pawlikowski

You must be having a really serious and well-thought agenda to arrive here. However, donâ€™t be in a hurry to jump on the blogging bandwagon. There are many competitors out here whom you need to beat to be at the top of the Google search results. If you wish to set up a blog just for fulfilling your communicative needs or for the purpose of catharsis, then you donâ€™t need to worry about following all the rules. But, if you are here for promoting your websites or company products, you need to be careful about many things. Ten Things to Do before a Blog Launch: Your very purpose of setting up a blog is to put down the best content that you are capable of. Nobody comes here for the sake of mere promotion; there are other ways to accomplish that like use of ads, posters, banners. Think of various topics for your content. Search online for similar content and find if it is selling, popular, or hardly visible. So, brush your content writing skills, think of the best and the most original ideas, and think of ways to engage the readers to the max. Donâ€™t just let visitors be plain visitors; try hard to convert them into readers and active sharers. Only if they read, they will be tempted to share. And they will share it only if there is something new or strikingly good. Nobody shares commonly known facts or stories. Some spice, useful piece of information, or a lovely narrative is what they share through various social media like Facebook, Twitter, or Google Plus, etc. Write content that is not just interesting but deadly viral. Some pieces of content are not that useful but their weirdness or outrÃ© nature makes them viral. These have garnered popularity in recent times as an effective way to promote a blog or website. Offer incentives and prizes to those who are the first ones to share your tweets or to those who comment on them in the best possible way. Contests like â€˜prizes for the best answerâ€™ are highly attractive to users, and make them participate actively. The most common mistake that most Attend to the technical aspects of your blog in detail like font, graphics, navigation, structure, etc. If people get confused or lost while going through your blog, then it is a bad blog design. Get your blog designed from an expert; hire a professional web design UK company for the best results. Donâ€™t stick to your own blog; post comments actively on other blogs of similar genre. By doing this, you increase your interaction with similar bloggers who will be curious to know about your blog. They will click on your blog link thus increasing its visibility. Accurate Testing Test your blog several times before launching. Fix all the bugs found during the testing process. Check whether Gmail, Google Analytics, Webmaster, and other tools are working smoothly. Without Google Analytics, how will you measure your site traffic? Even if you are going to use only one or two profiles very actively, donâ€™t restrain setting up accounts on only one or two social media; Register on all the social media tools available on the internet currently. You never know who might show interest in your blog posts. Making a checklist of all the stuff you need for your blogs is a great way to be sure you havenâ€™t missed out anything. Go through the checklist before the blog launch. To get the most exciting and attractive design for your blog, hire Web design Cambridge professional service providers.",Anis Emitez

But thatâ€™s not the whole â€œfatâ€ù story. Â When it comes to fats,Â  some donâ€™t realize is that not all fat is the enemy. Now, when I say fat, your mind probably goes to oils, butter, and animal fats, all fats we   but what Iâ€™m talking about is the fat in the body. White adipose tissue (WAT), also known as white fat, is one of the two types of body fat and this is the fat thatâ€™s measured in the gym, using a caliper.Â  This fat can be under the skin (subcutaneous) or around your organs (visceral).Â  When there is too much subcutaneous or visceral white fat especially around the midsection, it can cause health problems.Â  Excessive belly fat plays a significant role in significant health problems such asÂ  metabolic syndrome and diabetes.Â  Additionally, the   is even investigating a link between excessive belly fat and dementia. Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) is fat that is present in mammals, most abundantly in newborns and animals. This type of fat is naturally thermogenic and has iron-rich mitochondria, which gives it a brown color. Babies have an abundance of BAT (about 5% of mass) because it helps them regulate their body temperature and fight off the cold. This form of thermogenesis is present in hibernating animals which explains why bears, for example, lose so much weight during this period. As we grow up we lose enough brown fat and the white fat is becomes more prevalent. Brown fatâ€™s thermogenesis comes from burning white fat. Â This is important to understand because despite the name, scientists believe that itâ€™s more closely related to muscle than white fat. Considering that leaner adults have more brown fat and that muscle burns white fat, the relationship makes sense. So, is there a way for adult humans to capitalize on our own brown fat phenomenon? Well, scientists were able to   but as far as humans, thereâ€™s hope. While brown fat is present in the neck and chest areas of adults, finding a way to naturally turn on the furnace could lead to more help in fighting obesity. As I mentioned, brown fat is most abundant in babies and hibernating animals and therein lays the key to possibly stimulating brown fat in adults. The one thing both babies and hibernating animals have in common is that BAT is activated by cold exposure; itâ€™s like a defense mechanism to protect the bodyâ€™s naturally hot state. A   talked about the therapeutic potential of cold-induced thermogenesis and in May 2012, University of Cambridge scientists found  . It may take years for this medical research to really get to the bottom of this phenomenon but until then, what can we do? In addition to drinking more green tea, which induces thermogenesis thanks to that mixture of EGCG and caffeine, you need to expose ourselves to the cold. BAT is activated by cold so little things showering with water between 68 F-75 F (20 C-24 C) for 5-10 minutes can help. Other possibilities are taking a walk around the block in cold weather or reducing the thermostat inside the house so that itâ€™s a little chillier. Â Remember, the key is to activate brown fat not induce a state of hypothermia so be safe get some feedback from your health care provider if this could be a health risk. Whether you choose green tea, cold showers or both, getting BAT active helps you to naturally lose weight and keep your metabolism going throughout your life.",Dianne

These kind of events are what separates the great bloggers from the rest of the pack. So what can these events be? What kind of blogging disasters did I face? To tell the truth, I did face quite a few blogging nightmares that could have stopped me from continuing my blogging career, but they didnâ€™t and I am proud of that. During these difficult times, I did get thoughts like â€“ â€œWhy I am continuing blogging, this is going to be such a wasteâ€_..â€ù â€œIâ€™d rather be doing something else, my hard-work has not paid offâ€_.â€ù But then I had better thoughts which made me realize that blogging is what I do for fun and is something I really enjoy doing, so I continued on, rectifying the errors. This attitude saw the problems go away. So what were these blogging disasters that I faced? I hosted my first few blogs on the BlogSpot platform where everything looked like blue skies and rainbows. Free hosting, free domain name, zero input, total profit. Things were going really well, I was getting a lot of traffic, good repeating visitors and then this happened. One day I woke up to find my blog deleted.As you know Google controls all the blogger accounts and can delete any blog without giving notice to the blogger.Even till today I do not know why Google deleted that blog, but a simple mail to blogger support got the blog back to me with all the contents intact. But for the three days it took to get my blog back, I felt so sad and it was not I like I had a few posts and it didnâ€™t But thankfully, things returned back to normal _Ÿ™‚ Okay, so right now, Adsense is not a big income source for me from my two blogs, It hardly makes any difference when combined with my affiliate and sponsored post earnings, but back then when I had just one blog which had decent traffic, Adsense was the ultimate source of making money from my blogs. I am sure all small time bloggers dread the mail which says â€œAdsense suspendedâ€ù, I am fortunate to have never received the Adsense Banned mail, but still it was a dreaded mail. Again I could feel the sadness, after all the hard-work, losing adsense would have been bad.But thankfully, the fix was pretty simple.The mail said that I had to put in a Privacy Policy in my blog or my adsense account would be terminated as according Google Adsense policies, every blog that runs adsense ads needs to have a privacy policy. I did put in a privacy policy and hence got the suspension revoked in a few days. I had heard about the impending Google algorithm updates and I was not really that phased by them, I had never copied any posts, I didnâ€™t have too many ads, I did not buy links, I did not do any of the blackhat stuff.But it happened. Traffic was slashed by 50% and I was going mad thinking of why this happened to me.There were literally tons of blogs with â€œbad contentâ€ù which did not get affected, but mine did. After researching a lot, I found the answer on a search engine forum.Page Load Time. I was always one to try out new widgets, add design CSS, try to make my blog look trendy with Flash and Java-Scripts.I had done myself a lot of harm by doing this.When I checked my blog page speed test on Google, it wasÂ 37/100,Â which if you donâ€™t know,Â means that a tortoise can finish a 100m race before my page got fully loaded. Got over that phase too with a lot of tweaking and ultimately totally changing my blog theme.What a relief. So these were the three blogging disasters that I faced, fortunately I have not experienced any others and hopefully wonâ€™t in the future too.Because of these experiences, I now know how to avoid these on my new blog.This is how people become experienced bloggers.

So before throwing away your advertising dollars, it makes perfect sense to first  .Â  At first, that may seem to go directly against the grain from what every online guru on the planet has ever said about website conversionsâ€_but Google actually likes you more when you go out of your way to ignore SEO. While the various   have always been closely guarded secrets, we donâ€™t need to know the actual formula to know that the search engine giants prefer unique, frequently updated content across our websites.Â  Instead, 100% of your website copy should be optimized to give your visitors a superior experience.Â  Not only does Google measure your websiteâ€™s success based on numerous on-site metrics (number of pages visited, time on-site, etc.), but the entire point behind a business website is to convert readers into buyers.Â  Why on Earth would you do anything to jeopardize that?Â  If your only goal is to write content for Google, then youâ€™re likely going to end up losing out with customers and search engines alike. Likewise, it is important to remember that if someone is typing your product or service into a search engine, there is almost a 90% chance that theyâ€™re already a motivated buyer.Â  So many websites lose out on sales because they put forth so much effort on overselling an item that the consumer has already planned to purchase in the first place.Â  Just give your customers a solid description and let the product speak for itself. If that doesnâ€™t make complete sense to you, then letâ€™s look at it from a different perspective.Â  Two of the worldâ€™s largest online marketplaces,   and  , have absolutely no SEO content to be found on their product pages.Â  Their descriptions are generally sparse as well, because these powerhouse companies know that   from recommending similar products.Â  While you may not have anywhere near the PageRank of these business moguls, it doesnâ€™t mean that you canâ€™t learn from them just the same. Ever since the launch of the very first search engines back in the early 1990â€™s, the goal has always been to allow the website with the best overall user experience to rank atop the charts.Â  While content is definitely still king in terms of long-term growth, it is essential to remember that there is no substitute for a happy customer.Â  If you keep your visitors coming back time and time again because of great products, superior customer service and/or unbeatable prices, thatâ€™s more important in the eyes of Google than 50 SEO articles and 100 backlinks.

08/06/2013,http://comluv.com/top-ten-ways-the-earth-can-get-destroyed/,Top Ten Ways The Earth Can Get Destroyed,"Since Earth is an unique place in our universe because it harbors intelligent life, many often worry about how the Earth can get destroyed or what will happen if something catastrophic happens. The outer space is a violent place and some of things out there are really powerful. Some are powerful enough to wipe out our planet in a matter of moments. Asteroids, also called minor planets are mostly found in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Thanks to Jupiterâ€™s incredible gravitational pull, all of the asteroids are kept in control and it prevents them from flying off in different direction. But sometimes, some of them do occasionally get out of control.  One such is named as 99942 Apophis. The asteroid caused a lot of worry because it was predicted that it would strike the earth in 2029. That however was ruled out, and it was stated that it could come back and hit earth in 2036 if it passed through a Gravitational Keyhole. Later, it too was ruled out with more accurate predictions. Even though we managed to avoid one disaster, it doesnâ€™t mean that there arenâ€™t other asteroids out there. Unlike asteroids, comets are mostly ice that shows off a tail when they pass close to the stars they revolve around. Comets follow generally follow hyperbolic or elliptical paths from way outside the solar systems. Though comets are smaller than asteroids, they have much higher speeds than asteroids. When close to the stars, they can travel at speeds of 250,000 km/h. Higher speed means higher kinetic energy and when it hits something (if Earth) with that speed, you can only imagine the kind of destruction it will cause. Coronal Mass Ejections are a form solar storm which are mostly associated with Solar Flares. Huge solar flares are created on the surface of the sun because of the incredibly complex magnetic fields of the Sun. The complex magnetic fields are a result of the movement of plasma in the different directions. The magnetic field causes super storms which shoots out highly energized radiations. Severe or powerful CMEs can wipe out the entire electrical infrastructure around the globe. High radiation can cause lotâ€™s of problems for us humans. A super CME can easily make conditions difficult for us and make Earth inhospitable. Black Holes are one of the most elusive objects in the universe. Invisible to everything , they are one of the most powerful forces in the university. Even the fastest in the universe â€“ Light canâ€™t escape itâ€™s grip. Black Holes are the densest entity in the universe. With infinite mass compressed into a infinitesimally small (almost zero) it has almost infinite density and this is where the laws of physics breaks down.If one of them were to come too close to Earth, our planet would be sucked into it almost instantly and shredded into untraceable pieces. Supernovae are one of the powerful explosions in the cosmos. Caused by a star which has exhausted itâ€™s fuel and when the core of the star explodes. The threat to our planet from supernova A close enough supernova (about 26 light years) could deplete half of the ozone layer in the earthâ€™s atmosphere and then there would be no stopping by the radiations coming towards the earth from different directions of outer space. Like the supernova, hypernova is also a type of stellar explosion. Mostly occurs in heavier stars than the sun (at least 15 times more massive) , they are more powerful than standard supernovae and are often associated with long duration gamma-ray bursts. A long duration gamma ray bursts can cause the life on earth to end. It has long been considered that the Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction was caused by a long duration gamma ray bursts from a hypernova. Pulsars are powerful rotating neutron stars that emits gamma ray bursts. Pulsars are formed after a supernova when the core of the star collapses onto itself to form highly dense neutron stars. Neutron stars retain most of their angular momentum and they pulsate after frequent time intervals. The longest known pulse upto now has been calculated as 9.5 seconds. If that were to hit earth , it would have vaporized earthâ€™s ozone layer along with significant part of the atmosphere. Quasars are are the most luminous objects in the universe. They are the most powerful and and brightest objects in the outer space. Quasars are usually found at very large distances typically at few million light years or few billion light years. Quasars emit extremely powerful gamma ray bursts constantly and they are powerful enough to be seen billions of light years with the naked eye. One hit of the powerful gamma ray to Earth and it would disintegrate everything in a matter of moments. The mass of the sun is small enough that it wonâ€™t go supernova. Instead, it would ultimately collapse into a white dwarf. But before that, it goes through the Red Giant stage. Itâ€™s a stage where the sunâ€™s atmosphere expands because of higher fusion temperature when the hydrogen fuel runs out and it starts burning helium to fight gravity. The Red Giant would be so large that it would consume the orbits of Mercury and Venus. The Earth would not get sucked into the sun because of lower gravitational pull and it would have floated much farther from the sun. Though life as we know it would end because of the heat from the dun. All the water would vaporize and the earth would become inhospitable. Galactic collisions are very common although they take millions or billions of years to occur. The Andromeda and the Milky Way galaxy are destined to collide in the future about 1.4 billion years from now. Galactic collisions creates much larger super massive black holes because of the merger of the two. Although there are huge distances between the stars of a galaxy and it is extremely rare for a solar system to be wiped out because of the merger, you never know the odds. If it were to collide with other planets, life as we know it would be completely wiped out.",Lahaul Seth

Everyone (including me) would want to generate handsome income online. However, such desirable income depends so much on the amount and quality of traffic that flows to your site. So, you need to unravel the most successful ways to keep visitors flocking to your blog or website. A good number of the known traffic generation strategies are on their own effective, while some require a little tweaking here and there to make them compatible and most effective for your own type of online business. PPC is among the most successful tools for traffic generation. It simply requires advertising your URLs or banners on well-known websites. PPC is result-oriented but would put a little pressure on your pocket. Article submission is also another effective traffic generation  that comes with good rewards. Creating unique and quality articles can generate good traffic to your website or blog. Such articles may be duplicated in wide range of websites and also attract several targeted traffics. If readers find your articles irresistible, they are likely to explore your author bio and would irresistibly click on your link. Donâ€™t ruin your author bio by adding too many URLs. Only Participating actively and consistently on forums would offer you high exposure and people would be attracted to your posts through your links. For instance, if you are specialized in weight loss services, you should not hesitate to participate on weight loss and health related forums; this way, you will eventually attract targeted traffic (people who want to lose weight and live healthy). The clicks from the folks in the forum will generate traffic that you need. According to forum experts, it is most effective to integrate just one link in your signature. This will help avert possible confusion. Although some folks indulge in multiple links for SEO purposes, it is not the best strategy as it wouldnâ€™t generate targeted traffic. A successful video  will help erase your past poor website traffic history. Video marketing is a great tool for attracting visitors to know more about your products or services. As the virtual world continues to evolve, video files have become important online marketing tool in addition to articles. Video helps online users to get more and visual information on just anything. If your online offering requires extensive explanation for potential customers to grasp, consider using a video marketing strategy. However, such video should not be lengthy and should be easy-to-understand. Itâ€™s a great way to gain the attention of your potential customers, particularly if your competitors are not using videos. Besides, videos always make their way to the first search result page, your potential customers are likely to find you quicker. If implemented correctly, you can generate traffic massively within the shortest possible time frame with videos. These tested and proven traffic generation strategies are highly effective.

06/06/2013,http://comluv.com/building-a-better-fathers-day-with-gifts-that-give-back/,Building A Better Fathers Day With Gifts That Give Back - ComLuv,"The late American motivational speaker Jim Rohn once said: â€œWhatever good things we build end up building us.â€ù The same is true for building a better gift with your dad. Nothing is as priceless as the gift of your time, and your dad will appreciate that over anything else you give him at Fathers Day or any other time of the year. Here are some things that my siblings and I have done with our dad in past years that proved a great success, as well as a few other suggestions. Maybe one of them will help to inspire you about something that you can do with your own dad this year! When my siblings and I were younger, it seemed like every year my dad helped us build at least one birdhouse, wind chime, picture frame, or some other small woodworking project. Itâ€™s because of these projects that I now understand how to do things like change out a bit in a cordless drill and practice time honored lessons like measure twice and cut once. The lessons our dad taught us are something we really appreciated, so to show our appreciation for him last year we got all the grandkids together. They spent the entire afternoon on Fatherâ€™s Day with my dad, spending time with him just the way he did with his kids when we were young. At the end of the day, each kid went him with a bird house of their own. Thanks to the scrapbook my mom created with all the pictures taken during the day, he now has a tangible memory of that day that will last for a long while. Does your mom have a list of things that she wants your dad to do around the house? If so, then take that list from her and tackle those odd jobs on his behalf. Leaky faucets, squeaky door hinges, and gutters stuffed with leaves waiting to be cleaned out take very little time and could be a thing of My dadâ€™s favorite room of the house is his man cave, which was formerly the unfinished half of the basement. A few years ago my siblings and I helped our mom surprise him with his very own space for Fatherâ€™s Day and by far it ranks among the best gifts heâ€™s ever received throughout his entire lifetime. From the â€œNO DAMES ALLOWEDâ€ù sign on the door to the regulation-sized pool table andÂ  ,Â everything is tailored to reflect manliness. I donâ€™t think the room has ever seen the first shred of pink!If your dad doesnâ€™t have a man cave and has the space to create one, heâ€™d appreciate your time and effort into helping with the project. Sometimes Fatherâ€™s Day is as much about giving back to others as it is about giving something to your dad. Spending time with your dad is the important thing, and if he has a favorite charity or volunteer organization offer to spend time with him doing what he loves best. If you have no plans, Habitat for Humanity is a great organization that does wonderful things for otherwise underprivileged people. Even if you canâ€™t spend time helping build an actual structure, Re-Store shops can always use an extra helping hand. And donâ€™t leave out the younger children in your family â€“ the youth programs offers volunteer opportunities for kids as young as 5 years old! Your dad is almost guaranteed to like any gift that you give him, but what heâ€™ll really appreciate is when you give up some of your time to focus on him. Regardless if youâ€™re helping him on a minor home repair, building a birdhouse for the backyard, or building a home for someone who otherwise wouldnâ€™t have one, what youâ€™re really building is a lifetime of memories that you can always look back on together.",James Martell
05/06/2013,http://comluv.com/how-to-reduce-bounce-rate-of-your-website-and-blog-by-50/,How To Reduce Bounce Rate of Your Website and Blog by 50% - ComLuv,"Bounce rate of a website or blog that has gone well above 50% could be a source of worry to the site owner because it means your site is losing quite a number of visitors that come to it. How do you reduce bounce rate of your website and ensure that a greater percentage of those who pay visit actually visit other pages inside your site? Those sites with lesser bounce rates are respected more because they have more engaging readers or visitors. Visitors to such sites are more likely to turn to buyers because they find time to see through the contents of the site and itâ€™s more likely they enjoy the content hence they are staying longer there. In simple term, bounce rate of a site refers to the number of visitors to such site that only view one page upon their visit and then leave without caring to see other pages. The lower the bounce rate the better for your site. When the rate climbs above 50%, it simply means that more than half of your visitors are in a haste to leave your site. Therefore, you must think fast how to reduce bounce of your website in order to   and other revenue generation. It is not the intention of the visitors to your site to leave as soon as they arrive at the site. They come with the intention to stay and enjoy the site and get the information that they are looking for. However, when on first impression, the site does not look like a place to get what they want, they quickly hit the back button. Bounce rates donâ€™t come by accident; they are caused by certain factors. Until you are able to spot and take care of those factors, the bounce rate would continue to remain alarmingly high. To find a solution to this problem, you need to ask yourself the following questions: Is my content good enough for my visitors? Are there annoying pop ups and pop unders here? Is this site loading fast or slow? Are the ads on this site moderate or simply in excess? Is my site inviting or just repulsive to visitors? Knowing where the problem lies will enable for the best solution. Once the source of the problem is identified, the next thing to do should be to find how best to take care of the identified problem and make your site more enjoyable and more engaging to visitors. Now that we have identified some possible causes of high bounce rate, I want us to look at how much we can do to improve the situation. Identifying a problem is not enough; but taking a proactive step to give our visitors a better user experience does the trick Have you ever asked yourself what attracts people to huffingtonpost, boing boing, mashable, techcrunch, MBT, Linda Ikeji blog, ESPN, etc? The answer is that they have interesting content. Are people sharing your posts with friends? Do readers leave comments after reading your blog post? If not, then your content is either not interesting or not informative enough. So it means you have to improve on the quality of the content â€“ make it more interesting and informative/educative. There is nothing as annoying as coming to a site and you find everywhere cluttered with ads because the site owner wants to make quick cash. Visitors to such sites easily decode that the site is made for Adsense (MFA), and they wonâ€™t bother opening the next page. But when you have minimal ads display, they hardly notice the presence of ads on the site. They are even happy to click on the few ads present. To reduce bounce rate of your website or blog, you need to minimise advertisements. Have you ever visited a site and the first thing that greeted you was a pop up? What did you do thereafter? Did you continue or simply hit the back button? I can bet you that in such situation, over 80% of people would leave immediately. I agree that you need some pop ups to build your mailing list, sell your products, etc. But should you begin to advertise to a visitor who hardly knows what your site is all about? If you must use pop ups or pop under, you have to allow your visitors some time to settle down and digest some of your site content. When he finds your content interesting, he will willingly subscribe to your list or buy your products. Some people want to add styles to their site; but they end up driving away their visitors by overdoing it. Take for example, a site with a black, red or blue background colour that a visitor would need to strain his eyes before heâ€™s able to read the content of the site. After straining himself for some seconds, he gets frustrated and leaves in anger. No matter how interesting your content is, such person might never come back to your blog again. In my own opinion, it is better to use a white background and black ink because it is easier to read. Improve your background colour, reduce the bounce rate of your website. A website that takes several seconds to load would definitely have a higher bounce rate. Nobody wants to waste his precious time waiting endlessly for your site to load. So to improve your page loading speed, you need to load images from your picasa web album; minimize use of plugins, use cache plugin, use CDN services like MaxCDN, etc. Check your site speed with  . The faster the page speed the lower the bounce rate. So many visitors are smart enough to know when you are trying to use blackhat methods to trick them into clicking on links or when you are trying to use them to achieve your selfish aims. The moment they fathom this out, they never bother to proceed on your site. So to reduce the bounce rate of your website, you must stop all forms of blackhat practices. To reduce bounce rate of your website, you have to provide quality content, minimize advertisement, remove pop ups, improve background colour and avoid all forms of blackhat practices. Once these are implemented, visitors will get better user experience, and this eventually would reduce bounce rate of your website or blog.",Efoghor Joseph
04/06/2013,http://comluv.com/22-quick-tips-to-get-your-mojo-back-2/,22 Quick Tips To Get Your Mojo Back - ComLuv,"Looking busy doesnâ€™t always mean we are being productive. I have days where Iâ€™ve got more done on my virtual farm (yes, you know the one Iâ€™m talking about!) than I have for my business. If you find you are having too many unproductive days, or are finding time just slips away from you, here are some great tips to get you and your business moving in the right direction: 1. Go to bed early, but never go to bed with an unsolved task buzzing in your head, either get it done or make a plan of how you are going tackle the problem. One way or another it needs to get out of your brain, even if that just means passing it to someone else (half asleep husbands are great resources for unloading!) 2. Wake up early, before the rest of the family and with a spring in your step, if you donâ€™t really feel like it then force it; jump in the shower, splash your face with cold water, grab a strong coffee, go for a brisk walk/run or just step outside and breath in the new day. Look forward to what lies ahead. 3. Work on your to-do list, start at the top and achieve at least one important task before you take a break. 4. Decide early which jobs you just arenâ€™t going to enjoy and will end up putting off, then go get someone else to do them. One person can achieve anything, but they canâ€™t do everything! 5. Check your email, Facebook, Twitter or other accounts once â€“ make a note of anything that needs to be done on your to-do list and then log out of all the accounts until youâ€™re ready to work through the tasks. 6. When you are ready to go through your email, donâ€™t â€œput offâ€ù the difficult replies, just get them all out of the way and empty the inbox. An inbox isnâ€™t the place to store work, get it out and into your task management system (Evernote, Freedcamp, RememberTheMilk and Trello are all free, useful tools). 7. Stay logged out of Facebook and Skype during work hours unless you really NEED them, itâ€™s a good idea to have separate work and personal accounts. If your friends see you logged into FB chat or Skype, you can kiss goodbye to being productive! 8. Donâ€™t mix up your work time and your leisure time, that includes answering the door (if you work from home) to casual visitors. I know this can be a difficult one for us moms who have the kids at home during the day, but do try to get into a routine of at least an hour of uninterrupted work every day. Lynn Terry has a great system of codes for her children, if one shouts code red she knows itâ€™s something life threatening and leaves what she is doing, everything else has to wait. I did try this, but unfortunately my kidsâ€™ definition of life threatening and mine just werenâ€™t compatible, it usually meant they needed a drink! 9. Identify your least productive time of the day and stop trying to fight it, taking a break isnâ€™t against the law of business success! I know I donâ€™t get much done between 3pm and 8pm, so this has become family time and I just do my â€œmomâ€ù stuff. 10. Define your set work time and leisure time, and even if both 11. Have a hobby or interest that is completely away from your business, even something as simple as reading a book (a real one, with paper pages!) or doing a crossword. Take some time out every day thatâ€™s just for you. 12. Keep a notepad with you at all times and as soon as you get the idea, note it down for later, resist the temptation to react and do it now or you will forever find yourself running over to the laptop at inconvenient moments (during dinner, the middle of the night, and ok, Iâ€™ve even got out of the shower dripping wet to check something!) Get stuff out of your head and onto paper/screen asap before you forget or your head gets so cluttered that it no longer makes any sense. 13. Drink plenty of water along with the coffee or Red Bull, eat regularly and well; donâ€™t stuff yourself every time you realise you havenâ€™t eaten for hours, not only will you be unable to function properly with a full stomach, but your energy levels and mood will spike and dip, staying constant will get more done. If you need to snack while you are working, try fruit and nuts to keep your energy levels up, keep the cookies and sweet stuff for special treats. 14. Move around, sitting staring at a screen for hours is bad for your metabolism, your posture and your circulation. If you donâ€™t have time to take a break and go for a walk, at least put some essential items out of reach so you have to get up to fetch them, while you are up take the opportunity to stretch a little. 15. Stop wasting time checking your stats, webmaster tools, analytics, etc (Iâ€™m a sucker for real-time analytics!) Once a week is fine for checking on your rankings, no need to panic if you drop a place since the last 10 minutes you checked. If you really canâ€™t resist then make it your last job of the day before you shut down the computer. 16. Tidy up your workspace and your computer so that itâ€™s free of mess (sort those files and folders out); a tidy desk means a tidy mind! 17. Focus on one task at a time, work through your to-do list methodically, only adding new task at to the bottom of the list. At the end of your working day re-evaluate the list and move more important tasks up to the top ready for the morning. 18. When you get really stuck, itâ€™s often times best to just leave it for a while and refresh yourself. Let it come to you. 19. Finish each day and be done with it. You have done everything you can. Some blunders and mistakes will happen from time to time, learn from them then forget them. Tomorrow is a new day, begin it afresh. 20. Enjoy what you do, if youâ€™re not enjoying it then change things! 21. Work in small, but complete batches, taking on each task at time. You must be able to finish things or you will get nothing done. 22. If thereâ€™s one nasty task that you find you are putting off then remember that delaying doing something is always worse than actually doing it. Having stuff â€œto-doâ€ù that you know you arenâ€™t going to will be a constant in the back of your mind until it is resolved â€“ Just Do It! Youâ€™re going to have to do it eventually anyway! Why add to your worry and stress by putting it off? As soon as you empty out all the yucky jobs that are lurking in your business (and your life) you may even suddenly find that motivation that youâ€™ve been lacking to move forward, with real purpose and drive.",Lisa Melia

Slowly, there seems to be a shift of these bloggers over to Twitter.In this post Iâ€™d like to discuss why blogging is still the â€œ â€ù and why people should switch back to blogging from tweeting for people using twitter to keep in touch with their friends and family. I want to tell a story.I canâ€™t do it on Twitter. Twitter gives you only 140 characters, sure its faster, but what if I want to narrate an incident that occurred to me? What if I want to explain something? I need more than 140 characters.Blogging gives you an infinite number of characters to use to get your point across.You can cover everything you want in detail with all the examples you can think of! Every single profile on twitter looks exactly the same, so boring right? In blogs, you can have literally infinite different designs that people implement on their respective blogs.You are free to design your blog the way you like, you can edit the code of your blog to make the design that you like.Twitter just does not offer such liberties and freedom to a user, something they should probably look at doing in the future. To be honest, Blogging offers hundreds of ways to earn money, through ads, affiliates, links etc.Twitter doesnâ€™t. To have an account on Twitter, I have to present so many details such as real name, mail address etc which I do not want to be visible to others. But there are easy ways in which people can find mail addresses on Twitter and hence use them to spam others with ads and links that no one really cares about.Itâ€™s such a pain isnâ€™t it? In Blogging, you own the site, you own everything. You do not have to let anyone see your mail or other personal details such as date of birth etc.You have complete privacy. Comments in blogs are the reason why I love to blog and commentluv is my favorite way to ensure there is a good interaction with my readers.There are no third party services in Twitter, which is kind of sad. Maybe its something ComLuv should look at doing, working with twitter to make some kind of ComLuv feature which could really help bloggers too. So basically these are a few reasons why I feel blogging is better than twitter for people who use twitter as a personal social network.For companies and agencies that need to provide quick updates, Twitter is probably the best way to do it.What do you guys think?

31/05/2013,http://comluv.com/characteristics-of-an-alpha-male/,Characteristics of an Alpha Male - ComLuv,"Many guys want to be the top dog, the so called leader of a group â€“ an alpha male. But, in any given group there can be only one alpha male. Letâ€™s go over the characteristics that most alphas have in common: Â  Most guys that are leaders of a group use their body with ease. They are not afraid to take up space, their movements are natural and unstilted and their pose is natural and relaxed. They also use their body wisely as they are aware that when they turn their body towards someone, they are giving that person attention, and vice versa. They only give attention to people that they respect. 70% of what is said in a conversation is conveyed not with words, but with body language. A third of that at least is your voice tone. That means that the words that you say accounts for only 30% of the message and impression people have of what you said. Voice tone is very important. We can differentiate a questioning type of voice tone, also associated with beta status, a neutral one, and a commanding, short pitched voice tone. Alphas usually use either neutral or commanding voice tone. No man can be a true leader of a pack without confidence with women, or in general. If he does not believe in himself or his abilities, he will cower away from a challenge and will likely lose his spot as an alpha male. Yes, confidence is truly important, it is also very hard to acquire for those that donâ€™t have it. That is why people value it so much. But, the catch is that the most confident person, the one that believes most in what he says, is often wrong. Alpha guys are not always right looking from the outside, and maybe even from the inside of the group, but no one dares stand up to them and their opinion is taken as the truth for granted. Although not all alpha males are funny or blessed with good humor, people laugh at what they say because of who they are. Remember in all the movies when people suck up to their bosses by faking laughter? Well, that is what we do all the time; we fake our laughter and show our best selves in the presence of a top dog. Most alpha males are actual leaders. That means that they take care of their pack. When someone has a problem, they help them out. Alphas who donâ€™t care for people around them are often left with no following and are no longer alphas. Being an alpha may not be as easy as it seems. Many people believe they want it in their minds, but in their hearts are content at the position they are now. So, think about it. Do you really want to be the alpha male and have all the responsibility that comes with it?

Even though they might not sound that much important, these two things determine how popular the online business or website is. The statistics might include a lot of popular things such as Google PageRank, Alexa Rank, Mozrank, etc. Apart from these, there is one other statistic which clients and advertisers consider to be equally important â€“ the Alexa links or backlinks. Alexa backlinks or Alexa links in short, is basically a measure, or a quantitative value, of the number of websites linking to oneâ€™s personal blog or website. As an example, if there are a hundred websites which link to oneâ€™s webpage, then the websiteâ€™s score in Alexa links is 100. For any website to link to your page there should be a link on the website that points to your homepage or any page under the same domain as the home page. No you know what Alexa baclinks are; just go to Alexa and check the backlinks of allbloggingtips.com Now you might wonder how comluv.com has managed to accumulate 5000+ Alexa backlinks? I am sure it would not be an easy task to achieve this figure, but believe me, it is neither difficult too. Here I am going to tell you how you could probably increase Alexa backlinks will the help of this short guide. Before showing how to increase Alexa backlinks, one thing should be pointed out. Unlike Yahoo and Google back links, Alexa back links or site links do not take into consideration the total number of links from all the domains which point Alexa back links pointing to the popularity of a webpage. The more the number of websites which link to your webpage, the more popular your page is. This is what Alexa measures, and it helps to correctly show how popular a page is, unlike Google and Yahoo. It clearly shows how many exact domains are currently referring towards your own site Learning how to improve your pageâ€™s Alexa backlinks score requires you to increase your sphere of activity. Reading and commenting on the same blog pages does not help. Neither is posting on just a few blog pages. Rather, it is a good practice to comment and post on a greater number of blogs. Most people do the mistake of commenting and posting on only blogs with similar niche. Well, I wonâ€™t say it doesnâ€™t help, but why keep yourself behind. In addition to similar niche, you should also post comments and try to get backlinks from non-niche sites too. Another thing, do-follow or no-follow doesnâ€™t matter for alexa, Even if you manage to get a no-follow link back to your site, your Alexa rank will surely increase. This way, Alexa will find more number of links to your webpage, and it will help improve your page ranking. To increase the Alexa backlinks score, it is a very helpful practice to comment and guest post on new blogs regularly. The frequency of these posts can be one post per week or more or may be a bit less. Submitting blogs to the same directories and blog sites never helps. To improve oneâ€™s website ranking through Alexa, using backlinks is a very intelligent and effective way. But one must remember that backlinks are only counted per domain, and not for each individual link.",Ansh Gupta
28/05/2013,http://comluv.com/google-approved-wordpress-seo-tips/,Google Approved WordPress SEO Tips - ComLuv,"Many SEO marketers recommend WordPress SEO tips which arenâ€™t necessarily approved by Google. Theyâ€™re not necessarily forbidden by Google either, but we thought you might want to know which tips are officially approved by Google, so here are the top five Google-approved WordPress SEO tips: Various plugins for WordPress let you add a meta description and meta keywords tag to your WordPress postsâ€”Google says this is great, but it also offers a few warnings. 1.Â Â  Donâ€™t use keywords or content in your meta tags which donâ€™t reflect the actual article. 2.Â Â  Keep descriptions and keywords short. 3.Â Â  Donâ€™t assume that Google will necessarily use your descriptions or keywords. If you havenâ€™t used meta tags before, youâ€™ll probably want to take the time to go back and add them to all of your previous posts. Remember that the text you enter in the meta description field will probably be the text which appears in search engine listings, so you want to make it short and enticing. Google wants you to label your images accurately using the alt tag. The alt tag was designed so that seeing-impaired people could read (or have read to them) a text description of any images on your page, but the primary use of the alt tag on the Internet today is for image search engines. Labeling your images is a great way to back up the keyword phrase for that particular page. For example, if you write a page about cheesesteaks and you want to rank for the keyword cheesesteaks, put an image of a cheesesteak on your page and label it as a cheesesteak with the alt tag. Google not only appreciates you labeling the image so it can use it on its image search engine, but it will also further convince Google that your post is about cheesesteaks. Almost everyone says it, but itâ€™s still trueâ€”the more you post, the higher you rank. Google is the worldâ€™s leading search engine because it makes its customers happy by pointing them to high-quality content. Therefore, nothing makes Google happier than seeing more high-quality content on the Internet. If you publish high-quality content often, Google will show its appreciation by linking to your content more often. All WordPress SEO tips boil down to this principle: make Google happy. See what is quality content. The most important part of your page, from an SEO perspective, is the title. Look at any set of search resultsâ€”the first thing you notice are the titles. Youâ€™re not going to click on any bad titles no matter how high they rank, so take a moment and make sure all of the pages on your site have good, strong titles. Google pays close attention to titlesâ€”remember they make their money by hawking appealing content. But donâ€™t fall into the trap of thinking that your title should be keyword optimized. Itâ€™s far more important that you make people eagerly desire to click on your titles than it is that you rank for any particular term. The art is to try and combine both. However, the last of our WordPress SEO tips will tell you how to sneak in your keyword phrase: Google pays more attention to the URL than most people do, so your URL is a great place to put your keyword phrase without it taking away from the appeal of your article. Imagine your keyword phrase is something boring, such as â€œhomemade footstoolsâ€ù. You probably canâ€™t write an interesting headline using that keyword, but you can write an interesting headline without itâ€”â€œHow To Build a $5 Footstool In 5 Minutes At Homeâ€ùâ€”and then add the proper keyword phrase in the URL, â€œexample.com/homemade-footstoolsâ€“5-dollarsâ€“5-minutesâ€ù. Donâ€™t go overboard on the URL. People are less likely to share longer URLs than shorter URLs, and even Google will stop trying to parse really long URLs. But donâ€™t worry about getting your keyword phrase into your title if you can get it into your URL using one of these  .",Mitz Pantic

But what is this almost-magical post, and how do you get it? Whatever your niche, thereâ€™s probably one person who everyone recognizes as the expert. In online marketing, itâ€™s Seth Godin; in time management, itâ€™s David Allen; in software startups, itâ€™s Paul Graham. Every niche has one of these dominating personalities, and nobody in that niche can get enough information about them. A single post on your site backed by one of these personalities can hugely  . But how do you get one of these people of almost mythical stature to appear on your blog? Itâ€™s simple: ask them. For this to work, you need an established and respectable blog which already has at least some natural blog traffic. The big personalities in your niche donâ€™t want to waste their time on unproven blogs. If you already have some blog traffic, you can approach the biggest, most influential personality in your niche and ask them for a 15 minute phone interview. Almost anyone, even a famous person (within your niche), will agree to 15 minutes on the phone. But what if they donâ€™t agree? Then you can try again later. First, build up some social proof that a 15 minute interview on your blog will help them. You can interview other, less-famous people in your niche as proof youâ€™re a good and helpful interviewer. You Youâ€™ve scored your interview with the biggest name in your niche, so what do you do now? First, prepare for your interview. This is going to be, perhaps, the most important 15 minutes of your blogâ€™s life, so itâ€™s not unreasonable to spend hours preparing. Develop a list of interesting and short questions to askâ€”and practice asking them. Test your equipment for recording the call and try to get the best possible sound quality. Do everything you can do in advance to make the call perfect. After the call, mine the interview for as much content as you can. Turn the recording into a podcast. Turn the audio into a text transcript. Extract parts of the transcript into a shorter, more focused blog posts. Summarize the actionable advice in the podcast into another post. Keep working until you have the perfect storm of content to post to your blog. Then contact the person you interviewed and tell them that youâ€™re going to post the interview tomorrow. Give them a sample of all the great content youâ€™ve created from that short interview and kindly ask them to promote it on their blog, mailing list, social media accounts, and other platforms. If youâ€™ve done your job well, youâ€™ll receive one or more links from the most highly influential person in your niche to your site which will send you a torrent of blog trafficâ€”and many of those readers will see the incredible job you did and want to subscribe to your site to see what you do next. Plus other sites will link to your interview over the next couple days and send you more blog trafficâ€”and more new subscribers. Both the many new subscribers and the new high-value inbound links will ensure you a permanent boost in blog traffic.",Mitz Pantic
26/05/2013,http://comluv.com/3-major-ways-mobile-payments-will-change-the-way-you-shop/,3 Major Ways Mobile Payments Will Change the Way You Shop - ComLuv,"The physical retailer is making a comeback. The online shopping revolution left many physical retailers reeling. Mom and pop shops around the globe closed as people explored convenient and less expensive online alternatives. Can anyone blame them? For non-urgent purchases, online shopping is the superior experience.  The latest development in payments might turn the tables. For the past few years many companies have started developing mobile payment solutions. Whether in the form of software or hardware that connects to a smartphone, mobile payments allow vendors to process credit card payments from any mobile device. The result: a new era of shopping. Just as online shopping changed the ways we buy goods and services, so will mobile payments. The difference is that while online shopping allowed us to accomplish at home what we previously accomplished at a store, mobile payments will allow us to do more back at that store.  Perhaps the greatest pain of visiting a store comes at the end. Even if you find everything you want, you still have to wait on line to check out. At some times thatâ€™s not a big deal. But during peak shopping hours youâ€™ll have to wait behind a number of people before you can leave. Anyone who has ever visited a Walmart or other big box retailer mid-day on a weekend knows that any number of conditions â€” a slow cashier, a disputed price, a disorganized customer â€” can make for a long wait at checkout. We have to wait on these checkout lines, because point-of-sale (POS) systems are large and mostly immovable. But thatâ€™s the old way. Companies such as WePay have worked hard developing   that replaces those large, clunky cash registers at the fronts of every store. Stores can load this software onto mobile devices, which gives them any number of virtual registers. The potential for expediting checkout is enormous. Imagine finishing your shopping and having a store employee come up to you, scan your order, and take your payment right on an iPhone or iPad. Or, better yet, you scan the order on your own iPhone and check yourself out at the end. Many grocery stores in the US already have programs like this. Bringing it to big retailers such as Walmart and Target can change the game for consumers who otherwise might have shopped at home.  Every couple of months my wife and mother-in-law take a trip to an outlet mall. Itâ€™s Brands prefer the outlet model, because it allows them to set up shop cheaply. Outlets are in more remote areas than other malls, because they are destination shopping experiences. You go there because there are so many vendors and brands selling directly. The cheap retail space allows these brands to sell merchandise at a discount. Mobile payments, combined with one other recent trend, could help bring that same cheap shopping experience to higher volume areas. Storefront is a company that  . Vacant retail space is at an all-time high, so landlords are much more accommodating for short-term leases. Storefront helps connect these landlords and brands that could use the retail space. Brands that utilize mobile payments can set up shop cheaply. They can bring in merchandize, check out customers with smartphones, and realize the benefits of high-volume shopping areas. These temporary satellite locations can help expose brands to customers who donâ€™t want to spend three hours in the car.  The internet has given rise to many niche vendors. Sites such as   promote hand-made, niche products. People flock to these products, because theyâ€™re different than the mass-produced trinkets and clothing you see at most major retailers. Yet Etsy stores are at a great disadvantage. When you want to buy a TV or a smartphone or any other mainstream item, you can go see it at a physical store before you buy it online. With Etsy youâ€™re buying based on pictures and description. For most Etsy vendors, selling in-person is impractical. Theyâ€™d need a POS system, for starters, which can be expensive. They also need space to sell. Mobile payments takes care of the POS angle. Niche vendors can set up shop in traditional retail space, using an agent such as Storefront, or they can set up as vendors on street corners or at trade shows. In any case, the ability to accept credit cards, rather than cash only, gives them many advantages that they previously did not possess. Mobile payments makes in-person shopping more convenient for the consumer, and lowers overhead for the retailer. The result is an enhanced in-person shopping trip, something that has been diminishing over the last decade thanks to improved online shopping experiences. Since mobile payments are still in their infancy we might not see an impact immediately. But as these payment solutions spread far and wide, weâ€™ll see more physical retailers make a comeback.",Joe Pawlikowski

Being able to successfully integrate the various available tools within these basic aspects of a well-rounded marketing strategy is essential for expanding and developing strong brand awareness. First of all, let me just stress the importance of having an online store in this day and age.

There are serious and dedicated professionals out there that can help you manage your online marketing strategy for best results. This is all about going out into the world and spreading the good word among the people. You can accomplish this by organizing: These are all useful for attracting people in larger numbers, and as long as you engage them in a fun and informative way you can earn yourself a few devoted customers. For example gun companies have boots on various gun shows throughput the year, where they showcase their products and give information on different details the customers are concerned about or baffled by. Red Bull often organizes fun competitions, like the Flugtag where people try to fly in homemade flying machines.

You want to be in the spotlight as long as you can â€“ in the media, on posters plastered all over town, on promotional products and on social media sites â€“ never too far from peopleâ€™s minds. There are tons of promotional companies out there offering some nice products that can be purchased cheaply in bulk. Here are some choices: As weâ€™ve mentioned before, you can offer prizes to people, and these donâ€™t have to be small trinkets, but actual products or services that you offer â€“ a cruise, car or a yearâ€™s supply of a particular product for the winner.

23/05/2013,http://comluv.com/my-5-best-ways-to-get-safe-backlinks-for-google/,My 5 Best Ways To Get Safe Backlinks For Google,"Google has introduced a huge number updates and changes in its algorithm because like every business it also wants to improve its users experience and quality of their search engine. In these changes a lot of webmasters had to suffer, their rankings went down, traffic started to decrease and ultimately they lost there steady earnings. Some of the people whom I know even stopped blogging which is something we should never do. Just stick to your project and one day it will prosper. Well, today I am going to share a solution for this outcome. The main thing which is targeted in these Google updates are the quality of your blog and the links which are pointing towards them. Backlinks are really essential and counted as a vote for your website to rank higher. Before these updates people focused on quantity of backlinks but not quality but now Google wants quality and sites having fake and low quality backlinks are penalised. So, here are the best 5 ways to build safe backlinks. You might see other techniques but I prefer using these techniques because they are harmless but still before building any backlink you should just keep in mind that â€œyou canâ€™t game Googleâ€ù, so do not try to spam and focus on the quality. Link Bait is when you create an awesome post which people really like and as a reward provide links to you on there website/blogs. I know this is one of the most difficult method but it brings you natural links which is the aim of Google. Link baiting can be made easy when you share your expertise and answer different people questions. Share your imagination and see how much people like it. You could also write about something which really interests your Guest Blogging comes second in my list. Yes, it is another way to get high quality backlinks which Google likes. TheÂ advantage of this method is that you not only get quality links but also get targeted traffic to your site and the main dis-advantage is that it is time consuming. In my opinion, a blogger should write at least 1 guest post each week. This will increase its traffic and overall ranks. Social Bookmarking is one of my favourite method and I share my every post which I write on different Social bookmarking sites and networks like Facebook, twitter etc. This again brings you backlinks from authority sites and new visitors. You could use   list and submit your content to them. You should submit to them regularly. Blog commenting is one of the most popular and easy method to create high quality backlinks for your website. The thing which I hate about it is that you can not change your Anchor text on popular blogs or else your comment will not be approved. Otherwise, it is a best way to build backlinks. For people who are new to this, just try to create comment on authority sites with high domain authority. Secondly, try to find blogs with CommentLuv or KeywordLuv plugin installed and comment on those blogs. You could use my   for starting commenting. This is my last method which I use and really love it. This provides me with highly targeted traffic and generate good amount of leads for me. Just answer appropriate questions related to your content and share your link. People will visit your website and if your content is great, they can be your daily readers. On the other hand you will also generate quality backlinks as Yahoo answers is high authority site. These were my methods, if you have any queries feel free to share. If you have any other method then share with us.",Hamza Ahmad

21/05/2013,http://comluv.com/should-you-edit-guest-posts-others-send-to-you/,Should You Edit Guest Posts Others Send to You,"The topic of guest posting is probably covered enough on the internet as it is, but thereâ€™s still one aspect that has slipped everyoneâ€™s mind a bit. Iâ€™m talking about some of the scenarios that are likely to occur   (instead of you sending posts to them). One of these scenarios is when you feel that the article youâ€™ve received lacks something and yet, you still want to publish it. So, what to do? Should you edit anything? Is it okay to alter someone elseâ€™s work? To give you a short answer, not that much. For a more detailed one, consider the following. These are the easiest to deal with. Of course, whenever you find something an outright error, you have all the right to make it correct. Also, itâ€™s an opportunity for you to learn what the most common language errors are. Something that can come very handy if youâ€™re planning to send  . And now we stumble upon the first no-no on the list. Even though the blog is 100% yours, I donâ€™t believe you should modify the contents of the guest posts you get in any significant way. However, if you really feel that the article needs a change before it can be published, reach out to the author and ask them to change it. If the author really wants their work published on your site then they will have no problem making the changes. That is, if you explain what the deal is exactly. Actually, letâ€™s make it a rule of thumb: Whenever something needs to be changed,   for you. This is probably the most common issue with guest posts and it shouldnâ€™t be very surprising. In fact, most guest posting is done for link purposes. As much as weâ€™d like to think that the â€œgoodâ€ù bloggers have other reasons (like   and stuff), they donâ€™t. Now hereâ€™s the best partâ€_thereâ€™s nothing bad about it. Links drive most things that take place online. When we tweet, we   to something.   are the things we click on when we like something on Reddit.   are the things we send to our friends via email. The examples are endless and on top of these,   drive guest posting. So what to To be honest, there was only one situation where I, the author, requested my post to be taken down because my link was altered without consultation. Obviously, I lost the possibility to guest post on that blog forever, but at least the owner agreed to leave my link intact (the article got popular so they didnâ€™t want to lose it). In the end, I believe that you shouldnâ€™t sweat all that much about the links people feature inside their guest posts, as long as they are relevant and there isnâ€™t too many of them. Of course, linking to gambling sites, â€œnaughtyâ€ù sites, hateful sites and so on, is a completely different thing. Sometimes itâ€™s good to add your own voice or your own tips in the article, especially if you rarely publish guest posts and your readers might be surprised that thereâ€™s someone else speaking to them on a given day. One of the most common ways of handling this is to add your intro, like a foreword. The idea is to introduce the author, introduce the topic and explain why youâ€™re even publishing the post. Another approach is to add small tips within the article itself. You can indicate the tips with brackets and your initials, for example. You can take a look at   at Tim Ferrissâ€™s blog where he uses this exact technique to add some more value into one guest post. The main idea is not to confuse the reader but to help them distinguish your input from the original authorâ€™s input. As I mentioned, changing the original links is not okay and that is my humble opinion. But adding your own is definitely okay because, well, why shouldnâ€™t you? The rule is quite simple: if the links bring value, then by all means you should add them (and that includes product links). I guess thatâ€™s it when it comes to my tips on this matter. To be honest with you, one of the reasons for writing this post was because I came across a situation in guest blogging that I didnâ€™t like, so I thought that finding some consistent policy would be a good idea here. Anyway, what do you think? Whatâ€™s your opinion on editing guest posts that other bloggers send to you? Or maybe you are the one who has had their posts edited in a non-cool way? Either way feel free to share.",Karol K

It is poised to push away Facebook.com and Twitter.com as major social medial tools as it promises positive results in any websiteâ€™s marketing efforts. This is because the current top social media websites possess features that cannot be accessed by Google, which somehow restrict their ability to maximize SEO. With the use of Google Plus, your website is able to dominate search results in an easy and convenient manner. It is highly possible that a well-optimized Google+ based website can be found in search enginesâ€™ top results. Here are ways in which you can dominate SEO via Google+: Google Plus permits insertions of followed links onto posts. You only need to insert the URL, and Google.com will immediately consider it as a link. The link benefits your website since its value increases every time that the post is shared online or linked into by other websites. Remember that links coming from Google Plus depends on the domain and webpage, much like any other social network websites. As long as you maintain the link, it will raise better visibility. This is true if you become connected to more online visitors, share more web posts, and make a direct link to your own profile. While other social network websites and forums require you to perform actions, such as making a number of comments, in order to earn a followed link to your profile; Google Plus initiates the link to the rest of your profile pages on the With Google+, you can perform full editing of every web post at any time that you want. This social website is way ahead of Facebook.com and Twitter.com in terms of editing. In case of the two, users can only enjoy limited editing feature. Twitter.com, for instance, only allows deletion of a tweet after it is created. With Google plus, you can update a post anyway you want even if it has become viral. You can also change the title tags and media attached to the post when necessary. Your Google Plus postâ€™s first sentence is basically the title tag. Hence, you can benefit from high SEO by opting for the most appropriate keywords. It is a must that you carefully choose the words that you use for your postâ€™s first sentence. The creation of the first sentence can either make or break the title tag of your post. You can depend on Google+ to get connected with top influencers within your chosen industry. You know that youâ€™re getting connected by receiving notifications such a SMS, emails, and Google notification bars. The best thing about Google Plus is the ranking benefits that it offers to web posts and pages. For instance, whenever you post new content via Google+, it is likely for search engines to index it quickly. Most web masters and SEO experts believe that new Google+ URL are being crawled immediately. In the olden days of SEO, if an owner wants to have his website indexed, this can be realized; however, the process will take a number of weeks. Now, with the existence of Google Plus, indexing is as quick and convenient as pushing the Plus 1 button. Indeed, Google+ has been touted as the new Google.com indexing form.  to learn more on how you could dominate search results and maximize online visibility.",Rob Boirun

When I set up my full name domain I wanted to see how well the referral traffic would perform on my main business website. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. The most compelling stat was how much longer the referral visitors from my name domain stayed on my business website than all other sources. As a mater of fact my name domain was the only source to refer visitors that stayed almost 6 minutes on average (5:55). Â  It was encouraging to see that referral visitors from my name domain not only stayed on my business website longer but also they clicked MORE PAGES per visit than any other source. This tells me that not only are these visitors reading my content longer but also theyâ€™re checking out more content on my business site. Visitors referred from my name domain viewed 2.49 pages per visit while no other referral source averaged over 2 pages per visit except Twitter which averaged 2.1 pages per visit. Â All the other sources averaged less than 1.9 pages per visit. The average Surprisingly enough only Twitter had a better bounce rate than the visitors from my name domain at 54.39%. If you donâ€™t know your bounce rate is an extremely important yet very simple indicator of general website health. Â The percentage of visitors that   or leave your website after viewing only one page is your bounce rate. The lower this number is the better. Â Have you ever clicked a website and left immediately after only two seconds? Â Yeah, Men lie women lie, number donâ€™t. I built DarnellJackson.com to be a meet and greet website and a referral machine and so far thatâ€™s exactly what itâ€™s been doing. The site has proven it is effective at filtering out the   and sending my business and niche websites REAL targeted traffic. I also noticed a spike in email subscribers during this period but I canâ€™t conclude 100% if they came from my name domain or not. I also set up my twitter account to do the same thing so Iâ€™m not surprised that itâ€™s stats are right up there with my name domainâ€™s performance. I use my full name on Twitter, Iâ€™m veryÂ candid with my comments, I post regularly, and Iâ€™m not afraid of controversy. Â  Wait a minute. Â If both my name domain and my twitter accounts refer targeted traffic whatâ€™s the difference? Someone could hack or delete my twitter account at any moment and I would loose all that traffic and my 700+ â€œfollowersâ€ù. Â Think about how many Facebook accounts have been shut down recently.

It may not be possible to prevent identity theft for everyone, but if youâ€™re watchful you can be much safer than those who donâ€™t pay attention. So what is the big deal? These applications I am talking about have code that either on your phone or computer basically â€œdigs inâ€ù and hides itself, then starts to record information. With all the websites out there that you can purchase items from, it is highly likely that you will at some point enter your personal information into your phone or computer. When those items are infected, there can be a data breach, and though you think your information disappears into the payment, it is actually saved on your device. The person who created the code then knows  that users of web browsers (the software you use to surf the internet) are being heavily targeted. Extensions are programs, a lot like apps, that are used to have your web browser perform extra tasks. Extensions are used to do anything from help online shoppers keep track of their wish lists to changing the look of your browser or even make it perform faster. Developers can offer extensions in an app store or anywhere online. Toolbars which are commonly downloaded to enhance the browsing experience or advertise can also contain the malware that will bring the Trojan programs into your computer. Tech bloggers report the malicious extensions, but the rate with which they are uploaded far exceeds the abilities of the people looking for them to get them all removed in time. Diligently managing your personal information is the best defense against the theft of it. No one is going to stop downloading apps or extensions on their computers and cell phones because they have become a part of our culture and everyday lives. To prevent id theft,   is still the best method available. When you monitor your credit, you will be more aware of what is and is not normal on your reports. Knowing what to look for (abnormalities) and where (your three credit reports) is one of the very best ways to stay ahead of the thieves. With diligent monitoring of credit reports, you will know if there have been requests for lines of credit that you did not make, and then can alert the proper authorities to protect yourself. So what do you think about all this? Please feel free to comment on this post and weigh in on this matter, or share this with your friends so that they are aware of the security risks that are out there. Knowledge is power.",Joy

Iâ€™m sort of ashamed to admit this but I must have accounted for a hundred or so searches in Google for that hospital.

There you are, on the front lines, busting your hump day-in and day-out to make this company work. And whatâ€™s the boss doing? Sitting in a cushy office. It hardly seems fair at a glance. Once you find yourself in the bossâ€™s chair, though, that idea vanishes. It takes incredible effort and dedication to run a small business â€” and even with all of your time and every ounce of your energy it can still fail. SMB founders and executives can use all the help they can get, and they need to look under every rock to find something useful. Using these apps will not change the course of your small business. Itâ€™s not as though adopting them will turn a struggling startup into a successful one. They will, however, make life that much easier. With less time spent on rote tasks, executives can spend more time on what matters â€” and thatâ€™s where the difference comes.     The costliest liability for small businesses is wasted time. If no one knows what theyâ€™re doing, the company wonâ€™t go very far. A productive company is one whose employees walk in the front doors and know exactly what theyâ€™re working on for the day. Thatâ€™s why an app such as Producteev can be so powerful. Not only does it let employees know what to do, but it gives them priorities. You could spend all day listing task managers and their strongpoints. There are some task managers that perform many of the same functions as Producteev. But none hit all the features in such a synchronous way. As the boss, you can create projects and subtasks, and then assign all of that to one or multiple employees. Each listing has a space for notes, tags, and other methods of qualifying tasks. There will be no question as to who is assigned to what, and the priority they should assign those tasks. Like most powerful software, Producteev is not free. You can, however, try it for free as an individual user, or you can take advantage of a  . Donâ€™t be surprised if you find yourself hooked; an app that keeps tasks and priorities in order has great value. If you own a small business, youâ€™re on the web. If youâ€™re on the web, you need to find ways for people to discover you. Two methods immediately come to mind: search engine marketing and social media marketing. Using these two channels, small businesses can find the people most likely to patronize them. But you canâ€™t just sign up for Google AdWords, do some basic SEO, sign up for Twitter, and expect to become a marketing sensation. It takes an incredible level of effort to get results out of these platforms. As renowned management consultant Peter Drucker said, what gets measured gets managed. If you want to get the most out of your social and search marketing campaigns, you have to set up ways to measure their effectiveness. Raven Tools provides a comprehensive way to manage these campaigns. Beyond that, it helps you manage content marketing efforts, and provides research tools to prepare you for success.

Rather than getting too carried away and the connections with Iron Man 3 and personal branding, what everything boils down to is that branding and identity is based on emotion and itâ€™s this emotion that turns Another analogy with the Iron Man 3 baddie and attention with your audience is that people connect with people, not faceless brands that are purely product focuses.

10/05/2013,http://comluv.com/coconut-oil-good-bad-or-undecided/,"Coconut Oil: Good, Bad, or Undecided","Over the years, the media and medical experts have really put the screws to coconut oil while a lot of island people, like my Dad, just laughed. He grew up eating natural, pure coconut oil, the fresh non-processedÂ kind, so he felt that medicine was a little slow. So here are some of the reasons why coconut oil was labeled â€œbadâ€ù:  â€“ Thatâ€™s right. It is high in saturated fat, which medical research indicates is a detriment to cardiovascular health.  â€“ Because of itâ€™s saturated fat content, the next logical assumption would be that it increases the low density lipoprotein (LDL) part of the total cholesterol panel. Hereâ€™s what modern science is starting to realize about coconut oil that many cultures before them already found out so many years ago: Lauric Acid is one of the components of the coconut including  . Itâ€™s a saturated fat that resides in the medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) group, which is very easy to digest and is a great source of energy. Lauric acid does increase cholesterol but it does so by increasing the high density lipoprotein (HDL) part of the panel.Â  You want a higher HDL because it means youâ€™re protecting yourself from cardiovascular disease; one of the major benefits of coconut oil Monolaurin is lauric acid thatâ€™s been naturally converted by the human body. It is an antibacterial and has shown signs of being  . According to  , patients are given pure coconut oil because the body doesnâ€™t need use pancreatic enzymes to aid in digestion. Coconut oil digests quickly without taxing the body so the nutrition is absorbed quicker. For people with Crohnâ€™s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), this means that they have a chance to reduce the cramping and diarrhea associated with those diseases by incorporating coconut into their diet. Â For people with diabetes, the benefits of coconut oilÂ  means less stress on the pancreas and on the body overall. One of theÂ  issues with diabetes is insulin resistance. That happens when the cells donâ€™t respond to insulin so the pancreas keeps pumping out more until it does. A diet consisting of coconut oil protects the body against this and actually reduces the accumulation of body fat. A research study published in   suggests that diets composed of MCFAs like those found in coconut oil reduce insulin resistance in the muscles and fat accumulation, which may lead to obesity prevention. Between these and the  , diabetics have an ally they can rely on to help them deal with the disease. Other significant benefits of coconut oil include, but are not limited to: The list goes on and itâ€™s growing. One of the reasons why coconut oil has received such a bad reputation is based on the way itâ€™s made. As I mentioned, my father grew up with pure coconut oil. The way it was made was by boiling the coconut milk until all thatâ€™s left was the oil. It was then bottled and used. Thatâ€™s it. However, as with any commercial product, manufacturing companies need to do things faster and longer. As a result, some have used the hydrogenation process that gives the oil a higher smoke point. The problem is that this hydrogenation process creates trans fats, which are dangerous to the cardiovascular system. Nutritionally, the more natural and unprocessed form (i.e. organic, cold-pressed) of coconut oil has shown that it is extremely beneficial to body health inside and out. It is a fat, which means it has more calories and shouldnâ€™t be eaten in overabundance.Â Despite the many health benefits, the medical community is still trying to qualify and quantify the benefits of pure coconut oil.Â Ayurveda practitioners and herbalists are already convinced of its benefits based on years of use and observation.

I mean,  ! The reason behind it is simple. People usually want to achieve a specific goal, like lose 5, 10, 20 pounds or more. And they do it all wrong, even though they often reach their goals. What most people would do is, they would try on all these different, unhealthy diets. Eat only carbs, donâ€™t eat carbs at all, eat this and that and donâ€™t eat that. Or even worse, eat just salad for a weekâ€_ of course you will lose weight if you stay true to a diet like this. If you are overweight, there are only two reasons for it: either you intake too much calories or you spend too few with exercise. . And even worse, because you tortured your body by not giving it all it craves, you will eat like a mad man and put on even more weight then you lost, in a shorter time span than it took you to lose it. Any change that is not permanent will not result in permanent change. What this means is that if you donâ€™t intend to keep eating and exercising like you did when you lost the weight,  , and of course, with interest. The only right way that there is in losing weight is by changing your lifestyle. You need to understand that if you want to be slim and fit, you will have to eat less, healthier food and regularly exercise, no matter what. There are multiple ways to achieve this.   during which your only aim will be to eat as much as you really need, not more. Then, expand that trial by an additional 30 days, and during that time add regular exercise, for example walking in the park for 30 or 40 minutes. You can also use   to help you feel natural about losing weight, or even    that will help you think you can eat less than you really can.

From NLP, hypnosis, subliminal or binaural beats, positive affirmations to meditations and music therapy. When you know how and why most of them work, it is easy to conclude they all have one common denominator. Look at positive affirmations, they need to be repeated numerous times, with the person saying them in a confident tone of voice standing in a relaxed comfortable position, and after a certain period of time, they will work. Look at meditation, one needs to meditate as often as possible to learn to clear the head of thoughts and silent the mind. Then, he may find what he seeks. Hypnosis, again, it works by repetition. One session will help patients for sure, especially if the hypnotist is any good, but multiple sessions are usually needed to cure any real problem, such as an addiction to cigarettes for example. Music therapy â€“ repetition is the key, yet again. Listening to music once will feel nice, but for real benefits one needs to listen regularly. Itâ€™s the same with  . The more one listens to it, the faster it will work. And so on and so forth. Now, letâ€™s look at why repetition is so important in our lives. From early childhood we have been learning by repeating. It is the best, easiest way to learn. Simply put, if we do something once and it works, we will do that again. What we donâ€™t like, we wonâ€™t do again if we can help it. Anyways, from childhood to preschool to middle school to college â€_ we always learn by repeating something so we can recall it at will.  Granted, in college there are lots of case studies of how people did what they did, and it may not feel like repetition. But, the underlying motive behind case studies is to learn how people achieved success so we can copy (repeat) it, but in a better, more efficient way. It is how our race grows. We build upon the knowledge gained by previous generations, and we repeat everything they learned, then build upon it and make it better.  And yes, it is becoming harder and harder to keep up with any field, that is why there are more specializations than ever. . No matter what technique you use, it will work. If you meditate, then master meditation and learn to quite your mind at will. If you use positive affirmations, use them until they really start working, and then, donâ€™t stop. It works just like building your body. If you were fat and you start going to the gym regularly, you will likely lose fat and your muscles will grow. You will look better than you ever did. But, if you stop, over time your body will be at a state it was before you even started going to the gym.

If you do not notice changes after 3 or so weeks that are needed for a human to accept a new habit, you should change the routine a bit.

Itâ€™s there if we make the most of it. The interesting thing is that the world now allows us to be anything that we want to be; from the writer; to the designer; to the videographer; to the printer. What this means is that for the first time in our lifetime, we all have the opportunity and power to decide what the next step is, how itâ€™s produced and how itâ€™s delivered. By taking all these actions on board enables us to make connections, build a dialogue with our audiences and to make something happen. It is down to us to decide what to do next, because if we donâ€™t someone else surely will. That is exactly the point, with a breadth of ways to target our audiences it becomes far more interesting using a variety of platforms than just sticking to sending emails to prospective customers and hoping for the best. Here are five really effective ways to add more value in terms of producing new work, connecting, asking, learning, spreading and repeating. If there is an area of expertiseÂ  , there are ways to create your own project and tie in with the overall business. Remember the overall aim is to create something that people will engage with. It is about producing work that matters to the audience that you choose. For instance, The ID Group have an up and coming project that focuses on local business owners and what advice would they give to their younger selves starting their own business. It is intended to be used as a resource for anyone starting From an industry topic related to your business, you can produce powerful insights aimed at providing information by delivering market data that is far more motivational than product data. Whoever provides their audience with the best information will always stand head and shoulders above the company who just wants to sell their services. Itâ€™s also a good idea to share what you have created on SlideShare. Banish the one page enewsletter and bombarding everyone with as much text crammed onto a page, itâ€™s time to make the most of the print options that are available. Keep to the 80/20 rule, with 80% aimed at providing value to the reader and the 20% to allow a bit of promotion for your business (but not too much self congratulation). If you have the opportunity to talk to an audience on a topic that you believe in and want to share, film the presentation. The best position is to devote yourself to helping others succeed and to share what you believe in. Once the video is produced (and uploaded to YouTube), you then have the platforms to share and interact with (from LinkedIn to Twitter). If the whole aim is to inform and educate you build rapport as opposed to breaking rapport by selling. Using your website as a platform for others to write and contribute to a particular topic, helps present you as the authority in your areas of expertise, by a collective group of people sharing ideas and commenting in one central place ie. your site/blog. If the information produced is of value, it automatically repositions you in the mind of the prospect as much more ofÂ  Â than all your competitors, isnâ€™t this a great place to be? The secret to all the points made is to produce content that can target audiences over a variety of tactics (and testing what works for you). In a new era of empowered prospects and customers it is vital to create quality content that is relevant and provides value.",Mark Masters

But according to doctors, â€œeating less and exercising moreâ€ù is the only way to lose weight. Considering the paucity of research done on obesity, and the lack of success in all diet methods, no wonder 95% of people who go on a diet regain the weight within a few months to a couple of years. This information (from a study done on feeding college age men a typical obesity diet) shows the physical & psychological effects of 6 months of dieting. Unfortunately, it didnâ€™t include information about body temperature (which Iâ€™m CERTAIN had been considerably lowered during the course of the study). That included increased interest and preoccupation with food; heightened cravings, food dislikes disappeared, they became possessive about food, increased gum chewing, smoking, coffee drinking, nail biting; purchased useless items Ancel Keyâ€™s book (Biology of Human Starvation) explained findings of studies that he and his colleagues completed: So if you starve by dieting, you will create a big deficit in metabolism, which is like essentially shooting yourself in the leg in anger because it wasnâ€™t moving fast enough to win a race. Dieting is NOT the way to lose weight. In fact, when you consider how eating less slows down your metabolism- We   that; consider the effect of eating MOREâ€_. Yes, it does speed up your metabolism. Thatâ€™s because your body is designed to keep you at a set point, and will balance the amount of food in with the amount of energy you expend. So if you sit at a desk all day, your metabolic rate will be slower than if you have a physical job. BUT donâ€™t think that if you exercise a lot this is going to make you lose weight! Because the logic doesnâ€™t follow that! Your body will pull every calorie out of what you eat, store it as belly fat, and make you hungrier in order to maintain that set point! Itâ€™s all beyond your control: itâ€™s automatic. Your body is BRILLIANT, donâ€™t you think? Itâ€™s a matter of understanding why you are eating. Are you hungry, or are you using food as a drug for stress relief, by eating comfort food? Eating is a way to fill your stomach, not an empty heart. Learn to deal with the stress without eating.

01/05/2013,http://comluv.com/5-must-do-things-after-installing-wordpress/,5 Must Do Things after Installing WordPress - ComLuv,"After installing WordPress, you assume that you are almost done with creating a blog. Now, you create some content and wait for Google bots to come and index your blog but this is not the right approach. Well, creating a new blog doesnâ€™t take much time and effort but there are some things you must do just after installing WordPress for better optimization, indexing and better results. So this post is aboutÂ  . Below are the things you need to do after finishing WordPress installation. You should delete the  Âù post as soon as you finish installing WordPress. There is no special reason for this but you must not get this post indexed on Google or any other search engine as it provides no value to your readers. So go to your dashboard and put it intoÂ  Â just after installing WordPress. WordPress permalinks are a great way to increase your SEO. WordPress 3.5 comes with default /%postname%/ permalink structure and I suggest you to use the same for better optimization. You know, closer the keyword is to the beginning, better your SEO results will be (donâ€™t forget to put your keyword in the URL for better SEO). But, if you are using older versions of WordPress then change the permalink structure to /%postname%/ instead of the default structure because this is the best permalink structure for SEO. Changing permalinks in WordPress is easy, Go to settings>>permalinks and change it to /%postname%/. There is a reason behind this. Once your posts get indexed, changing permalink structure will result in  Âù errors and you will have to do a 301 redirect and i bet you donâ€™t want to mess up with all these things. Also, you should go to General settingsÂù and change the following settings. Â Put your site title here. Â Put your tagline here. Â select â€œanyone can registerâ€ù and new user default role as â€œsubscriberâ€ù or whatever you want. Â Select your time zone. I hate Akismet more than any other plugin and there is a reason behind it. Thanks to Ana Hoffman for writing a detailed post on Akismet and its negative effects, you Hello dolly is of no use, so I suggest you to delete it. More number of plugins will increase the load on your server, this will result in slow loading and we know thatÂ  Â now considers page loading speed as a part of SEO. So there is no reason to keep these plugins installed. So delete these plugins after installing WordPress, if you want to have good page loading speed. You should install some useful plugins after installing WordPress. Below are the plugins I use on almost all of my sites and they are really very useful. So, these are some must have plugins for a WordPress blog. I love this plugin, I suggest you to use CommentLuv premium but if you cannot afford it, you can use the free version. This plugin will increase the number of comments on your blog. This is an awesome plugin to generate and submit sitemaps automatically. Applying SEO on your posts will give them a chance to perform well on search engines. You can choose an SEO plugin for your blog according to your needs; I suggest two plugins â€“ SEOPressor (if you can afford it) or SEO by Yoast (if you like to have more options and free plugin). You can choose anyone of these two. They both are awesome, one is premium and other is free. SEO by Yoast gives lots of options like Taxonomies etc. and SEOPressor is specially designed for on page SEO. This is the solution for spams if you have removed Akismet. GASP adds a check box after comment box. Robots cannot check this box so you wonâ€™t get bot spams. Shows the mobile version of your site on Mobile devices like Android, iOS etc. Also, you should install WordPress theme for your new blog if you donâ€™t like the default WordPress theme. So install these plugins and themes after installing WordPress. Now, you need to get your blog indexed on search engines. This depends upon how fast you can share your blogâ€™s link on internet? Try to comment on few well-known blogs, share your blogâ€™s link on social media and submit it to web directories. This will increase the chances of getting indexed quickly. Google bots visit top web pages more often so they will crawl your link from these sites. I have applied the same tricks and my sites got indexed within the day I bought them. So these were some of theÂ  . Hope you liked the post, Happy Blogging.",Alan

When properly employed, Guest Posting can be a very powerful tactic. No other strategy is as ethically justifiable, or as compliant with Googleâ€™s T.O.S as the creation of great quality content. The first step in any Guest Posting campaign should be to identify which blogs in you want to target. Look for blogs in your niche that have high editorial standards. Read through a few of their recent posts and assess the quality of their content. If any of the blogs you selected appear to have low editorial standards, remove them from the list. Donâ€™t focus too heavily on Page Rank,Â  Alexa rank provides a useful way of assessing the visibility of a blog, and domain authority will provide a clearer picture of a blogs true authority than Page Rank anyway. Once you have identified a couple of blogs that are deserving of the great content you intend to write, get involved. Comment on their posts, follow them on Google+ and work on building a relationship. Linking to one of their posts from your own blog, and then letting them know you have done so by leaving a comment on the linked post can be a great way to break the ice. The chances are that they will click the link in your comment and read your article, so they will already know that you write great quality content before you have even asked them about the possibility of becoming a guest author. I much prefer to ask about the possibility of Guest Posting in Google+ hangout chat than via an email, but if you do have to resort to email requests, then make sure you tailor the request to the blog owner in person. Take the time to find out their name, what aspects of your vertical they write about, and provide information in the email that lets the recipient know that you have actually read their blog. Propose writing a post on a specific subject that you think will be well received on their blog and provide previous examples of your work, either on your own blog or as a guest author elsewhere. Itâ€™s important to remember that the owners of popular blogs are inundated with guest post requests on a daily basis, to even stand a chance of success your pitch needs to be right. Guest Posting is now the de facto link acquisition tactic of choice for many internet marketers, and just as standards amongst individual internet marketers vary, so too does the quality of the blogs that they target. There is no shortage of blogs that Including a Google authorship link in your author bio is a great way of increasing the visibility and click through rate of your article in organic search. Generally speaking, anything that can lead to your article receiving more traffic can only be a good thing, but linking to your Google+ profile in every guest post also provides an additional benefit, each link increases the authority of your Google+ posts page. This means that any pages you share via Google+ will receive more link juice. Donâ€™t consider the publishing of your guest post as the end of the line, subscribe to comments on your post and engage your readers. Answering any questions your readers have and responding to feedback is also means you gain an additional link every time you reply. Remember that your readers will likely include other web masters in your vertical, I have gained a number of great Guest Posting opportunities through nothing more than engaging with readers in this manner. Many business owners simply donâ€™t have the time to write high quality content, build relationships, create their own guest posting opportunities, and then engage their readers. For these businesses outsourcing can be a great solution. There are a number of   in the UK that create quality content, on the flip side of the coin there are also a number of not so reputable companies that specialize in precisely the kind of guest posts that are likely to be hit with the next Google update. When choosing a provider itâ€™s imperative to view previous examples of their work and ask yourself if you are happy for their standards of work to be associated with your brand. Only when the answer is a resounding and definitive â€œyesâ€ù should you consider working with them.",Nick Davison

And in the arena of brand building through social networks, Twitter is a platform you should never overlook. With more than 500 million active users and approximately one million new accounts being created every day, Twitter is arguably the top contender of Facebook in terms of usage and following. So, how in the world can a social network channel that only allows 140 characters per post help you grow your business? Here are a few tips. One of the advantages of Twitter over Facebook is its ability to organize people by interests. You follow a marketer and the next thing you know, Twitter is already suggesting other marketing enthusiasts you might want to follow and even show promoted tweets related to marketing. Itâ€™s an organized network where you can find like-minded people whom you can build relationships with either to amplify your   messages or convert into real paying customers. Itâ€™s amazing how a simple symbol can make a big difference. Unless youâ€™ve been living under a rock, you should know that social networks are doubling as search engines. Some marketers even argue that itâ€™s better to search using social media because there is context as opposed to that of semantics used by search engines. When people search for topics   Twitter, they usually use the hashtag (#) before the â€œsearch term (i.e. #marketing) to show all Tweets related to that topic. So, if you want your Tweets to appear Hereâ€™s a clever tip   using the hashtag. Trending topics on Twitter are actually made possible because of the hashtag. If a topic is trending, that means thousands or even millions of people are using that hashtag. So, if thereâ€™s a trending topic that you think you can link to your business, take advantage and post relevant Tweets using that hashtag. This is just another way of saying that you need to share your content on Twitter. Ask around and youâ€™ll be surprised that a lot of people get information about current events or breaking news from Twitter, not from the TV, the newspaper or the news agenciesâ€™ websites. Twitter users are hungry for content so give it to them. Itâ€™s an easily implementable social media activity for effective link building. Just make sure that every piece of content youâ€™re sharing is interesting. According to an   from Info Labs, the top reasons why Twitter users re-tweet are: Content marketing and social media marketing are closely intertwined and Twitter is an effective platform for you to establish your businessâ€™ thought leadership on different industry topics. Businesses and business men or executives are often perceived as cold entities. Through  , you can humanize your brand and bring it closer to your audience or your target market. Remember, the second reason why people interact with brands on Twitter is personal connection. In your Twitter posts, sound professional but warm and accommodating. Engage your followers in constant and meaningful conversations. When people feel a personal connection with your brand, the more likely they are to buy. The old adage reminds us that â€œgood things come in small packages.â€ù While Twitter posts are short and sweet, they can definitely help you push your business forward online.",Subhash Chandra

Although people in higher paid professions do have stress, they have more options to manage their stress. People who are suffering in this economy have far fewer choices for stress relief. Researchers are discovering that a higher percentage of people who are obese have a history of trauma and abuse in their childhood. In many cases overweight people learned in childhood, that you werenâ€™t ok the way you were. For others, this lesson is learned later in life. When I work with people who are suffering from weight challenges, my first questions are about when they started gaining weight. Invariably, there was a stressful event in their lives that preceded their weight gain. Stress not only sends people for the refrigerator to eat comfort foodsÂù, but also changes your biology. Chronic stress slows down your metabolism, as your body changes to make you able to survive. Fight or flight, the stress response, will slow down and stop digestion, and all other normal body functions until the stress is over. For humans with chronic stress, the evidence is seen in belly fat. Dieting and over-exercising, actually are stressful for your body! Being disgusted with your body and how you look is also stressful. These attempts to dieting will result in slowed weight loss, and a gradual regaining of the weight you struggle to lose. Whatâ€™s the answer to obesity and overweight? Look into your past and try to see what started your weight gain. Was it past abuse, or a stressful event in your life? Are you still stressed, or living in an abusive situation? Donâ€™t expect that your body will be able to lose weight and maintain that weight loss until you are able to relieve your stress. If you have a negative mindset, and hate your body, you are sabotaging your ability to lose weight and keep it off. This has been proven with research in brain science. The Law of Attraction also explains that the things upon which your focus are the things you create in your reality. The things you resist, persist! It will be necessary to change your attitude from fatitudÂù, start nurturing your body, and relieve your stress and  . Yes, abuse from others can be damaging. But self-abuse of negative self-talk and mindset can also be sabotaging your ability to lose weight. So stop blaming yourself, and start healing your relationship with your self, and your body. The weight loss will come only after that is in place.",Lianda Ludwig

Furthermore, a negative attitude invites stress, worry and might even be damaging to long term health. All of these reasons, and more, are the reason why you are desperately seeking a true and tested way to look at life in a positive light. So, you have stumbled onto subliminal audio, and wonder if it works. To learn what subliminal audio is, we would first have to understand what subliminal messages are. In one short sentence,  , or so to speak. This means that subliminal messages are the kinds of messages that pass by our perception, but we still get them. To illustrate it with an example, we will go back to   were used in advertising â€“ in a New Jersey theater. During the projection of a movie, every five seconds the words â€œThirsty? drink Coca Cola, Hungry? eat popcornâ€ùÂù would appear for a millisecond or so. What were the results? The theater s  than usual. And people were not even aware of it all! Subliminal audio works by sending positive affirmations to your subconscious. The positive affirmations will have power to help you, just like the subliminal messages during that move projection in New Jersey helped the theater sell more cans of Cola and more popcorn. The positive affirmations that you would receive would be very simple: Etc, etcâ€ùÂ_ many positive affirmations just like these would gradually change Subliminal audio will work straight away. Having said that, for significant and long term effects you will need to listen to the subliminal mp3 or cd tracks more times than just once. Imagine it like this. How long have you had the negative attitude for? Likely for a long time. The reason subliminal audio takes time to really help, not just give you a slight boost so you feel ecstatic for a while, is because what you think you are. If you have been negative for years, you have had plenty of times to reinforce the negative beliefs in your mind. Repetition is the way humans learn. So, for subliminal audio to be truly effective, you will have to give it some time. That means that you need to put aside time each day, preferably 20 minutes before bad and after you have just woken up, to listen to a track. The catch is that   to develop a positive attitude. You have to want it; you have to allow it to help you. Nothing can make you do something against your will; subliminal audio is all about suggestion. . If you feel like it and if you like what your friend suggested, you will go do it. Often times a friend will suggest something you wouldnâ€™t have even thought of, that turned out to be major fun you never knew you could have. On the other hand, if you donâ€™t like to do what your friend suggested at all, you will decline the invitation. . If you donâ€™t want to become more positive, it wonâ€™t be able to force you, and thus it wonâ€™t work. But, if you like the suggestions subliminal audio sends you;  . Subliminal audio can be that friend that suggested something you didnâ€™t even know existed before, that made your day, your week, your month, your year, or maybe your life?",Thomas Allan
24/04/2013,http://comluv.com/enhance-seo-blogging/,How to Enhance Your SEO through Blogging - ComLuv,"Every website owner would want to see improved search engine rankings for their site. A website which has a high ranking will be more visible, and is therefore more likely to attract new readers. In addition, good rankings can help you get the attention of advertisers, and thus generate income with your site. Blogging is one of the most effective strategies for improving your siteâ€™s rankings. Here are some of the ways in which you can enhance your SEO through blogging. The ranking of a site is determined by the number of links pointing back to it. Anytime someone links to you, search engines count it as a â€œËœvoteâ€™ for your site. The more people you have linking to you, the higher your ranking. Having a blog offers you the chance to attract natural backlinks. One of the most effective strategies for building natural backlinks to your site is by writing insightful and relevant blog posts. When people look for information in search engines, they use keywords. Therefore, to make your site more visible, you need to incorporate relevant keywords in the content. Writing keyword-rich blog posts is a great way of enhancing the SEO of your site. For instance, if you run a wedding photography business, your main keyword could be â€œËœprofessional wedding photographyâ€™. When creating Comments left on blog posts can play a key role in enhancing the ranking of a site. They make your blog posts more interactive, as a result attracting more visitors. In reality, comments are actually new content for your blog. Such free content can provide immense SEO benefits to your site, especially when commenters use the same keywords which you are targeting. Search engine rankings can be enhanced by linking one page of a site to another. A blog offers a great chance for interlinking your posts. For instance, if your site is about web hosting, you could create a post about free web hosting tips and link it to another post on paid web hosting. This makes it easier for search engine bots to crawl your site, as well as enabling readers to find your content faster. Whenever anything becomes extremely popular in a short span of time, it is said to have â€œËœgone viralâ€™. This could be a post that gets hundreds of comments in a week or an online video that is watched by millions of people in a month. When people find very interesting content, they will share it with their friends, who are also likely to share it with their friends. Therefore, if you create stimulating or controversial content, there is a possibility of it going viral. As a result, you will be able to attract more visitors to your site, hence enhancing your search engine ranking.",Charles Mburugu

Moreso, if you are writing several quality related contents connect them, or link them together to reduce bounce rate. Please consider my behavior in reading online: So, if you offer several worth reading contents for a related post, put the links inside the post body. Itâ€™s a great idea to break paragraphs, be creative in doing so. All sort of pop ups can annoy users. If you want to reduce your bounce rate, consider removing your pop up windows. Common examples of pop ups are: The most common pop ups as I observe while visiting different blogs and websites are Newsletter sign up forms. Why donâ€™t you consider placing your newsletter on your sidebar or below post content? You can strategically incorporate your layout with your newsletter form other than placing them in Jquery pop up windows.

Obviously, it depends upon the niche market on which you focus, business model you adopt, and the strategies you use.Â Another factor is whether you invest money upfront, or take some time instead.

20/04/2013,http://comluv.com/hypnosis-weight-loss/,Using Hypnosis for Weight Loss - ComLuv,"Welcome to the page that can explain to you how to use hypnosis for weight loss, especially if you are looking to gain that extra willpower to motivate yourself to lose the weight for the last time and change your attitude towards food. Most of you likely gain weight on and off, because the diets you tried have been successful, but after you stopped practicing them the weight came back. Or youâ€™ve just eaten more than usual during holidays and you were surprised by the big number the scale has showed you. So, you have realized that you need to lose weight the natural way, as many people have as well. One of the alternative and natural ways that is gaining popularity is by losing weight with the help of hypnosis. Hypnosis can be an excellent addition to your normal dieting and exercise regime, it can give you a much needed push and be of detrimental value to you in terms of support, but that is only true if you really want to get this problem solved. Although hypnosis can help you push yourself to new limits, it is not magic and it can not make you do things you do not want to do. You have to really put in effort, and if you do, and with hypnosis by your side, your chances of losing weight and staying at that weight once you do will go up tremendously. Hypnosis works by helping you relax so you are more susceptible to suggestions spoken by a hypnotist which enter your subconscious mind to change your behavioral patterns and your thoughts and attitude towards weight loss, diet and exercise from negative to positive ones so that you feel compelled to stick with your dieting and exercise plan and lose weight as a result. The latest trend in weight loss hypnosis which emerged in the last 18 months or so, is the cutting edge method called  , during which the listener goes through the virtual gastric band surgery which is supposed to make him or her feel like they have a smaller stomach and a lesser appetite. The result of this should be that the listener permanently, voluntary and naturally loses weight. This is a relatively new concept, with which many people reportedly had good results. It does not work for everyone of course, as again, hypnosis isnâ€™t magic and it canâ€™t make you do anything you do not want to do, it can merely be that extra push you really need. A virtual gastric band procedure isnâ€™t something you should rush into. Instead take a moment and think it through. If you do not really aim to work on losing weight and just look at this a shortcut or a magic cure, then I would advise you to think again as it will simply not happen. If you do want to go through this you need to be ready to change your beliefs at the core level, so it is definitely nothing you want to take lightly, even though it is all virtual and there is no actual medical procedure taking place.",Thomas Allan
19/04/2013,http://comluv.com/nobrainer-tips-drive-traffic-blog/,Five No-Brainer Tips to Drive More Traffic to Your Blog - ComLuv,"Not so long ago, blogs were channels where teens filled with angst ranted about how cruel the world is to them. Prime example â€“ Mark Zuckerberg and how he compared the girl who dumped her to farm animals. Today, the blogosphere has evolved from a personal space full of nonsensical musings   a platform where people publish content, a tool for experts to give advice, a place where like-minded people discuss and for businesses to reach their audience. Speaking of business blogging, a lot of brands are in   on how they can increase traffic to their site. Itâ€™s mainly a question   SEO, but there are a lot of   variables that come into play as well. In solving this problem, while there are best practices and guidelines you can follow, it boils down to trying several things and determining which strategies or tactics work. However, to help you jumpstart driving more traffic to your blog, here are five, easy-to-implement suggestions and steps to optimize and promote your blog post. When people visit your blog or any website for that matter, they are driven by a motivation or intent â€“ whether itâ€™s to get information, search for tips, be entertained or even just looking for something to read just to pass the time. If your blog posts are not aligned with your audienceâ€™s expectations, they wonâ€™t continue reading your blog, they wonâ€™t return to your blog and certainly, they wonâ€™t recommend your blog to others. Make sure that every blog post you publish is well put together, well researched and is something that is relevant and compelling to your prospective readers. Many business owners withhold information because they feel that they are revealing their trade secrets. Hereâ€™s the thing. Youâ€™re not telling them exactly how you conduct your business. The knowledge you impart will position as an expert in your niche or category. This builds trust and as we all know, trust is a crucial element of conversion. Set up a Google Reader or subscribe to the RSS feed of your competitorsâ€™ blogs, those of experts in your industry and other publishers that deals with topics related to your business. This will serve as your barometer to gauge what topics are hot and people are interested in. Also, donâ€™t just read. Participate by leaving useful comments that add value to the conversation. Simply saying â€œGreat post! I love itâ€ùÂù will not drive traffic to your blog. By leaving Business blogging is not just about publishing content. Since the stakes are higher and you have business objectives that you need to meet, it is essential that you have the penchant for analytics. By looking at this empirical data, you will see patterns of what works and what does not. For example, are there certain days in the week where readership is noticeably high? Are there certain content themes (i.e. â€œHow Toâ€ùÂù articles) that get more favorable response from your audience? Among the many steps to optimize and promote your blog post, examining analytics for insights is often overlooked. One advantage of using WordPress blog is the extensive and easy to understand analytics. Other content management systems have this feature as well. Blogging is social media. In fact, it can be considered as one of the earliest forms of social media so it is just fitting that your business blogging efforts should be closely integrated with social media marketing. When using social networks to promote your blog, be strategic. Donâ€™t just post links to new posts. Give it a structure. For example, as youâ€™re working on a post, you can give you social followers a teaser of what they can expect next. When thereâ€™s an upsurge of interest   a topic you previously wrote about due to current events, refresh your social communityâ€™s memory that you have indeed   about that topic before. Of course, donâ€™t forget that social media marketing is about relationships and having meaningful conversation with people. Donâ€™t let your followers hanging. Respond to their comments and posts. In other words, do guest blogging. Your blog may not have a strong following yet, but other blogs do and thereâ€™s no stopping   from leveraging their strong readership as long as you do it ethically and through quality content. Guest blogging is one of the steps to optimize and promote your blog posts that will only work for those who value high quality content marketing. Just to reiterate, quality is very important. If you submit poorly written, the web administrators of these blogs will only get annoyed and you might be blacklisted. As an act of basic courtesy, read the blog submission guidelines of this site and make sure you provide content that will add value to their readers. Blogging is a great tool to engage your audience and build your brand. If you think youâ€™re publishing high quality content on your business blog, it would be a shame not to get the traffic and for people to miss out on reading your content. Start with these simple steps to optimize and promote your blog. You wonâ€™t see great results overnight but itâ€™s a good start.",Subhash Chandra
18/04/2013,http://comluv.com/natural-link-building-work/,Natural Link Building: Does It Work? - ComLuv,"Natural link building works, but if you donâ€™t understand how it works, youâ€™re likely to become disappointed before it starts to work for you. So before you start trying blackhat SEO techniques which may get you blacklisted, consider the following points that follow the ethical SEO standards. A brand new site has no incoming links and no organic incoming traffic so the most effective natural link building techniques are out of reach. What you need to do is establish your first set of incoming links. Make sure you have an initial set of high-quality content-at least a few thousand words (or dozens of pictures or videos if thatâ€™s your type of site). Without high-quality content, attracting links becomes much more difficult. Now use the guest post technique. Find a blog or other frequently-updated site and offer its webmaster free content in exchange for a link back to your site. Repeat this step ten or twenty times to get additional links. Each time you guest post for one site, you can use that guest post as leverage for posting at a higher ranked site. For example, tell a medium-ranked site that you guest posted for a low-ranked site in the same niche, and then tell a high-ranked site that you guest posted for that medium-ranked site. The higher ranked a site you guest post for, in general, the more useful will be the link back to your site. Now that you have your initial set of incoming links, you can expect to get your initial incoming traffic. One great way to use a small amount of traffic to get a large amount of links is to run a contest with a nice prize. This might be a prize you have to pay out of pocket for or it can be something your create yourself. In general, physical products do much better than virtual goods such as ebooks. But whatever method you use to encourage your traffic to give you great links, make sure you back up your site with additional great content. Great content makes it easy for people to feel good about linking to your site. Many website builders get carried away when building links when they actually come naturally when you just take action. You do not need to create thousands of links as it is only the quality ones that will count in the end. The absolute best links to get are the ones that stay alive for years to come. This is why Guest posting is an awesome way to build links and share your knowledge. this is After you leverage your initial traffic into additional links, youâ€™ll find you start to   for the various keyword phrases youâ€™ve targeted. That newly improved rank will draw more traffic and give you the opportunity to rank for more keyword phrases. This is the snowball effect working for you-the bigger you get, the easier it will be to get more links and draw more traffic.

17/04/2013,http://comluv.com/choose-butter-margarine/,Which One Do You Choose: Butter or Margarine? - ComLuv,"In fact there are hundreds of thousands of sites if not millions bashing one over the other claiming animal fats will kill you and plant fats will save you. I personally have had both and like both, depending on what Iâ€™m eating or cooking. So, out of curiosity, I decided to do a little poking around because I wanted to understand more about the debate and see if one really was that much worse than the other. To start, letâ€™s go back a few hundred years. Now, thereâ€™s this weird story around about how margarine killed a bunch of turkeys and was then unleashed on unsuspecting consumers who donâ€™t know that itâ€™s just one â€œstepâ€ù away from making plastic. Letâ€™s just step back from that crazy train and go back in time. The discovery of margaric acid in the early 1800â€™s by a French chemist,  Â was a precursor to the creation of margarine. The acid was found to be a combination of natural fatty acids. Another French chemist,  Â came up with a butter alternative in the 1860â€™s called oleomargarine because the Emperor of France something that could be used by the military and the masses, not turkeys :).Â Oleomargarine was made from both animal (primarily beef) and plant fats. Over the years the ingredients of oleomargarine changed as certain types of animal fats became scarce. With that shortage, it was made exclusively from plant fats and oils. In the 1950â€™s and 1960â€™s companies fought with each other trying to create the type of margarine that tasted more like butter. That market demand caused manufacturers to create margarine from dairy products as well as plant products. Over the last three decades, in an effort to cater to the more health-minded public, most if not all companies have done away with the use of â€œpartially hydrogenated oils,â€ù have fortified margarine with essential vitamins and minerals and have turned to more natural fats such as olive and sunflower oils to create healthier products. According to some, margarine has a bad rep because, well, itâ€™s bad. But letâ€™s take another look. Margarine is a semi-solid mixture of refined plant oils and fats. The refinement is called hydrogenation, which means that an element of a substance is treated with hydrogen. During this process, trans fats may be produced. Trans fats used to be very prominent in a variety of foods because it does help to extend shelf life. However, research showed that trans fats Â raised LDL cholesterol and lowered HDL cholesterol, increasing the risk or coronary heart disease. Some companies decided to move away from that practice and created margarine that were based on omega-3 fats from nuts and seeds. There are additives in margarine and thatâ€™s probably the source of a lot of the bad feelings. When people think of additives, they may think of artificial flavors and coloring. In some margarine, that may be the case. One additive is annatto, which is a seed that has a nutty flavor and a yellow to deep orange color, depending on how much is used. Another additive that may be a source of controversy is palm oil. Palm oil has been used for centuries as a food additive. Itâ€™s naturally trans-fat free and loaded with vitamins A and E and even  â€_in itâ€™s natural form. The question is if the palm oil is the unrefined, natural form or is it the refined, more readily available but nutritionally compromised version? Some products are required to clearly label products so that people can make more informed decisions. Butter is made by churning fresh or fermented milk from cows, goats, sheep, buffalo even yaks. Unlike margarine, itâ€™s solid in the fridge and softens at room temperature. Because animal fats may contain dangerous bacteria, itâ€™s pasteurized to kill those microbes. Being more natural, butter has a limited shelf life and needs to be refrigerated. Throughout the world butter is made from the milk fat of different animals, like cows and sheep, and is considered a staple in many cultures as it can be churned manually by anyone who knows how. Butter is high in animal-based saturated fats and up until recently, doctors, dietitians and other medical professionals have been telling people to switch from animal fats to vegetable fats. However, according to a  , patients who switched from animal fats to omega-6 polyunsaturated fats like those found in margarine (made from plant fats) had increased mortality from cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease than those who had diets rich in saturated fatty acids. It is a well-known fact that some forms of  , which is a major detriment to cardiovascular health. Â Revisiting this 40 year old study is turning a lot of heads and raising a lot of questions about what people have been told, how products were made then versus now and will more than likely lead to other research studies along the same lines for years to come. Bearing in mind the age of the study, it could be seen as a significant step towards validating those who in favor of more natural foods, i.e. butter, but it does give a little boost to some forms of margarine as well. Remember, margarine was originally made with animal and vegetable fats so we could see a resurgence of those types of butter alternatives. We could also see some kinds of vegetable oils removed from margarine altogether while others are used more frequently.

Lots of guides point out various ways of building backlinks with varying percentages of anchor text, then you have the people who tell you what percentage of your text needs to be your keyword and how many different variations on the keyword you need etc, etc, etc, blah, blah, blah. Itâ€™s a headache! Follow the basics here and youâ€™ll be on your way to ranking. In this quick guide Iâ€™ll try to make things as simple as possible so that anybody reading can get an almost guaranteed top 10 search engine ranking when they make their next few articles. Iâ€™ll come clean right up front, I am going to plug my book at the end of this article but even if it doesnâ€™t interest you, I hope the information here will help you anyway. The biggest part of this whole process will be made easier if you have the information in that book to hand however. If you have been struggling with ranking, there are 2 areas that Iâ€™d like to concentrate on that will help you for sure, namely: The first thing you can do is link out to an authority on the subject that you are writing about, and yes, it should be a â€˜dofollowâ€™ link if you are wondering. Here for example I can take the opportunity to link to this article on   which is on Google.com. Note that the link is set to open in a new tab so that you donâ€™t lose the visitor completely if they do decide to click through. This is of course the main ranking factor behind the concept of EMD (Exact Match Domain) and/or niche sites. While it is not always a factor you can use, it is definitely worth mentioning for those who are in the stage of planning a new site. This is a factor that you can control on just about every article you write. The best way to achieve this in WordPress is to enter â€˜/%postname%/â€™ into the â€˜custom structureâ€™ field on the permalink settings page. Then when you are creating an article, the URL will automatically become whatever your title is. This can be further optimized by clicking the â€˜editâ€™ button next to the permalink when editing if desired. Note: I donâ€™t recommend changing the permalink structure on an existing site that is already ranking! This is pretty much self explanatory, what isnâ€™t so obvious however is that you can also use the title to include a longer tail version of your keyword along with something catchy to pull in readers from the SERPâ€™s. I find the best way to do this in WordPress is by using  , there are of course other plugins or even themes which can help with this. Again, bear in mind that you can squeeze in a longer tail version This again is fairly easy to carry out, just be wary of writing exactly the same thing in your articles H1 tags as you did in the title. It looks kinda strange, especially when they are both right at the top of the page one on top of the other. Putting an image in a post makes it look prettier anyway so why not take the opportunity to get your keyword on the page in another form by using the image alt tags? Not only do the search engines take notice of this, you may end up picking up a few extra visitors through Goolge image search. Once again, this is pretty much self explanatory, I personally like to do the keyword with both bold and italics on time and towards the beginning of the article. Toward the start of the first paragraph is the best option if it will make sense. Quite simple, head on over to YouTube and search for a video that is related to what you are talking about and embed it within your post. Make sure that it is helpful and informative for the visitor, they are more likely to stay longer on your page if they watch and Google likes this! _Ÿ™‚ By the way, have you noticed I havenâ€™t mentioned using the meta keywords tag? [youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK7IPbnmvVU&w=560&h=315] This really should be the very first thing you concentrate on, without good keyword research you are really going to struggle no matter how good your on page SEO is. You could fail for many reasons: Big companies with a big budget or huge authority sites will always have a big advantage over us when it comes to â€˜head keywordsâ€™ like â€˜SEOâ€™ or â€˜dietingâ€™ etc but there is fortunately a way we can research keywords to see if they will be easy to rank for. To give you a clue on how to do this, you could choose one of the keywords that you are trying to rank for on one of your own posts and go through the top 10 results in Google to find out if they are doing everything I told you to do above, with your on page SEO. You might be lucky and find that they are not, doubtful however. Now next time you are doing research you can go through each of your prospective keywords one by one, trying to find the gems that have not been heavily targeted yet. You have all the information you need to succeed now. â€_it is going to take you hours and hours of research every time you need a new keyword for an article. This is where my new book comes in, it will show you how to get all of that research done in record time using free tools and it also runs you through a live example where you get to see how I increase website ranking to page 1 for a 1300 local US search in a matter of days.

So I am going to share some tips which are very easy to follow and will Surely Increase Facebook Likes faster for your Page which will not take much time to Implement. There is no Option for this. You Must Constantly deliverÂ unique and Quality content to your readers. If you are not doing this then you will certainly loose many likes for your Page because there will not be any use and it will be irritating for the readers that very common topics are getting displayed in their News Feed. That will make it Unwanted and Hence you may loose Likes. This is another Point of attraction for readers which will Increase Facebook Likes faster. Writing a Good Bio and Choosing a Proper Username increases a Reputation among readers and Hence trust. You should choose your Blog name as a Facebook Page URL. Also try to add some Interesting bio rather than Boringly describing what your Blog is gonna deliverÂ to the readers. The Bio should be Friendly in words which will attract more users. Â Also you should describe in Such a way that readers should think that the Page is gonna notify for  I do not really need to explain what is the Role of logo in attracting readers and consumers. A good logo will certainlyÂ Pull some attraction from Facebook users and Readers to your Page which will Increase Facebook likes. Once the user in on your Page, he/she sees three things viz.  . Logo Icon should be 180Ã—180 pixels in measurements and the Cover Photo must be having resolution 8511Ã—315 which will fit the Page exactly. Hire any Good Logo Designer to Design such Logo and Cover Page for you. Choosing a Template Design is one of the Starters steps. I think most of the bloggers will not agree that Choosing any Template Design will Increase Facebook likes, they might be true about this, it may not make much difference but a Poor template design will. Because the Facebook user might get a Bad impression just because of your Template Design. This is the Very common step followed by Page Admins. I have seen many People asking for likes on Facebook Chats. Well I will say that Please do not Overdo it. Just Ask Your Friends to like from the Options provided in the Facebook Page Admin Panel. Also many Bloggers keep telling about E-Mail marketing. Use such email lists to Invite using E-Mail Contacts. Show your Facebook Likes Count and ask Visitors to Like your Page and Place this Box in the Primary Sidebar of your Website/Blog. This box should be placed at the top of the Sidebar, means when any page is opened the visitor sees this Like Box when he/she checks sidebar. You can choose to add Facebook Streaming in this Like box if you want to. You can choose from the Several LightBox plugins which is displayed whenever a new page is opened. This Lightbox appears  Â you open a new page which prompts users to click Like button provided in the  . Believe me Most of the Users are logged into Facebook all the time so when the search engine traffic flows to your website/blog the likes increases with a tremendousÂ speed. When You Build a Strong Network Among Famous Bloggers you can ask them to   Your Page which will notify their Friends and Followers. So some users will check your Page and even like it. Also it helps to get likes for your Posts and Updates from your Blog/Website. But   to share and Like content from other Bloggers. Because â€œSharing is Caring.â€ù This is one of the Most   ways to Increase your Social Media Followers count and hence Increase Facebook Likes. You can ask your Readers to Like/Share Facebook Page and its content. Share your Giveaway links to MaximumÂ Facebook Groups and Comment on CommentLuv blogs with Recent Post of the Giveaway. Provide Some Unique Downloads on your Blog/Website for which you should ask just for a Like. You can create it at  . Just Enter Facebook Page URL, then Download link, then Width, color scheme and email address. And use this on your website/blog I really do not need to tell you About CommentLuv Plugin. Just configure your Settings so that if a Blogger wants to comment and wants to choose a Post from its last 10 posts then he/she must like the post. This will Increase the Facebook Page Reach and increase the likes for the Posts. Post something unique and Interesting daily on your FacebookÂ fan page. But do not go Out of your niche. For example you can try Some Jokes, Banners Trolls, Quotes which resembles to your Niche. You Should Not be Posting Jokes About Fashion if you are following a Tech niche. In Short you should Target your type of audience with what they Like. Generally Users Just Post Links with the Thumbnails and expect to get Traffic from Facebook. But this is not enough to get traffic and increase Facebook likes. Try to Add Some unique Image which describes the link you are posting with. Try to Find some Humorous Image which will pull some more Facebook users and bring them in reach. This will increase FacebookÂ Fans Faster than Posting Just links. There are Many Facebook Groups which are used by bloggers to Promote their Posts. Join them and Post your Post Links and Images which will bring them to Limelight and get More Likes from Bloggers and others. Also you can make A group By  Making Multiple Admins and Moderators for your page can help to Post constant and Unique content through Facebook Page and target Facebook Users. Also it will help to interact with readers in the comments which will increase the Facebook Page reach will will bring you more  . Like Pages with High Number of Likes (Like With Page Account). Remember liking the Page is not enough but being active is more Important. When you will Comment on these Pages the Commentators will try to check out your Page and you will get likes. I have observed one thing that the users on Famous Pages just keep on Liking the Pages they See. So If you are active there then you may get Many Such likes who are desperateÂ to Like Pages Even I was Shocked When I Discovered that such Users Exists!!) Most of the Successful Bloggers are recommending to use Viral Marketing methods to get More traffic and Social Network Followers. It is very Obvious but these techniques must not be limited only for your Content but also for your Facebook Page. You can try different things such as Posting Infographics, Making a userâ€™s fool on April Fools Day etc.Â To Pull More likes. People love Viral Content as it is indeed Unique. QR codes have been a Great use to get Information with a Scan.  Â these QR codes tools to generate a Landing Page when the Code is Scanned. The Code will redirect to the Facebook Page which when liked users will get Latest Updates on their News Feed. You can Hire any Programmer to Develop some Interesting or Viral Apps for your Facebook Page which will Pull you more Likes. You can provide Games, or Any unique content using these Facebook Apps.

You can set your Budget and CPC You can also select audience according to your Interests. Facebook will show these ads in Sponsored category to which most users must be aware.",Ravi
13/04/2013,http://comluv.com/blog-contests-hidden-traffic-gem-neglect/,Blog Contests ~ Hidden traffic gem you must not neglect!,"Organizing blog contests on your blog is a powerful way to pull in huge traffic. From my experience, you get rewarded more than you put in. Despite the huge value in benefits, most bloggers are still not sure if itâ€™s worth their time.Â My   has been doing quite fine bringing in quite impressive traffic. In this post, I discuss some of the things I did to push the contest high. Not all blog contests you organize will experience immeasurable success though. Some will definitely be more successful than others. However, there are things to do to always be on the upward move. Here are some points to guide you as you plan your next contest: This is incontestably one of the very strong points to shoot your blog contest through the roof. People love money.Â  Itâ€™s generally said the best way to give someone what he wants is to give money.Â  You may not know that what he really wants now is Commentluv Premium plugin so giving him a premium template may be of little or no value. What if you just send him $120 as prize for the blog contest he just won? That means heâ€™s 100 very fulfilled. He can get Commentluv Premium and still save some money. Oh yes! I see why cash prize contests are the hottest on the Internet today. Now just add cash prize to your next blog contest and see the how your readers go crazy. Oh no! Enstine I donâ€™t have $100 to give out! Donâ€™t worry! Iâ€™ll show you how to raise the money. Just read on. Here is one thing that kicks me off so many contest pages. If you want me to like 20 fan pages and follow 20 Twitter accounts, etc, it wonâ€™t work for me. Most often, contest organizers want to bundle everything in a single contest. That makes the task heavy and keeps many participants away. There are many tools out there to help you run your contests. Some paid and other free. Which ever is your choice, youâ€™ll have to be wise and make sure you get the facilities you want. Most commonly used free tools are RaffleCopter and PunchTab. While I have used both of them, I like Punchtab for its facility that rewards hard work. Each PunchTab contest participant is generated a unique referral url. The more they pull traffic to these unique URLs, the more points they earn, standing a better chance to win. This will encourage participants to drive more traffic to your contest page through their referral url as they fight to earn more points and win the contest. If you care about your contest, then you have to do some promotion. I know, like any other blog post, you are going to share on social media, mail to your list, talk to your friends about it, etc. But there is much you should do to take your blog contests to greaterÂ heights. Here are some suggested dedicated platforms for contests promotions: I know there are a couple of others. You can add to this list in the comment box In my most recent blog contests, I contacted a few friends to sponsor with cash. Surprisingly, it came in so easy. Â I got more than enough guys who showed up to sponsor. Â So I had to split them into two blog contests. Listen, in blogging, there are many cool guys that are ready to join hands to succeed. Just talk to your friends and youâ€™ll see them jumping on board.  Avoid too many sponsors on a single blog contest. In trying to reward them, you are going to make participation difficult. If you have 10 sponsors, each having a Fanpage and Twitter account, that will mean 20 PunchTab tasks already. Thatâ€™s way too high for an average participant. If you have many sponsors, split them into several blog contests Have you ever organised a blog contest? What were your successes? Let me hear your thoughts in the comment box and thanks for sharing this post with your friends.",Enstine Muki

But what if youâ€™re just getting started building your business? Then the best websites to imitate fall into four categories: If you want to   and your business quick, take a look at minimalist websites. Many of the best minimalist websites sell just one product, often an info product, using just one page, the sales page. Although the sale pages on many   are long enough to count for a dozen pages on other websites, thereâ€™s no functional website easier to create than the minimalist website. All you need to do is find a product and then spend an afternoon (or less if you write fast) describing the product and all of its benefits in appealing detail. Go ahead and take a look at the best minimalist websites right now and think about how easy it would be for you to imitate them. If imitating a minimalist website isnâ€™t your thing, then the best website for you to imitate is your favorite website-or at least a website you really enjoy. Creating a non-minimalist website is a long process, so you ought to find a reason to enjoy the journey and not just the destination. Imitating a website you enjoy is the best way to do that. But if money is your goal, the best websites to imitate are probably busy websites. The busier the website, the more potential for profit-and the more established the community around the website. Itâ€™s much, much easier to tap into an established community than it is to create your own new community. Imitating a busy website is a great way to legally and morally build your business until youâ€™re ready to take the lead in your niche. Some sites may not be that busy, but theyâ€™re definitely going through changes. Change is good. Change means the webmaster is experimenting with new technologies or new techniques. People who experiment often track their progress so they know when the experiment has succeeded. Thatâ€™s great news for you-all you have to do is watch the evolving website to see where it stops. Youâ€™ll know thatâ€™s where the experiment succeeded, so you can imitate it without having to go through any of the intermediate unsuccessful iterations. Best of all, your imitation wonâ€™t be behind the curve on the new technology or technique by more than a few weeks, so youâ€™ll have the same opportunity to attract visitors to your imitation website as your template website. When you imitate a website, donâ€™t copy it exactly or even try to â€œspinâ€ùÂù the site. Instead make a checklist for yourself listing what you like about the site and use that checklist when designing and writing content for your own site. Although the old saw says imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, copying a website directly will get you banned from Google and completely waste your effort to imitate the best websites.",Mitz Pantic

09/04/2013,http://comluv.com/steadily-increase-website-traffic/,How To Steadily Increase Website Traffic - ComLuv,"The best way to increase website traffic is by adding more content to your site. Any high-quality content will work-but there are a few particular types of content which will work better than others. Linkbait is posts on your site written specifically to attract incoming links. Google doesnâ€™t care about incoming links as much as it once did, but it still cares some and incoming links are a great source of non-search website traffic. Any article on your site can be linkbait, but you can also use a few well-known formulas to write linkbait: â€¢Â Â Â Â  Controversial linkbait is a controversial opinion post which screams out for comment or refutation â€¢Â Â Â Â  Current news linkbait works when you have a fresh news story nobody else has or a unique perspective or a timely topic which other bloggers will want to mention to their readers â€¢Â Â Â Â  List linkbait lets you choose the best or worst of something. Other people love linking to top-10 lists if they agree with them (or violently disagree with them) One of the easiest ways I know to attract traffic is to give people free stuff-especially physical free stuff. But you probably canâ€™t afford to give free stuff to everyone who visits your blog, so youâ€™ll have to settle on giving free stuff to only a few people. The Then write out your contest rules. In the U.S. and many other countries which regulate gambling, you canâ€™t require people to pay to enter a contest, so your contest should be free. But that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t require people to do something in order to enter your contest. Be creative: look for something easy people can do to help   but which wonâ€™t discourage people from entering your contest. For example, you can require people promote your site on social media to enter your contest. Also remember to promote your own contest with other websites in your niche who might be interested. Mailing lists and social media are great ways to get recurring traffic to your website. Once people subscribe to your list or start following you, you can send them links to your latest and greatest website content. Itâ€™s important to only encourage your fans to read your best content if you want to increase website traffic. Anyone who is consistently impressed with you will recommend your site to other people. Later, when you have all the website traffic you need, you can   then send subscribers and followersÂ links to products or services which make you money. But whichever technique you use-even if it isnâ€™t a technique listed here-remember that adding more high-quality content to your site is the single best way to increase website traffic.",Mitz Pantic

Now letâ€™s get to the point and see what plugins you can use to speed up your WordPress blog. The   recommended byÂ pro-bloggersÂ and leading web hosts. This plugin is designed to reduce loading time and improve userÂ experienceÂ by improving your server performance. With this single plugin you will be able to create cache for browser, database, objects, pages and not just cache it will also minify CSS andÂ JavaScriptÂ to save you every single kilobyte that you can. And YES, W3 Total Cache also supports Content Delivery Networks like MaxCDN, NetDNA, Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud, and Amazon Cloud Front. If you find it difficult to setup W3 Total Cache than I would recommend you to try WP SuperÂ Cache. As compared to W3 Total Cache, this plugin is very easy to set up and maintain. The plugin caches every database query withinÂ predefinedÂ lifetime which makes your blog load much faster and uses less disk space for cached files compared to other plugins. The developer of this plugins claims that itâ€™s even much better than other caching plugins like WP-Cache and WP Super Cache (one that I mentioned above). On of the best way to maintain WordPress performance is to regularly optimize database entries and to do this automatically, you can try WP Database Optimizer plugin. You can schedule it to run after a certain number This plugin caches the output of your blog widgets which significantly reduces database queries and speeds up your WordPress blog. Use this plugin as an addition along with WP Super Cache . If you are getting lots of comment on your posts and you are also displaying gravatars with comments then this plugin will surely help you reduce page loading time.  InsteadÂ of downloading gravatars images directly from Gravatar.com, the plugin will stores all the gravatars on your blog by caching gravatars on comment submission which means lesserÂ DNS query look up and better site speed. The plugin helps you combine and compress CSS, JavaScriptÂ files and thus reduces the total number of HTTP request which means better site loading time. The plugin gives you free hands to include or exclude certain CSS or JS files to minify. In case, you are using W3 Total Cache you donâ€™t need to install this plugin since W3 Total Cache anÂ inbuiltÂ setting to minify CSS, JS and HTML. We all know that posts with eye catchy images tends to do well as compared to posts without any image. But one big problem with images is their file size which can dramatically increase page loading time. And to overcome this issue, I recommend you to install WP Smush.it plugin on your WordPress blog. Once you install this plugin, every image you add in your post will automatically be optimized and compressed which again means better page loading time and much better userÂ experience. If you are using lots of images in your posts or pages this plugin will surely help you reduce load time and save bandwidth. The plugin replaces all images (including gravatars) and iframes in your page with a placeholder and loads them only when they are visible in the view port of the browser. P3 or Plugin Performance Profiler, is a plugin you can use to scan all your installed WordPress plugins and detect which plugins are slowing down your WordPress blog. Besides using these powerful plugins, there are many other ways you can try to make your blog load fast and some of them areÂ discussedÂ  . Now that you know what plugins you can use forÂ  . Go and give them a try on your WordPress blog.",Tesur Rajan

The facts (which I will state below) that I found made me stop buyingÂ  And I am sure thatÂ  will do the same after reading my post. If you are looking for a face- lift in a bottle, you may be disappointed with the results you get. Although most anti-aging creams contain those ingredients, they are in less concentration than recommended, so, if effective, you need to wait long to get the desired results, and when you stop using them, there is a possibility that wrinkles will appear again. I was very disappointed when I read that the FDA classifies creams as cosmetics. Cosmetics only undergo tests forÂ safetyÂ and not for effectiveness. Therefore, every cream we buy is safe to be used on a human being, but does it reduce the appearance of wrinkles? There is no guarantee! Â  Ok, if you insist, but you need to keep the following in mind: These facts made me think a million times before buying anti-aging creams, I even tossed away anti-aging creams I have in my closet. I switched to more natural ways to reduce my wrinkles and prevent future wrinkles from appearing. A woman from the Middle East gave me a special green tea mask remedy, which I have been using for 2 months now. My skin is more flexible now, moisturized, and age spots started to fade. All are natural ingredients that you can find in your kitchen. I will write a post about that in the near future.

In this article we will look at five really good reasons why you might decide improve your home by investing in double glazing. Older, wooden-framed windows are not very efficient in keeping in the heat. This means that you are likely to have to set your central heating at a higher temperature and keep it on for longer to adequately heat your house. This is something that many people are not prepared to do, particularly senior citizens, who need more heat because of their propensity to lose body heat more quickly. In addition, older window units tend to be draughty. In the same way that older windows are not very effective in keeping the heat in, they are also inefficient when it comes to keeping noise out.

04/04/2013,http://comluv.com/top-6-websites-paid-contributing-articles/,Top 6 Websites To Get Paid For Contributing Articles,"Numbers of freelance content writers are increasing everyday, likewise the scope of earning from content writing also. You can definitely earn a handsome amount by writing a book and getting it published; but â€œwriting a book and getting it publishedâ€ùÂù may sound easy but trust me it isnâ€™t. So how most freelancer are sticking to â€œearn from home jobâ€ùÂù instead of looking for a 9-5 desk job? Â Iâ€™ll you how. Freelance content writer, like myself, contribute articles on various websites which offer a compensation based on the traffic receives or a fixed compensation. On some websites you can put your own Google Adsense code from where you can earn a long term passive income depending on the demand of the topic of the article and of course quality. There are many sites which compensate writers for contributing articles. Top 6 websites to get paid for contributing articles are as follows: Squidoo is probably the best and most loved websites for freelance writers because of its user friendly interface and the fees it pays. You can publish your article immediately by following the required guidelines and optimizing it with images and formatting it with headings and subheadings. When a lens (published articles are called Squidoo lens) is published, Squidoo automatically include ads from affiliate network, mostly Amazon, within your published lens. The   that the ads generate are sent to the article author through Paypal or can be donated to the authorâ€™s desired charity. This is similar to the Squidoo programme. Here after you create a â€œhubâ€ùÂù, Hubpages will automatically post ads related to your content. Here also the ads generate from Hubpages associate affiliate network, like Amazon amd ebay or from Google Adsense. After you have reached the minimum payout your income will be sent to your Paypal account. The     Both the thresholds are easy to reach, just write quality content and do some little SEO on it. Triond allows you to submit articles (in-directly) on popular websites relevant to the article niche. Users submit article on Triond then Triond approve or disapprove the article depending on their guidelines and then they publish your article automatically on websites which are associated with Triond. You get paid   (from direct advertising). It is quite different from the above mentioned network. Here you have to write and submit a unique content. Unlike Blogging.org, registering on About.com is very tough and time taking. You will have to be an already experienced and professional content writer or journalist to get yourself registered. You cannot just apply to contribute on any topic of your choice. They have editors and contributor for almost every topic. You will have to choose a topic which does not already have a contributor or editor. You will have to submit your resume and if the â€œsuper editorâ€ùÂù approves your resume then you will be able to register and then contribute. Once you have registered then earning from there is not a rocket science. You donot have to optimize your article for SEO, you will only have to write a quality article which will be beneficial for the readers.  . About.com also pays a cut from Google Adsense income. Probably the best place for freelancers from every niche. If you have any skills (does not limit to internet marketing) you can earn from Fiverr. I have made my first income from Fiverr J. Here you can post a free ad about your service, in this case about your content writing skills. As soon as a buyer posts an order, you will be notified to your registered email id. Then you will have to complete and submit the work within the Estimated Time mentioned in your gig. If you fail to do so your client may cancel the order or may give you more time to complete it. This depends upon the client and your luck! Â There is no minimum payment, you can withdraw as low as $4 to your Paypal account. $4 is the minimum you will make from one order. Fiverr takes $1 per order.   just by content writing. The above mentioned ways are not the ultimate ways of earning money from writing articles. There are many more ways and sources by which you can make money by contributing articles. If you are a skilled web designer looking for passive income from content writing, I recommend you to visit weblogs like  ,   and many similar web design blog which pays contributor as soon as their article is approved. The payment ranges from . When the question is about  , Sky is really the limit! If this information proves beneficial for you and you earn from it, donâ€™t forget to send me a cut to my Paypal account. Just Kidding!",Debarshi Ghosh Dastidar

Lots of groups arrange enjoyable events like field trips, museum tours, trips to sporting events and more. Support groups are also a great way for your children to meet new friends and build lasting relationships. These groups give a vital opportunity for socialization. Setting rules, choosing a curriculum before you start, creating a schedule, and choosing an environment with the least distractions will help things run smoothly. There are lots of curriculums to choose from. Depending on your budget you may want to look into free and paid options. You may even choose to develop your own curriculum.Â Do some research and consider the products that are available. The internet is full of resources to help you develop a homeschool curriculum that works for you and your child. As I mentioned earlier, organization is key to homeschool success. Create a schedule that is enjoyable for you and the children. You donâ€™t have to pack 10 subjects into 6 hours of learning. It is more important that your children absorb what they are taught. Since each child is different, you may need to spend more time on certain subjects than others. With discipline and team work, homeschooling can be a great experience for the whole family.",Dorothy Whitfield

27/03/2013,http://comluv.com/money-appraise-online-content/,Money and Value. How to appraise your online content.,"Iâ€™m going to say something about money. I donâ€™t want you to freak out, just follow me on this for a moment: What do you need to do in order to own a website thatâ€™s worth $1 million dollars? Well, all you have to do is create a one page website worth $1 million dollars or create a website with 1 million pages worth $1 each. Get it? I donâ€™t think you do. Hereâ€™s an example of what I mean. In DecemberÂ  , wrote about how she earns $100 per guest post. Now obviously thereâ€™s more to it than just clicking publish and cashing a check. Mitz has already done the work it takes to earn that money in advance. Â She has already completed the major steps: NO, you donâ€™t need to go to any fancy appraisal school but you will need to understand the practical, logical, and common sense relationship between value and money. I know equations can make things easier and harder for people to understand some times. _Ÿ™‚ The point is VALUE is  . It absolutely has to be or else a sales transaction should not take place. Â Think about it like this. Â When you make a purchase do you check to see if you can find the same item for a lower or higher price? Exactly. Â You want the most for every dollar you spend. Â You want VALUE. So, what should you do when you donâ€™t have money but you really want some? CREATE VALUE. If a guest post is worth up to $100 on Andyâ€™s blog then how much is your post worth on your blog? Instead of confusing you withÂ sillinessÂ like real estate appraisers Iâ€™ll give it to youÂ straight: Hereâ€™s what you should be thinking about: > I have seen offers on Odesk and other comparable sites that pay $5 for a 500 word post. Â Thatâ€™s one penny per word. Â More than what you had but do you really want to > Iâ€™ve noticed offers on the problogger job board that pay $50 or more per 1000 word guest post. Â Thatâ€™s 5 cents a word, better than being a digital sharecropper but rates like this could leave you living like aÂ slum dogÂ millionaire. If you wrote an article, published it on your blog and waited a few days how much revenue does it generate? Â If the answer is $0.00 then that is your postâ€™s current market value. Thatâ€™s the bad news. The good news is you can change it. This is really what you should be thinking about when it comes to appraising your content. Â Your posts can earn money even if they havenâ€™t made you a single dime all year. First you need to know why youâ€™re not making money. I understand the deal, youâ€™re writing blog posts and sharing them on social media and writing more posts and sharing them on social media but no money is being made, what gives? Well, your shares on social media are not enough. Think about what a new Pizza restaurant does when they open up in your neighborhood. Whatâ€™s one of the first things you see them doing?",Darnell Jackson
26/03/2013,http://comluv.com/discover-successfully-pick-products-promote-affiliate-marketer/,Discover How I Successfully Pick Products to Promote as an Affiliate Marketer,"Affiliate marketing offers an incredible business opportunity for anybody who enjoys writing. Itâ€™s also fantastic because you donâ€™t need to make a big investment at all. You can start small and build up a very lucrative business, thatâ€™s simple, over time. I stumbled onto affiliate marketing and am glad I did. At first it was a lot of trial and error, but I persisted and in time I started earning some serious commissions. All it took was developing a system that worked for me and finding the right products for me to promote. The reason I started promoting certain affiliate products, is because I own them and actually use them. I honestly love these products. Regarding these, I donâ€™t use any other criteria in choosing which products to promote (Note the screen where I show how to select products to promote). Iâ€™ve read stories about other affiliate marketers and how theyâ€™d love to find good products that theyâ€™d be proud to ethically promote. They want to make sure that they only promote products that theyâ€™d purchase themselves, instead of simply promoting products just to make money. Iâ€™d say to them, take a look at some of the software you use around your home. If you stop and think about it, surely thereâ€™s software products that you love or use everyday. If you take this approach to selecting a product that youâ€™d like to promote, youâ€™ll surely find products that you can start promoting immediately. Since you use certain products already, why not share what you know and make some good money while doing so? After all, thatâ€™s the core of affiliate marketing! Before I even get started with promoting a product, I see to it that thereâ€™s some great offers attached for my efforts. I screen products that I want to promote in the early stages of developing a niche site. And trust me, new opportunities are always presenting themselves as my sites grow in popularity. 1.   Iâ€™ll only promote products that my readers find relevant. Some affiliates jump from product to product because they can. This didnâ€™t work for me at all. Instead, I focused on promoting high quality products that I knew were useful to my readers and that I use extensively. 2.   If not, then huge opportunities can come from these products as well. If you find a product that doesnâ€™t publicize a great affiliate program, and you have an audience, you can always approach the merchant and ask about setting up a referral program. Iâ€™ve done this a few times with success. This way I promote a great product with no affiliate competition. Just be sure you have relevant traffic/audience. 3.   I purposely promote both low commission products and high commission, because my readers like these price points. My point is I donâ€™t reject a product because it pays smaller commissions â€œÂ_ often this is made up for with volume. While a $50 commissions are great, I make $1k a month from products that pay $20 commissions each. One product in particular is a strong converter. While it doesnâ€™t pay a huge commission per unit, my sales volume compensates for the low commission. Iâ€™d have to say then, donâ€™t simply focus on the commission payout price point. **Note: for my local affiliate projects, I DO require higher payouts. I discuss the local affiliate marketing concept There are some merchants who reward high sales volumes with higher commissions. This motivates affiliate marketers to sell more product, of course. While this feature isnâ€™t a requirement for me when Iâ€™m selecting a product to promote, itâ€™s a nice feature to have going for me! 4.   I adore merchants who offer lifetime tracking cookies, so that I can get paid as far into the future as possible. This is a treat, and most merchants donâ€™t offer this. While I wonâ€™t turn away from a merchant who doesnâ€™t offer lifetime cookies, a merchant will certainly get my attention if they do offer them. Of course, I also have to like the product being offered. 5.   If I find that if Iâ€™m not being credited past the opt-in page, Iâ€™m not interested in marketing the product. I also need to read the sales copy and check out the design of the site. In short, I need to see if I would purchase the product, based upon the sales page. That said, if a product is a perfect fit for my audience, Iâ€™ll give it a try to see if it converts. I canâ€™t always tell if a sales page works. Investing a few hours in a test-promotion never hurts â€œÂ_ Iâ€™ve found some gems that I initially didnâ€™t believe would convert well. 6.   If referrals arenâ€™t tracked via telephone, then Iâ€™ll ask the merchant how many order they get via telephone. If itâ€™s 50% or less, Iâ€™ll consider promoting the product. Itâ€™s not fun losing credit for commissions when my referrals call in orders. Some very smart merchants ensure they use mechanisms such as coupon codes to track telephone orders as well (this is much appreciated and results in me really putting forth a big effort in promoting them). 7.   If not, then I purchase it in order to try the product first hand. If I like the product after using it, then Iâ€™ll promote it. I use the above as a guideline. If a product meets many or most of my criteria, Iâ€™ll promote the product. As your blog starts to gain traction online, merchants will come to you, in order to promote their products. Keep in mind that just because they approach you doesnâ€™t mean that you have to say yes. I always approach every opportunity with scrutiny. Having said this, when your site gets to this stage, youâ€™ll enjoy having offers come to you. This is the stage when you can enter into private referral deals with your prospective merchant partner. These deals arenâ€™t made known to the general public. As I grow my affiliate business, Iâ€™m definitely interested in developing more private merchant deals, over promoting public affiliate programs. Every business needs to attract more business. If you own any web property that attracts online traffic, you can create lots of financially profitable deals for yourself. Mind you, youâ€™ll need to build a successful site first. If you only attract 10 visitors a day, you can forget it! But once you really start attracting traffic, there are other opportunities for you, such as CPA, ad space and again, negotiating higher commissions. Just a brief note about higher commissions, Iâ€™ve had three of my merchant partners grant me higher commissions based upon the traffic that my site receives and sales I generate. Affiliate marketing is not about promoting hundreds of offers. Instead, itâ€™s about promoting a few of the right offers. Once you embrace this and work hard promoting those few right offers, as long as you have a responsive audience or targeted traffic, you can start earning consistent commissions and build a viable business.",Jon Dykstra
25/03/2013,http://comluv.com/catering-tips-common-food-allergies-symptoms/,Tips for Caterers: The Most Common Food Allergies,"Catering companies provide their services to many millions of customers every year. A proportion of these will have a food allergy. Fortunately, most of them will be aware of this and will avoid eating anything that is likely to cause an allergic reaction. However, it is not always clear that some foods contain allergens and it is the responsibility of the caterers to make it clear to the customer if this is the case.  There are many foods that bring about an allergic reaction â€“ which is, in fact, a reaction to the protein in the particular food. In this article we list the most common of these and describe some of the potential consequences of inadvertently ingesting a food to which you are allergic. One of the most common of allergies is to the peanut, which is, incidentally, a member of the bean family. Peanuts and peanut traces are contained in many foods and it is important for caterers to flag this up for their customers. Although many children suffer from a peanut allergy, some of them may grow out of it when they get older. Other types of nut and some types of seed also produce an allergic reaction in certain individuals. It is very common for eggs to cause an allergic reaction. It is thought that the allergy is to the protein in the white of the egg rather than the yolk. Once again, many children who have this type of allergy find that they outgrow it as they mature. Milk, cream and cheese figure highly on the list of products that can cause an allergic reaction. Any foodstuffs that are diary based, including milk powder can promote unpleasant side-effects in a person who is sensitive to dairy protein. Another of the more common products to cause an allergic reaction is seafood, including crab, prawn, lobster, cockles and mussels. An allergic reaction to seafood can be rapid and severe. Many people who have an allergy to seafood find that it remains with them for their entire lifetime. A range of other foods, including soy, wheat, maize and certain vegetables can also cause allergic reactions. If a person is diagnosed, which is normally by either skin prick testing, a blood test or a food challenges test, they must do everything possible to avoid the food to which they are allergic. In the event that an allergen is inadvertently ingested, the symptoms that follow can include skin rash, such as hives, itching, swelling, which often affects the throat, limiting the ability to swallow and breathe, sickness, sneezing, runny nose and fainting. One type of reaction, anaphylaxis, is a systemic reaction that can result be fatal. If a person suffers from an anaphylactic reaction the common treatment is to rapidly administer adrenaline. Because of the possibility of accidental ingestion of an allergen, many people carry a dose of adrenaline with them in an epi-pen, which allows them to self-administer the medication quickly. Because there are so many foods that can cause an allergic reaction and because the consequences of an allergic reaction can be so severe, it is vital that caterers clearly point out the ingredients of their foods where this is not immediately apparent. It is equally important that catering companies avoid the risk of cross-contamination of foodstuffs in the preparation and service of their food, as this can cause an unintended exposure to an allergic foodstuff. Finally, caterers should be aware of the nature of an allergic reaction and should train their staff to recognise the symptoms when they arise and to take the appropriate steps to obtain the necessary medical intervention, if necessary.",Billy P
23/03/2013,http://comluv.com/brand-personality-key-success/,How Brand Personality Is Key To Your Success,"Decisions are based on the relationships we create, youâ€™ll never build a relationship by hoping someone will react to a message you send out. A couple of good examples from the past fortnight, included a LinkedIn message where I was â€œËœpitch slappedâ€™ from one side of the room to the other with what was being sold to me and the second was after a networking event and someone who I didnâ€™t speak to, but obviously had the sheet of contacts/email addresses, sent me the email (which we probably have all seen before) with the â€œËœgood to see you at the event yesterdayâ€ùÂ_now hereâ€™s eight paragraphs about us.â€™ These are examples where it is blatantly clear that the whole focus was to make the sale and nothing to do with sowing the seeds of a relationship. Never become â€œËœthat personâ€™ because when you do, your personality goes completely out the window. Always remember that the brands we create, arenâ€™t the logos we sit behind, but the successful ones are those that act human and evoke an emotion. The biggest fear for us all is that no one cares and what we produce is irrelevant. Itâ€™s time to let the human side come to the surface. What changed for my business was When we meet someone new in our personal lives, we donâ€™t go guns blazing saying how fantastic we are, we see how they fit into our way of behaviour through listening, conversing and ultimately, we like who they are and what they represent. This is exactly the same for building business relationships and creating a brand personality. Our intentions should never be to please everyone, if you do this you merely sit on the fence and become unimportant. To be seen as having a personality, you need to stand for something that you believe in and be worthy of your audienceâ€™s attention. When you do this, you are considered as the expert because you have an opinion. Your brandâ€™s personality is one that should be continually evolving through the different prospects/customers you meet. By having a brand personality that has a human side, also means that none of us are perfect, we all make mistakes and if we can be strong enough to say â€œËœwhoops my faultâ€™ sometimes, then at least shows our businesses represent being honest, transparent and authentic. The relationships we create are firmly built on the brandÂ  Â we represent. By having a clear personality helps build bonds and alliances and send those that donâ€™t fit in the other direction.",Mark Masters

20/03/2013,http://comluv.com/ra-usga-ban-anchoring-club/,The R&A and the U.S.G.A. to Ban Anchoring the Club,"In a few short weeks The R&A and the USGA will bring down their decision on the anchoring of a golf club to the body. The exact wording of the proposed rule change is: In making a stroke, the player  , either â€œdirectlyâ€ùÂù or by use of an â€œanchor pointâ€ùÂù. Note 1:Â  The club is anchored â€œdirectlyâ€ùÂù when the player intentionally holds the club or a gripping hand in contact with any part of his body, except that the player may hold the club or a gripping hand against a hand or forearm. Note 2:Â  An â€œanchor pointâ€ùÂù exists when the player intentionally holds a forearm in contact with any part of his body to establish a gripping hand as a stable point around which the other hand may swing the club. Who are these esteemed groups that can make such a drastic change to the current game of golf? The USGA (the United States Golf Association) is the United States national association of golf courses, clubs, and facilities and the governing body of golf for the U.S. and Mexico. It traces its history back to 1894 when it was formed between two clubs trying to settle a dispute as to who was the national amateur champion. Today the membership exceeds 9,700. Mike Davis is Executive Director. The R&A as such was just formed in 2004 and is based but now separate from The Royal and Ancient St. Andrews Golf Club. Like the USGA it runs many tournaments, tries to safeguard the financial operations of golf facilities, and helps to grow the game of golf. Chief Executive of The R&A. is Peter Dawson. Both these organizations are the gatekeepers of the rules of golf. They produce and regularly revise these rules. Since 1952 the rules have been issued jointly. As of January 2012 there are now a common set of the rules of golf worldwide. Over the years there have been a number of controversial decisions made by these two organizations, notably the decision to ban box-grooved wedges. This new rule that is meant to clarify what is a swing, is directly aimed at all golfers who use  and anchor these putters to either their belly or their chest or their chin. The change appears to be prompted by the use of this type of putter being used to win three of the last five major golf tournaments. Adam Scott, who in February 2011 switched to a long putter that he anchors to his chest, won the World Golf Championship at Firestone. A week later at the PGA Championship, Keegan Bradley (belly) became the first player to win a major using a longer putter. Webb Simpson (belly) won the following week (August 21, 2011) in Greensboro, N.C., and then won again at the TPC Boston. On June 17, 2012 Simpson won the U.S. Open at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. Veteran The putters involved in this debate are the belly putter and the long putter. Richard T. Parmley patented the belly putter that a player anchors in his belly in 1965. It usually measures about 41 to 44 inches. It came into popular attention after Paul Azinger used it in 2000 to improve his putting stats to fourth on the PGA Tour from a dismal 111th the previous year. In 1980 Charlie Owens designed the long putter measuring about 50 to 52 inches. Johnny Miller was the first professional to use the long putter and this spurred both governing bodies to declare it legal. Rocco Mediate was the first to win a tournament with the long putter in 1991. Jim Ferree who started using it in 1986 is quote as saying â€ù it saved my golf lifeâ€ùÂù. Tim Clark feels if this new rule comes into effect his career will be over. Since the announcement that the anchoring of these longer type putters might be banned there has been a torrent of comments for and against this. Some of the saddest comments are that the use of them is cheating. In December players reported fans jeering and accusing those players who were doing this as cheaters. This is ridiculous as up until now this method of putting has been completely legal. Many players and fans feel that the new rule will preserve the tradition of golf. One might think after all these years of golfers anchoring their putters to stabilize the stroke it might be considered a tradition. Some very powerful organizations have come out against the implementing of rule 14-1b. The PGA Tour and the PGA of American have both publically declared their opposition to it. After a passionate meeting with members of the PGA tour Tim Finchem said that it was â€œnot in the best interestsâ€ù of golf for the proposed change to be implemented. The National Golf Course Owners Association believes that a ban of anchoring a golf club could have a negative impact on participation in the game of golf now and in the future. All these organizations feel that there is a lack of data to support that there is a competitive advantage in anchoring the putter. In fact in the last 30 years there has been less than Â_ of 1 percent of tournaments won by players employing this method. It stands to reason that if there were a significant advantage then everyone would use this method. One of the missions of both The R&A and the USGA is to grow the game. On The R&A web site they state, â€œThe R&A is working to protect the enjoyment of the game and to safeguard the financial operations of golf facilities, in a manner which preserves natural environments and enhances community engagement.â€ùÂù The USGA promise is â€œbased on a shared love and respect for golf, we preserve its past, foster its future, and champion its best interests for everyone who enjoys the game.â€ùÂù When we talk about everyone, the majority of golfers are the recreational golfer and many of these players will leave the game or will ignore it if rule 14-1b comes to be. This is not in the best interest of either the game or the governing bodies. The questions that must be addressed are: Let us hope that The R&A and the USGA make a decision that is to the benefit of all golfers.",Pat

20/03/2013,http://comluv.com/when-your-timeline-becomes-an-embarrassment/,When Your Timeline Becomes An Embarrassment - The ComLuv Network,"Have you ever had one of those moments of embarrassment when viewing Â your social media timeline, there it is. A post that you wish was not there. While taking care of some business tasks one morning, I also had my Twitter account open. Finishing up my tasks, but before moving on to other priorities for the day, I performed a brief scan of recent postsÂ on the timeline. Scrolling through the timeline, I was making a mental note to come back to certain posts that were of interest to me. Continuing to scroll on down, there it was; The re-tweet had nothing to do with me; it was just a bit, (that is putting it lightly), vulgar. It was a moment that anyone would wish to go away. The embarrassment sets in even though no one can see you. You just wantÂ to erase the post, but canâ€™t. All the while, your other followers possibly saw it too. Continuing to scroll through the timeline, I noticed that the company I recently followed back had manyÂ re-tweets, one right after another, posted from various people. Some were saying the same thing, others something different, but most promoting some product. The vulgar re-tweet wasÂ right in the middle of the other tweets. I had no way to erase the Â re-tweet causing the embarrassment, and found the other re-tweets of no use, along with clogging up my timeline. It was time to take action. Find the company that I followed back and hit the unfollow button. Many people and businesses are using automated services for their tweets. I find most of these services as a way to end up getting connected with, shall we say, bad neighborhoods. Most of the services are gamified with loyalty/rewards/credits programs to get a person to re-tweet anyone, then in turn you will receive credits towards some sort of reward, This was not necessarily the case concerning the company that re-tweeted the unsavory tweet. I do not partake in any automated tweet networks. It seemed to me that possibly the company in question had their own network of followers and they re-tweet whatever their network followers post. It also appeared to be on autopilot. Even though the vulgar re-tweet found its way into my timeline, I realize that it was not my fault. I hope anyone else that saw it noticed that it was a re-tweet from another company. Do you think the company that re-tweeted ever saw the vulgar post? I think not. There were too many re-tweets from the same company in too short of a time-span. Any legitimate business should really think twice before signing up for one of these automated re-tweet networks. It puts your business in the position of having unwanted tweets in your timeline, which could be harmful to your business. Make it a practice of viewing someoneâ€™s previous tweets before deciding to follow him or her back. However, seeing anything they have re-tweeted might not show up. This is when being proactiveÂ comes in to play. Every so often take time to scan through the recent posts on your timeline, especially when you have recently followed new people or businesses. Anything that you might find offensive to others, not to your liking, or complete gibberish, make note of how it made its way into your timeline. Go to the followerâ€™s profile that created the post and hit the unfollow button. You can only be proactive. There is no way to control what othersâ€™ post, along with who might re-tweet it. The bad neighbors just have a way of showing up from time to time. Be considerate of the legitimate followers you have by being proactive and cleaning out the un-wanted neighbors. Your professional followers will thank you for it. Posting your own tweets, even though it takes time, is the best way to go.

No matter what I did, how much I worked out or ate healthfully, I couldnâ€™t lose those few pounds. So during my annual checkup, my doctor told me that my vitamin D levels were too low and I needed to get it back up. Now, I am not a   primarily because I donâ€™t need to be so I wasnâ€™t surprised by that news, just by her insistence that I get start taking vitamin D3 supplements immediately. Vitamin D is one of those vitamins that many of us take for granted because we associate it with sun exposure. We all know that too much sun can lead to skin damage and possibly cancer so we think weâ€™re OK without it. The truth is, we are very wrong. Hereâ€™s what Vitamin D does: And the list goes onâ€_ as I realized just how it impacts   functions of the body. As I mentioned, people of color have a tough time getting enough vitamin D through sunlight. Not only because melanin (skin pigment) blocks the rays but because we too put on the sunscreen so that we donâ€™t run the risks of premature aging or skin cancer. The truth is, sunscreen reduces vitamin D absorption by over 90%; so you could say itâ€™s doing what itâ€™s supposed to do but at a big price. The form of vitamin D that is manufactured by our bodies is known as Cholecalciferol a.k.a Vitamin D3, which is the type of supplement my doctor recommended. As it turned out my low levels of vitamin D prevented my body from losing weight. Hereâ€™s how that can happen. The brain uses the vitamin to keep hunger and cravings at bay while increasing levels of serotonin, the â€œfeel goodâ€ù chemical. If your D levels are low, that  , which affects weight loss. Another way Vitamin D impacts weight loss is regarding your fat cells. All cells need vitamin D, including fat cells.Â It helps cells figure out whether to store fat or burn it. The lower your levels, the more likely your body will store fat. In my case, my body was holding on to those pounds because it didnâ€™t realize that it needed to be burned not stored. Once I started the recommended D3 regimen, I did see some results including weight loss. Â One thing I want to make clear is that there is such a thing as too much vitamin D. It can lead to excess bone loss and calcium deposits on the organs due to kidney malfunction along with a whole host of other problems so itâ€™s best to check with the doc before supplementing. When it comes to natural weight loss, itâ€™s always a good idea to have your numbers checked to make sure you understand why something isnâ€™t working.",Dianne
18/03/2013,http://comluv.com/hidden-cost-paid-blogging/,The Hidden Cost Of Paid Blogging,"Paid blogging is a great way to earn some extra cash, but it can also delay your own   as you spend all of your time building someone elseâ€™s audience. There are thousands, if not millions of blogs that pay per post, as content is a valuable comodity on the internet. If you fail to diversify, your paid blogging career will leave you with just a few large clients who provide you most of your work. If one person is responsible for 25% or more of your income, youâ€™ll probably bend over backwards to make them happy. But, chances are, you left your full-time salaried job just to avoid this sort of dependency. When you start paid blogging, make sure itâ€™s something youâ€™re prepared to do indefinitely or that you have an escape plan. You can offer paid blogging services for years and become an expert blogger, but when you strike out on your own, youâ€™re going to need to start from scratch. No longer will you be working for an established blog with an established revenue model. Youâ€™ll have to build not just your blog but also your means of  . That means, in many cases, writing your initial blog posts, writing your free give away reports, and setting up a mailing list. If you havenâ€™t worked on these things before, youâ€™ll need to invest dozens or hundreds of hours into them before you can reasonably expect to begin making money from your blog. Even people who own their blog rarely get to write exactly what they want to write about, but as a paid blogger youâ€™re likely to get the assignments the blog owner doesnâ€™t want to write. That means youâ€™ll get to write articles which are: â€¢Â Â Â Â  â€¢Â Â Â Â  Research intensive â€¢Â Â Â Â  Vague â€¢Â Â Â Â  Disgusting and offensive Youâ€™ll also probably receive assignments the blog owner thinks would require too much of his or her time. If youâ€™re lucky, youâ€™re familiar with those topics so you can write them quickly. If youâ€™re unlucky, those assignments will take considerable time but youâ€™ll accept them anyway because youâ€™re dependent on the blog owner for a large part of your income. You work for a day and you get paid for that and nothing more! The content you produce is far moreÂ valuableÂ than the dollar you earn today. Here is an example of what one article can earn on a blog without even trying, and within one week. I wrote this article about howÂ  was giving away $5000 worth of products for free. I also linked to a previous review that I wrote about thisÂ Google sniperÂ product. I am almostÂ embarrassedÂ to publish this article as it is extremely short and not up to myÂ usualÂ publishing standards. Here are the results below. I made $177.00 from that article but two of the commissions are recurring. Not a bad start for an article that will stay on my blog for years. The sad thing is that a paid blogger would only have earned about $10-$20 for this articleÂ (as it is really short), whereas I have made $177 plus more! This is a tiny example for me. I have articles on some blogs where I make $30 a day and others can make $100 a day. That is NOT a whole website, that is one piece of content that generates its own income. Getting out of paid blogging is easy-or at least itâ€™s easy to say. Develop a business plan and start your own blog. Youâ€™ve had a great opportunity to work with successful blog owners, so learn from their examples and use your honed blogging skills. But, most importantly, start with something simple which doesnâ€™t require much of your time so, until your blog takes off, you can continue to offer paid blogging.",Mitz Pantic

However, when the playful nipping turns into a destructive one as your pet continues to exhibit the same behavior to house guests, children and other animals, your once affectionate approach becomes a concerned one. When he starts nipping on you hardly that he successfully draws blood and when he starts nipping on random strangers so much that these strangers actually get hurt in the nipping process, itâ€™s time for you to go ahead and figure out what to do with your pet dog in order to stop this nipping behavioral problem for good. Of course, for us to successfully solve the problem, we should first be aware of the reason as to why dogs nip. Why do dogs nip so much? The answer to this agonizing question is this:  Simply speaking, your pet dog uses his mouth in order to explore his surroundings and get a sense of how they feel like. Nipping, as perceived by your dogs, is a form of communication and exploration. Nipping is only but natural to them! If it is natural, then, why does my dog start to hurt me while he nips, you ask? My friend, your pet doesnâ€™t really want to hurt you on purpose. The real truth here is that he doesnâ€™t really know that heâ€™s already hurting you. He thinks heâ€™s still playing with you so he continues to nip you even though you donâ€™t want him to. How do you easily stop destructive nipping for good, then? Here are five ways to help you: Usually, bite inhibition is learned by your puppy when he plays with other puppies. Both puppies playfully bite each other and if one puppy bites too hard, the other puppy expresses hurt by yelping and letting out a high-pitched scream. The offending puppy will then realize that heâ€™s bitten too hard so to prevent his playmate from being hurt again, he starts controlling the force of his bites. You can also apply this in your owner-dog relationship by: Sometimes, older dogs wonâ€™t really care for high-pitched whining. More often than not, pet owners engage in interactive play with their pet dogs. Usually, these games are tug-of-war and wrestling. Most pet owners are under the impression that participating in these contact games promotes bonding. However, what really happens is that these games give the impression that your pet is supposed to fight for you for dominance. Instead of these games, try games that implement obedience instead, such as fetch, training sessions and jogging around your neighborhoodâ€™s park. This tip is suggested to moderate to severe cases of dog nipping. Sometimes, when your pet dog has a difficulty understanding your instructions, he will still continue doing his behavior until he encounters an unpleasant experience. You can do this method by: As we have mentioned earlier in this guide, nipping is also a form of communication for your dog. If you have already done these tips to no avail, maybe itâ€™s time for your dog to visit his vet now. He might be experiencing a medical problem so he bites you in order to get your attention. Also, he might be having a medical condition that causes him to act restless â€“ you can only find out the real deal behind your dogâ€™s behavior if you let an expert assess his status appropriately.",Kriss Schaefer

Guess what? If you use social media as part of your Internet marketing strategy, believe or not, the same rule applies. In any typical organization, especially the big names, the social media team takes care of tweeting while the content writers broil in another department, constantly pressurized to come up with fresh and useful content. What many business owners fail to understand is this: the thing is, social posts and shares are actually content, too! As a business, if you are not getting the results you expected from marketing on the social media networks, itâ€™s time for you to start treating your social postings as seriously as you do your content. Here is how to do this quickly and effectively: According to bitly.com, it matters when you choose to post updates on Facebook and Twitter. This is one very compelling reason for you to plan and schedule your shares and posts in advance. The task doesnâ€™t have to be daunting. ONE quality social post a day in more than enough. When it comes to Twitter for example, do not hesitate to talk about the previous dayâ€™s tweet: â€œHere is ______ for those of you who didnâ€™t see it yesterdayâ€ùÂù. This will â€œËœcatchâ€™ those who have really missed your tweet, as well as some of those who ignored it. Similarly, consider posting â€œËœteasersâ€™. Thatâ€™s something not many people do. Letâ€™s say you are about to make a post about weight loss for women tomorrow. Today, you can post a picture of a hot and slim girl and tweet, â€œLadies, stay tuned and Iâ€™ll show you her secrets! No guys allowed!â€ùÂù One of the most important things about marketing on the social media networks is knowing your audience and subsequently tailoring your posts just like you would with your content. Whatever you post, do it for This is indeed very important. Just like you would never in your right mind not respond to the people who comment on your blog, you should never neglect answering a follower, irrespective of the social platform you are on. In fact, since we are talking about social media, you should respond within 24 hours, and even faster on Twitter! Do not forget that posts on social media are (at least should be!)â€ùÂ_social. This basically means that when you post on Facebook or Google+, include an element of interaction. For example, for your list posts, it would be so good to include something like â€œIs there anything we missed?â€ùÂù or â€œDo you have any more suggestions?â€ùÂù at the end of the post, Similarly, â€œDo you agree with us?â€ùÂù type of questions for controversial posts can make you a very popular figure on the social media platforms. When you do not have anything original to share (it happens to everyone), it doesnâ€™t mean that you â€œshould not post todayâ€ùÂù. Instead, curate! This means that you can share something someone else created (something relevant, something that your audience will like). Just donâ€™t claim to be the original creator, and give the credit where it is due. Also, while itâ€™s okay to just publish â€œas isâ€ùÂù once in a while, your audience will appreciate it if you give your take on what you are sharing â€“ a comment, a suggestion for improvement, etc. In most cases, social posts and shares do show up in the search engines results pages. So whenever itâ€™s possible, try to potimize your post. How? By simply introducing the target keyword in the post, and in the comments. HOWEVER! Do it only if it fits. If it doesnâ€™t, donâ€™t even think about it. Remember, you are writing for the audience, not for the search engines. The optimization is just a plus, for when it can be done.    form of marketing.

And do you know what else? Those giveaways can make a drastic difference when it comes to brand recognition. Donâ€™t listen to people who tell you otherwise. Here are a few retorts you can use the next time one of those haters gets on your case! Iâ€™ve spent the past few years in the industry, so Iâ€™ve encountered â€œËœem all.  I beg to differ. Junk is in the eye of the beholder, and people hold onto items they find valuable.

Well, weâ€™re also never far from a promo item of some kind.

I firmly believe youâ€™d be satisfied with the results if you gave branded merchandise a chance. Now, with all of that said, please use common sense when choosing giveaways for your brand. You wonâ€™t see many new customers if you blow your entire advertising budget on a handful of expensive items or hand out things that have little to do with your audienceâ€™s interests.

Two reasons: Whatâ€™s being served with it and how itâ€™s processed. Polished white rice is stripped of all the nutrients that make it a worthy and viable source of nutrition. Thatâ€™s why a lot of the white rice in the stores are vitamin fortified because the polished rice is nothing more than refined starch.

Brown rice has: Brown rice is more nutritionally dense and has a flavor that some people donâ€™t like; instead of boiling in water, some choose broth or even coconut milk. Black rice is an heirloom rice that is black when raw but purple when cooked.

This service makes you free from managing hardware and software of an organization. With a cloud app, you have to run a browser, log in, customize the app, and start using it. Cloud Computing runs on different methods, which are discussed as under.  serviced are divided into three categories: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS), Platform-as-a-Service (PAAS), and Software-as-a-Service (SAAS).  Cloud service provider performs the operation and maintenance of IAAS. It offers storage, hardware, servers, and networking function.  Developer creates a set of software with tools provided from provider. The total control of software deployment and configuration is in hand of developer. The provider offers only server and storage.  It is available via the internet. Many organizations use this type of model. It provides a remote access of software and its tasks. There are different types of cloud computing models like private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, community cloud.  Private cloud is carried only in organization. Employees of organization can access data, application, and other service. Unknown person cannot access private cloud service. The operation and maintenance of a private cloud is in the hands of an organization.  Any person can access a web application and service through the internet. Organizations do not have to purchase personal cloud storage; they can store their data and backup on the third party cloud storage.  It is a combination of a private and public cloud. Organizations keep their essential data in enterpriseâ€™s private cloud storage. The rest data rests on public cloud storage. It saves cost of public cloud storage due to the usage of private cloud storage. Security is necessary for a cloud computing service due to storage of high volume of data and backup. There are some security issues, which we cannot ignore while considering cloud computing.  Data transfer is a critical issue for cloud computing. For a cloud customer, it is very hard to judge the behavior of an attacker. It is essential to check that the data travels on a secure connection. Therefore, your data should be encrypted using industry standard protocol like IPSec (internet protocol security). Your URL should begin with HTTPS instead of HTTP.  While accessing API or software interface, you should be careful about its dependability, liability, and privacy. A weak interface can cause security issues. Organization should go through the policies of cloud service provider. There are many policies regarding cloud authentication that must be matched with companyâ€™s strategy. The security administration policy should be flexible that should support for new services that have different background of authentication.  Attacker can inject virus in cloud service that can damage cloud system. Attacker makes a malicious application or service and places it in the cloud. When a user chooses a malicious program request, the virus will enter in the userâ€™s system and can damage the userâ€™s system hardware.  The main object of cloud computing is to provide available resources to users. Cloud computing frequently increase its size as per request received from a user. Here, attacker can place false requests to cloud service. Now, cloud service accepts such request, then, there will be no space for the legitimate request. Client has to pay additional money for the used space generated through false links.  Client should ask to cloud service provider about the security for data storage. How they maintain the clientâ€™s data on storage is very important aspect for service provider. Strong security must be there at the time of data transfer and data storage. Even access level of data and the details of people who manage your confidential data should be obtained.  When your data is not encrypted then, attacker can hack a password during the transfer of data.  . The third party cannot read your password or login details, when you have SSL security for your cloud service. In this article, we have discussed the types, security issues, and methods of Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing is a service that provides access to virtualized resources and saves the cost of clients. Cloud Computing is really a helpful technology that needs security at the time of implementation. Encryption of data is necessary when you use Cloud Computing service.",Abel Wike

This is basically keyword research and content creation done with 2 goals prioritized: your customers and the conversion rate of your website. If your SEO strategy has not been working that well for you lately, clearly you are doing something wrong. This post can help you figure out exactly what that something is. For search engine optimization, while you want to invest in improving your websiteâ€™s ranking in the search results for the broad keywords, often almost all your competitors use these same keywords. The competition can get fierce and unproductive. In addition to that, broad keywords only contribute so much to your business profitability since very few people directed to your website through these keywords actually convert into buying customers. All in all, what should be your take-away from the above is this: in addition to broad keywords, it is important for online businesses to focus on optimization for more specific keywords too. It is mostly traffic generated by optimization for the specific keywords that bring in the majority of buying customers. Ideally, if you offer different categories of products and services, you should conduct a keyword research to generate specific keywords for each of the product categories.Â  Track your conversion by testing out the different keywords in turn to determine which specific keywords work best for you. We already covered the importance of focusing on keyword research for the different categories of products you offer. This is a lot easier said than done. Most businesses use Google AdWords for this purpose. Google AdWords is in fact a good tool to evaluate the weightage of different keywords, whether broad or specific. It gives website owners a pretty good idea of what people type in the search bar to look for things online. Note that since keyword research is a lengthy process, Once youâ€™ve done your keyword research and you have your keywords home and right, using this knowledge, you can create a piece of content or an overview for the different categories of products you offer. This should be done tactfully because while content on your category pages can help boost the ranking of your website in the search results, at the same time, you donâ€™t want push the products you are actually selling too far out of sight. Â Getting the amount of content right is important. Note that in addition to helping your websites rank better, content on your product category pages also gives you an opportunity to connect with your customers. Sometimes, people donâ€™t land on your homepage first and then they navigate to the products you offer. They can land on the other web pages too. This makes it important for you to have some kind of sales message on each of your web pages. So in summary, some content on your category pages that includes one or two relevant keyword phrases can go a long way in improving your ranking in the search results and improving your conversion rate. Equally important for the purpose of improving your ranking in the Google search results is to add content to your product pages. This may be a simple product description, a few product reviews put together in one place or if you want to go the extra mile, a video message. Also note at this point that even if you forget about ranking well in the search results for a while, any content you create pertaining to a particular product will serve to help you establish a connection with your potential customers. It is a means for you to get to your readers and sell your products. To increase your chances of getting found online, throw in some specific keywords pertaining to the product in the content you create but always make sure that the keywords donâ€™t appear too cumbersome or conspicuous.",Winson Yeung
09/03/2013,http://comluv.com/5-crucial-tips-for-buying-a-new-smartphone/,5 Crucial Tips for Buying a New Smartphone - ComLuv,"Smartphone growth might eventually level off, but 2013 wonâ€™t be the year it happens. At least one report   in 2013, after over 600 million shipments in 2012. Manufacturers will realize this growth from two places: new consumers upgrading for the first time, and existing users looking for the newest and greatest devices. Given the typical lifespan of a smartphone, less than two years, the latter could drive industry growth for years to come. There is a good chance that you will purchase a new smartphone at some point this year, wether itâ€™s your first or your fifth. Given the plethora of choices currently on the market, combined with the shiny new devices weâ€™ll get from Apple and Samsung, among others, later this year, the choice might seem daunting. Like any decision, the key to picking a smartphone is to break it down into manageable parts. If youâ€™re shopping around for a smartphone, consider these five factors before making any decision. Accounting for them will make your choice significantly easier. In the U.S., you typically purchase a smartphone through a carrier. That carrier offers a steep discount for the phone, in exchange for you sining a two-year agreement. The penalties are pretty steep for canceling your contract, and even if you do you canâ€™t unlock your phone and take it to a different carrier, without the original carrierâ€™s permission. Since carriers control the process, consumers have to pick a carrier before picking a phone. Each carrier will offer different phones, and even different prices on the same phone. For instance the   costs $370, whereas it costs $400 at other carriers. Some carriers might run a promotion and offer it for $300 or less. But that wonâ€™t matter if you chose a different carrier. The overall point: choose the carrier that best fits your needs, and then choose from their smartphone selection. The last thing you want is a high-end phone on a sub-par network. It seems every few months we get a new, top of the line phone. It wonâ€™t be long before Samsung releases the Galaxy S IV. HTC has a new high-end phone in the pipeline. It appears that Motorola is going for a state of the art Android handset, and with Googleâ€™s backing it could When choosing a new phone, set a deadline and make a decision then, based on what you know. If you keep waiting for the next big thing, youâ€™ll end up waiting forever. Once you hit your deadline check the tech blogs and see prevailing rumors. If thereâ€™s something set for release in the near future, waiting is fine. But if thereâ€™s nothing rumored, pick the best of whatâ€™s available. It will likely last you until your next upgrade. One reason iPhone models last a long time: Apple always provides software updates. You can buy an iPhone 4 and still get it with iOS 6, the latest version of the software. That makes a bigger difference than the processor speed or screen resolution. Similarly, the latest version of Android will provide you with more usable features, while greater specs will just makes those features run a bit more efficiently. Many popular Android models have become obsolete in the recent past, because they havenâ€™t received the latest software upgrades. There are year-old handsets that are still stuck on 2.3 Gingerbread, which looks ancient compared to 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and 4.1 Jellybean. The flagship models are the ones that will get assured upgrades. Going with them, despite potentially higher spec models on the market, is a better long-term strategy. When you were younger your mom might have said, â€œIf your friends all jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge, would you do it too?â€ù Copying you friends just to fit in is a bad idea. But picking a smartphone because your friends have the same one is actually a quality strategy. Smartphones are, in large part, about sharing. The more friends you have on the same platform, the more you can share. Yes, there are many apps that work cross-platform. But if you have a dozen friends with an iPhone and you go with Android, you wonâ€™t be able to share apps, recommendations, and other networked items. So while you might not follow your friends into the East River, you might want to follow their smartphone choices. It will make the experience better for everyone. Buying a smartphone is not like buying a computer. When you buy a computer you are in it for the long haul. Chances are you will not buy another one for a number of years. But when youâ€™re buying a smartphone, essentially a mini computer, youâ€™re looking at a much shorter timespan. It could be as short as 18 months. When youâ€™re looking for a new phone, plan on upgrading in that 18 to 20 month span. Thinking along these lines will make your decision much easier. Sure, you a great phone might come out a month or two after you buy yours. But at least you know youâ€™ll be eligible to upgrade again soon enough.",Joe Pawlikowski

(great title for a TV series right?) hereâ€™s a pretty picture that looks scary (to some) that shows what   does to your nerves Thatâ€™s basically saying my nerves are getting damaged which affects how I feel and function. if you can imagine losing some insulation on the wires behind your car dashboard so there are bare wires touching each otherâ€_ lights wouldnâ€™t work sometimes or switching the heating on also puts the screen wipers on or the windows are slow to go down.. sometimes itâ€™s ok, the wires donâ€™t touch each other or only a bit, when that happens, itâ€™s a good day. but, sometimes it seems like all the wires are touching, when that happens, itâ€™s not such a good day.. .. and it feels like youâ€™re going round a corner when in fact youâ€™re going straight. woo! keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times!â€_ _Ÿ™‚ change depending on the person, what time of day it is, how tired I am, how hot it is and more luckily, not all at the same time! oh how fun that would beâ€_ I am getting treatment.. it appears to help. even if it didnâ€™t, I think Iâ€™d be fine to type this. (Iâ€™d just see 2 of everything) apart from knowing it, it really shouldnâ€™t affect you. you might have to wait a little longer for support responses or email replies but, generally you wont notice. I hope so anyway. So far, so good. if you want to contact me then itâ€™s best to use the support ticket system rather than emailing direct so I can keep a track of the thread of conversation. you can get to it here >>  Iâ€™ve had to reduce the amount of geekery I do every day simply because my body and brain is not so good with too much intense work (haha, no change there then!) seriously though, Iâ€™ve had to drop all projects apart from CommentLuv which means, I will actually have more time for CommentLuv when I get in to my new office.. I was supposed to have the new payment system in place by nowâ€_ that wasnâ€™t possible. It will still happen but I have other things to do in the meantime..(and thereâ€™s a new system in town that might make this a much easier thing to do, with instant payments â€“ for affiliates, Iâ€™ll let you know about this nearer the time) like moving house.. oh deary, I was in the middle of this when I got diagnosed! bring on the stress related symptoms! .. so I went the route of paying for the work to be done rather than try to do it myself. when Iâ€™m all moved in to my shiny new office (cat5 points in every room!) I can move on with the new payment model and other site changes. like add a new place for members to get (free) goodies and the CommentLuv user directory (more on that below) and lots of other stuff which Iâ€™ll tell you about next time well, Iâ€™ve got a whole bunch of things to do for the plugin and site.. now that I can focus just on CommentLuv and not chase after shiny buttons to keep me amused like I used to, I think youâ€™ll be pleasantly surprised.. First thing I need to do is transfer my lists over to my new system.. thereâ€™s a lot of people on my lists! I will be dropping some lists completely and merging others together a fresh start, for spring, with a big old list a complete nightmare if I was planning to continue to do the promotions that I used to do but, I canâ€™t do that any moreâ€_so no point lamenting lost lists (ooh, that could be a book title) (some lists will stay with Aweber like the tasty Tuesday opt in and other automated funnel type lists that are compatible with your affiliate links) Iâ€™ll still be emailing, just not the same way as before.. youâ€™ll probably hear from me soon as I start to get lists combined and merged. if you have subscribed to more than one of my lists with more than one email address (probably you have) then you might get a few duplicate emails.. please do not hesitate to unsubscribe if you donâ€™t want to hear from me The subjects and content of the emails I will be sending in the future will partly be to do with  , itâ€™s progress and how I will be promoting it.. donâ€™t worry! they all wont be as long as this monster email.. it should be exclusive too. Iâ€™m not 100% certain Iâ€™ll keep all the info in the emails, maybe Iâ€™ll allude to it and write the whole thing on a blog post.. ..maybe Iâ€™ll keep the exclusive stuff on the emails.. I havenâ€™t really decided what format will work best yet, I do hope you can bear with me while I find out what worksâ€_ Iâ€™ve been studying hard this last year, big old courses on PPC, PPV, TLB and other three letter acronym type things _Ÿ™‚ and when I get funny days where I canâ€™t type properly because my hand is numb or I accidentally put on someone elses legs when I get up in the morning, Iâ€™ll study some more.. I am hoping that youâ€™ll find what I learn useful.. things like facebook advertising paid traffic (<â€“ this is actually fun to do if you get it right) funnels.. not just sales funnels, but opt-in funnels and others media buying solo lists (<- not learned about this yet) PPC (and how to use it to promote products) PPV (banner ads and how to use them) Iâ€™ll do the buying and spending and experimenting so you donâ€™t have to plus, because I wont be charging for this information and thereâ€™ll be full disclosure (even the failures) you could copy the successes and apply it to your own products, services or affiliate products. it wont be all promotional methods though, that would be way too boring Iâ€™ll also include some featured CommentLuv bloggers and what theyâ€™re doing right blogging tips that work ( maybe a guest email now and then from experts) and if it doesnâ€™t freak too many people out, the progress of my condition and what Iâ€™m doing to make it better and to overcome any difficulties it brings up are you ok to be part of this? donâ€™t worry, you can unsubscribe any time and if youâ€™ve got CommentLuv youâ€™ll still get notified of important plugin updates any thoughts on what youâ€™d like to see? just let me know (via the support ticket system if you can) I know that this is not for everyone and some people are a bit put off by pictures of medical thingsâ€_ like this, the human juice box. I was so freaked out that if I knocked the cap off, all my juice would spill out! Iâ€™ve been keeping a video diary and publishing it online. well, what else did you expect Andy Bailey to do? _Ÿ™‚ itâ€™s been super helpful in giving me something to rant to (the MS nurses are supposed to do this but theyâ€™re 20 miles away by car) apparently, theyâ€™re helpful to others too. I hope so. I started them just a few minutes after getting my diagnosis and Iâ€™ve been making them regularly.. you can see my facebook page here >>  the first video is here ->  feel free to come and watch a few. I try to keep them short so theyâ€™re not boring (I hope) these emails that Iâ€™ll be sending, they wont all be expert-tells-you-how type emails in some, Iâ€™ll ask YOU if you have a way of doing things in others, Iâ€™ll ask YOU what you think is best, and then Iâ€™ll try it â€_ and report the results and in others, Iâ€™ll ask you to visit a site or give a thumbs up to a worthy cause or blog I hope you can stay on my list, thereâ€™ll be lots of information to be learned and Iâ€™ll throw in a freebie now and again too. I really donâ€™t want to cram up your inbox with useless crap or insincere hype about plugins I donâ€™t use.. be sure to let me know if you see stuff like thatâ€_ have fun! and speak to you soonâ€_. your friend, Andy Bailey P..S..

Although it is very Tough to Hack into Facebook account but if proper security guidelines followed. Sometimes a few silly mistakes can lead to Your Facebook Account getting Hacked. It is quite Difficult to hack Facebook as Facebook have not used any Public platform for its development. So many attacks such as SQL injection and Cross scripting has become very difficult to implement. But no System is Perfect. So what can you do to protect Facebook Account? So here I am going to enlist and explain a few tips to Protect your FacebookÂ account. You should change default login from http to https.Â  Â means Secure Browsing which is an optional feature on Facebook. This makes all of your FacebookÂ activity encrypted which makes harder for anyone else to access your FacebookÂ information without your permission. Hence it Protect your FacebookÂ account. Set a Password which includes Upper Case lower case alphabets combinations and few digits along with one or two symbols. This makes harder for the people who hack your password by watching your keystrokes when they are nearby. Also donâ€™t forget to change your password regularly with no relevance to the previous Password. Add a mobile number which is very useful when you Forget your Password or to keep you updated with your notifications. Also it makes difficult to reset your password for other People which can be used to hack your FacebookÂ account. Hence to protect Facebook account, you must add your mobile number. When you enable login notifications, Facebook asks you the name of the machine from you are logging in to your FacebookÂ account and sends the details to your Facebook registered mobile and e-mail address. What if someone already knows your Mobile number? It makes them easier right? No because there is one more feature for advanced security to protect FacebookÂ account. With   approvals you will need to add a special login code each time you try to access your Facebook account from a new computer or mobile phone. You will not have to enter a code when you   from a recognized device. Add two or three extra e-mail idâ€™s to your Facebook account after your primary e-mail ID. This can be used to recover your FacebookÂ password when your primary e-mail ID is not accessible. Using Apps from an untrusted supplier can surely create a Big threat to your Facebook account. To protect Facebook account you must carefully use the apps and grant them Permission. Most of the Apps work as Loggers for your Facebook I have seen many   links on the Facebook which often claims to â€œChange the Skin of Facebook Profileâ€ù or to â€œView who visited Your Profileâ€ù etc. These links are completely fake. Donâ€™t click on such links when you are logged in to your Facebook account. Clicking such links will automatically send your password to the Hackers. I have seen another method which was very common earlier. Some articles used to claim that pasting particular script in the address bar when logged in to FacebookÂ can show you the recent visitors to your profile. Well this is another trap for the Facebook users. Pasting such scripts will not give you any advantage instead these scripts will send your password immediately to the hackers. So to protect Facebook account you must avoid Clicking on unknown links and Pasting scripts into the address bar.

Or, in other words, how do you get people to visit multiple pages on your site? Itâ€™s easy-get rid of the junk. That is a simple answer but of course people love to see the more detailed ways of reducing bounce rate. If you look at theÂ Website Bounce Rate for your site as a whole, youâ€™ll notice that some pages perform better than others. That means you can immediately reduce bounce rate problems by deleting unnecessary pages. But wait-do you really want to delete pages? Absolutely-if the pages donâ€™t perform well, and you canâ€™t quickly improve them, then your site is better off without them. Bad pages on your site likely draw people away from the good pages, so get rid of the bad pages to improve the overall performance of your site. All they are doing is distracting your visitors from your real goals. You probably read that long-form sales pages tend to perform better than shorter Unfortunately, that incredible labor is now wasted as 99% or more of the people who see your sales letter leave without buying your product. I have good news for you: you can reduce bounce rate problems on that page by going back and performing the step you skipped-intensive editing. I typically delete 50% or more of the material I write for sales pages because anything which doesnâ€™t move the customer closer to buying is irrelevant on a sales page. (To compensate for this reduction in sales page length, I also overwrite my sales pages.) Take a moment and create a backup copy of your sales page. Then go through and delete unnecessary words, sentences, paragraphs, bullet points, benefits, and anything else which isnâ€™t absolutely compelling. Try to cut the total length in half and then test it against your previous unedited sales page to verify that it performs better. I have done this with content pages as well because low quality content just brings your sites rankings down and itâ€™s always better to have a Good Bounce Rate. Your website layout stinks. I say that generically because many  , although I admit it is not always the case. Take a moment to compare your website against the most successful website in your niche or a related niche. Youâ€™ll probably discover that the successful website uses a much more streamlined layout-thatâ€™s because a streamlined layout works. A streamlined layout can reduce bounce rate problems by keeping your visitors focused on your copy. A non-streamlined layout distracts readers with advertisements and navigation menus on the side, but a streamlined layout puts everything in front of the reader exactly when you think they need it-advertisements in the middle of a good article; navigation at the end of the article so they can find another interesting article on your site; etc. In short, if you manage your visitors attention well, youâ€™ll immediately  .",Mitz Pantic
03/03/2013,http://comluv.com/whats-the-difference-between-repeat-business-customer-loyalty/,What's The Difference Between Repeat Business & Customer Loyalty,"Building a community of customers who will stand by you is stronger than a relationship built merely on repeat business. Lets look a bit deeper, repeat business is when people do business continually with you over a period of time. Loyal customers are those who stand beside you and enjoy working with you, no matter the better offers that are out there to entice them. Repeat business can be won, loyalty is an ongoing commitment to build a relationship by a clear shift in perception where you move from a service provider (with a host of competitors) to one who is seen as making their lives better. Building customer loyalty is all about being seen as being able to solve problems A good example of the two sides between repeat business and loyalty has been my experience with Blackberry. Over the past six years, I depended on my Blackberry and didnâ€™t really pay much attention to the added benefits. The apps were a bit clunky, nothing was really tweaked to make the user experience more interactive, I just paid my line rental every month and because my contacts were on the phone it was just easier to upgrade to a new Blackberry when the time came round. Last week I moved to iPhone (so now alongside the Mac and iPad have the hat-trick), itâ€™s where a lifestyle is drawn to. Itâ€™s clear that the Apple aim is to empower the individual and this is where we move from repeat business to loyalty. When the focus moves to the individual, this is the key in switching to loyalty. If we can champion the brands that we represent and move to a way of working that is focused on â€˜how can I help youâ€™ and others believing in what we represent then the path changes from a repeat customer to a loyal advocate.",Mark Masters

02/03/2013,http://comluv.com/why-blog-post-length-must-always-be-secondary-to-creating-value/,Blog Post Length Must Always be Secondary to Creating Value,"The people behind the rationale for producing low word count content will often argue that readers struggle with their attention spans. These same readers it would seem much prefer a chunk of information, with the minimum opportunity of distraction. This blog post will take a closer look at both sides of this argument and perhaps more importantly explore the best scenario. As we have already discussed, shorter posts run less risk of the reader getting bored and losing interest. There are fewer things more disappointing than coming across a bloated piece of content. Often these will make their point within the first paragraph or two and then spend the remaining 800+ words almost beating their reader to death. In many respects this type of writing is similar to when an individual was in secondary school. Maybe you can remember scrambling like mad to get as much fluff and filler into the writing as possible. Desperately trying to get over the magical quota line, well long worded posts can often be a little like this. The reality is that is that if something can be said quickly in a snappy fashion then it should. In a world where there is already far too many distractions, should you really be wanting to add to them? Four or five hundred words is barely enough to determine an issue, let alone explore it properly. However, the internet is chock a block full of short content. A lot of this content offers just about as much use as a chocolate teapot. Why? Because content writers are frightened to death about scaring their readers off. If you believe that your writing cannot hold a readers interest over say 800 or even 1,000 words then now is the time to hang your head Great writing is worth much more attention than this. Having read the above, you might well be unsure of the best approach to take. The reality is that there is probably no clear winner when it comes to just how long a   or article should be. When writing for the web it is essential to always deliver value. Without it your readers simply wonâ€™t return. Whatâ€™s more they wonâ€™t share your â€œgreatâ€ùÂù post with others. The time that you spend putting it together will have been by and large wasted. Itâ€™s extremely unlikely that a reader will stop reading after 500 words or so if they are finding your content informative and interesting. The reality is that they will want more! However, on the flip side, if you are being a little long winded in your approach then people are much more likely to stop reading. Most of the time they wonâ€™t even bother to hang around for you to make your point, assuming that there actually is one. The easiest way to guarantee successful content is to follow a very simple, but essential pattern. This will ring true for the vast majority of all non-fiction written material. Put simply a great writer will be able to provide an interesting introduction. They will then have the ability to   a little; of course this is achieved by simply discussing the roots of the problem. After this stage they will then be able to provide a conclusion, or in other words they will solve the issue that the reader has faced. Putting content together in the above fashion can take a little practice; however, with some perseverance great results can be achieved. Without a doubt it is the most likely way that value can be delivered, without the risk of missing something or worse still droning on till the cows come home.",Glenn C

If you do not follow certain guidelines, and you take the fast and aggressive route, you will be punished, that is for sure. Diversity, diversity, diversity, I cannot say that enough. That is probably one of the most important aspects of link building, especially for this year and the future. Sometimes it is best to let the professionals do this, as we have seen so many business owners do more harm than good. My   Company is in South Florida, and if anyone would like help or advice on their site please feel free to ask in the comment section, free of charge of course _Ÿ˜‰ Most of us already know that if we target a specific keyword too much, too fast, too often, and it happens to be an exact match keyword, it is not good. When Penguin hit hard and the big companies started to do the research on what sites got hit and who did not, they all came to the same conclusion. Sites that had more than 50% exact match anchor text got penalized. Given that the â€œBig Gâ€ùÂù does make mistakes, they did penalize sites that did nothing wrong, and that happens a lot these days. The fact is, itâ€™s an algorithm, and not human, so mistakes can and will be made. Even humans make mistakes, so there is no sure thing. The only way to stay away from a penalty is to play it 10000% safe.

Total Backlinks â€“ The Complete Total # of Incoming Links Referring Pages â€“ Backlinks coming from specific pages Referring Domains â€“ Backlinks coming in per 1 domain Referring IPâ€™s â€“ Many sites may be hosted on 1 IP, so it is best to not link from sites that are all hosted from the same IP Address Exampleâ€ùÂ_ 10,000 Total Backlinks Now if you have only 7,500 Referring Pages, that means that you have more than 1 link per page, because the ratio is 10,000 links to 7,500 pages. If you had 1 link per page, the values would be the same, which is what we want. Now if you have only 5,000 Referring Domains, that means that you have more than 1 link per domain, because the ratio is 10,000 links to 5,000 domains. If you had 1 link per domain, the values would be the same, which is what we want. Now if you have only 5,000 Referring IPâ€™s, that means that you have more than 1 link per IP Address, because the ratio is 10,000 links to 5,000 IPâ€™s. If you had 1 link per IP, the values would be the same, which is what we want. The moral here is that you want as close to an even ratio of these as possible. If you have something like the above examples, you more than likely have been building links.Â  Most sites do not have an even ratio, because if there is any effort in link building, the values are not going to be even.

She has long beautiful hair, light eyes and a smile that says she is enjoying life. She is getting closer with each second and you know what you would like to do. You want the confidence to approach her and strike up a conversation, seeing if she is as interesting as she is beautiful. She walks by, the opportunity is gone and you start to get that feeling of regret. Why are you always afraid to approach women, you wonder? Donâ€™t worry there are tons of other men that suffer from this and you shouldnâ€™t ashamed of it. The main reason that men are afraid to approach women is that they fear rejection. Picturing the worst case scenario, perhaps she will slap him, or gets so frightened that she pulls out a pepper spray. Her boyfriend can come out of nowhere and be so offended that you dared approach his girlfriend that he shanks you. I have cold-approached 1000â€™s of women and have hung out with guys that have approached even more than that. Let me be the first to say that never happens. The worst that will happen is that she will ignore you and walk away. And let me let you in on another secretâ€_itâ€™s not a big deal. Along with irrational expectations of what may happen if he approaches her. He feels as if her decision will validate him as a man. If she likes him, it validates his masculinity. However if the opposite happens it is a blow to his self-esteem. He is simply not good enough. Even if her reasons has nothing to do with him, she could be late for work, have a boyfriend, be a lesbian, had a rough day or even be on her way to save kids from a burning orphanage. It doesnâ€™t matter he will take it personally. Sheâ€™s not interested because he is not good enough. This comes from a lack of confidence in himself. If he were truly confident in himself it wouldnâ€™t matter what she thinks, hell it wouldnâ€™t matter what anyone thinks because at the Have you ever seen a young child confidently staring at you? Dancing in a public place with no music and not a care in the world? Tugging on the pant legs of strangers to ask their name? I have and itâ€™s quite endearing, it also shows that children are fearless. Society teaches the fear of other people to kids. â€œDonâ€™t talk to strangers!â€ùÂù their parents and teachers state. So they became wary of others and over time lose their confidence of approaching others. We also learn from society to feel as if we are not good enough. We want nicer cars, expensive clothes, huge houses and the latest iPhones, because that is what society tells us we should want. So itâ€™s no surprise that a man will look to a woman for validation, and fear being rejected. This also shows us that since society teaches fear of rejection to men. If it that can be taught, we can also learn that fear of rejection is actually nothing to fear. One way and the most important way is to realize that you do not need validation from others. What others think of you is irrelevant and what is most important is how YOU feel about yourself. Discover what makes you happy, what is your passion, and simply do what you want to do. To some people, this may seem selfish but who cares. Once you start looking at the world this way, whether you get rejected or not by a woman will become irrelevant and you will be able to confidently approach any woman who you feel like. Another way to get over the fear of rejection is to face that fear head on. I know itâ€™s not easy so instead of jumping into the deep end of the pool. Start in the shallow part, talk to the cashiers when they are scanning your items, ask random women for the time, ask for directions, ask the waitress her suggestion from the menu, essentially have small interactions with women. Over time you will become more confident when it comes to interacting with women, because you are constantly being exposed to it. Imagine if you were afraid of bungee jumping but every day for the next year you go bungee jumping. By the end of it do you feel that you would still be scared of bungee jumping? Of course not, you will laugh in the face of danger, and this is the same with approaching women. By exposing yourself to it more, you will gain a tolerance to that fear and in no time, being afraid to approach women will be nothing but the past.",Alex Taylor

If you like, feel free to brainstorm potential usernames in the comments below, and we can critique them and make suggestions. Every dating site has an â€œAbout Meâ€ù section of some sort. Some are more elaborate than others, but for now we will focus on Plentyoffish.com, since theirs is the most straightforward, and since PoF.com is a very widely used free dating site on the interwebs in the United States and around the world. The two mantras I preach when it comes to profile text: These very simple precepts will get you well on your way to injecting your personality and vibe into a profile that is wholly interesting and attractive to beautiful women everywhere. When I set out on my first experiment in online dating, I went crazy with my profile. I had at least three paragraphs of â€œabout meâ€ù text, and another two of â€œfirst dateâ€ù. And I had already spent two years in the â€œseduction communityâ€ù, which had helped me iron out the â€œnice guyâ€ù from me. The content was good, so why wasnâ€™t I getting responses? One day I had the radical idea to cut everything from the profile and keep it as short as possible, keeping enough in the text to get her intrigued, but leaving the vast majority of hard value out for later conversation. At one point, I decided to conduct an experiment. I would create a female profile and observe the male specimens who would contact her. I was shocked at how many lads had profiles that were littered with such gems as â€œI am a funny and charming dudeâ€ù and â€œIâ€™m really easygoing and I like to partyâ€ù. This reminded me of a mantra which my literature professor in school would repeat: show, donâ€™t tell. It is weak to write â€œshe was sadâ€ù, and much stronger, and indeed more descriptive, to describe â€œa solitary tear sliding off her rosy cheekâ€ù. Similarly, whilst a girl   want someone who is funny, responsible, accomplished etc, telling her that you are those things is much weaker than demonstrating them and letting her come to the same conclusion through observation. I eventually arrived at this: Creative, yes. Silly, you betcha. But most importantly, it demonstrates the eccentricity and cocky/funny sense of humour that I carry with me at all times. Talk about making dating fun. Now on to the most important part of this dating site profile workshop: PROF PIX! If a picture is worth a thousand words, then nonsensical clichÃƒÂ©s would imply that in the world ofÂ online dating sites,Â pictures are very important. And they are. I use my pictures to avoid the boring but stressful â€œdescribe yourself in 60 seconds!â€ù feeling that comes with most biographical self-descriptions. The truth of the matter is, you can get the same point across much more vividly by attaching pictures of you presented in the right way. Ideal pictures for dating sites have the following characteristics: As with the profile text, you want to let your personality show through your photos and present it in the best way possible. If you are certain to include these three components into your photos, you should have no problem getting your foot in the door with attractive women across the dating site world. I am retired from the world of online dating sites. This article is for you, not me. See what you can do with this information, apply it to your own profile, or create one if you havenâ€™t yet considered online dating as a way of creating new relationship potential for yourself. I will be monitoring the comments, so if you have any questions or requests for clarification, feel free to present them below. If you have any additional points to expand on, I would love to hear your own experiences, successes and learning experiences.

24/02/2013,http://comluv.com/photography-on-the-cheap/,Photography on the cheap - The ComLuv Network,"Photography can be a very expensive hobby or profession, you can easily spend thousands on your camera and lenses and that is without the cost of software to process your photographs or the small (but pricey) add-on to help give your photographs that pro-look. But there is some things you can do to keep the cost down some will save you some money and others will cost you nothing apart from a little effort. Have you ever seen a photograph of an item like this photograph below of a watch that looks like its sitting in a large open white space with no distractions behind and just a nice simple shadow below. Well these can be done using a small light tent which is simply a small fold-able canvas box were you can place your item in to be photographed. These are not to expensive to buy at around Â£15-Â£20 but you can save that money to buy yourself a nice new memory card for your camera. Why spend that money on a bought lightbox when they are so easy to make yourself. A light box is basically a miniature studio, you can light it using household lamps and photograph items in a nice even light Making a light box couldnâ€™t be easier, all you need is an old cardboard box. Once made you can use your light box to photograph any objects you like in a nice even light without using flash. Just using household lamps instead. The lamps I bought were from an IKEA shop and only cost a few pounds each. Below is a diagram of a simple light box and would take around 20min to make When you take a photograph of someone your flash (if its on top of your camera) creates a strong flat unflattering look which does not produce nice photographs. One way around this is to bounce your flash off something like the ceiling or wall. Most modern flash guns have the ability to tilt and swivel the flash head for this purpose Another thing you can do to diffuse the flash is to buy a diffuser. These come in all shapes and sizes from ones that clip on the front of the flashÂ  (shown below) to ones that clip on top when the flash head is titled right back (90 Degrees) and the diffuser spreads the light all around creating soft pleasing photographs. One small problem with this is when you donâ€™t have anything to bounce the flash off like for instance if the ceiling is to high. Some flash guns have a small white card you can pull out. This bounces some of the flash back at the subject but even if your flash does not have a built-in pull out card a white business card or similar attached with elastic bands would work just as well. These diffusers are fine and work well but you can also save some money here and make one yourself. There are a few options you can choose from using the bottom of a plastic milk container or using some kind of plastic or rubber that is transparent to fix on top of your flash in a cone shape.              Another option would be to use a reflector, the light from a flash comes out of a very small area and this makes the light harsh. As I said earlier if you bounce the light it would be softer but if you canâ€™t reflect off the ceiling or wall then apart from the solution above what else could you do. Well you could make your own reflector that is larger than the size of your flash head and so making the light softer. Again there are options out there to buy but some are very expensive. Instead all you need is something to sit on top of your flash and reflect the light at your subject. You will need to make the reflector area substantially larger than the flash and it would need to be white. You could try using cardboard, plastic or even craft foam, just look around you and you will find something suitable. Once you have your material experiment and see what works the best, which is more durable and which produces the best photos. Another area of photography that can be VERY expensive is software. A Program such as Photoshop can set you back hundred of pounds. So what can you do about it ? Well for Photoshop you can now get a monthly subscription starting from about Â£20 a month. At least this way you can have all the power of Photoshop now without the large price tag up from spreading the cost. Also donâ€™t forget Photoshopâ€™s little brother Photoshop Elements. This has nearly all the features of Photoshop but at a fraction of the cost so its worth checking out. With the market leaders in Photo processing software being photoshop its easy to forget the smaller but very capable software. Below are two programs that offer good value for money but it is worth looking around the web and just seeing what is available and not just focusing on the likes of Photoshop as good as they are. These two programs are reasonably priced but we can do even better than that. We can use programs that cost us NOTHINGâ€_ yep nothing. The first one I would like to mention is from Serif and its the starter edition of the software shown above here. Yeah it wont have the same functions as the program above but it will get the job done and cost you nothing. Another program that has a good following is Gimp and its also totally These are just a small fraction of the free software that is available. Its worth doing some searching and looking at forums to find what others are using and deciding what works for you. I hope this article has shown you that photography need not be as expensive as you think. With a bit of research and a small bit of DIY you can save yourself a lot of money.",John Young

23/02/2013,http://comluv.com/most-essential-security-tips-to-save-your-wordpress-blog-from-getting-hacked/,Most Essential Security Tips to Save your Wordpress Blog from Getting Hacked,"WordPress is the most famous and most popularly used CMS for blogging. The core of WordPress is very secure but still hackers always attempt to find a loophole in the core to hack it. As WordPress is used by millions of users, so the hackers try to find vulnerabilities in WordPress and exploit them to crack them. This article focuses on securing your WordPress site against these hackers and all their hacking attempts. It covers some of the most important and fundamental elements of securing your WordPress blog. There can be hundreds of loopholes for the hackers to breach your security. It is technically not possible for anyone to take care of each and every single loophole. But that certainly doesnâ€™t mean that you will sit idle and wait for the hackers to steal or destroy all your hard work. I personally consider this to be the first and foremost step in WordPress security. If your hosting provider itself is not providing you any security, then you are in real trouble. There have been many cases when hundreds of blogs got hacked in minutes due to poor hosting security. There can be an another scenario too â€“ suppose you are using a Shared Server and a particular site in your server (which has very weak security measures) gets hacked, then all other sites sharing that same server have  It is the best option to go for a VPS. But neither everybody needs a VPS nor they can afford one. If your blog doesnâ€™t get huge traffic then probably you will never need a VPS,  Taking a strong password is the tip that you probably have read in almost all security related articles. The password is the key to the lock that opens up your admin panel. So choosing a very strong password is extremely essential. If your  , like !, @, #,$,etc then you are probably not doing it correctly. Make your passwords look as ugly as possible. More ugly it gets, more secured it becomes.  Every WordPress blog has an admin username by default. So, if the hackers are sure about your username, then all they need to do is make combinations to find the password. So, it is always advisable to remove the default username of your blog permanently. So, now the hacker neither knows the username nor the password, they need to guess both of them. These are some of the most technical aspects of WordPress security which needs utmost attention. Database is like the brain of your WordPress blog. It contains every single useful information which is required to run your blog. By default, the WordPress database comes with â€œwp-â€ù Â prefix, so it is very important to change to prefix to something like this â€œbf432lxz2112fkâ€ùÂù which is  . The wp-config.php file contains very sensitive data of your WordPress blog, so securing it is very important.  The .HTACCESS file also contains very important data which are required to secure your blog. So, change the permissions of this file so that it becomes unreadable and un-writable by others. Also, do not forget to disable directory browsing, so that hackers do not get any chance to view the directories on your server. Backup is just the next part of security. Securing your WordPress blog is never complete without a proper backup solution.  If some day, your blog gets hacked even after taking all kinds of security measures then it is your backup that is going to save your day. Take regular backups of your Database, XML export and important files like wp-content. Be prepared for all kinds of situations. It is best advised to use any automated backup plugin like  , so that you can get enough time to write valuable content for your readers. These are some of the most essential tips that you must follow in order to get your WordPress blog secured to some extent. There can be  , but these are the most basic security elements that need to be taken care at the very first instant.

22/02/2013,http://comluv.com/dont-let-these-on-page-seo-mistakes-ruin-your-blog/,Don't Let These On Page SEO Mistakes Ruin Your Blog,"Search engine optimization is anÂ excellentÂ way to drive organic traffic to your blog. Itâ€™s also a good method to keep getting traffic for your oldest post. However, search engineÂ optimizationÂ can also ruin your blog, if done improperly. Itâ€™s good to be well aware of things you should do, right? But I think itâ€™s even better to know what you should avoid. Here in this post Iâ€™m going to share the mostÂ commonÂ   mistakes that you should avoid at all cost. Why? Because these simple mistakes can actually kill your blog. Itâ€™s always a bad idea to use the same title tag for more than one page. As per Google guidelines all pages should have unique title tags that describes the content on the page. However, there are many bloggersÂ especiallyÂ newbies who donâ€™t realize this until they receive GoogleÂ notificationÂ for duplicate title tags in their webmaster tool account. And if you donâ€™t resolve this issue it can cause problems in search engine ranking where one of your pages gets ranked and the other one is filtered out of that search result. No doubt imagesÂ speaksÂ more than hundred words. Itâ€™s an excellent idea to grab your readerâ€™s attention andÂ encourageÂ them to stick around to read the post. But adding eye candy images in posts is just not enough, you need to add ALT Tag Attributes to drive a decent amount of organic traffic. You may not realize but images can drive tons of traffic to your blog from image based search results like Google Images. But Many bloggersÂ misunderstoodÂ that if you want to rank higher for a keyword phrase then you should use that particularÂ keyword phrase over and over again. But in realty this method can make your post look spammy to search engines as well as to your readers. What even worse? If you get caught for keyword stuffing, you might get penalisedÂ by search engines. Therefore to make your article look natural to your readers, search bots and to avoid any kind of penalties start using LSI keyword in your posts. Now you must be thinking what are LSI keyword, right? LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing ) keyword are just dressed up names forÂ synopsesÂ and related keywords that you can use to make your post keyword rich without doing keyword stuffing. Besides title tags and meta description, URL is the only thing thatÂ appearsÂ in the search results so why not use your targeted keywords in URLs. This would be a logical step to get more overall benefits from your SEO efforts. However, this is the area where many newbie bloggers continues to drop ball. Now keep that in mind that having keywords in URL isnâ€™t the only thing you need to do. You should always try to keep them short because if a URL is long enough to display in search results, search engines like Google willÂ truncateÂ it by dots. As a result your targeted keywords may not get properÂ visibility. Do you want more comments? Do you want more likes, tweets and shares? If yes, then the next time to you publishes a post on your blog donâ€™t just end it all of a sudden, instead, add an effective call to action (CTA) that will encourage your readers to share their opinion by leaving comment or promote your post on social media network. I have seen that posts that ends without CTA gets very few or no comments while the post that ends with a proper and effective CTA gets more comments, tweets and shares. Remember that Google considers your ability to influence social networks when deciding which sites are most important to rank higher in search results. Over to you.

This day in age itâ€™s not hard to get there. Weâ€™re encouraged to spend, spend, spend at every corner. Given the consumer culture and the unstable job market, itâ€™s easy for anyone to fall into peril. Thankfully, there are ways to turn things around. The following five-step program is by no means easy â€” itâ€™s never easy to get out of debt and regain prosperity. But it does make the process as smooth as possible. Less resistance means a greater chance of success. If youâ€™re in a poor situation, follow these five steps and pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Â  Before you can change your behavior you have to take two important steps. The first is to take inventory. In financial terms, that means gathering together all of your debts and your assets. With these in hand you can give yourself a clear view of your net worth. If youâ€™re deep in debt, this might paint a sobering picture of your finances. Taking inventory has never been easier. With apps such as Mint.comâ€™s  , you can just enter information for all of your electronic accounts. Since almost all financial institutions have electronic accounts these days, youâ€™ll get a clear picture of your financial state. Even better, it will automatically keep up with you, so youâ€™ll always have an idea of where you stand. That is, you wonâ€™t have to take inventory again. The second step in changing any behavior is to identify any trends that might lead you down the wrong path. If youâ€™re in financial trouble, chances are you have a few behaviors that have led you there. By examining trends in your behavior you will be in a better position to make a change. Since youâ€™ve already inventoried, you have the means to identify these trends. Look back through your transaction history. Which withdrawals stand out? When were they made? What was going on around that time? Were you feeling a certain way, or was there some event going on? The more ways you can qualify each transaction, the clearer your picture becomes. Once you identify a few qualities that define your most egregious transactions, youâ€™re in a position to stop them before they occur. Creating Clearly everyone will have an individual breakdown, but the idea is to figure out the minimum levels needed for necessities (housing, food, transportation) and then portion out the rest as needed. Creating this kind of framework helps you automate your finances, so you donâ€™t have to think about it. Every time you get paid, you just add the appropriate percentage to each â€œaccountâ€ù. When you get out of debt, you can swing around and create savings. If youâ€™re going to stick to a budget, you need to keep accurate records of what you spend. That means being diligent at all times. Thankfully, there are ways to make this process easier. You can use a small notebook and pen you carry around, or you can download an   such as ExpenseTracker. Every time you spend, make a record. That way youâ€™ll know when youâ€™re sticking to your budget (especially if you follow No. 5). Save your receipts as a backup reminder. Yes, the Mint.com app does keep track of your spending and even categorizes it. But the point of this is to create a connection between you and your money. Thereâ€™s no feeling of parting when we swipe a credit card. Itâ€™s just electronic digits. By writing down your spending youâ€™re re-creating the connection we had with money in the old days, when cash was among the only means of payment. Taking this small step will make you more aware, and hopefully more responsible. The final step is to remain diligent. When it comes to your finances, that means making records every night. Hopefully you donâ€™t spend money every day. Even if you donâ€™t, it pays to look over your records. Itâ€™s a good habit to get into even if youâ€™re in good financial standing. Everyone falls into bad habits from time to time. Sometimes those bad habits pile up, leaving us in a sorry financial state. But with a quick five-step program anyone can turn around a poor financial situation.

Totaling up the final price for a business trip can be downright depressing. Whether youâ€™re self-employed and on a tight budget, working for a company that compensates travel expenses very conservatively, or just donâ€™t like to get snookered out of a few bucks, learning to take business trips while having dollar awareness and being travel savvy can be quite valuable. Watch out for these factors that can make your traveling expenses go up or down: With the ease and speed of air travel today, itâ€™s easy to forget that there are other options. Trains, buses, and car rentals can be much less expensive modes of travel, depending on your destination. However, if you must travel by plane, try to book your flightÂ  Â three weeks in advance as ticket prices rise as a specific travel date nears. Make sure to check sites like Orbitz, Travelocity, and Expedia for deals on tickets, and bear in mind that flying into a smaller airport in a neighboring city will probably be cheaper than flying into a larger airport in a booming metropolis. If you are traveling internationally, watch out for extra cell phone charges. Many wireless carriers charge drastically higher rates for international Where to access the Internet is something that a lot of travelers donâ€™t think about ahead of time, and if you donâ€™t plan ahead, youâ€™re more likely to end up paying ridiculous fees to get online. Find out whether or not your hotel offers free Internet access. If not, find a local coffee shop with freeÂ Wi-FiÂ and get connected there. Bear in mind that some airports offer freeÂ Wi-Fi, but many do not. Tip for Android users: there are free tethering apps available for Android that will enable you to use your phone as your own personalÂ Wi-FiÂ hotspot. You have to watch your data usage, but itâ€™s one way to get around theÂ Wi-FiÂ charges in airports and other locations. Watch out for little conveniences that come at seemingly low prices â€” they add up. Checked baggage is no longer free on most airlines, so try to pack light and useÂ carry-onsÂ if possible. Snacks on the plane, in-flightÂ Wi-Fi, pillow and blanket kits, hotel mini-bars, and extra towels for the hotel pool are all unnecessary amenities that can really inflate your bill. Youâ€™re about to head out of the hotel when you realize that youâ€™re out of cash. You see an ATM in the lobby and breathe a sigh of relief. But watch out! Many ATMs charge a fee for their use, and your bank may also assess a fee if you use an ATM outside of its network.

By diving into the work without a clear idea of what you will be up against, youâ€™ll be certain to waste company resources and provoke frustration from all corners of your project, not only will this cause frustration but the workers involved will become less motivated. Remember, it takes time to develop a successful plan, so donâ€™t handicap yourself with too much haste at the outset. Create a roadmap of activities and schedule in potential set back and set a point at where to evaluate the progress against time, once you have managed to plan this stage accurately the future will be brighter. This timeless advice is particularly relevant in project management. Your team needs to work together, without interfering with or undermining each otherâ€™s efforts. The best way to ensure they can is by keeping communication channels constantly open and trying to identify areas where team members might be making unfounded assumptions. Plan for regular meetings and facilitate informal talks frequently. When thinking about communication in your plan, make sure you take into consider your own ability to lead, what are your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats within communication; the SWOT analysis is a useful tool to use in the communication process. Not only will the SWOT analysis help drive your project forward but you will learn how your workers can improve further on a project, optimising them to perform better. But communication also dictates that everyone involved in the project has an understanding of the big picture. After putting together your project management plan, distribute it in a simple form to your team. Visually oriented plans are especially effective, and creative options (like creating an infographic outline for the project) can clarify and reinforce memory while also saving time. Developing When drafting schedules and timelines, remember that problems are bound to arise. Do not cut things so close that minor setbacks become major disasters down the line. Also, when it comes to hiring contractors and scheduling meetings with inspectors and other outside consultants throughout the project, contact them as early as possible to give a rough timeframe. Then, solidify plans with them several days in advance, when things have become more certain. Creating a focussed schedule allows not only time for inspection on projects but feedback to amend areas in need of recovery. Auditing is a crucial part to projects; plan to construct an audit checklist of what needs to be accounted for. Do not expect to get everything finished by the ultimate deadline, without setting in-process goals to help the project proceed efficiently. Make sure everyone is aware of the goals, and be strict with intermediate deadlines. If your goal is to make sure a construction project is safe for example, plan to check everything on site, are the pathways clear, is their signage around, is chemicals contained all of these are important. Not be aware of what is happening on site is a danger hazard in itself. Plan a goal to make sure your project is adhering to all safety regulations. For some industries (like construction) planning is largely a function of ensuring the project agrees with local legal standards. If youâ€™ll need any municipal approval or inspections, schedule them well in advance and make them priorities. You may also want to check government regulations and standards that may affect your project, plan to contact the right people in the right department and question every detail you feel insecure about. At the end of the day, you would not want to plan and build a projectÂ  to turn around and be told it must come straight back down because it is not in line with building regulations. If you have worked a   and happened to manage a construction project then you know the reasons for doing this. It is important to remember that even the most carefully laid plans become ineffective if they are overly rigid. Scheduling isnâ€™t the only aspect of the job influenced by unexpected delays. Project managers have to think on their feet, revising their plans to meet the unique demands of the work. So the next time you find yourself in the important role of Project Manager, make a plan, use  ,Â  and stick to it as best you can. But donâ€™t forget that a plan is just an outline to provide goals, instruction, and direction. When it comes to the practical reality of getting the job done, you and your team will have to be adaptable.",Rob Boirun

Many of the Top Ranking SEO Companies are hiding links in JavaScript & Widgets on their clients sites which point back toÂ theirÂ site and and their other clientâ€™s sites. They are intentionally doing this, to hide them from their clients to see. To me, this is completely unethical, and basically stealing their PageRank from them. The reason I stated â€œTop Ranking SEO Companiesâ€ùÂù instead of â€œTop SEO Companiesâ€ùÂù is because a good, ethical, and noteworthy SEO Company would not be participating in this kind of link building tactic. As an owner of a   Company, it is my duty to research my competitors and their link profiles. I am constantly analyzing these companies to see where there links are coming from, and what type of anchor text they are using. While I was doing this a month or two ago using  Here is how to see where a link is coming from whileÂ usingÂ the backlink tool: 1)Â Â Â Â Â  Go to your favorite backlink checker tool 2)Â Â Â Â Â  Enter the domain you are looking to research 3)Â Â Â Â Â  If you are using Ahrefs.com. there will be a â€œnew/lostâ€ùÂù tab at the top of the page 4)Â Â Â Â Â  Click this and you will see the incoming new and lost links per day 5)Â Â Â Â Â  Once you are there right click on the referring page URL and open in a new tab 6)Â Â Â Â Â  Use you find command or keyboard shortcut and type in the anchor text that is listed for that referring page URL 7)Â Â Â Â Â  If the find command says â€œ0 of 0â€_Âù or â€œnot foundâ€ùÂù, this means that the link is hidden 8)Â Â Â Â Â  Next, right click on the page and choose â€œview page sourceâ€ùÂù 9)Â Â Â Â Â  Repeat step 6, and you will see the link and anchor text either in JavaScript or a Widget I am almost positive that the owner of the site does not know this is there. There is the accepted practice of placing your link at the footer of the page if youâ€™re a Web Designer or SEO Company. Most site owners are ok with this, but there are some that are not, and their decision has to be respected. Do you think this is ethical? Is this stealing PageRank technically? How would you feel if you found out their wereÂ hiddenÂ links on your site that you have spent thousands of hours and money on? If you are curious or wondering what types of links are coming to your site or which are going out, use a backlink checker tool and use the steps above on your own site, but search for â€œa hrefâ€ù on your own page.",Justin Musiker

Well, it is the personal relationship you build with the solo ad provider that can get you further in your affiliate marketing business. If you are in the make money online niche and want to grow your business, you might want to visit this   Â or  The first thing to take heed when buy solo ads is to make sure the clicks send to you are unique. This means that the   the clicks you get should be from new visitors. Those return visitors donâ€™t count. You will also want to check the solo ad provider review (on the offer page or warrior forum) to see whether they are genuinely delivering their promise. You will also need to know that there is no guarantee to the product conversion and there is no money refund to your solo ads. If you doubt the result, you can contact previous buyers directly as they will include their website and you can find their contact from there.

So if the clicks work for your campaign, remember to send in your testimonials and this is where the beautiful relationship start to bloom. J Sometime your affiliated product owner will provide email swipe to make things easy for you. But when come to buy solo ads, do ask the list owner whether you can use your own swipe. Because many list owner will actually do it for you. To personal preference, it is best to just leave this to the list owner mainly for the reason to make things easier for you and the solo ad provider. Because when you submit your own copy, the list owner will need to review your copy and if the owner deems it is unsuitable to his or her list, your copy will either be rejected or the owner will have to edit it which waste time. By the way, the list members are already familiar with the list owner tone of communication. Why do you want to disturb that? Just leverage on the facility provided and sits back for the clicks to arrive. Lastly, do keep a list of the solo ads provider who sends you good traffic, price packages, exclusive discounts and other remarks. This is because details like price packages might change over time and you are supposed to stay up to date with the details. Do you have any experience to buying solo ads?

Gone are the days when the choice of a meat substitute product was limited to one or two items that were hard to access. There is now a range of meat free alternatives, making it easy to shop and cater for the vegetarian and vegan consumer. Steaks, burgers, chicken, sausages and a whole range of high protein/low fat meatless foods are now readily available, but what are the sources of these meat free â€œmeatsâ€ù? Quorn remains a controversial product, not least because its source is actually a fungus known as Fusarium Venenatum. Quorn is the most popular protein substitute in the UK. Its popularity extends to the European continent. Whilst an increasing number of people have used this immensely popular and profit producing product safely for over half a century, at least one study, by the USAâ€™s Center for Science in the Public Interest, has suggested that it can be hazardous to people who suffer allergic reactions to moulds and fungi. This may explain its relative lack of popularity in North America. Anyone who   have such an allergy might wish to consider one of the alternatives to Quorn. The soybean has provided the source Originating from China, gluten is derived from wheat and is another major source of meat substitute products. Gluten is produced by the removal of starch from wheat flour dough. The most popular retail form of gluten is seitan. Gluten is nowhere near as popular as Quorn and soya but is nevertheless considered by many to represent the tastiest, healthiest and most versatile of the three. Its relative unpopularity may have much to do with the fact that far more people are likely to possess an intolerance to gluten and wheat products in general than to the fungus based Quorn or the legume based soya protein. For housewives, restaurant and diner owners and caterers alike, the need to find alternatives to meat continues to grow. Those who eat meat donâ€™t stick to one meat source and there is no reason why those who choose not to eat meat should do so. All of the three products described above provide a great source of meat free protein. If you have no allergy issues, there is no reason not to try all three before deciding which one off them suits you the best.",Billy P

I was looking up a local builder on Google and what came up was a lot of bad press from a disgruntled customer who didnâ€™t like the stamped concrete flooring he got in his house. Not that I would want stamped concrete on the INSIDE of my house either, but thatâ€™s what he asked for. Anyway, the customerâ€™s blog dominated Google page one. The builder apparently does not have a website at all. If he had a website that was in the #1, #2, #3 and #4 spots on the Google results page then potential customers might not even see the negative comments coming from his customerâ€™s blog since they would be farther down on the page. The way I accomplish that is built into how I design websites for better SEO plus the built-in advantages of a Content Management I have new posts show up in at least five different places on my website and Google treats each one as an individual page to display on its results page for all the world to see. Firstly, excerpts are on my blog page for the last 20 posts. Secondly, each post gets its own page like the one you are reading now. Thatâ€™s typical for WordPress. Thirdly, excerpts of the most recent three or four posts are on my front page. Fourthly, for the category â€œTruth in Marketingâ€ù I have another page of excerpts, and fifthly each post will be in itâ€™s own category and show up on a category page. Actually, I can assign as many categories to a post as I want so there are even more opportunities for a post to show up on Google page one. This means for at least the short term, before I write more posts and this one no longer shows up on my front page, the title to this post will show up on 5 different pages of my website and Google has picked up on 4 of them. Â The reason it doesnâ€™t show up on my blog page is I have a different header with no introduction to my services so itâ€™s harder for the Googlebot to tell what the page is about.

15/02/2013,http://comluv.com/how-to-create-more-sales-with-enhanced-special-offers/,How to Create More Sales With Enhanced Special Offers,"Have you everÂ  bought or subscribed to something on the spur of the moment, (even though you might not have thought you may not haveÂ  needed it at the time) all because of that   which was really to hard to refuse? A few months ago I received a flyer through the post from a leading charity. It was completely focused on an   of a fabulous rucksack which for me, and Iâ€™m sure countless hundreds, was a little gem. You see at that time I was already thinking about buying a new rucksack for outdoor walking anyway so maybe it was pure coincidence that this special offer came my way just at the right time. They do say timing is crucial but to be honest with you the offer could have come at any time and I would still have fallen for it So now they got my attention with the offer a free rucksack. Looked good to me â€_.but was there going to be a catch? We are now so used to seeing all these special offers only to know that somewhere along the line there was going to be either more expenditure or some sort of committment attached to the whole thing.Â  In a way that is to be totally expected. Business canâ€™t give things away for FREE just for the fun of the exercise. Iâ€™m sure they would soon get into some sort of financial difficulties without having the special offer   in one way or another. Being open and honest about this special offer being available when I subscribed to their organizations magazine, with a monthly donation that I could actually choose according to my own ability to afford, they mentioned that I could actually un-subscribe at any time without giving any reason. That was it. That was the deciding factor.  with the full knowledge that I could receive it without fear of commitment.Â  I could receiveÂ  the special gift offer and still un-subscribe if I thought I wasnâ€™t continuing to get value for money. And nobody would be asking me any questions. Of course, on this occasion,Â  it was great value for my ongoing monthly subscription because I knew that this charity was doing great work and I love to this day receiving their quarterly magazine packed with useful information and more great products to buy directly from them. I also know where and how my donation is being put to best use so they have me as a loyal subscriber for many years to come. Had this special offer been sent my way, complete with a need to commit to buying only 4 more bags from them throughout the year which more than likely would be at highly inflated prices and possibly even of designs that I just might not like,Â  then it might have been an entirely different matter. Rather than an enhancement to the special offer, this would be a great reason to run a mile!Â Â  Been there Every time you write something to your blog, every time you send out news to your subscribers, and every time you invest in quality advertising on the web, including a directory listing it really does pay to include a special offer that is irresistible to your target market. I invested into Andy Baileyâ€™s  Â  which I highly recommend you invest in too, and which I now know is a fabulous addition to my own blog posts and of course that extra special BONUSÂ  now made available to all of my  inviting them to add their own special offers into every post too.Â  If you have a membership site   and let your members make use of it.Â  They will love it! Thereâ€™s now an even greater incentive for my members to write great posts knowing that the visitors might take immediate action on their special offers too. Dramatic improvements to your offer will give you dramatic response to your advertising. Excluding your special offers in business advertising can be a costly mistake because you might not be providing a good enough reason for you potential clients or customers to respond. When you make a special offer that your clients really cannot refuse then you will get a much better response and see higher returns on your advertising investment. Your initial offer doesnâ€™t have to generate sales. It can generate leads or traffic to your business or website.Â  But aÂ  special offerÂ  to generate leads or traffic requires you to develop another special offer further down the line to convert those leads into customers. This is obviously a lot more work initially but it may prove invaluable to you producing the maximum number of sales at the lowest cost per sale ratio. Even for someone without any social skills, talent or previous experience you can use these simple steps to creating powerful offers  If you select a whole range of your products then your prospect will be overwhelmed and your task will be made all that more difficult to define.  Do you want them to contact you for more information? Do you want them to visit your website or to call in to your store? There needs to be something very specific that you want them to do.  Make it as attractive as you can afford then combine it with your BONUS (enhancement) to get the response from your prospect. Quite often a money back guarantee can serve well as your enhancement and ensure a greater amount of response.  Include all the costs of your advertising and promotions. Even a very small profit might be acceptable if you are certain that you will generate repeat business. Revise your offer if you are making losses or not achieving the results that you required.

Daily, weekly or once per month perhaps! It doesnâ€™t matter how dedicated you are to blogging, or how experienced you think you are, there will be times when youâ€™ll simply feel like not writing or blogging about anything at all. There will be times when you simply wonâ€™t find anything to blog about either.Â  This isnâ€™t a bad thing, it happens to us all. So, instead of trying to pull your hair out in clumps, trying to find a topic or idea for your next big post, just forget it!Â  Yep thatâ€™s right, forget it altogether and donâ€™t write anything. In fact do something totally different, something inspiring and preferably something that doesnâ€™t involve being tied online or staring at a blank word document page on your computer. Today folks I want to share with you 9 inspiring things you can do, when you simply donâ€™t feel like blogging.Â  And who knows, you might find any of these activities invigorating for getting your creative juices flowing againâ€_  â€“ Get some fresh air and get those old legs of yours moving, sitting down stressing about what to write wonâ€™t make you more creative.Â  Walking is a great way to inspire the mind and loosen up those old joints.Â  Grab your iPod or iPhone and find your favorite songs that are inspiring to you and hit the pavementâ€_  â€“ Thereâ€™s a real sense of achievement that can be attained from creative cooking, I love to get into the kitchen and cook myself a meal when Iâ€™m not feeling creative with my blog.Â  The joy of it that comes after is eating it.  â€“ Sit back and relax with a movie or an inspiring TV program.Â  One of my favorite things that I love doing is getting the Bloomberg TV app up on my iPad, and checking out the Game Changers channel.Â  There is a series of documentaries on there about how business and media leaders climbed  Reading is the ultimate off-blogging activity.Â  Itâ€™s a great way to learn and inspire your mind at the same time.Â  You may even find some post ideas hidden in what you read.  I love going for a drive when Iâ€™m struggling to find anything to write about, especially if itâ€™s a reasonably nice day and Iâ€™m not in the mood for walking.Â  Though my advice is that you might want to go for a drive when you know there is little traffic on the roads, as the key to all this is to distress and inspire you, and not to get road rage.  Get a massage or spend 30 minutes in a sauna or Jacuzzi.Â  That will soon invigorate you and get your creative juices flowing again.

This bill represented nothing less than the most significant change in our medical care system since Medicare went into effect in the 1930s and Medicaid became a program in the 1960s. The law was challenged by opponents, but was ultimately upheld as constitutional by the United State Supreme Court on June 28, 2012, in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was designed to initiate an overhaul of the health insurance and health provider system for all Americans, staggered over a 10-year period from 2010 to 2020. The   can be accessed on the HealthCare.gov website or the features of each yearâ€™s planned changes can be accessed and understood on a   noting when each law will go into effect. Essentially, the Affordable Care Act will provide or require the medical insurance of millions of Americans. Preventative care will be emphasized even as the demographics of our aging Baby Boomer population will also swell the numbers of patients requiring care. Even without the required interventions of the Affordable Care Act, medical economists have been warning for years that the number of U.S. nurses would be inadequate to meet the needs of the growing Boomer population. Proposed â€œfixesâ€ù such as encouraging more nursing students through student loan deferments, allowing vocational training in high school for LPNs, higher salaries for working nurses and even immigration allowances for Filipino nurses were never enough. The number of nursing students our system can graduate is limited not by insufficient student interest, but by the lack of spaces available in nursing schools due to insufficient faculty numbers. Until we have the number of nursing professors to teach would-be nurses, our number of new nurses each years will remain static and below anticipated needs. In an effort to meet the needs for trained health care workers, the government has been reconsidering faster educational tracts to a nursing degree and license. Examples of these interventions include providing high school and vocational tech educational options for students to become licensed practical nurses (LPNs) or considering military medic training as on par with this basic nursing program than can lead to a registered nurse (RN) degree with more education. Other alternatives designed to increase the number of available caregivers involve new programs and positions to take over aspects of nursing that donâ€™t require a nursing license.   are now moving into open positions in outpatient facilities, the fastest-growing segment of the health care provider marketplace. Medical assistants have the advantage of training in both medical and clerical aspects of their positions and have associate degrees that can be the foundation upon which additional education or careers can be established. Despite the deep divide in America regarding the ultimate success of the Affordable Care Act, all parties agree on one issue: we are in the midst of a health care provider shortage and every additional worker is a plus as the ACA changes take place.",Melissa Crossman

While it doesnâ€™t supersede the value of a good education, real work experience will increase your industry connections, your skill sets and even your familiarity with your trade-all of which can increase your value as a prospective employee. Internships are one of the best things students can do to generate future employment opportunities. These positions can be found over the summer or part-time during the school year and give students a chance to gain experience in their desired field. But one overlooked advantage of internships is the opportunities they offer in terms of networking. Professional contacts are always important, and the more you can accumulate-and the earlier in your career-the better off youâ€™ll be in the long run. An internship is a great way to get in the front door with a company, get them familiar with you and put your name in the running for future positions. But your best prospects will be at companies that are growing and plan on adding a number of positions in the near future. An internship can give you an inside track to one of those positions, as well as experiencing working with an organization quickly on the rise.

My experience was incredibly difficult thanks in total to my ISP. Despite that and with the help of some fantastic tech support reps, my blogs were successfully moved to their new home. Here are 10 steps that helped me keep some of my sanity during the process: If you have a blog that has a lot of traffic, you will need to plan for potential downtime. As you know more about your WordPress blog than anyone, you are the best person to decide when is the best time to make your move to your new webhost. As a blogger and site owner, an FTP client, like FileZilla or CuteFTP should be a staple in your software arsenal. One of the things you want to do is to test your FTP login with the new webhost. I did his and found that I was receiving an error message when I tried to access my FTP site. This is something that I forgot to do before my migration so I most likely lost some emails. Like some, I use MS Outlook to get email. What I didnâ€™t do but should have done was to download new emails into Outlook ahead of time so that I minimize the chance of losing messages that come in during the migration. Once your start moving your WordPress blog to the new webhost, you will no longer have access to the old hostâ€™s mail server; thatâ€™s why itâ€™s good to do ahead of time. The idea of moving each file one by one was not appealing and I needed a way to get this done quickly. Thanks to some great advice, I found a free WordPressÂ plugin called   that not only backed up my blogs but really  Once you have the This is where things get a little technical, so bear with me. If youâ€™re going to moving an existing WordPress blog to a new host, you need to create a blank database in phpMyAdmin and import the table from your existing SQL database into that blank database. This is   if you want your blog to work at all. Once youâ€™ve tested and made sure everything is working, you change your nameservers to the new host. This means going back to the place where you bought your domain name and changing the ns1 and ns2 fields to the new webhost. If you donâ€™t have these newÂ nameservers, ask your webhost. This process takes about 4 hours to complete for each site so you have no choice but to wait. When I moved by blogs, I was unable to get the login screen. So I had to go into the phpMyAdminÂ to modify two fields in my database table that were pointing to the test site and not the main url. Once I did that, I was able to login and get into my blog. Once everything was done, I still had to login and create my webmail accounts. I did this and then configured my Outlook to retrieve mail from the server. If you donâ€™t have the addresses for your incoming and outgoing mail servers, ask your webhost. Itâ€™s also a good idea to configure your client to keep a copy of your messages on the server just in case you have problems with your mail client. After 44 hours of what I thought would take eight, I realized that I was actually holding my breath. Once I made sure I was able to log into WordPress admin and get my emails, I actually breathed. Moving your blogs to a new webhost is not an easy task but it does take some organization. Things can go wrong so itâ€™s important to have great technical support staff whoâ€™s able to help you whenever and however you need it.

12/02/2013,http://comluv.com/new-years-resolution-create-a-successful-blog-in-a-weekend/,New Years Resolution - Create A Successful Blog In A Weekend - ComLuv,"Do you want to learn how to   but donâ€™t have a lot of time to spend messing around with various software, settings, and ideas? Then read on-weâ€™ll tell you everything you need to start a successful blog in just one weekend. A successful blog needs a domain name, but it can take up to 48 hours-two days-for a new domain name to propagate to all of the Internet Service Providers around the world. That means you have to buy your domain name and point it to your server by midnight Friday in order for your website to be fully functional Monday morning. Letâ€™s go through these two steps individually so you can learn how to create a successful blog: Before you choose a blog hosting provider, you need to choose your blog platform. To keep things simple, just use WordPress. Itâ€™s the most popular blog platform and it will work for any blog topic. Now you need to find blog hosting which supports WordPress. There are thousands of   to choose from, but I suggest that you choose one of the larger companies. Most of them offer a free trial, so go sign up immediately for one which offers a good rate, free software installation, and a free trial. If youâ€™re not happy with the service, you can copy your whole blog over to a new service before your free trial ends. The best domain name will include your blogâ€™s primary keyword. (Weâ€™ll discuss keywords later in this article.) But donâ€™t stress over the domain name-you can always buy another domain name later on and move your content over to it with just a few clicks. 1.Â Â  Create an offensive domain name (unless you think you can create a successful blog out of an offensive topic). 2.Â Â  Choose a hard-to-remember or hard-to-say domain name or youâ€™ll make it hard for your readers to tell other people about your site. 3.Â Â  Choose a domain name based on a pun-anyone who doesnâ€™t get the pun will discount your website. After you decide which domain name to buy, you need to buy it. You can use any major registrar; theyâ€™ll all provide DNS hosting for your domain at no extra charge-just use the tools they provide to associate your new domain with the IP address provided by the blog hosting company you selected earlier. Now that you have a domain and hosting, you need to actually build your blog. Start by choosing a main topic for your blog. Almost any topic can be turned into a successful blog, but it has to be a topic youâ€™re willing to write about for a year or more, so make it something which holds your interest. Next you need to distill your topic into your core keyword phrase-this is the same keyword phrase you tried to work into your domain name. Your keyword phrase should be three words or less, and it should be something people use in search queries. Youâ€™ll use this keyword phrase in your initial blog posts to establish your blog as an authority on your core topic. You can then use your status as This post is about how to create a successful blog, but what does success mean to you? For most people reading this article, I think it means a blog which makes money. If money isnâ€™t your thing, figure out what you want your blog to do and how it will do that. For making money, there are three main methods to make money from your blog: 1.Â Â  Advertising: this is simple-you sign up for an account on an advertisement platform, they give you some HTML code to insert into your website template, and then they pay you when people view or click on advertisements on your site. But the ease of this method corresponds to its relative unprofitability for small sites. 2.Â Â  Affiliate sales: you recommend products to your readers and get a cut when they buy them. Depending on what you recommend, you can make a lot of money from just a few sales, so you donâ€™t need many visitors. But attracting readers willing to spend money on products can be challenging. 3.Â Â  Opt-in marketing: you get visitors to your website to opt-in to a mailing list and then you use the mailing list to sell them products-either your own products or someone elseâ€™s products on commission. (You can also rent your mailing list to an advertiser.) This can be the most profitable business type, but it can also take years to establish. Knowing how youâ€™ll make money will help you with the next step: Now that you know your topic and your business model, you can design your site. WordPress has hundreds of free site designs to choose from, but since you can change designs at any time, I suggest you choose either the default layout or a simple layout. Donâ€™t spend much time modifying your site design to fit your needs, but instead choose a site design which works for you from the start. (The only exception to this advice is for people writing blogs about website design who need to prove their skill.) In general, I recommend   with only one or two columns. Advertisements should appear between paragraphs of text-not shuffled off to the side. Calls to action for a mailing list or affiliate sale should appear within the article text or immediately after the article. But, again, donâ€™t spend too much time designing your site-you still have a lot of work to do. The second-to-last step in how to create a successful blog is to write your initial set of blog posts. Why do you need to launch your site with several blog posts? Because anyone who likes your site needs to see other information before they consider you an authority. You also need to convince search engines that youâ€™re an authority, but search engines are smart enough to know that one article does not make you an authority. So your goal Sunday is to write as many blog posts as possible. Order a pizza and just keep writing until youâ€™re ready to pass out-then hang in a bit longer and edit all of the articles you just wrote. Finally, publish them to your blog and go to sleep. Now that you know how to create a successful blog, thereâ€™s just one more step-you need to market your new blog. You have several articles, you have a business model, you have everything else you need. Now you just need to tell other bloggers in your niche about your blog. Iâ€™ve written about marketing your blog several times before, so see my previous posts about guest posting, link building, and other techniques to finish learning how to create a successful blog. You can also grab my free ebook from myÂ authorsÂ bio. This will help you customize your site to gain the most benefits from the searchÂ engines.",Mitz Pantic

08/02/2013,http://comluv.com/the-most-powerful-marketing-strategy-ever-discovered/,The Most Powerful Marketing Strategy Ever Discovered,"As marketers, most of us have learned a scientific formula to try to convince customers to buy our products: list a bunch of benefits and features, a few bullet points, close the sale, upsell, and basically use a bunch of â€œtechniquesâ€ùÂù to try to draw customers into our products. But why are we settling for outdated marketing strategies, when thereâ€™s something MUCH BETTER we could be doing, thatâ€™s much more natural, and will create a level of results and success in your business and marketing that youâ€™ve never even dreamed of. To start off, and prove my point, before I teach you these secrets, here is Appleâ€™s 2012 revenue comparison to other top companies: Apple made more $7 billion more in 2012 than Microsoft, eBay, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Amazon COMBINEDâ€ùÂ_ and in this article Iâ€™m going to show you how they did it; what theyâ€™re doing differently from every other marketer and business on the planet, why theyâ€™re so disproportionately successful than anyone else, and how you can apply their secrets to your blog or business. They did â€œmarketing strategiesâ€ù the old way-Apple did things the new wayâ€ùÂ_ this is the PROVEN success formula for marketing and advertising your business in the 21st century, and the most powerful marketing strategy EVER CREATEDâ€“and itâ€™s the FUTURE of marketing. In a moment, Iâ€™m going to go into detail and break down this formula step-by-step, but to sum it up: It comes down to building relationships with people, instead of trying to â€œsellâ€ùÂù your products to them, and involves adopting a whole new way of looking at marketing, thinking of it as an emotional relationship, and making it about connecting with people on a core emotional level. Emotions are what motivate us, and drive us to make most of the decisions in our lives; we usually do something because the results will provide a positive emotional experience, and selling an emotional experience, life-transforming experience is much more powerful than selling a product or service alone. Three of the biggest areas I learned good marketing methods from are also the most popular forms of entertainment, relationships, and storytelling: Music, television, and books. And what do all three of these things have in common? Well, thereâ€™s actually a few things: Go back to that third one, because itâ€™s the key to capturing a personâ€™s attention and getting them drawn into anything you have to say. Why do we pay attention to the things we do, and feel a   and   with things in our lives? You know that EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS are much more powerful than logical onesâ€_ so why arenâ€™t you integrating this into your marketing strategies? Which of the following means more to you, and would help you connect with a blog, brand, or business more: 1.Â Â Â  We build music, photo, and movie editing software. (company says   they do) Orâ€ùÂ_ 2.Â Â Â  We all have unique skills, ideas, and talents; and itâ€™s the expression of those talents that give us the ability to create, invent and inspire others with the art, music, images, and movies that make us laugh, cry, share, and create moments that weâ€™ll remember for the rest of our livesâ€ùÂ_ and we build software people like us who want to express themselves [connecting with your reader], who want to share their creativity with others, to transform lives, and to transform the worldâ€ùÂ_ basically, we give people the tools to turn their dreams and visions into reality. (company talks about their passion, and   theyâ€™re doing what they do, connecting with customers, building loyalty, and gaining followers) Now, which product would you want to buy? Who are you going to instantly TRUST has your best interests at heart? Which company are you going to believe would be devoted to YOUR needs, and to building the best product? Marketing method number one; which connects with your logical brain, and offers you a piece of computer code and machinery? Or marketing method number two; which tells a story, hits with your emotions, core beliefs, creates an EMOTIONAL bond, and inspires you to do something that will change the world by sharing a grander vision for the world? YouTube is a perfect example of this; you see all sorts of people expressing their comedic talents, their musical talents and unique sense of humor (like Gangnam Style), and inventions like the video camera, the internet, and the computer give them the tools to turn the ideas they have in their head into a reality to share with others, and make others laugh, learn, simple, connect, share with the world, and love. Now how does that compare in terms of meaning, and emotional connection, with â€œwe build music, photo, and movie editing softwareâ€ùÂù. Just like with Microsoft you donâ€™t feel anything for their products, but with Apple you can FEEL the passion and attention to creating amazing products that you can fall in love with, because Apple has communicated this, and has made a human connection with you as an individual, rather than just as a company who is pushing out Windows because of their financial timetable or the holiday season; Apple communicates a passion for changing the world customers can personally connect with and get behind. Apple clearly communicates their desire to make the best products on the planet, and to create revolutionary products that change the world; how many other companies do you know that communicate anything about why they do what they do in their marketing, advertising, and branding strategies? For example, BMW might associate their brand with â€œluxuryâ€ùÂù, but we have no personal connection with a passion or mission for why they build cars in the first place (other than because they need to make money, which isnâ€™t a reason we can personally or emotionally connect with); 99% of companies NEVER try to actually build a connection with their customers; they never create a REAL HUMAN CONNECTION with their customers. In every area of our lives, except marketing, we focus and prioritize emotions and relationships in our decision making, and our whole lives are about relationships and connecting with other human beings, so why donâ€™t we try to connect on a human level in our marketing? We watch movies, read books, and listen to music because we love stories, we love emotional connections, and we love things that capture our imaginations. When people talk about â€œlong vs. short sales lettersâ€ùÂù, think about how an 800 page novel can keep your attention, while offering nothing new (other than emotional stimulation), and not giving any value other than entertainment, storytelling, and stimulation of your imagination that builds a story and pictures, and entertains your brain. We connect with others by understanding their passions, ambitions, dreams; what inspires them, and how they think about things. We donâ€™t just want to be sold a product; we want to have a memorable life-changing EXPERIENCE with the products, businesses, and connections in our lives. As humans, we crave story, meaning, and entertainment. People donâ€™t just want products, they want a history, a story of passion that drove the creation of a product, or a story of one man (or woman)â€™s vision to change the world; and we love hearing about how they overcame the odds and fought so youâ€™d be able to benefit from their product today. How would that change the meaning of the product, and how would you feel about trusting the company who built it to have the best products on the planet, because while the first company just says, â€œwe design movie softwareâ€ùÂù, you can only assume their purpose is to put out products so they can get paid and make money. But the second business, like a friend, created an emotional, human connection, where you can feel their passion, and Especially in todayâ€™s impersonal, over-saturated internet world, where everyone is making questionable claims, trying to compete with each other for money and sales, and customers are naturally skeptical, in todayâ€™s world good marketing and sales is all about TRUST and EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS. Everyone is focusing on winning over readers minds; trying to convince them that their product is the best on the planetâ€ùÂ_ but all the pitches look identical! If you win over your readers hearts, and really make them feel a deep connection with you, your sense of purpose, and why you do what you do, and you aspire to create the best products on the planet, people will naturally want to buy whatever you have to sell, not only because of your product, but because they feel a personal connection with it. Itâ€™s like someone buying a song not because the song is the best, but because they connect it to their first song they heard on their wedding night; people are humans, and they connect products with MEANING in their lives. Building a modern marketing strategy is about forming an intimate, personal bond with people; like a feeling they would have for a best friend, where everything you say cuts directly to the core of their emotions; it begins with being PASSIONATE and creating an amazing experience for your customers. The problem is that most business and marketing has gotten to the point where it actually TRIES to be impersonal to create a â€œprofessionalâ€ùÂù imagine with boring, lackluster, or over-hyped language (like the kid who tries too hard to be cool but just looks desperate)â€ùÂ_ and itâ€™s BORING because itâ€™s been overdone so much; this marketing strategy just comes off as TRY HARD. Good marketing, when done right, is so good it looks invisible; like your friend telling you about how great the new iPhone is, showing you his, and everything it does, and making you want the product, but   trying to convince you to buy it, or that you need it. Itâ€™s marketing; selling a product, but itâ€™s so well done and natural that itâ€™s invisible, and this marketing approach feels just like a friend telling you about an amazing passion project they built, and how incredibly proud of it they are. Everything we do is for some sort of positive emotion, and everything we avoid is associated with some negative emotion. But what causes emotion, and how specifically do you create emotions in someone else, get their attention, and make them FEEL compelled to read whatever you write about? Itâ€™s actually incredibly easy once you understand it. But first, you have to understand exactly what causes emotionsâ€_ because emotions are the key to getting rapport with people, getting them personally and emotionally involved in and connected with whatever youâ€™re doing, and making them want to share your message with everyone they know. The key to holding someoneâ€™s attention (versus boring them) comes down to the difference between abstraction and tangibility. So letâ€™s get that out of the way quicklyâ€_ but this is the KEY to getting people interesting in what youâ€™re talking about, and getting people to like you and actually getting them interested in what youâ€™re talking about when you talk to them. Abstract: Existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence (ex: communication). Tangible: A thing that is perceptible by touch (ex: handshake). We, as humans, value things that we can interact with on a one-on-one, personal level. Basically the difference is, if I put 100 people in a row, showed them two other people, and said, â€œare these two people communicating?â€ù, youâ€™d get 100 different answers and maybe even an argument, because communication is an IDEA that doesnâ€™t have an exact physical equivalent, which means the brain canâ€™t produce a picture, which means thereâ€™s NO EMOTION to the conversation. However, if I said, â€œare these people shaking handsâ€ù, everyone could reach the same conclusion based on what they SEE, because a handshake is a physical, visible gestureâ€_ itâ€™s a little detail in social situations that makes a BIG DIFFERENCE when youâ€™re talking to someone. It gives your mind a picture of something you can FEEL during the conversation, rather than just saying â€œinteractingâ€ùâ€_ which brings me to the next part of this topic The key to making people feel emotions is to use as much PHYSICAL detail in conversations as possibleâ€_ and putting as much emotions into whatever you say to people as possible to make sure you get their attention in any situation. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown: Iâ€™m going to show you 3 easy but powerful â€œlevelsâ€ù of being descriptive during a conversation to make whatever youâ€™re talking about more interesting. The first level is being descriptive when you talk to people: For example if I say eating food, your brain could produce a picture of anything. But if I say eating a soft, creamy banana notice the detail in the picture in your head? The word food really has NOTHING in terms of connecting with you, or producing feelings in your bodyâ€_ and if thereâ€™s no emotion, thereâ€™s no connection with the person youâ€™re talking to. But the word soft, creamy banana has a smooth almost sexual emotional feel to it, and creates a sensation in your body because it creates a PICTURE in your head that causes feelings. Suddenly, youâ€™ve turned â€œfoodâ€ù from a general word that could mean anything, into a specific word where both of you are sharing the same picture during the conversationâ€_ this sharing of the same thing is what creates an emotional connection when youâ€™re having a conversation or talking to someone. In a nutshell, you were able to build a picture in your mind that stimulated your EMOTIONS and drew your attention into the conversation. Now, letâ€™s take it even deeper, and add an ACTIVITY to the sentence: Imagine that soft, creamy banana, and feel your fingers running down the soft, smooth, yellow banana running past your lips, as you chew on the soft, white delicious banana slowly. How much more interesting that conversation was that than, â€ù eating food?â€ù And did you notice how it made you FEEL a lot more connected with me as you were reading itâ€_ instead of it just being a mundane sentence, because it stimulated your emotions, built pictures in your mind, and connected you on a one-on-one personal level to what I was saying. For example, when youâ€™re talking, instead of saying, â€œI went to a game yesterday the went out to eatâ€ù, what you want to say is: Or do you say, â€œI went to a football game yesterday, it was intense, it was sunny out, there was THOUSANDS of people around, and I was sitting with my three friends in the fifth row of the stadium surrounded by cheering peopleâ€_ one of the players made a slide tackle that just dug 5 feet of grass out of the ground with dirt flying everywhereâ€_ and we were all laughing about itâ€_ the afterward we went out to McDonalds and had the most amazing cheeseburgers everâ€ù. Marketing isnâ€™t the same now that the entire world is connected; the social media and the digital age have redefined the personal human experience  , and as long as your marketing strategy is to do things in an impersonal â€œprofessionalâ€ù way, your customers are going to feel a disconnect, arenâ€™t going to be interested or entertained, and youâ€™re not going to have any way to connect with your readers or customers. Remember: PEOPLE LIKE TO FEEL EMOTIONS. If you give them something to connect with in what you do, something to relate to in what you do, and something to believe in, and make them feel like your business or blog, is a close, personal friend, you will instantly stand out, and win people over.",Chris Nosal

Many Webmasters seem to be successful but cannot admit that their websites do not cover their expenses and do not cover the hours they invest working on these sites. An UGLY website is really in the eye of the beholder and the users. As long as your website is user friendly and is built for human enjoyment, you might gracefully pass the UGLY test. Who cares what it looks like if it converts and makes you money if that is what your goal is? Non Simple websites can be both distracting and annoying to your reader. I see many Webmasters spend too much time on weird and wonderful jobs and not enough time on the strategy of the website. Really? This time wasting thing is so common that you are probably committing all of the above offences. Most Webmasters know that you need quality content to make a great website but unfortunately that is not the end of the story. Many Webmasters presume that the content will make them money and make them famous. This will not help if you want to earn money from your blog or website. I have seen some absolutely fantastic content, but when Webmasters expose the monthly earnings, all we see is a sad story behind all of that This just proves that great content will not put money in the bank. You need to have a purpose for the content and you also need to be selling the right products. This brings me to my next point. Many Webmasters say that you should wait until you get loads of traffic before  . I strongly disagree with this and I believe that you should monetize your website as soon as possible because if you drive the right traffic to the right page you will make money. If you think you have to wait to make money then you really donâ€™t know how to make money online and this is just admitting that fact. Think about it? A webmaster can make an ordinary blog post and place an affiliate link within the article and to make money from this link. They have two choices here, they can post this article on an already established website and make money for sure, or they can post this article on a new website and drive the right traffic to it to make money. In each case the way traffic is driven may be different but to make sales, the outcome is the same. You do not need to have a big website or a big following to make money. You can easily start making money if I create content that has a purpose. The problem is, Webmasters create links to the homepage that has no goal, or to any content on the website that also has no goal. Having a simple, but not ugly website, will make your visitors goal obvious to them. The less distractions the better. Many Webmasters make a sale and celebrate. I immediately investigate. This is something that is a part of any business. You need to analyze your success and repeat it over and over again. How does your website make conversions or make sales? If I ask you this question you should know the answer. What type of blog post makes sales? Where should the links or banners be placed within the blog post? What type of products our most likely to sell in these posts? One way to keep your eye on your conversions is to track all affiliate links on your site and in your email campaigns. Here is a quick video showing how to track your affiliate links. My answer is to buy a premium WordPress theme and be done with it. (most are seriously minimalist) Then create fantastic content and promote it. Make sure each piece of content has a goal. That is it in a nut shell. After that, see what results appear and make adjustments. Donâ€™t waste time on tasks that see no benefits. This is why I have UGLY simple websites that make money. _Ÿ™‚",Mitz Pantic
02/02/2013,http://comluv.com/8-key-steps-to-permanently-cure-your-shyness/,8 Key Steps to Permanently Cure Your Shyness - The ComLuv Network,"Shyness is a normal thing! Each and every one of us has felt shyness many times throughout our lives. The only difference between people is how well they manage to overcome and suppress their shyness. With practice, anyone can gain self confidence and become skillful at interacting with others. Itâ€™s not a hard task really, and each of us has it in them. By knowing a few tips and having a sure-fire plan, anyone can learn to better control their emotions in order to have a fulfilling social life! Iâ€™ve talked to many shy people over the course of time, and many of them are annoyed by the inconsistency of their shyness. They felt very social and outgoing one day, but only to find themselves overwhelmed by anxiety again one week later. Our thoughts are to blame for this. Have you ever noticed that, when youâ€™re really busy and focused on something you have to do, you donâ€™t even have time to think about your shyness? Not even mentioning   it. Itâ€™s as simple as this: if you donâ€™t think about it, you donâ€™t feel it! When weâ€™re busy and focused on our goals, our brain is simply too busy to auto-sabotage itself by thinking about anxiety. And this makes the feeling disappear wholly. I you want to prolong those times when youâ€™re in your social mood, you have to keep yourself too busy to think about your shyness, or to even remember about it. Work to achieve your greatest goals in every moment of your life! Follow your passions and dreams, work to achieve them, and problems like shyness will simply disappear as a secondary effect! A very hard thing to do at first, but it is an absolute must if you want to permanently overcome your shyness, fast. It is the simplest and most effective way. If youâ€™re afraid of talking to strangers and the simple thought of asking a stranger how their day was so far makes you feel anxious, then this is exactly the type of exercise you should do in order to get over your shyness fast. Just ignore your fear and do it. Itâ€™s not going to be easy the first few times, but as you keep practicing, it will become very natural   doing it! Believe me, that feeling you get after youâ€™ve overcome your fear for that specific moment is Awesome! The feeling you get after makes this exercise worth doing by itself, not to mention the long-term self confidence gain! But why would you want to do that? One single group of awesome friends that are there for you is great and makes you feel so comfortable! Well, I agree, but let me explain. You need a various circle of friends to evolve in any aspect of your life (especially your social life). You need to be an active part of at least several different social groups. This means people that you hang out or talk with at least once a month. The problem with being a part of only one, or of very few social groups is that they will unconsciously hold you from improving, from becoming the best version of yourself! Theyâ€™ll hold you back without knowing. But how is that? To be short, if you only have one group of friends you regularly hang out with, they will always remind you of who you were when you initially got to know them, and they will always draw you back to that stage. This is due to a psychological effect called  . The only real solution to this is to be a part of as many social groups as you can manage to get in, and to keep them separate! Never try to unite all of your small circles into one big group, because youâ€™d then lose the purpose. Iâ€™m not saying you should quit a close group of friends youâ€™ve got now if itâ€™s your only one! No way! What I mean is that you should always Making others remember who you are comes with so many advantages. Memorable people are acknowledged and respected people. Theyâ€™re always wanted around at any social event and in any social group, because of the value they bring. You can be memorable by expressing your uniqueness. What I mean by this is that, whenever a seemingly crazy idea crosses your mind, you should act immediately, without thinking about potentially negative scenarios. â€œItâ€™s better to regret you did something, than to regret you didnâ€™t do it!â€ù A crazy surprise for your friendâ€™s birthday, a simple   to someone that helped you in the past, or simply being a positive person can all help you be memorable in other peopleâ€™s minds. One big problem I find at shy people especially is how much they complain about their life and daily issues. EVERYONE has problems! And everyone cries about them all the time, everywhere: in their social life, at the TV, on their blogs, everywhere! Be unique! Find SOLUTIONS! Never lose your time thinking about the problems, it wonâ€™t solve anything! Once you start acting to solve the problems instead of thinking about them, youâ€™ll notice a huge difference in the way you think and act. Always surround yourself with positive people. People that complain all the time have a huge negative influence on your own thoughts. Be curious about other people. Donâ€™t be afraid to tell them your name, and to get to know theirs. Make friends with everyone you get the chance to. It will result in many good opportunities in the long run! Humans are the so called â€œsocial animalsâ€ù, and thereâ€™s a reason for that. We cannot be happy if we donâ€™t interact and network with others of our kind. The feeling of loneliness is overwhelming to us, which is why you have no reason not to be friendly and open towards new relationships in your social life. They say the good speaker is, in fact, the awesome listener. Good listeners are sought after by everyone in our society nowadays. And this is because theyâ€™re so rare. Everyone focuses on their own image these days, listens to their own thoughts while others are talking, and generally never care to really understand the one in front of them. It is important to exercise your ability to empathise with others. This is the ability is to visualize yourself in anotherâ€™s position, with their thoughts and feelings in a certain situation. If you start doing this, youâ€™ll have a revelation in terms of understanding others and their interests. Always try to empathise with someone you canâ€™t understand or are having an argument with. It will greatly improve your chances of getting what you want from the interaction. â€œBe Yourselfâ€ù is such an overused tip right now, you see it everywhere. Itâ€™s good advice, yet there is a major problem with it: itâ€™s not applicable! Itâ€™s not like anyone could consciously decide â€œOk, Iâ€™ll be myself from now on, ALWAYS!â€ù and their life would change radically from that moment on. â€œBeing yourselfâ€ù has to be learned and exercised if you want to achieve it. And this can only be done by constantly getting out of your comfort zone! Trying new things and putting yourself out there are the only ways for you to expand your comfort zone and learn how to be yourself in every social situation. But be warned! Once you gain enough self confidence by constantly getting out of your comfort zone, youâ€™ll start feeling godlike! Youâ€™ll basically feel like a boss and roll like one very soon! Itâ€™s all a matter of time and exercise, but itâ€™s so well worth it! Iâ€™d love to see your own thoughts on shyness! Leave a comment and tell me about your own experience! Also, please consider sharing this article with one friend you think it might help! Who knows, you just might change their life! _Ÿ™‚ If youâ€™d like to read more of my articles, you can follow me onÂ  !",Andrew M.

30/01/2013,http://comluv.com/kidney-transplants-and-a-nobel-prize-in-economics/,Kidney Transplants and a Nobel Prize in Economics - ComLuv,"In April 2008, doctors performed what most believe to be the first simultaneous six-way kidney transplant in the world. When one donor, who did not know any of the six kidney patients, stepped up to the plate and was a match for one of the patients in the group, the ball started to roll on this amazing procedure. Twelve individuals were in surgery at the same time, giving six kidney patients a new lease on life.Â This feat was made possible because of the generosity of the donor and because of the genius of  . The organ matching system he created earned him the coveted award and has changed the lives of thousands of kidney patients around the country. Roth created a system not for the intention of matching kidney patients with donors. Instead, he created a system that would match people in a variety of fields. His computerized program has been applied to matching job seekers with job offers, students with colleges and even  . The program uses design and matching theory to make stable matches and it applies perfectly to the kidney donor and matching problem. Kidney patients are in the unique position of being patients who can have a live donor. Because people can and often do live on just one kidney, individuals who are in good health can volunteer to offer one of their kidneys for someone who needs one. If the transplanted kidney takes without complication, both people can live a healthy, long life with one functioning kidney.Â Many patients have friends or family members who are in good health and willing to donate a kidney. The problem lies in finding a match. There are numerous factors that go into matching kidney patients with donors; simply having a willing donor may not be sufficient.Â That is changing with Rothâ€™s system. Through his computerized program, kidney patients have a better chance of finding a match. In 2008â€™s six-way transplant, each of the patients had a willing donor, but none of the donors were a match for their loved one. When the sixth match was found, the doctors were able to swap the kidneys around the group so everyone had a match. Today, all 12 individuals are doing quite well. In spite of Rothâ€™s system,  . The averageÂ kidney patientÂ in need of a transplant has to wait 49 months to find a suitable donor. While this wait time is decreasing, the longer people have to wait, the less their chances of survival will be.Â The vast majority of kidneys come from deceased donors with a survival rateÂ of 75 percent one year after surgery. The survival rate increases to 90 percent when the donor is still alive.Â The more people who step up to the plate and offer themselves as living donors, the more patients will be able to survive after suffering kidney failure. With Rothâ€™s system, live donation is becoming more feasible. People who know kidney patients can offer to donate even if they are not matches and increase the chances of finding a kidney for the person they love.",MattHerndon
29/01/2013,http://comluv.com/why-guest-posting-on-blogs/,Why Guest Posting On Blogs - The ComLuv Network,"The common explanation when you see this kind of posting is all technical n boring stuff like guest posting on blogs is to increase your blog traffic, SEO, build authority and etc. No disrespect but thatâ€™sÂ  Â what u going to see in this posting. This is something more to heart and emotional. First of all, as a writer, you probably will agree that it is fun to write and exciting to see your work being published. _Ÿ™‚ Letâ€™s face it, how many writers can have their work being published? Guest posting make that possible and you donâ€™t need to go through the pain of publishing a hardcopy book. Take   for example, once you submitted your post to the network, you will need to wait for the approval over the weekend. If everything flows smoothly, your post will be on queue for publication and the admin will email you the date your post will be published. This is where the excitement startsâ€_ For the entire waiting period, it is like waiting for your baby to be due. When the days come closer, you will feel the excitement building up slowly and is anxious to see your guest posting on blogs. When the email notification finally came that your guest posting It is that excitingâ€_ The next reason to why guest posing on blogs is to share information. Have you ever heard of the saying â€œthe more u give, the more u getâ€ù? If that is the case, why be selfish? If you believe in the law of attraction, you will know that the Universe doesnâ€™t work that way. Too many mediocre affiliate marketers focus on the tangible and afraid that there will be more competitors if they share what they know. Thatâ€™s probably why so many affiliate marketers are struggling to make money online. If you are following any mentor, they will probably tell you otherwise. If you focus on the intangible like sharing quality content and delivering value, tangibles like traffic, pagerank, authority and money will flow in effortlessly. By the way, it feels good after you give. _Ÿ™‚ When compare to article marketing, guest posting enables you to interact with your readers where the writer can take the feedback and improve on his writing. Often, these comments are genuine and reflect the readers feeling toward your content. When the readers comment and you reply back, it is like everyone is interacting in this small like minded community which ideas are being bounced off and trying to help each other without asking for return. Well, there is return of traffic and other tangible stuff but again, it is advisable to focus on the intangible and let the other things flow naturally. By the way, building a community and interacting with like minded people is proved to be rewarding because often, partnerships are struck under this kind of environment. The sweetest part to guest posting on blogs is to be able to see the compliment from the readers and that they enjoy reading your post. This is such an appreciation that your hard work (not really hard work though because you are just sharing) is being recognized. Letâ€™s be frank, donâ€™t you like a pad on the shoulder and be told of a job well done? If you have done the work, shouldnâ€™t you take credit for it? If you agree, why are you still reading? Start guest posting on blogs nowâ€_",Michael
28/01/2013,http://comluv.com/8-seo-tips-for-every-business/,8 SEO Tips For Every Business - ComLuv,"Search engine optimization or SEO is a fact of life. Your SEO efforts must be clear, concise and practiced constantly. Site owners that have a handle on all things SEO will succeed with what they do and provide a winning website that gets more visitors, attracts interested customers and can convert some of these customers to sales. There is no way getting around this step â€” your website needs content, plenty of it and that information should be accurate, fresh and interesting. For small business operators, content generation can be an all-consuming process, but one that can be carefully managed to yield excellent results. Your choices here are to write the content yourself, have one of your workers write it for you or get your content from a third-party source. Letâ€™s cut to the chase here and look at third-party sources â€” you can pay a freelancer, use a free content site or do both. Chances are you will do both, choosing to pay for some content while welcoming guest bloggers to add their material to your site. Set a standard for web content on your site, that is articles that are of a certain length, cover a specific subject and link to relevant sources. Never underestimate the importance of social media. Twitter, Facebook, Stumbleupon, MySpace, Delicious, Digg, Reddit and LinkedIn are just a few of the sites out there. You wonâ€™t use every site, but the most essential ones are Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Create accounts with all three, write your profiles and link to your website. You can automate some of your actions such as your tweets and Facebook updates, but you will need to set aside a portion of your day to work on these directly. Consider hiring a virtual assistant to help you out with certain tasks including updates, tracking your social media influence and monitoring feedback such as on your blog. Quite easily, your SEO efforts can take you far and wide, but what if your customers are mostly local? What good is all the work that you do if they are not finding out about your business? This is where local search participation comes in. With local search, you need to optimize your site for local customers. For instance if you operate a local gardening shop in Raleigh, then using words such as Raleigh garden shop, Raleigh garden help and Raleigh garden store can help your cause. You will also want to get local reviews through Yelp and similar sites, by asking your customers to provide that information on your behalf. Take care not to game reviews here â€” welcome honest feedback including negative information. We touched on keyword relevancy in our third point, but there is more that you can look at here. Whether your business is locally focused, or has a national or international reach, you must take steps to understand what keywords are right for your business. Using the Google Mobile devices are here to stay. Indeed, we will soon reach a point where people are conducting the majority of their search with a tablet or a smart phone, as personal computer usage diminishes. Optimizing your website for mobile home users is essential. Pages that are not optimized may not show up on such devices or may be rendered incorrectly. Optimizing on your own can be expensive, but you can instead use content management system themes to do the work for you. Here, you would make use of WordPress, Plone, Joomla or Drupal as your CMS and purchase a theme or download a plugin to use instead. Â Let someone else do the hard work for you! Â Related to the fifth point is the design of your website. Mobile device compatibility is important for the reasons given. But, your site may not be usable in other ways too. Your siteâ€™s theme should be clean, easy to navigate and load quickly. Your pages should offer a clean hierarchy with sub-pages pointing to main pages and all links working and easy to follow. Avoid sidebar clutter and never link out to bad neighborhoods. Â Every person seeking SEO enhancement must have a clear strategy for inbound, outbound and internal linking. The Internet is the world wide web â€” the way that sites connect with each other is important if you want your information to be easily found. Seek inbound links by writing articles, issuing press releases or being quoted on other websites. Offer outbound links by quoting other websites or referring your readers to third party sites for more information. Link to your older articles and check your links to ensure that none are broken. You need to be a student of your website. That means using a good analysis tool such as Google Analytics to measure your siteâ€™s performance. Google Analytics is easy to install and the code is typically placed in your siteâ€™s header or via a plugin if you use WordPress. This tool can help you set and gauge your visitor goals, analyze your data, track your advertising campaigns and handle advanced features such as tracking traffic variations, employing scripts and monitoring your profiles. Whatever tool that you choose to use, find one that you are comfortable with and use it regularly. SEO management is no small matter, something that many business owners realize that they cannot handle by themselves or simply prefer to outsource. If you choose to work with an SEO professional, ask that individual for details about what the company has to offer. You will also want to obtain at least three references and contact these people to learn what the company did for them.  If you find a professional that you like, insist on signing a short-term contract before agreeing to a long-term commitment. You will want to carefully evaluate the   to obtain the plan that is right for you.",Matthew Keegan

Harv Eker That Changed My Life Forever,"Like you want one thing but  Well that was me all the way! A little over 2 years ago, I was working the grave yard shift at a dead end job.  ! It was only my 4th job I believe it or not but it didnâ€™t take me long to see a pattern. This is the exact thought that came into my head over 2 years ago. I started looking for something more fulfilling and was directed to read booksâ€_. â€_You know the â€œ â€ù books that society tends to stay away from. Funny how that works. One of the first books I read was   â€œ â€œ.Â After reading this and a few more books, I started to think different. I started to realize that   I could start then and live the life of my dreams in a few years. After getting fired (like you didnâ€™t see that coming.. LOL) I focused like never before and thanks to  , Iâ€™m comfortable in saying Iâ€™m   than most people think is even possible. Iâ€™m going to share with you Â these 10 things I learned that changed my life and they will do the same for you; if you want them to. In the beginning of his book   threw in a slick disclaimer where he lets you know not to believe anything he says; basically letting you know that  . Best way to get results is to go out and  My thinking is  â€_ So I took action and I see it paying offâ€_ Success isnâ€™t something you can just buy from the store. You actually have to put in work. You are going to fail many times before you reach success. The mindset you have to wake up with every morning is When you get to the point where you want success as bad as you want to breath, youâ€™ll be successful. Thereâ€™s a saying that most people give up right before reaching the success they desire. This comes from not being â€œ â€œ. . If you do something for a long period of time and see no results, then strap it; but usually what happens is you perfect the method and become successful. Itâ€™s true that everyone has greatness within them but many never awaken this sleeping giant. It took books like Â â€œ (and many others) for me to see that there was so much more out here than a 9 to 5 for 40 years. This one thing helped me awaken my true potential. I knew so much about internet marketing, it would blow some peopleâ€™s mind; yet my income didnâ€™t reflect it. It wasnâ€™t until I realized that people are hungry for the knowledge that I have; so much so that they will pay me for it. Iâ€™ve ranked websites on the top of Google in 35 minutes; completely took over the first page of Google for affiliate launches; made $700+ from a few hours of work and many more stories but none of that matters if you canâ€™t see greatness within yourself. My friends constantly push me to be great. I know Iâ€™m great already but itâ€™s good when you have a circle of friends who push you to do better. It took me a while to understand this but if you keep going from opportunity to opportunity and youâ€™re the only person not seeing success, itâ€™s not the company, the opportunity or the people around you.   Thanks to some amazing audio from , I suddenly found  . The reason I wasnâ€™t successful was because of the way I spending the 24 hours I have in a day. We all get 24 hours in a day. The only difference between You, me and Oprah Winfrey is she uses her 24 hours differently. This is one that was hard for me to grasp. You get into something like internet marketing and you want all your friends to get in and experience true freedom. Only problem is they donâ€™t have the same drive or goals as you. I eventually came to the conclusion that Iâ€™m not here to save everyone.  . Trying to save everyone, you end up putting more burden on you than you can bare and most end up failing anyway.  If not where you want or deserve to be, then itâ€™s obvious that what youâ€™ve been doing is NOT workingâ€_ You need to change your thinking or else you will stay in the   who live a mediocre life. This goes hand and hand with #8. Being successful is all about making changes to yourself because itâ€™s ultimately your fault why you arenâ€™t successful. Let go of old habits. You may have some habits that may be hindering your success; I donâ€™t know. I heard a great speaker once say,  Aside from the fact that youâ€™d be expected to follow in his footsteps, you would greatly benefit in life from having one of the greatest educators in history as your father. It shows because  , son of  , has created his own lane and like me, is fond of internet marketing. He says it fits his lifestyle. You can viewÂ  . How your parents live(d) their lives weighs heavily on your adulthood. I see parents all the time who want the best for their kids but I can tell from the way they live that the best is not really that muchâ€_ You canâ€™t teach your kids what you yourself donâ€™t know; meaning if a parent is not educated on how money works, they canâ€™t teach their kids which means the process repeats itself generation to generation until someone wakes up and saysâ€_ Iâ€™ve given you 10 specific things I learned from  . I live by and apply these methods daily and as I grow, I see them working. How can I see the proof? Iâ€™m happier, my finances are growing and my business is taking off to new heights. Iâ€™ve come along way just like everyone in internet marketing but the journey is worth and youâ€™ll see once you get in it. At one point, I would â€œhope for the best and expect the worseâ€ùâ€_ â€_Now I hope for the best and expect nothing but the best. Being successful has a lot to do with mindset. Work on that and youâ€™ll be successful. If youâ€™ve made it this far, itâ€™s obvious you liked this post so I encourage you to  Thanks andâ€_ Facebook:  Facebook Fanpage:  Twitter:",Dennis

23/01/2013,http://comluv.com/wordpress-website-design-widget-zone-home-page-vs-traditional-blog/,WordPress Website Design: Widget Zone Home Page vs. Traditional Blog,"One of the big WordPress website design questions that must be address before choosing a WordPress theme is whether the website will use a particular home page layout or simply post the most recent blog posts. What makes this issue more interesting is that there are some WordPress themes that have home pages comprised solely of widget zones where a website can list recent posts as well as other content. Therefore, when building a WordPress website, should you go with a widget zone home page or use a traditional blog home page? Both home page formats have their advantages. I set those out below. Widget zones enable you to insert any kind of content within the zone. Moreover, there isnâ€™t a limit to the amount of content. Therefore, one widget zone provides for a great deal of flexibility. Multiple widget zones configured into columns provide even more home page layout options. The more flexibility you have, the easier it is to test different content on your home page to what works best. Determining what works best depends on what your primary goal with your website is. Therefore, itâ€™s imperative you know exactly what you want your website to do for you when planning and building it (as well as choosing a theme if youâ€™re using WordPress). Some premium themes include whatâ€™s With a widget zone home page, you can get your most important content displayed front and center on your home page. This is important if you have specific goals or purposes for your website that you achieve with your content. It may be selling something, getting people to read a particular article, If your website/blog has an audience who revisit your site, placing your latest blog posts on the home page makes the most sense so that readers donâ€™t keep running into content theyâ€™ve seen before. This makes it easier to build up a loyal audience who get their eyeballs on your latest work quickly upon visiting your website. When you have a widget-zone home page, thereâ€™s quite a bit of formatting, planning and design work involved to get the home page just right. When going the traditional blog-format, thereâ€™s zero home page formatting required. You simply focus on providing top notch content and let the WordPress CMS do the work for you. If youâ€™re website is a true blog, go with the traditional, non-widget zone home page format. If your goal is to publish timely and new posts regularly for readers, the blog format is for you. However, if youâ€™re publishing a magazine website, business website or wish to feature a portfolio or e-commerce catalogue page, a widget-zone home page is best. The widget zone home page will give you more flexibility in formatting and laying out your content to create a high-calibre home page.",Jon Dykstra

When I started blogging, as a beginner I was prone to mistakes. As people say â€œPractice makes a man perfectâ€ù. Though 4 years of blogging did not make me a perfect blogger, still I have learnt a lot of lessons from blogging. Blogging is a vast platform. Every day there are a lots of blogs being added. So its obvious that we have many newbies to blogging everyday. It is also obvious that they are prone to making mistakes. Here are some common mistakes that a newbie must avoid doing. Every field in this world has competition. Though blogging is not a competition you do have people around you of same interests. You are not the only blogger in your niche. There is no way a blog can get visitors without promotion. Promotion is a major factor that decides a blogâ€™s fate. Blog Commenting, Guest Posting, Article Submission and social sharing are few ways one can promote blogs being a newbie. This is a much repeated quote when it comes to blogging It is rightly said. One killer post can prevail for a longer time than many poor quality posts. There is no meaning posting 10 poor quality posts Blogging out of niche increases a blogâ€™s bounce rate and can also frustrate regular visitors. A Multi-niche blog is a tough job to develop. It needs a lot of work. Maintaining a single niche and posting within the niche is the secret behind every blogâ€™s success. This is one of the several reasons people write posts out of their niche. You need to have a thorough knowledge about the niche before writing about it. If readers find you struggling with your content its tough to maintain the blogâ€™s traffic. Google, Yahoo and Bing would pose greater challenges to you than your blogâ€™s traffic. Search Engine Optimization is one of the most important factors of a successful blog. It is a major contributor of blogâ€™s rankings and a blogâ€™s traffic. Most of the newbies forget this key factor. Finally it is for you to decide. Most bloggers sweat it out hard to bring up their blog. Especially in Internet Marketing and Making Money Online niches. Itâ€™s really easy to develop a blog if you  There are conventional ways to develop blogs but smarter people take up unconventional ways. Thatâ€™s where smartness comes into play. Working smart gives you more positive outcomes than working hard. So, The last one was one lesson I learnt in my blogging career that could be applied even in daily life.

If youâ€™re like me, you can look back at your life and remember the time when you first decided you were fat, and â€œhad toâ€ùÂù diet. Looking back at those photos I think that I wasnâ€™t overweight, but insane! I was 126 pounds, 5â€™6â€_Âù, and athletic. My problem was not my weight, but my mindset: I wasnâ€™t perfect. I wasnâ€™t good enough the way I was. It takes some women a long time to understand the life lesson and realize that you â€œhave a bodyâ€ùÂù. You may like it, or hate it, but it is yours for the duration of this lifetime! For women, this can become a lifetime struggle, until you finally wake up and realize: You are fine the way you are, and how you look is not the most important thing in the world â€“ except to you! Low self-esteem got me started on the slippery slope to â€œdiet prisonâ€ùÂù. Each time I dieted my metabolism slowed down because I was starving myself. I got angry and frustrated at my body. Here I was, sad, stressed, starving. Iâ€™d ask myself, why am I continuing to do this?? Iâ€™m not losing weight anyway, and then Iâ€™d stop the diet. And gradually my body would start to bring my weight back to where I began. After each diet Iâ€™d gain an additional pound or so, something I call â€œ â€œÂù. Then, Iâ€™d get disgusted with my weight again, and find yet another diet plan, that promised, that THIS time would get me to my weight goal. But it never did. And Iâ€™d go through the same yo-yo process again, putting on additional punishment pounds each times. This process has been called Yo-Yo dieting. You go down, you go up. The diet industry blames the dieter for not staying on that miserable tasteless diet for the rest of their lives, and says thatâ€™s the reason why the dieter failed. ( ) Â The poor dieter, who only went on the diet because of feeling lousy about themselves in the first place, is all too willing to feel guilty, and take the blame on themselves INSTEAD of the fact that  . Itâ€™s time that you understand, you didnâ€™t gain the weight back because of your lack of discipline, or that you ate a cookie and â€œbrokeâ€ùÂù your diet. You regained the weight because you have a healthy, normal body! Dieting actually making you   weight! It took me a long time to finally realize that I was not unusual, but in that 95% who regain the weight. Much of the â€œCommon Wisdomâ€ùÂù accepted as about dieting is totally false! Â Diet   has been repeated so many times, that people take it for being the truth without questioning it. When people all you have to do to lose weight is â€œ â€œÂù they are completely wrong! Itâ€™s actually a combination of the worst things you can do if you want to lose weight! Your body has a natural set point that is inherited, just like your other physical characteristics. If you eat â€œnormallyâ€ùÂù when you are hungry, and donâ€™t use â€œcomfort foodâ€ùÂù like a drug when you are stressed, your weight will stay within a 2-3 pound range by itself. Your body is a very sophisticated system, like a thermostat. If you eat fewer calories, your body automatically slows down your metabolism, and makes you feel lethargic. If you exercise too much, it makes you extra hungry and makes you crave carbs! This is a healthy bodyâ€™s reaction to â€œeat less and exercise moreâ€ùÂù! Furthermore, dieting puts your body into a stressful state, which changes your physiology and makes losing weight almost impossible! I call it a â€œwaist of dietingâ€ùÂù, because stress puts on belly fat! The number one important thing to lose weight is to  . Itâ€™s been estimated that 80% of overweight is created by stress eating, and the effects of stress on your physiology. Eating because of stress provides only temporary comfort at best, and will just make you feel worse about yourself after you stop eating! Your mindset must be transformed so that you believe you deserve to eat and enjoy your food. Nurture yourself with good food. And that means having an occasional treat! Eat mindfully, paying attention to enjoying and experiencing your food. Youâ€™ll then notice when you are full, and stop eating. Essentially, eat like a two â€“ year old: eat what you want, when you are hungry, and stop when youâ€™re full. But please donâ€™t smush the food all over your face like a two year old, itâ€™s very unattractive! Seriously, de-stress, enjoy your life, and your weight will adjust! Itâ€™s time you stop stressing and blaming yourself for your diet not working.   on being meaningful, grateful and happy, and watch your weight adjust almost by magic: without dieting!",Lianda Ludwig

Find at least 10-15 minutes a day to do something fun and relaxing for yourself like yoga or meditation, taking a power nap or a bubble bath, listening to your favorite music or spending time with your pets. Forget about work, children and learn how to relax and do absolutely nothing. This is the best thing you can do for yourself: your mind, your body, your spirit and your health.

Okay, you donâ€™t have to be a rocket scientist to know that. Thousands of new blogs start up every day. Most of which have great intentions; however, many completely miss the point. Their content is not written for the right people! Huh, I hear you say? Well what I mean is that the blogger doesnâ€™t write for the people they should. To expand on this a little further, the following multiple choice question should help: Hopefully most people will choose a healthy split between their readers and Google. In reality it should be something like a 70/30 split, in favor of the readers. After all these are the people that actually bother to read the content you have (painstakingly) written. Unfortunately way too many bloggers are still writing content that is just for the search engines, aka Google. How do I know this? Well the stuff that gets churned out is  . Most of the time the content contains way too many keywords, it seems that these bloggers are trying to force Google to notice their content. It should also be noted that attention to formatting is important here too. A well laid out blog post will make it much easier for the reader to actually, In some desperate attempt to get their content featured as high up the rankings they are resorting to churning out spam articles. Despite Google and the others stating time in memorial that content should be adding value. The fix for this spam is quite easy. All that it really needs is the writer to think more about the audience that they are writing for. If it is not possible to fit a keyword into a sentence naturally, then it should be left out. This practice is much better than forcing keywords into text; it makes it so much better for the reader too. Generally speaking a good, readable article will contain around 2-3% keyword density; much higher than this and you are risking spamming your readers with your blog content. Nearly as damaging as purely writing for Google is to just to write for yourself. This means that you really donâ€™t care about providing your reader with any kind of solution. Â Very often there will be way too much technical information in your writing, when this happens readers donâ€™t get time to digest what they have read.

I guess it goes back to my early days when gaining top rankingsÂ was brain-dead easy. Iâ€™ll never forget the day when a Google Top 10 page listed onlyÂ sites built by either myself or one of my students for a â€œmoneyâ€ùÂù keywordÂ in a very competitive industry :: {cell phones}. But there is no doubt things have changed. Itâ€™s more competitive now because not only has Google fine tuned theirÂ algorithms to filter all sorts of weak content and backlink tricks but companiesÂ now routinely invest big bucks in optimization. However, along with this trend of companies seeking to â€œimprove ROIÂ through SEOâ€ùÂù :: as the humorous National Car Rental TV ads remind usÂ :: goes the all-to-human-tendency of â€œover thinkingâ€ùÂù a fairly simple concept. I think of Google as library. And like any library people can find useful information about topics, or subjectsÂ they are interested in. However, book libraries would be useless without an organizing system. Because of the Dewey Decimal System a library assigns a number that makesÂ it easy to locate a particular volume to within a short length of shelving whichÂ makes it simple to find any particular book. In the case of Google they too make it easy to locate information through sophisticated mathematical formulas that narrow down a top-ten selection of websites deemed most appropriate to the search term entered by a user. Googleâ€™s continued success depends on their ability to get this right. That is not a bad thing but a good thing. Imagine going to a library and asking the librarian for the best books on theÂ American Revolution and she or he brings back books about the War of 1812,Â the American Library of Congress or the French Revolution. No, no, youâ€™d say, I want to learn about the American Revolution. Youâ€™re close, but not close enough. Of course, libraries do a pretty good job of classification so the above analogyÂ is far fetched to be sure. But my point is simply this: Googleâ€™s role is the same as the librarian. They want to help you find what youâ€™re looking for and unless they haveÂ a high rate of success youâ€™ll go elsewhere. I donâ€™t have â€œblack hatâ€ùÂù types reading my emails. (at least I hope not). But consider, for a moment, the challenges Google faces when rankingÂ gazillions of web pages every day. Hereâ€™s a black hat trick that recently got demolished by Googleâ€™s latest EMD update of Sept 27th, 2012, which unfortunately caused some collateralÂ damage to legitimate sites.",James Martell

Thatâ€™s the ONLY secret to boost your email subscribers. Because, when you give too many options to the readers.. they likely to choosing nothing! When you donâ€™t have a focus on your blog homepage or design, youâ€™re not going to get more email subscriptions. Iâ€™ve seen a rapid growth on my blogâ€™s email subscribers after using landing pages. Iâ€™m averaging almostÂ  Â email subscriptions almost every single day [Monday to Friday].

They should be clear, concise and less distracting. Â My blog is just 7 month old.. so the average new subscriptions are really great for any new blog. Do more with less.Â Provide less options to the readers. What do you want from your blog? Is it getting more Facebook likes, YouTube views or boost in email subscribers? Play according to the pitch, youâ€™ll get great results then. If your blogâ€™s primary goal is getting more email subscribers.. give only one option to the readers. Give your email or leave. Itâ€™s as simple as that. Â Give a strong reason to the readers to subscribe to your blog. Why should they subscribe? What are the benefits theyâ€™re getting after subscribing to you? Is it a freebie? A video? Or something unique and useful? Call To Actions (CTAâ€™s) play a vital role when it comes to boost your email subscribers. Why? Your readers are looking for what to do after landing on your page. If you give proper actions, theyâ€™ll definitely do it.

Chances are that you have. They are rampant on twitter! Even pros like Ryan Deiss get tricked in to clicking a link and then authorizing the page to tweet on their behalf (or, more likely it was one of his minions) The idea is to blast out DMs to people with a message about bad things being said about you or bad pictures of you being published. Anything to get you to click the link. once you click that link then youâ€™re most likely taken to a page that tries to further trick you in to authorizing an app to give you access to the pictures. if you do that, youâ€™re screwed! once you give an app permission to post on your behalf, they can then DM everyone in your followers list the same sneaky message. because rinse and repeat. Because once they have your account they can send their spam out to your followers. even if only 1 in a thousand responds and just 1 in a thousand of those clicks.. etc then the millions of followers they can now access gives them enough successful rubes to make the whole episode profitable. Just be careful out there. Donâ€™t just authorize any app to access your details or post on your behalf. sounds simple doesnâ€™t it? whoâ€™d get caught doing that? plenty! The next time you get an authorize request for your twitter account, be very careful! even pros like Ryan Deiss can get caught and if they can get hacked, what hope is there for their followers? see this tweet, poor person is probably already hacked..

The audience comes away with an impression about a writerâ€™s ability to communicate effectively. Writing at your best will   on Twitter and your blog! There are a variety of techniques a writer can use to improve their writing and clarify their message for the reader, just like theyâ€™re techniques for   Readers do not like being taken on a wild goose chase when seeking information.Â  They like organized and easily understood text with a logical format. Open with a clear introduction letting the reader know what the intention is. Make sure that there is a strong opening with good descriptive words.Â  When writers wander around their subject too much at the beginning, readers lose interest.  Make sure sentences do not drag on forever.Â  Use shorter sentences when possible to get points across. Use longer ones for explanations or definitions of your main points. Make sure commas are in place to break up sentences that require lengthier explanations. When sentences are too long, readers may find themselves having to reread passages. Sentences should never convey more than one point at a time. Also monitoring your articles that you write in social media through   can further enhance the visibility of your article.  Nothing helps us to better understand how to come across than to read how other authors structure theirs.Â  If you are going to write a classified ad, read other ads for ideas. Â Many new ideas can be infused into your writing by taking the time to study other authors.  Keeping readers interested to the end of a piece can be a challenge.Â  If the entire article is a string of boring statements or commands, they will quickly scan it and move on.Â  If they are actively engaged in thinking about the subject and asking themselves questions, the message has hit its mark.  If there is too much talking in the article and the main points are being buried in too many extra words, take them out.Â  Stick to the point and remove the fluff words. Much can be said with a few simple sentences.Â  It is not necessary to give a lot of descriptions about things in general unless the subject calls for it. Many times proofreading just exposes simple little mistakes that you are grateful to have caught by going back over the piece. Make sure you edit your writing as much as possible since writing can be a powerful source to  !  Nobody wants people to read an article and leave readers with the impression that they are uneducated. Make sure the message is accurately conveyed through proper spelling and punctuation.Â  Many office programs offer spell checks and correction settings for writers that make it easy to spell and punctuate correctly.  When you read with your eyes and not your voice, it is easy to miss mistakes.Â  Professional editors often read books backwards so they will not get involved in the story.Â  It is easy to pay more attention to sentence structure that way.  Using good, strong and clear language clearly illustrate exactly what you intend.Â  Action words and adjectives are a sure way to accomplish this. When authors write, they have a clear picture in their heads about what they want to convey.Â  However, without good nouns and verbs to convey it to the reader, the message can get lost in translation.Â  Take time to make sure the message is unmistakable.  The whole point of writing is to communicate.Â  Do not neglect the basic tools of writing.Â  A good dictionary will provide spelling and usage. A good thesaurus helps with using different words with the same meaning to eliminate redundancy.Â  Make sure both are updated frequently.  Writing alone can sometimes cause authors to miss things.Â  Often other people can catch things we completely missed. When we read aloud, we are looking at the words and wanting to pronounce and say things correctly.Â  It is at this time that many simple mistakes can be discovered.  Readers will appreciate every effort made by a writer to simplify the message.Â  Use the basic tips listed above and always consider your audience when writing.",Samuel Pustea

22/12/2012,http://comluv.com/7-smart-online-shopping-tips/,7 Smart Online Shopping Tips - ComLuv,"Like many consumers, youâ€™ve increasingly been using the Internet to find and make purchases. Online shopping continues to outpace traditional shopping in growth, as consumers embrace the easy price comparisons, the free or reduced shipping and the great customer service of many online destinations. Shopping online does have its pitfalls, particularly when visitors find a website that is not easily recognizable, perhaps one that is based overseas or simply has not taken the right security precautions. Read on and we will look at seven smart online shopping tips for you to consider as you navigate the Internet for the best deals.  Shopping online is easy. In some cases it is too easy. Every site you deal with should be secured, where your personal information is not easily found and shared elsewhere. A site with a â€œsecureâ€ù sockets layerâ€ù or SSL encryption in easy to find as it adds an â€œsâ€ù to the http: part of the web address rendering https. Also, when you look at lower corner or bottom of the page, you will find a closed or locked padlock. Those two things ensure that a site is safe for your use.  At checkout, there is certain information about you that a company will want and need. That information will include your name and address, a contact phone number and your credit card information. What it must NEVER include is your Social Security Number, as that 9-digit number can quickly expose you to identity theft and is information no retailer ever needs. Your birth date information is not important to retailers either and should not be shared.  Do not wait until your monthly statements arrive to check up on your purchases. Log on to your sites throughout the month to verify your purchases. If you find anything out of the ordinary, such as an unauthorized purchase, contact your credit card provider immediately. The sooner that you identify unauthorized transactions and tell your provider, the more likely youâ€™ll get  Youâ€™re active online, but are your passwords strong or are they easy to crack? You may think that your information is behind an impenetrable fortress, but crooks have a way of finding out more about you and keying in certain words to find your password. Your catâ€™s name is easy to discover and even when you add a few numbers after it, crooks can quickly break that code. Instead, use difficult passwords that even you have difficulty remembering it. Start off a password with a raised letter and mix it with numbers and letters, and if allowed, symbols. Go long, too â€” 12 characters are much more difficult to crack than 8 or fewer.  Your personal computer can expose your information for the entire world to see. Why open yourself to possible hacking when downloading security software including an anti-virus program can offer excellent protection? You will want a program that tosses trojans, squishes worms and gives bots the boot. Make sure that your program is updated too â€” renew your subscription before it runs out.  Lots of people connect to the Internet by way of a wi-fi. Your system should be private, not allowing anyone to access your information. Secure your network today and avoid using unknown public networks to make purchases. When shopping, do it at home or at the very least through a secured network at your hotel or popular coffee shop.  Expect that scam artists will be diligently at work to find different ways to fool you. If they cannot entice you through email or a web page pop up, expect even more sophisticated methods to be employed. These include a phone call from a supposed shopping site explaining to you that your order did not go through. This individual may attempt to get more information about you that can compromise your security, so do not part with those details. Also, any deal that looks too good to be true is probably just that: an empty come-on, one to be avoided at all costs. Take your time when shopping online. If you rush through a purchase, you are much more likely to make a mistake such as choosing the wrong   or, worse, expose yourself to a problem. If you are scammed, notify your local police and file a report.",Matthew Keegan

01/12/2012,http://comluv.com/commentluv-premium-will-soon-use-ioncube/,CommentLuv Premium will soon use IonCube - ComLuv,"I was supposed to be on the new payment model for CommentLuv Premium by now. but I couldnâ€™t for 2 reasonsâ€_ 1. health reasons are the main cause and also, 2. I bought a house! combine 1 and 2 and you have a recipe for arrrrggghh! Before I move everything to a new payment model with 6 monthly subscription for updates (and some really nice extras) I have to set the plugin security to use ionCube If you donâ€™t know, ionCube is a way to encode a php file so it canâ€™t be reverse engineered or nulled. You have to have the ioncube loader installed to your server but luckily, almost all decent hosting has it already. hostgator hosting has it rackspace does too and many others I tried obfuscation of the code and that works up to a point but once it has been cracked, itâ€™s basically game over unless you want to spend ages sending out DMCA notices (which Iâ€™ve done before â€“ successfully) I know it wont be popular with a few people. mainly those with cheap and nasty hosting or self built or co-located servers where there was no need for the owner to install php with ioncube included. thankfully Iâ€™ve been monitoring CommentLuv Premium stat checks for the past month and a half and the number of sites without ioncube is very small although, in most cases where ioncube isnâ€™t installed â€“ it can be! itâ€™s not a security risk and it doesnâ€™t tax the server resources so thereâ€™s no reason why a hosting provider canâ€™t install it to someones hosting. When and also monthly subscription based payment systems instead of the one big lump sum having unprotected code with these types of systems is not good if someone cracks it and it goes out on blackhat forums trust me, I monitor those forums and it constantly surprises me at how quick something appears as nulled so soon after it was released. I have issued DMCA warnings to some sites and gotten commentluv taken off and added to the â€˜donâ€™t crackâ€™ list but for the time it is up it hurts for two reasons.. 1. it means lost money! 2. more than money lost, it is dangerous because cracked or nulled versions canâ€™t get updated and any bugs or worse, vulnerabilities, wont get patched. the nulled version of commentluv that is going around has a serious security problem. I managed to fix it very quickly in the legitimate version but the nulled one still has the bug and no chance of getting it patched because, well, itâ€™s an illegal copied version. (btwâ€_no legitimate customer has the bugged version) (itâ€™s a pretty serious bug too so if you have a nulled version, expect to get your site owned by a hacker soon) First thing that I need to do is update the plugin and auto update system to not allow updating to a version that has IonCube encoded files if the server doesnâ€™t have the extension installed then I have to make sure that any auto updates from old versions that donâ€™t send the IonCube status of the server to download the non-ioncube version first. this is something I have been thinking about for quite a while and Iâ€™m pretty sure I know what to do so it is as smooth as possible to transition to the new code the work starts after the weekendâ€_ (if my hands and eyes are working properly) <- health issues!

Use a Content Management System (CMS) to take care of all the website building, so you can focus on writing your website. The most popular CMS in the world is WordPress, a free software application that can be instantly installed on most affordable website hosting plans. Of course if you are a big wig with a big budget then you cannot go wrong with a customized designed website, but for the average person, see the cheap and stress free way to get a website. WordPress works immediately â€œout of the boxâ€ùÂù. All you need to do is enter a username and password to get started. After that you can choose your website theme from hundreds of free choices (and hundreds more paid choices). Customizing themes can be done in a simple point-and-click interface. You can see more details in my   about Building a WordPress Website. The link is in my authors bio above. You donâ€™t need to spend much time choosing your website theme because you can always change it later using the same simple interface. I know people who change their theme every month. Other people never change it. I now definitely try to leave my theme alone as it might look old and boring to you, but to new visitors it still looks great! After you choose the  , you can start adding pages to your site. You can add unchanging (static) pages, blog posts, forms, images, videos, and all sorts of content to your WordPress site just by clicking a few buttons Hey, donâ€™t get me wrong here. Not all web designers are bad people but some are taking advantage of new webmasters. Website designers also use WordPress because itâ€™s free and easy to setup. Then they sell you expensive layout customization sometimes costing thousands of dollars, when in actual fact, they have used a theme that you could have purchased yourself for hundreds of dollars cheaper. Most designers have certain WordPress themes in their   ready to use on new sites. I know I even have a few developer licenses just in case I need to use a Theme on someones elses website, other than my own. But you donâ€™t need to customize your layout beyond adding your company logo (which you can do from the WordPress menu). Any professional-quality layout, like those included with WordPress, will put your customers and clients at ease. Spending extra money to create a custom layout wonâ€™t attract new customers or increase your sales-itâ€™ll just waste your money on something you donâ€™t need. Too many things on the Internet sound too good to be true, and a free content management system thatâ€™s easy to use, requires no programming, and can be set up in less than five minutes certainly sounds too good to be true. Of course there have been many   that people love to talk about, but nothing is ever related to WordPress. But the truth is that WordPress is even better than I make it sound. If you donâ€™t believe me-try it yourself for free. You can register a free account on   and create a sample blog. After you get your feet wet with WordPress, I highly recommend you buy your own hosting so you have maximum control over your business or personal website. Hosting is cheap, so you donâ€™t have to worry about losing money-plus, by choosing WordPress, youâ€™ve already saved hundreds of dollars in website design fees.",Mitz Pantic

The body can begin healing much of that damage immediately, with the proper nutrients at hand. Certain foods offer the lungs high doses of critical nutrients that allow them to remain as healthy as possible. These foods can also help the body heal certain medical conditions that affect the lungs. The list is quite extensive, but the best have a few critical components. Here are five of the top  : Fish offers vitamin D. Vitamin D seems to have a direct link to a personâ€™s lung health. A deficiency of this vitamin indicates the high possibility in loss of lung function. Fatty fish and fish oil are especially rich sources of this vitamin. Fish is also rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Those natural components offer support to the health of the entire body, including the lungs. These fatty acids also provide some protection against cancer. Carrots offer vitamin A and Vitamin C. Vitamin A has a direct link to lung health. Scientific studies show that rats with a high level of vitamin A have a lower chance of developing lung disease than those with a deficiency of this essential nutrient. Vitamin C is a powerful anti-oxidant. It also has the ability to help the lungs heal from the inside out. Scientific studies continue to show that carrots and other foods rich in vitamin C can help people avoid lung deterioration and can prevent many lung disorders. Carrots also have lycopene, falcarinol, beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, all powerful anti-cancer agents. Oranges offer Vitamin C, iron and vitamin B6. These nutrients help the lungs transfer oxygen to cells more efficiently. The Vitamin C has the same benefits from oranges as they do in carrots and other orange produce. Oranges also contain beta-cryptoxanthin, a natural anti-oxidant. This combination of nutrients makes oranges a very good food to add to your diet for lung health. Red Wine offers resveratrol. Resveratrol is a powerful anti-oxidant. Anti-oxidants help the body fight off free radicals. According to current medical theory, free radicals are a major reason for the development of cancer cells in different forms. Having a food rich in this anti-oxidant can give your lungs extra protection. Another component in red wine, pterostilbene, helps resveratrol do its job efficiently. In combination, it can make a real difference in lung health. Moderate consumption of red wine is the best option available. Onions provide vitamin C, vitamin B6, and other critical nutrients. These essential nutrients give the body all the power it needs to heal itself. They also have anti-cancer properties also. Another component in onions is quercetin, a natural anti-oxidant. That antioxidant has research behind it showing it helps prevent lung diseases including cancer. Supplements do not provide the same nutritional value as the fresh food does. It is important to take in a wide variety of foods to give your body and your lungs the nutritional support it needs.",Lawrence Reaves

19/11/2010,http://comluv.com/do-you-need-ways-to-stop-procrastination/,Do You Need Ways To Stop Procrastination? - ComLuv,"Procrastinating is bad.Â  Action is good. You must find ways to stop procrastination, right? Not necessarily. Sometimes procrastination, as the word suggests, is more of a pro than a con. I love a good wine-especially a nice aged merlot or syrah.Â  I donâ€™t know much about wine but I do know that if the winery was to make the wine and then stick it in a bottle the next day, it would taste pretty lousy.Â  Some things just take time.Â  They need to sit for awhile Take my Up From Splat website, for instance.Â  Iâ€™d been wanting to get focused on one specific project for months.Â  Iâ€™ve bounced around from this to that, but I just couldnâ€™t seem to get myself into useful motion.Â  I spent a lot of time reading novels and walking my dog â€œÂ_ procrastinating.Â  But it turns out I needed that time to let my various options age a bit so once I got an idea that inspired action, I was revved up and ready to go. Procrastination gives your ideas time to meld themselves into a workable whole. The second way procrastination helps you is it gives you time to align with your action. Any action taken out of alignment is wasted.Â  If youâ€™ve never heard of Abraham-hicks or law of attraction, alignment just means that you donâ€™t have resistance The only actions worth taking are the ones that feel really good-as in the whole of you is on board with the idea. For instance, have you ever started a diet or exercise program and gone off it right away?Â  Why couldnâ€™t you stay on the diet?Â  You werenâ€™t aligned.Â  Iâ€™ve wasted a lot of effort trying to push myself into diets when I resent the fact that I have to diet.Â  Diets work when you procrastinate long enough about losing weight that you finally let go of resistance about it.Â  When you feel positive about a weight loss plan, itâ€™s time to start action.Â  Thatâ€™s when youâ€™ll find it easy to stick with a diet. Letâ€™s say youâ€™re thinking about buying a new house.Â  You want to get started on a house hunt but you canâ€™t seem to get in motion.Â  You have no idea why youâ€™re not moving.Â  Well, what if your higher self-that part of you thatâ€™s plugged into divine knowing -knows that the right house is coming on the market next month.Â  If you push into action now, youâ€™ll miss out on your great house. Sometimes, or rather, often, the unconscious part of you knows a lot more than the conscious part. If it goes on for too long, procrastination can hold you back from reaching goals.Â  But it also can be just what you need. Doing nothing isnâ€™t always doing nothing.Â  Sometimes itâ€™s the most important thing you can be doing.Â  Sometimes the last thing you need to do is find ways to stop procrastination. So go do nothing and feel darn good about it. [easyazon-block asin=â€ù1576754227â€_ align=â€ùcenterâ€ù]",andewags

They have a subscribe to feed by email box and a big ass RSS feed button on the sidebar but those are no good to a robot computer script. All it knows is that your header is bare and thereâ€™s no feed there!. To best ensure that your sites feed is visible to all, especially CommentLuv when it comes calling, you need to insert a bit of code to your sites header. You can tell if itâ€™s there or not by viewing your blog in Firefox browser and looking for the rss icon in the address bar (top image). If itâ€™s there then you have nothing to worry about, if not, just follow the instructions below This is for adding any feed to your header if you know the url: This is for adding your default feed (the one you get automatically with your wordpress blog) Open up your themes functions.php and add this code : (thanks to @frumph for  this out",andy
