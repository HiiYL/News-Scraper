The Asus Strix GL502 is a 15.6-inch laptop that manages to go thinner and is a fair bit lighter than your average gaming notebook.Under the hood, you’ll find a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, a NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX™ 970M GPU and 16GB RAM; which can be further pumped up to 32GB if you want more speed. The notebook is also home to a 1TB hard drive, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI and one lonely USB Type-C port. As for the display, you get a 15.6-inch UHD display with in-plane switching, 178-degree viewing angle as well as a non-glare surface.As for keeping the whole rig cool, the Strix GL502 has its own copper pipe and dual fan system to keep your components chill. Not sure how loud it would be but since it keeps the CPU and GPU cool independently, definitely a bonus. Let’s not forget that the notebook also has the prerequisite backlit keys, with the ever important WASD keys highlighted.Of course, what truly makes the notebook special is its weight and girth. Weighing in at 2.2kg, the laptop is also just 23.5mm “tall”, making it quite slim as far as gaming notebooks go.The Asus Strix GL502VT is available from authorised Asus dealers and retails for RM 6,999."

Samsung’s had a similar tie-in for Avengers: Age of Ultron too, producing an iconically red, metallic Iron Man themed device, as we mentioned earlier.There isn’t much else revealed about the actual device yet, but we’re expecting it to come with lots of extra goodies like the Iron Man one, and it will probably cost just as much.No idea when it might become official either, but they’re likely to drop more hints on the phone as it nears launch.But it does at least seem to have a really swanky box with Batman’s logo on it.Injustice is about to be served. #ComingSoon @InjusticeGame @WB_Games @DCComics pic.twitter.com/4PWIpz4Ht2— Samsung Mobile (@SamsungMobile) May 24, 2016[SOURCE]"
Sponsored,5 reasons why the Wiko Robby is an attractive buy under RM500,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/26/5-reasons-why-the-wiko-robby-is-an-attractive-buy-under-rm500/,"best smartphone under rm500,budget smartphone,sponsored,wiko,wiko robby,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sponsored,Wiko",2016-05-26,"This post is brought to you by Wiko.Wiko is still pretty new in Malaysia but they are definitely not new when it comes to smartphones. For those looking for affordable smartphone alternative, they have just introduced the Wiko Robby, which aims to shake up the budget phablet segment.If you’ve got less than RM500 to spend, read on for the top 5 reasons why you should get the Wiko Robby.
The Robby is home to a pretty decent 5.5-inch IPS screen that’s larger than most smartphones in its class. The bright and colourful display pushes a HD 720p resolution that’s great for watching your favourite videos on demand.There aren’t many phones that can attest to having two front facing speakers, and even fewer that can actually perform when it comes to playing your music aloud. The Robby comes with a pair of front facing stereo speakers and you won’t even need to crank it up to maximum to hear it loud and clear. This makes it perfect for video playback with your friends watching all at once.Truth be told, we were quite surprised to find that the Robby sports a rather pleasant looking (and feeling) metal back, something rather uncommon for budget devices. The back is also removable, allowing you to replace the 2,500mAh battery if needed.Equipped with two speakers and two microphones, you can use the Robby in any orientation. No worries if you answer a voice call the “wrong side” up. With its dual-mic setup, your voice conversations are made clearer with its noise cancellation.If you’re getting a smartphone, you probably want to be running on the current version of Android. The Wiko Robby runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box and it comes with a couple of tools and features to keep your phone optimised at all times.The elaborate further on the specs, the Wiko Robby is powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core processor mated to 1GB RAM. For storage, it has 16GB onboard which you can expand it further with a microSD card. You’ll get a 5MP front selfie shooter with flash while the rear gets an 8MP camera that does HDR and shoots videos in 1080p.If you’re looking for a phone that’s big on screen and sound, the Wiko Robby at RM449 is quite an attractive buy. You’ll probably be hard pressed to find a device that offers front stereo speakers and a 5.5” screen at this price point.For more info on the Wiko Robby, be sure to head on over to Wiko’s website and Facebook page."

Often times when it comes to your smartphone experience, they can do more harm than good.But there are those rare few features that simply complete a smartphone. Lenovo’s new smartphones have exactly that and it’s called TheaterMax.TheaterMax is a feature Lenovo built into two smartphones that have hit Malaysian shores — the Vibe X3 and the K4 Note. In a nutshell, this is an application that converts everything you do on-screen into a split-screen VR Mode that is compatible with most VR headsets.There is no sophisticated head tracking or 360-degree browsing, but the resulting image that TheaterMax can conjure up is rather immersive. Think of a 60-inch TV mounted inches from your face and you will get a general idea.We’ve covered the TheaterMax technology pretty extensively in the past. So today, we’re here to find out if the smartphones themselves are any good and we’re going to do that by taking a look at the more expensive, flagship-level Vibe X3."

It will connect to your phone using Bluetooth, and will probably charge via microUSB.  It’s apparently also kinda heavy, weighing in at 300g, where an Xbox controller only measures in at about 220g.Unfortunately, we likely won’t find out a price or launch date till IFA so fingers crossed we hear more soon.[SOURCE][VIA]"

Inside it’s powered by a Snapdragon 617 processor (the same as the HTC One A9) mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD up to 128GB). It is worth noting that on China’s Samsung store, there is also a 64GB storage variant.The smartphone will be running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box and will pack a 2,600 mAh battery to keep the lights on. It also features dual-SIM support via a hybrid SIM tray.As far as camera optics are concerned, the Galaxy C5 gets a pretty decent camera setup. On the back, it sports a 16-megapixel f/1.9 aperture camera while the front receives an 8MP selfie shooter.Its larger brother, the Galaxy C7, is essentially a beefed up version of the C5 featuring a larger 5.7-inch Full HD SuperAMOLED display and a faster Snapdragon 625 processor with an Adreno 506 GPU. The larger device will also pack a bigger battery, coming in at 3,300 mAh with Quick Charge 3.0 support, and feature both a 32GB and 64GB storage variant.Both devices look pretty good with their all-metal unibody that is reminiscent of an iPhone 6/6s. Measuring at only 6.7mm thin, both the smartphones are pretty svelte too, which is nice.The Galaxy C5 will retail at RMB2,199 (around RM1,361) for the 32GB variant and RMB2,399 (RM1,485) for the 64GB variant. The larger Galaxy C7 will be priced at RMB2,599 (around RM1,610) and RMB2,799 (around RM1,733) for the 32GB and 64GB storage variant respectively. Both devices are currently only available in China and there has been no word on when these handsets will hit international markets.[SOURCE, 2, VIA, 2, 3, 4]"

This means that even in highly congested areas or high-rise buildings where mobile connectivity is poor, you can still enjoy seamless phone call connections as long as WiFi is available.U Mobile will be charging their standard domestic rates to all calls made to a Malaysian number while calls to a non-Malaysian number will be subjected to the telco’s standard IDD rates.That means, even if you’re travelling overseas, all calls you make to a Malaysian number will be charged standard domestic rates. So, if you’re on a U Mobile P70 plan, all your calls to Malaysian numbers — regardless of where you are — will be free, provided you’re on WiFi.If you want to know more about WiFi Calling, you can check out our detailed post about it here.For now, U Mobile’s WiFi Calling service is only available for the iPhone 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus smartphones on iOS 9.3 and above. However, the orange telco has said that they’re planning to roll out this service for Android users in Q3 of 2016. The good news is that this service will be available for both prepaid and postpaid lines.WiFi Calling is off by default so you will have to switch it on yourselves in the settings menu. Don’t know how to do that? Check out our step-by-step tutorial on how to switch it on.U Mobile’s WiFi Calling service will also be on High Definition Voice. As long as both parties’ smartphones have support for HD Voice, you will be able to enjoy crisp call audio too.We honestly think that this is a fantastic move by U Mobile. One of their biggest weaknesses in the past was limited network coverage (compared to the other telcos) especially in locations outside of city centres. With WiFi Calling, they’ve not only shored up that weakness but they’ve also gained an advantage over the other telcos especially in high-rise buildings, offices, commercial areas and in underground locations as long as they have WiFi connectivity.For more information on this service, head on over to U Mobile’s website."

How you ask? with something called Trust API.Simply having a strong password isn’t even enough these days, when all an unwanted visitor needs is the key (in this case, the numbers and symbols that make up your password) to get access to all your information. Trust API hopes to eliminate that by only allowing your phone to function at its fullest only if it recognises you as the owner.How Trust API works is that it uses a variety of metrics to calculate a “Trust Score” from information collected from the phone. After all, a phone is full of different sensors, and Trust API intends to use them.The collected information will include things like proximity to familiar WiFi hotspots, Bluetooth devices, facial recognition, location, typing speed and even vocal patterns. Low risk apps like games and basic tools wouldn’t need a high trust score, but banking apps would need a pretty high trust score allow you access.So in practice, if your phone “recognises you” only then will you be able to use it in its entirety. Which means you probably won’t be able to lend your device to a friendGoogle hopes that Trust API will be rolled out by the end of 2016, and passwords might become a thing of the past.But the question is, how effective do you think this would be if compared to say, fingerprint recognition? let us know in the comments.[SOURCE][VIA]"

Alexander Wong,Meet Pebble’s latest smartwatches with 24/7 heart rate monitoring,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/25/meet-pebbles-latest-smartwatches-with-247-heart-rate-monitoring/,"kickstarter,pebble,pebble 2,pebble core,pebble core hacker,pebble smartwatch,pebble time 2,smartwatch,smart watch",Smart Watch,2016-05-25,"In the face of modern smart watches, Pebble is making a comeback with its new wearables for 2016. Sticking to its core of making simple, functional and long lasting smartwatches, they have just introduced its new Pebble 2 and Time 2. These are the successors of the original Pebble smartwatch and their current Pebble Time.  In addition, they have also announced the Pebble Core, which is a tiny keychain device that does a lot more than just activity tracking.  The current Pebble smartwatches are already capable of activity and sleep tracking. To take fitness up to the next level, the new Pebble 2 and Time 2 now comes with heart rate monitoring along with its new updated health tools. This includes a new Adaptive Goals feature that creates actionable goals to keep you motivated. Pebble Health also syncs with your calendar and will automatically reschedule your fitness activities if there are sudden changes to your schedule. Also new is a revamped mobile graph that displays your activity, sleep and heart rate throughout the day. The Pebble 2 is their base smartwatch model that’s priced from US$99 (about RM406.50). Like the original, it gets a black and white e-paper display with an awesome battery life up to 7 days. It’s also water resistant up to 30 metres and there’s also a built-in mic for voice replies. In terms of design, it still features a plastic body with a rubber strap. If you’ve used a Pebble before, the usability appears to be unchanged with a left mounted back button along with the typical up/down and select buttons on the right. Colour wise, the Pebble 2 comes in Flame, Aqua, Black, White and Lime. If you pledge the Pebble 2 now, it is expected to ship sometime in September this year. If you’re looking for something better, the Pebble Time 2 gets a colour E-paper display and it’s 53% larger than its predecessor giving you twice the amount of text viewable on-screen. The Pebble Time 2 is more premium with marine grade stainless steel and it comes with a longer 10-day battery life on a single charge.In terms of features, the Time 2 also gets the same fitness and sleep tracking, 24/7 heart rate monitoring, 30M water resistance and a built-in microphone. Available in Gold, Black and Silver, the Pebble Time 2 can be yours from US$169 (about RM693.92) and it will start shipping in November 2016.The Core is probably the most interesting device announced by Pebble today. In a nutshell, this is a tiny smart device that tracks your activity, plays streaming music and it even gets GPS and 3G connectivity. So if you’re going for a jog, not only it tracks your pace but you can also stream Spotify music from the internet without carrying a smartphone with you. You can also store offline music onto its built-in 4GB of storage. In case of an emergency, the Pebble Core can send out an SMS with your current GPS location at a push of a button. The Core connects via WiFi and 3G via a microSIM slot. For music playback, you can either plug in a wired headphone or pair it with a bluetooth headset. Despite its small size, the Core can last up to a week and you can charge it via USB or with a wireless charging that’s sold separately. For the adventurous, the Core is also a hackable tiny computer that you can customise to your heart’s desire. Since it has GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, 3G and a microphone, you can possibly turn it into a pet tracker, a walkie-talkie, a remote switch or even program one of its buttons to request an Uber with a single tap. All these will be made possible with an SDK that Pebble is releasing soon.The Pebble Core is scheduled to be shipped by January 2017 and you can back this device from $69 (about RM283.32).At time of writing, Pebble has already smashed its US$1,000,000 goal target by almost 200%. Want to support these new wearables? You can start pledging over at Kickstarter. They do ship to Malaysia but you’ll need to pay for international shipping."

Rory Lee,"The Xiaomi Mi Drone is official, 4K video recording for below RM2,000",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/25/the-xiaomi-mi-drone-is-official-4k-video-recording-for-below-rm2000/,"mi drone official,xiaomi,xiaomi mi drone,cool stuff,mobile accessories,others","Cool stuff,Mobile Accessories,Others,Xiaomi",2016-05-25,"Drones tend to be incredibly costly and as a result are mostly for serious hobbyists or the more wealthy among us. If you wanted to pick up a solid drone that can shoot 4K you will have to be prepared to pony up.So, if we want more accessible drones, who could we possibly turn to who has a track record for producing some seriously awesome products at incredibly affordable prices? Yep, Xiaomi, and the great news is that they’re doing drones now.Meet the Xiaomi Mi Drone. It’s the company’s first stab at creating these unmanned aerial cameras and it honestly doesn’t look too bad. Sure, it may not be as good looking as something like the sexy DJI Inspire One, but it’s sleek enough to not be ugly.There are two specifications to the Mi Drone. The first one shoots in 1080p via a 16-megapixel Sony backside illuminated CMOS camera with a 104-degree angle lens. If you want a higher resolution, the Mi Drone also has a variant that’s equipped with a 12-megapixel camera that shoots 4K video and can shoot stills in RAW format.Xiaomi’s Mi Drone also has a host of sophisticated features to make sure it is as easy to fly as possible. These include a number of smart flight controls, autopilot, automatic take-off, landing and return home functions.The Mi Drone also has built-in GPS and GLONASS support to allow for accurate positioning and safer flights. In the absence of a satellite connection, the drone can use vision positioning instead. This allows the drone to hover by itself at low altitudes (below 2.5m).To make sure you fly safe and area in control of your drone, the Mi Drone has four layers of security:1. Real-time location tracking for easy drone recovery
2. Real-time computing power to intelligently detect and allow the drone to automatically return home when its battery runs low
3. Automatic hovering at the edge of no-fly zones
4. A remote control with a PCB antenna array for a flight distance of up to 3kmXiaomi is quoting the drone’s flight time (with its 5,200 mAh battery) to be 27 minutes on a single charge. That’s pretty good even when compared to the more expensive DJI Phantom 4 which has a quoted flight time of 28 minutes.The 1080p variant of the Xiaomi Mi Drone will be crowd funded on the Mi Home app beginning tomorrow (26th May 2016) for RMB2,499 (around RM1,561). For RMB2,999 (around RM1,873), you can pick up the 4K Mi Drone instead, but that won’t be going on sale yet. Instead, Xiaomi will be putting the drone up for an open beta test programme come late July.[SOURCE]"

Rory Lee,Flash Plus 2 — Have we found the Redmi Note 3 killer?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/24/flash-plus-2-have-we-found-the-redmi-note-3-killer/,"alcatel,alcatel flash,android,android marshmallow,budget smartphone,flash plus 2,flash plus 2 malaysia,onetouch,smartphone,smartphone below rm1000,alcatel onetouch,mobile devices,mobile os","Alcatel,Alcatel OneTouch,Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-05-24,"Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 3 is a fantastic device. It is one of the best smartphones under RM1,000 that you can buy in Malaysia right now. A deadly combination of a premium metal construction and killer specs makes this a formidable device at its low price point.Challengers for the Redmi Note 3 were hard to come by because of the sheer value this device offered. However, we were rather impressed when Flash announced their new Flash Plus 2 budget smartphone that seemed to bank on that same formula.It has finally been officially launched in Malaysia, so the only question left is: Can it stand up to the Redmi Note 3? Well, we had a brief hands-on with the device to try and find out.One of the Flash Plus 2’s biggest selling point is the fact that it comes with a metal body. On the surface, it looks really good and has a rather premium finish. The back plate is shiny and has a hairline brushed look and feel to it that is very reminiscent to the more expensive honor 5X.It feels pretty good in the hand as the subtle chamfers and curves at the back allow the phone to sit in your palm effortlessly. However, once you pry open the removable metal back, you will be greeted by more plastic than you would probably like.In order to make the back removable, Flash had to wrap the edges of their metal back plate in plastic. We suspect that’s because metal isn’t as flexible or snappy as plastic so having a metal frame that pries open wouldn’t be very practical.Honestly, I think Flash should have just stuck with a metal unibody design as the removable back doesn’t really serve a major purpose aside from letting you swap between the two available covers. You can’t replace the battery and trays can be made for the microSD and dual-SIM cards. Instead, their decision has left nothing but a chink in the armour of their solid build.But, that’s not all. I have one last issue with the Flash Plus 2’s exterior and that’s with the power button placement. It perplexes me that Flash decided to place their power button near the top of the 5.5-inch smartphone instead of towards the middle of the device. My fingers aren’t particularly long so reaching that button was definitely a stretch.Let’s talk about performance now. When it comes to specs, the device sports a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS panel on the front with a MediaTek Helio P10 processor mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage running on the inside. The good news is that you can expand that storage with the dedicated microSD card slot.From what I could tell, performance was smooth, but not particularly snappy. I think that could be down to the Flash Plus 2’s relatively stock Android Marshmallow experience. The lack of bloatware was a welcomed sight and I’ve always been a sucker for vanilla’s clean good looks.In terms of the camera, the Flash Plus 2 comes with a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear shooter with Mixed Autofocus and a RealTone LED flash. On the front, it’s got a 5-megapixel selfie with a dedicated front-facing LED flash to help out in low light.Camera performance in the poorly lit venue was far from impressive as images turned out grainy without much detail even in the well-lit portions of the photo. Not its strongest feature then.What the Flash Plus 2 does well, though, is its battery. Inside, keeping the lights on is a 3,000 mAh battery with support for fast charging. The best part is that Flash includes a 9V/1.67A fast-charging brick out of the box too, so you won’t have to purchase an additional one from them.The Flash Plus 2 also features a front-mounted fingerprint sensor that sits beneath its rather stiff home button. This sensor comes with 360-degree fingerprint detection and can supposedly unlock the device in just 0.5 seconds. We were unable to test this feature, however.Flash has also included an NXP9890 audio amplifier and AKM4375 Decoding chips for clean and loud audio.For all of that, the Flash Plus 2 will retail at RM599 and can be preordered from Lazada in one of two colours — Luna Silver or Venus Gold. There is also a higher spec version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage that retails at RM729, but that device will not be available until mid-June.The short answer? No. Not for me at least. There are certain aspects of the Flash Plus 2 that I really like over the Redmi Note 3, like a proper fast-charger, the lower price tag and most importantly the stock Android Marshmallow experience. But, all things considered, I would rather pony up the extra to get what I think is the better phone overall.Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 3 simply has a much snappier smartphone experience thanks to a more powerful Snapdragon 650 processor and although I gave the Redmi Note 3 a lot of flak for their mediocre camera performance, it’s noticeably better than the Flash Plus 2’s.The Redmi Note 3 is also built better thanks to its unibody design. It’s more robust and feels nicer in the hand. I really feel that Flash shot themselves in the foot when going with a removable cover because they compromised what could have been a phone with a great build quality.For a budget smartphone, the Redmi Note 3 is definitely still the top choice if you can spare the extra RM100+ for it. But, if you simply can’t afford the difference, the Flash Plus 2 is definitely a solid device worth considering."

It looked absolutely magnificent with its gloriously thin profile and slick shiny keyboard. Unfortunately, the smartphone has made it so that there is no place in this world for a Motorola Razr anymore…Or is there?Motorola recently dropped a bomb of a teaser video which features a trifecta of nostalgic music (Boys Like Girls in their heyday), high school and of course the iconic Motorola Razr. Check it out!Ending on a simple TTYL just sells it for me. The question now is, what does this mean?Sure, Motorola has had some success with their Moto X smartphones but they never really had the impact a Razr did. The trailer seems to suggest that the Lenovo-owned brand is trying to revive their legendary Motorola Razr in some form.Perhaps it could be a smartphone in a flip phone’s body (sort of like the Samsung Galaxy Golden) or a new line of smartphones under the Razr branding. One big hint is the way the video’s end title appeared on the screen. Will we see a return of the T9 Numpad to Motorola’s next smartphone?At this point, all of this is just speculation. The good news is that we have a date, 9th June 2016. That’s about two weeks from now, so I guess we’ll find out then. I don’t know about you, but I’m super hyped for this.[SOURCE, VIA]"

With the music streaming service, I get access to all the music I need without the hassle. Things become even sweeter with Spotify Premium, but RM14.90/month can be a little difficult to swallow sometimes.Well, Spotify is now making it cheaper to own a Spotify Premium plan with their all new Spotify Family Plan.In the past, Spotify’s Family Plan’s charges depended on the number of family members you had on your account. The more members you had, the more expensive your total monthly obligation.Now, Spotify is introducing a new flat rate of RM22.40 for up to 6 individual Spotify Premium accounts. This means that if you can get 6 people to sign up for a plan with you, you can bring the monthly cost of a Spotify Premium cost to about RM3.73.If you’re already on a Spotify Family Plan, you won’t lose anything. Instead, you will be charged the new updated price from your next payment date onwards. You will also get to add more members to the same plan.For people who are constantly changing devices or are often on the go, Spotify is an awesome service to keep your favourite artists and playlists with you. Spotify becomes almost infinitely better when you pick up a premium account as you unlock the ability to play music offline and to listen to higher quality audio files. Oh, and how could I forget the fact that you won’t have to put up with those insufferable adverts with a premium account either."

They’re pretty cool and nifty, given the right circumstances, but for most of us, it’s more of a want than a need.Lenovo recently launched their Pocket Projector here in Malaysia and it’s exactly as the name suggests — a pocket-sized projector. So, if you want/need a pico projector, is this the one you get? Well, I spent a weekend with it high in the mountains to find out.When I first saw this little projector, I was quite taken with it. It looked adorable, sort of like an old-school video game controller from the future. Picking it up, I noticed the fairly good build quality with its robust hinge plus interesting colour combination.The device is split into two parts: The projection half which is black and textured to the touch and the base half which is smooth and houses a D-pad as well as buttons to switch it on and off at the back.Still, it remains fairly light and portable. That said, when Lenovo called this a Pocket Projector, I really wonder what kind of pocket they were thinking of because this thing did not fit into my jeans pockets.Army standard issue cargo pants perhaps?Nevertheless, this is a handsome looking device. Leave it on a table and people will definitely ask you about it even before you turn it on.Once you do turn it on, you’ll be greeted with a screen that shows you a whole bunch of connectivity options which you can navigate to via the D-pad. You can also adjust where you want to project by raising or lowering the projection half and the screen will orient itself automatically.Setting up is easy as the Pocket Projector supports WiFi connectivity and is compatible with Android, Windows 10 and iOS/Mac operating systems. When I brought it with me, I streamed video via Miracast which worked pretty well.There were occasional stutters and I would sometimes get a laggy playback, but for the most part it worked fine.I mean that in the most literal of senses. A couple of minutes into the stream, the projector can build up a lot of heat in its little body. It does have a dedicated fan to try and keep it cool, but if you’re one episode into your Game of Thrones marathon, I wouldn’t advise that you touch the metallic side panels.But, that’s to be expected as projectors do run very hot and since I didn’t notice any performance issues because of the heat, I’m not really complaining."

As the renders are based on technical drawings, all the functional elements like buttons and camera placement are where they should be.For starters, the cutouts for the antennas at the back look a little different, and the camera still isn’t going to be flush with the device. Sorry guys, there’s still gonna be a bump for now. Another thing that’s interesting to note that there are two grilles at the bottom of the iPhone 7, much like on the iPhone 5s. The return of the grilles might signify stereo speakers, but that’s anyone’s guess at this point.On top of that, it seems that the 3.5mm audio jack has gone missing.Rumours also have it that the iPhone 7 could be waterproof and have a touch home button, but we’ll have to wait till official info makes it out to confirm those claims. Till then, we can only wait till the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus make their debut this Fall.[SOURCE]"
Rory Lee,Huawei reveals the official Malaysian price of the Huawei P9 and P9 Lite,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/20/huawei-reveals-the-official-malaysian-price-of-the-huawei-p9-and-p9-lite/,"android,huawei,huawei malaysia,huawei p9,huawei p9 lite,huawei p9 lite price malaysia,huawei p9 malaysia,huawei p9 price malaysia,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os,promotions","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Promotions",2016-05-20,"At long last, we have a price for the highly anticipated Huawei P9 that is due to arrive on our shores next week. Huawei is also throwing in a bonus for those who are planning to preorder this brand new device.Huawei’s P9 has been the talk of the town for quite some time because of its Leica certified camera optics. The smartphone comes with a 5.2-inch Full HD display that’s tucked under 2.5D glass. Inside, it’s packing a homegrown Kirin 955 octa-core processor mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage.But, the star of the show lies in the dual 12-megapixel f/2.2 cameras, co-engineered with Leica, mounted on the back of the smartphone. What makes this dual-camera setup special is the fact that one has an RGB sensor while the other is monochrome. This gives the P9 a better low-light performance thanks to the monochrome sensor’s high sensitivity to light.But that’s not all. Besides improving low-light performance and providing better contrast in regular images, the dedicated monochrome sensor also allows for fantastic black and white images that are rich in detail and have stunning contrast.Of course, a partnership with one of the most recognisable names in photography doesn’t just stop there. The Huawei P9’s dual-cameras also get a pair of Leica Summarit H 1:2.2/27 lenses (f/2.2 with a 27mm focal length). On the front, the P9 also sports an 8MP selfie shooter that’s very similar to the Nexus 6P. To find out more about Huawei’s P9 and its cameras, check out our camera shootout with some of the best smartphone cameras in the world right now.Keeping the lights on in the Huawei P9 is a 3,000 mAh battery that charges up via a USB Type-C port.Huawei isn’t just bringing in the P9, though, they’re also bringing in the lower-spec Huawei P9 Lite which packs a Kirin 650 processor mated to 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. It also loses the fancy Leica dual-camera setup, opting for a 13MP/8MP primary and selfie camera combo instead. it also loses the USB Type-C port, opting instead for a microUSB one.However, it does still get the 3,000 mAh battery and 5.2-inch Full HD display only, this time, it’s encased in a plastic body, opposed to the metal one that the P9 has. Both smartphones will still come running Android Marshmallow with Huawei’s EMUI 4.1 running on top. For now, there is no information on when the P9 Plus will be making it to Malaysia.The Huawei P9 will go on sale for RM2,099 while the P9 Lite will retail for RM1,099. Both the smartphones will be available on the 28th of May 2016, but Huawei is letting you pre-order the P9 on Vmall.my on the 23rd of May. If you’re planning to pre-order, be sure to hurry as the first 10 customers who order and fulfill the payment from the 23-27 of May will receive a free honor Band Z1 worth RM269.Huawei’s P9 will come in three colours — Prestige Gold, Titanium Grey and Mystic Silver — while the P9 Lite will be available in Black, White and Gold.Want to know if these smartphones are any good?

The Galaxy C5 has popped by China’s TENAA certification and it looks like a mid-range device with a premium build. Unlike the Galaxy A (2016) series that has a glass back, the Galaxy C5 has a unibody metal construction along with a familiar antenna band lines at the rear. According to the listed spec-sheet, the Galaxy C5 has a 5.2″ Full HD AMOLED display and it is likely to be powered by a Snapdragon 617 Octa-Core processor. It gets a generous 4GB of RAM along with a generous storage option of 32GB or 64GB which is expandable with microSD. For cameras, it gets a 16MP rear unit along with a large 8MP front shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 2,600mAh battery which is quite small, but at least it’s larger than the HTC One A9 (2150mAh).

BOXiT, is here to help fix that.In a nutshell, BOXiT is a parcel locker service that allows you to pick up your parcel at your own leisure, and not have to worry about the postman arriving when there’s no one at home.How BOXiT works, is you buy an item online (from selected online merchants) and the parcel will be delivered to one of the BOXiT storage spaces in one of the participating 7-Eleven outlets in the Klang Valley. When your parcel arrives and is stored in the locker, you will receive an SMS with your locker pin code. All you need to do after that is head on over to the locker and pick up your goodies.And since 7-Eleven is open 24/7, you can pick up the items whenever you’re free to do so (within a certain preset timeframe of course). Merchants can also rent the storage to store goods beforehand so that customers can immediately collect it from the lockers on purchase.The same system can be used for refunds and returns as well.Currently, BOXiT has 20 lockers and locations set to begin service, with plans to increase it up to 100 by the end of Q4. At the moment, the lockers are only available to online merchants like Lazada and can be rented out by said e-Commerce sites as collection points for their customers. There’s also plans for a consumer based platform called BOXiT2Me, where users can subscribe to it as a service where people can use it as an alternative PO box for the collection of parcels.Doesn’t look like you can store large items in it though, as the majority of drawers look reasonably small. BOXiT will launch in the first week of June, with full deployment of the lockers to occur over the next 3-4 months.So do you think BOXiT would be a hit? let us know in the comments."

This sophisticated metal construction gives it “super strength and durability” so it looks like the bag can take a beating.Weighing in at 4.4kg (dimensions 550x375x215mm), the 90 Points Smart Suitcase is pretty similar to this one from Rimowa. However, as it’s being priced at only CNY1,999 (around RM1,240) it’s significantly cheaper than the GBP560 (around RM3,300) Rimowa.It’s also smarter as this bag has support for Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity. This means that you can connect your suitcase to your Android 4.4+ or iOS 7.0+ device and remotely lock or unlock it with an app. The lock is also TSA approved so you can rest easy if you’re travelling to the United States.What’s more, the Smart Suitcase has a 4 stage adjustable handle made of ultra-quiet aircraft-grade aluminum alloy rods. This product is part of Xiaomi’s Mi Ecosystem (Mi Jia) which also has a smart rice cooker and air purifier on their roster among other things.This isn’t the first suitcase Xiaomi has produced under the 90 Points brand but this is the first one made of metal as the previous had polycarbonate shells. Do keep in mind that neither of those bags have made it out of China so it’s uncertain if this will.[SOURCE, VIA]"

The teaser, which looks like Doraemon’s little helicopter gizmo, doesn’t let on much on its own. But Xiaomi also accidently released their drone app early, which reveals that it could shoot in 4K, as well as be home to its own camera. This makes it pretty similar to DJI drones which also come with an inbuilt shooter.Xiaomi also has patents that show that the drone will be controllable via a wearable (which looks like some kind of Mi Band) and gesture controls. The diagrams also show a sketch of a drone but we’re not sure if this is what the drone will ultimately look like.

We’re not sure how high-end Xiaomi’s drone will be, but the fact that it might shoot 4K hints that it might not be a simple consumer drone. No real word on when it will launch but we’re hoping that its onboard camera would be something like the YI Action Camera.[SOURCE][VIA]"

While Xiaomi isn’t a stranger to set-top-boxes, this marks the company’s first Android TV-powered device and will be available to consumers in the US and other global markets.The Mi Box is capable of streaming 4K UHD video at 60 frames per second with support for the latest HDR10 standard (to be enabled from Android N onwards) and an updated HDMI 2.0a specification. In terms of hardware, the Mi Box is packing a quad-core ARM Cortex A53 CPU, 2GB of GDDR3 RAM and 8GB of eMMC flash.You will also be able to speak to the Mi Box via a Bluetooth remote control that supports voice search and commands much like you would be able to with Apple TV. With this voice command feature, you can directly access any and all content that is readily available in Android TV’s extensive libraries including Google Play for Android.What’s more, the Mi Box will have support for Google Cast so that you can easily cast content from your mobile device to your TV. With this support, it’s likely that the Mi Box will also be able to integrate with Google Home.For those who want a proper gaming experience, there is the Mi Game Controller that has the looks of a PlayStation 4 controller but has a button layout that is similar to an Xbox controller. It will not only work with the Mi Box but also any Android device.For now, there is no word on pricing and availability, but Xiaomi says that those details will be revealed soon."

The device quietly appeared on its official site alongside its siblings and is pretty much their slightly smaller little brother.Positioned as the entry-level model of the series, the Moto G4 Play is not only smaller in size than its siblings, but also features a totally different set of specs under the hood.For starters, the Moto G4 Play is home to a 5-inch 720p screen, with a Snapdragon 410 mated to 2GB RAM running the show. You also get 16GB internal storage that’s expandable up to 128GB via microSD card.As for the camera, you’ll be getting an 8MP rear snapper (as opposed to the G4’s 13MP shooter)  along with a 5MP front shooter. Both cameras have f/2.2 wide angle lenses. You do get a relatively large battery however, clocking in at 2,800mAh, we forsee this phone will be pretty good in the battery life department.You also get Android 6.0.1 out of the box, which should be pretty clutter free.The official pricing hasn’t yet been revealed, but the release date is set for mid-Summer 2016, so we should be seeing it pretty soon.[SOURCE][VIA]"

If you’re a U Mobile customer, those days could soon be over as they are introducing WiFi Calling next week.As the name suggests, WiFi Calling or VoWiFi (Voice over WiFi) lets you make and receive phone calls as well as SMS through a WiFi connection. This allows you to stay connected in places where there’s poor mobile connectivity. It could be in a basement, in a dense high-rise building or even at underground subway stations where WiFi is available. You can watch Vodafone’s video above for a better idea. To use WiFi Calling, you would need a compatible device and a WiFi connection. Most high-end smartphones from the Samsung Galaxy S5 or iPhone 5C and above are already supported. Once available, you would need to enable WiFi calling under your phone settings and for iOS users, you might need to download a carrier software update to have that option. There’s no difference in terms of usage and your call charges should remain the same. What should be noticeable is that you won’t need to hunt for signal strength whenever you make a phone call at home. Apart from U Mobile, Digi too has plans to roll out VoWiFi this year. U Mobile’s WiFi Calling launch event is happening next Thursday, 26 May so stay tuned for more details.UPDATE: Apparently U Mobile’s WiFi Calling feature is now available for iOS users.

Xiaomi did take their own stab at it last year, with sneakers embedded with sensors and phone connectivity but they generally just counted your steps.How it works is the shoes are Bluetooth enabled and will connect to your smartphone. When you crank open a navigation app, small motors embedded in each shoe will vibrate to steer you the right way; your left shoe will buzz when you need to turn left and vice versa. It will also warn you when you’re heading off course or when you’ve arrived at your end point.We’re not sure how accurate they are though, like if you were facing the wrong direction or trying to navigate indoors; especially when location tracking indoors tends to be kinda wonky. But it definitely seems like EasyJet is onto something as this would allow travellers to easily traverse without too much danger of getting lost.EasyJet is still working on making the battery life go beyond three hours and researching into the development of an insole that can be placed in your existing shoes.We personally think it’s a pretty cool piece of future tech, do you think this would prove useful to travellers if they become commercial? let us know in the comments.[SOURCE][VIA]"
Rory Lee,Google’s Daydream wants to improve mobile VR more than ever before,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/19/google-daydream-mobile-virtual-reality-android-n/,"android n,android n vr,google,google daydream,google i/o 2016,google vr,mobile virtual reality,smartphone,virtual reality,virtual reality headset,vr headset,vr remote,android,cool stuff,mobile apps,mobile os","Android,Cool stuff,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-05-19,"In their I/O Google pretty much confirms the earlier rumours that Android N will have greater support for Virtual Reality (VR) than any other Android version. In fact, Google has come up with an entirely new support platform and it’s called Daydream.Daydream is basically Google’s platform for high quality, mobile virtual reality, and the best part is that it comes with Google-designed headset and controller.Yup, apparently everyone has been doing VR headsets and controllers wrong so Google is stepping in. The search engine giant has released what they’re calling a reference design for both the headset and the controller which they will use to work closely with their partners across the Android ecosystem. The best part? The first of these headsets and controllers will be arriving this fall and they will work seamlessly with what Google calls “Daydream-ready smartphones”.Google’s VR controller looks impressive if you can look past its TV remote looks. It seems to work like a sophisticated Wii controller allowing users to point, gesture, flick and move stuff within virtual reality.That aside, what is a Daydream-ready smartphone? With Android N, Google is baking in more support for VR than ever before, including a dedicated VR Mode that lets notifications appear more naturally within a VR UI as well as a greatly reduced latency (under 20 milliseconds).So, smartphones that are Daydream-ready are smartphones that have sensors that are powerful enough for accurate head-tracking, displays have fast response times to minimise blur and powerful mobile processors. Think of Steam and their VR-ready PCs and you’ll get a general idea.According to Google, several smartphone manufacturers including Samsung, Huawei, ZTE, ASUS, Alcatel, Xiaomi and HTC will have Daydream-ready smartphones and many of which will be available this fall.But VR is only as good as their apps, so Google is working with sites like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, HBO and IMAX to bring their libraries and news to Daydream so you can experience their content like never before.Google are also working with game developers like Ubisoft, EA, CCP and more to create games that can take advantage of all the new juicy VR features Google has placed into Android N.Google has also optimised many of their apps for VR including a special Google Play app store. They’ve also rebuilt the YouTube app to allow users to experience VR on the video streaming site like never before, including spatial audio and improved VR video streaming. Google Photos and Google Play Movies have also been tweaked to give users unique VR experiences.Things are looking pretty good for Android N and mobile VR this fall."
Rory Lee,"Android Wear 2.0 — standalone apps, improved fitness and more!",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/19/android-wear-2-0-standalone-apps-improved-fitness-and-more/,"android,android wear,android wear 2,google,google i/o 2016,smartwatch,mobile accessories,mobile devices,mobile os,smart watch","Android,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Smart Watch",2016-05-19,"Smartwatches are nifty little devices that have mostly functioned as extensions of your smartphone. While that can be useful, it also means that your smartwatches are often nothing more than watches when you leave your smartphone behind.Google wants to change that with Android Wear 2.0, giving smartwatches more independence to be smart.Android Wear was never the best watch operating system in the market as it had many limitations and relies heavily on your smartphone to do the heavy lifting. With Android Wear 2.0, Google is putting that power back in the watch, giving it more customisability and freedom than ever before.Perhaps the biggest update isthat Android Wear 2.0 now supports standalone apps. In other words, the apps on your smartwatch can have direct access to the cloud and will not need a smartphone to function properly. This eliminates one of Android Wear’s biggest weaknesses and should allow for a much better smartwatch experience.Google also focused on three key aspects during the development of Android Wear 2.0. The first is Android Wear’s watch face, followed by messaging and finally fitness.The Android OS as we know and love has always been one that gave you the freedom to customise your device the way you see fit. With Android Wear, that meant you could choose from thousands of watch faces and make your Android Wear watch look exactly the way you wanted.One big limitation was the fact that information that could be displayed on each watch face was decided by the creator of that watch face, not the end user. With Android Wear 2.0, Google is letting any watch face show any data from any app so you can mix and match as you see fit.Next, Google tries their hand at tackling smartwatch messaging, or the biggest problem with smartwatch messaging — typing on that tiny screen. The end result? Well, Google is giving you three different input modes, powered by Google’s machine learning, so you can pick the one that best suits you.The first of these inputs is the Smart Reply. This input method understands the context of your message and prepares several appropriate responses. Handwriting, on the other hand, lets you scribble on your smartwatch’s display (like you would with a stylus) with your finger to write out specific replies. Finally, there’s a more conventional keyboard with swipe support that gets better the more you use it.Last, but certainly not least, we arrive at fitness. Fitness tracking is growing increasingly important when it comes to smart wearables, evident by the popularity of devices from manufacturers like FitBit. Android Wear 2.0, has far greater support for fitness which includes a new automatic activity recognition feature.Automatic activity recognition on Android Wear 2.0 works very similarly to what we’ve seen from FitBit where the watch automatically detects if you’re in a workout and starts tracking it without any input from the user. The Google Fit app also supports data exchange with other fitness apps via its API, allowing data to sync across applications. So, information like calories consumed in one nutrition app can sync with calories burnt in another fitness app.But the thing that will probably get the most people excited is that now, thanks to Android Wear 2.0’s support for standalone apps, you can stream music from your watch with an app like Spotify without needing to bring your smartphone with you.These improvements in Android Wear 2.0 will undoubtedly benefit smartwatches with cellular support (like the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE) as it can turn your smartwatch into a capable secondary device by itself. This could be the sign manufacturers need to put more effort into developing smartwatches with cellular connectivity to take full advantage of what Android Wear 2.0 has to offer.While Android Wear 2.0 will only start rolling out in the fall, developers can now download a preview version of the OS from the Android Developer website."
Rory Lee,Google unveils its most personal assistant yet — Google Home,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/19/google-io-home-assistant/,"amazon echo,google,google assistant,google home,google i/o,google i/o 2016,home assistant,internet of things,iot,smart home,android,mobile os","Android,Mobile OS",2016-05-19,"Google unveils their take on the home personal assistant — Google Home. It is a fully voice controlled hub that lets you enjoy music and entertainment throughout your entire house, manage everyday tasks and ask Google what you want to know.Essentially, it’s Google’s own take on home voice assistants like Amazon’s Echo. Much like the Echo, Google Home also takes the form of a little cylindrical device that kind of looks like an air humidifier.Google says that the Home is essentially a WiFi speaker that builds on the experiences that the search engine giant has gained with their Chromecast Audio and voice recognition software. It will also allow users to communicate with it from anywhere in the home simply by using your voice.This means, in addition to asking Google Home to play music, you can also cast your music to Home via the Google Cast app. Google Cast support also allows you to hook up and control multiple speakers or televisions in your home without a complicated setup. So, for example, if you wanted to play music to your living room speakers, just tell Google Home that and it will do it for you.Google Home also brings Google’s assistant into your home, allowing you to manage daily tasks like setting the thermostat, setting an alarm, and even control switches. In the future, Google also wants to work with developers to allow Google Home to do much more like ordering a car or having dinner delivered to your doorstep.Additionally, it also has Google Search built-in. This means that you can ask Google anything from anywhere in your home much like you would with your Android smartphone.The only difference is that Google Home will not only search, it is also supposed to understand context and give more depth in conversations allowing you to ask follow-up questions in a more natural manner. Google says that Home will also learn from you, with your permission, allowing it to improve the way it helps you over time.Google says that this Home assistant is set to launch by the end of this year though they didn’t mention when exactly it would arrive. It looks mighty impressive in their video demo, but that’s just a demo and demos usually look impressive. We’re definitely interested to see how well this would perform in real-world scenarios.What do you guys think about Google Home?"

If your company has a need for speed, Maxis has revamped its Business Fibre offering with speeds up to 100Mbps. For greater reliability, it’s also backed by a zero downtime proposition.  To ensure 24/7 uptime, Maxis is including a wireless backup connection which you can use when your fixed connectivity is unavailable. The Business Fibre plans are available in either dynamic or fixed IP, but the zero downtime feature is only available on the dynamic IP package. Similar to its home fibre broadband plans, speeds on Maxis are symmetrical, so you get the same upload speeds as your downloads. Depending on your business requirements, Business Fibre on dynamic IP starts from 8Mbps at RM196.20/month and it goes all the way up to RM788/month for its highest 100Mbps plan. For those requiring fixed IP, the plan starts at RM188/month for 4Mbps and it tops off at RM971.60/month for 100Mbps. If you need more IP addresses, it will cost you RM500 per year for five. For greater value, Maxis is offering a slight discount on your broadband fees if you sign up together with MaxisONE Business or FlexiShare postpaid plans that comes with unlimited free calls within Malaysia. All plans are tied with a 24-month contract and there’s a one-time installation cost of RM200 which will be charged to your first bill. UPDATE: Maxis has reached out to us to clarify that users no longer need to call 1512 to activate the wireless broadband. This means the backup wireless connectivity will kick in automatically for a true zero downtime experience. They have also rounded up the monthly subscription to the next ringgit. The new Maxis Business Fibre 100Mbps plan is cheaper than their previous highest offering at 32Mbps. The 32Mbps fibre broadband option used to cost RM498/month for dynamic IP and RM988/month for fixed IP. The backup wireless broadband service is a nice add-on to ensure business continuity but do note that it only works when your broadband service is down and you would need to call Maxis HelpDesk at 1-800-82-1512 to activate it.

Pre-order starts 3PM on 24 May at Lazada Malaysia. The higher spec 3GB RAM + 32GB storage model is coming mid-June at RM729.The budget smartphone market is going to be heating up again as the brand new Flash Plus 2 has just been announced. It’s a budget smartphone with a metal replaceable back and a set of pretty impressive specifications considering the price.Kicking things off, the Flash Plus 2 is a 5.5-inch smartphone with a full-HD display mounted on the front. Below that it has a fingerprint sensor that has 360-degree detection and can unlock your smartphone in just 0.5 seconds.Inside, it’s powered by a MediaTek Helio P10 processor and a choice of two memory combos. The first gives you 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage while the higher-spec variant sports 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage. To keep things running smooth, the Flash Plus 2 will come with an optimised stock Android Marshmallow experience.The device also has dual SIM LTE support with a dedicated MicroSD card slot so you won’t have to worry about sacrificing a SIM card for memory expansion.It’s also got a 13MP f/2.0 rear-facing primary camera for imaging and a 5-megapixel wide-angle selfie snapper with an LED flash at the front. The 13-megapixel primary camera uses a mixture of PDAF and contrast autofocus to help it pull focus within 0.1 seconds.What’s also interesting about this smartphone is the fact that it has a removable metal back. Prying it open will reveal the 3,000 mAh battery that has support for flash charge quick charging that Flash says can give you a 50% charge in just 30 minutes.As a cherry on top of the proverbial cake, the Flash Plus 2 also comes with an NXP9890 audio amplifier and a 32-bit advanced audio headphone DAC (AKM4375).The price for all of this? Flash lists the Plus 2’s global reference price at USD160 (about RM644) for the base 2GB RAM model while the higher 3GB RAM model will go for USD190 (about RM765).Good news is, we won’t have to wait too long for this device (or its local Malaysian price) as Flash will be launching their latest smartphone here next week on 24th May 2016.

They look quite close to the leaks that surfaced leading up to the launch, so in terms of design we’re not too surprised.While its the same size as its sibling the Lenovo Moto G4, the Moto G4 Plus is the high spec option of the two, the “Plus” referring more to what’s under the hood as opposed to screen size.It is slightly larger, the 1080p display measures in at 5.5 inches as opposed to the 5-inch devices from the previous Moto G line. The screen also has Gorilla Glass 3, with a fingerprint reader sitting directly under the display, a feature that’s only on the Moto G4 Plus model.As for its innards, the device will be home to a Snapdragon 617 processor along with the option of 4GB, 3GB or 2GB RAM as well as 16GB or 32GB storage, depending on how affordable you want it. The storage is expandable via microSD, so you can bump up the storage yourself if you wish.The cameras on the other hand, are a 5MP front shooter with 84 degree wide-angle lens while the rear camera is a 16MP lens with laser and phase detection alongside a f/2.0 aperture.Looking very similar to its sibling, the Lenovo Moto G4 has pretty much the same innards as the Moto G4 Plus, except that you only have 2GB RAM and a choice of 16GB or 32GB built-in, expandable storage. For the rear camera you get a 13MP shooter but it has the same 5MP selfie snapper as the G4 Plus. You don’t get a fingerprint scanner here either, sorry.Both devices have 3,000mAh batteries and fast charging, but only the Moto G4 Plus gets a Turbo Charger out of the box.As for availability, the new Moto phones will be exclusive to Amazon.in, with prices starting at INR 13,500 (about RM 812) for the 16GB Moto G4 Plus and INR 15,000 (about RM 902) for the 32GB storage model.[SOURCE][VIA]"

As hinted by their CEO, there will be three ZenFone 3 at launch as seen towards the end of the video.Expect the ASUS ZenFone 3, ZenFone 3 Deluxe and ZenFone 3 Max, which all will be eyeing for the mid-range market. This time, they won’t be using Intel processors and the trio will be using either Qualcomm or MediaTek processors instead.

Not too long ago, they have introduced “Family Profiles”, which allows your spouse, parents and children use Uber using your assigned credit card. For greater peace of mind, they are now offering automated real-time tracking each time your family member gets on a Uber car. Real-time tracking of Uber rides isn’t new. You can share your estimated time of arrival and current location to a contact of your choice but it is done manually for each trip. With this new feature for Family Profiles, the tracking feature will be enabled automatically and you as the main account holder will be notified when a loved one is on a trip. It’s great for parents as they will know where their kids are along with the vehicle details.For those concerned about privacy, take note that this is only enabled for family profiles. Apart from live tracking, the head of the household will also receive the full receipt along with the trip details. That’s fair since he/she is paying for the trips. Family members that wish to ride under the radar may still do so with their personal or business accounts. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"
Rory Lee,Travel Recommends in New York: It’s hard to recommend,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/18/travel-recommends-portable-wireless-router-mifi-review/,"international roaming,internet service,mifi,roaming,travel recommends,mobile accessories,product review","Mobile Accessories,Product review",2016-05-18,"I love travelling. It’s amazing to be able to see new places and enjoy new experiences. Anyone who says that it’s about the journey, not the destination, has never been on a 15-hour flight with crying babies. To me, it’s about the journey you take once you’ve arrived at the destination. Do you go on your own and take the road less traveled? Or stick to the popular attractions?The biggest problem I have when travelling, though, is staying connected. While our local telcos are having an all out war in an attempt to come up with the best roaming plans, they’re still teetering on the pricey side. Another option is to pick up a local SIM, but that has its complications too. So what’s left?Well, the third option is to rent a portable wireless router from someone like Travel Recommends.Travel Recommends is a company that provides a portable wireless router rental service for people who are travelling abroad. You can enjoy unlimited internet connectivity from as low as RM9/day, but the prices will vary depending on country.  It is required that you reserve the router at least 5 working days before your date of departure.Once you’ve picked your country and paid for the service (including an RM200 deposit for the router), you can either opt to pick it up at the KLIA Travel Recommends booth or have it delivered to you.So, I went to New York last month and it was amazing. Here’s a photo of Central Park:It’s beautiful. Now, here’s a photo of me in Central Park:Much less beautiful. Here’s an amazing Shake Shack burger to make up for my horrible selfie:Oops, I may have gone off a little bit of a tangent here, let’s back to the Travel Recommends router and the question that’s burning itself into the back of your mind (probably):Well, yes and no. One big yes is that Travel Recommends gives you a complete package of the wireless router, a charging cable, an international adapter and a bunch of quick-start guides that are all packed neatly into a bag the size of my face. Just bring that little bag along and you’re good to go.It’s also incredibly easy to set up, as the included quick-start guide in my pack only needed three simple steps before I was connected and ready to go online. However, here’s when I hit my first snag: The connection isn’t particularly fantastic.The speeds and network stability definitely left a lot to be desired. I stayed at The Westin in Times Square which is located pretty much at the heart of the large city, and here’s a screenshot of the speed test I was able to run on my first day there:Not particularly impressive if I may say so myself. Definitely not as impressive as these guys cosplaying characters from the Ghostbusters:Nice!Anyway, there could, of course, be many reasons the connectivity was so poor. The first being that my location in the heart of the city isn’t particularly ideal for network connectivity, what with all the tall concrete buildings towering over me.However, the most likely cause for this poor result would be the network I was connected to — AT&T. A quick Google search of AT&T in New York reveals many articles that don’t exactly inspire confidence when it comes to network strength. My friend, on the other hand, who bought a local T-Mobile SIM had no problems with her data connection whatsoever, even achieving rather quick speeds.Even my colleague from TheSkop who had a review unit when he went on his trip to Australia reported fast download speeds of around 25Mbps and good network coverage overall.Things didn’t improve during the second half of my trip, when I moved towards the suburbs near Queens and Brooklyn, either. I had more consistency (and speed) connected to the various free WiFi hotspots in town.There are other inconveniences with having an extra device with you too. The first being that you need to bring it around with you all the time so that adds weight to your pack. You also have to constantly keep it charged throughout the day as the battery life on that portable wireless router is good for a day at most.Despite the hiccups and poor network connectivity, I was not left with a bitter taste in my mouth. All things considered, I think Travel Recommends’ biggest problem was their choice in network partner (in New York at least) which resulted in a rather mediocre experience for me.However, I am very hopeful for the growth of this type of service. This is a service that offers a simple way to have unlimited data connection for an affordable price. Apple once said that the “most powerful technology should deliver incredible capability without the complexity”. I may not agree with much of what Cupertino does, but this is a statement I completely agree with.There is a lot of ambiguity surrounding roaming that I’m sure many are hesitant to jump on board, especially with all the horror stories of bill shock stemming from roaming on the wrong network floating around. Buying a local SIM may be the best choice for those who are willing to put in the time and effort to research the best deal, but not everyone is willing to do that.Simplicity, then, is Travel Recommends’ biggest strength. If only they’d improve their choice of network partner so I wouldn’t have to wait until I was back in Malaysia before uploading photos from my trip.Before I sign off, I will leave you with a picture of a squirrel climbing up a fence:

But now, it seems Samsung wants to take it a step further by introducing a smartphone with a foldable display.Yes, the future is now. Well, sort of.Large screens are awesome for videos, games and even more mundane stuff like browsing and picture taking. The problem with large displays is that they’re very hard to carry around and operate especially for people with smaller hands.Ideally, we’d want a smartphone that can be both small and portable but have an enormous display. Making smartphones thinner and lighter helps somewhat, but what if we could shrink the display size altogether?Well, if these recent rumours are to be believed, it seems Samsung is working on exactly that with their purported Galaxy X handset set to go on display in 2017. The Galaxy X will be part of Samsung’s rumoured five flagships next year which will likely be the Galaxy S8, S8 edge, Galaxy Note 7 and Note 7 edge.According to more rumours, the foldable Galaxy X will feature a 4K (3840×2160) panel that folds out like one of those three part velcro wallets — shrinking something that is about the size of a tablet to the size of a smartphone.This would clearly be a big challenge for the South Korean electronics giant as they’re taking their flexible OLED panels to the next level. They will also need to come up with a much stronger material that can withstand the constant folding and unfolding than the plastic backplane they’re using on their flexible panels. The display is also said to use a diamond PenTile subpixel like they’re currently using with several Galaxy smartphones.Either way, it will be interesting to see how (and if) they accomplish this feat and would probably mark a new chapter in the smartphone story. Until we see some concrete evidence, do keep in mind that these are merely rumours so take them with the appropriate amount of salt.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

It also has a rather phablety 6-inch 1080p display, with some of the hugest cameras on a mobile device.The Xperia XA Ultra has a 16MP front camera with OIS, with the rear shooter being a 21.5MP camera with hybrid autofocus. Both cameras have an LED flash , and the front camera has gesture shutter for those moments you can’t press the button yourself.This puts the Xperia XA Ultra head to head with the OPPO F1 Plus in terms of its front-facing camera, with the F1 Plus also sporting a 16MP selfie snapper.Last but not least the Xperia XA Ultra will come out of the box with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, supports dual SIM and its 2700 mAh battery is rated to last 2 days on a single charge. Apparently the quick charging tech allows you to grab 5.5 hours of usage out of 10 minutes of charging, though we will probably look at real world usage before we back this claim up.The device is expected to hit the market come this July with three colour options; Black, White and Lime Gold.

The OS will also be home to  native split-screen capabilities that will allow you to run two apps side by side, as well as picture-in-picture modes so you can watch videos without having to jump between apps. We can’t wait to try this out on a tablet.The updates also include more human looking Emoji Unicode 9 support.Of course, there’s also performance updates so your device will run better, but it won’t be visible on the surface level as Google’s focus for Android N is towards seamlessness as opposed to raw power.Last but not least, you will also be able to reply messages directly from notifications and Google has finally made a “Clear All” button available to clear everything at a go, to further streamline the process.In an unexpected move, Google is leaving the name for Android N in the hands of the internet, letting netizens suggest names for the upcoming OS. Google will still have the final say in what it will be naming Android N, but feel free to fire away at the link.Android N is expected to be rolled out sometime later this Summer, and a public beta will be available shortly.[SOURCE][VIA]"

What’s interesting is that this design looks eerily similar to that of an HTC One M9 from the antenna lines to the square camera module.Our guess of a fully metallic OnePlus 3 seems to be confirmed by this next set of live images from @KJuma. Here the smartphone looks to have a gently curved back which is likely for ergonomics as well as a Samsung-esque camera bump. One notable feature that is missing from the back of the smartphone is a laser autofocus module.Around the bottom, we see a single speaker grille and asymmetrical design similar to that of a Samsung Galaxy S7, iPhone 6s and HTC One A9. That’s honestly a nice departure from their dummy grille design from the bottom of the OnePlus 2. In the dummy grille’s place sits a headphone jack and what looks like microphone ports along with a USB Type-C port.It is worth pointing out that in this image, the fingerprint sensor looks a lot more like a button (similar to the OPPO R9/F1 Plus) rather than a recessed dimple. Around the side, we find what has become OnePlus’ signature alert slider.As a whole, it looks like a really handsome device. Knowing OnePlus, this smartphone will likely pack the best specs you can get this year, with even hints that there will be a version with 6GB of RAM to go along with the lower specced 4GB variant.At the heart of the device, reports have indicated that it will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and will go on sale for a slightly lower price than the OnePlus 2.Unfortunately, if Evan Blass’ words are to be believed, it seems that the OnePlus 3 will only be packing a 3,000 mAh battery. Then again, it will come with an AMOLED display (like the OnePlus X) which should mean that the device is more frugal with its power consumption.[SOURCE, 2]"

With a single campaign, developers can promote their apps across the Google platform which includes Google Search, mobile sites, YouTube, Google Play and it’s coming soon to Gmail. For the past year, Universal App Campaigns have doubled ad-based app installs with over 2 billion downloads to date. Initially released for Android, Google is now expanding Universal App Campaigns for iOS devices. Apart from expanding reach onto the iOS platform, Google wants to help developers create a sustainable app business. According to a recent study, only 17% of app users drive 85% of app revenue. For developers, driving downloads is just one of their success metrics and ultimately they would want to acquire users that offer a higher lifetime value (LTV). This could be users that reach higher levels in a game or users that are more likely to make a purchase or booking on an e-commerce app.Analytics is crucial in order to target valuable users with less effort. To gain better insights, Google has introduced Firebase Analytics, a development platform that was acquired by Google in late 2014. With Firebase, developers can focus on app development while analytics is deeply integrated from the ground up.When integrated with Google AdWords, developers can run campaigns that are focused on conversions since Firebase Analytics can track user behaviour in greater detail. As a result, this should deliver quality downloads that will increase revenue."

To enable WiFi Calling, you would need to download a small update and enable it under your phone’s settings. If you haven’t received an update notification, just head over to Settings > General > Software Update. You should see a “Carrier Settings Update” pop-up as shown above. Once you’ve done that, you should be getting a new “Wi-Fi Calling” option under Settings > Phone.Tap on the “Wi-Fi- Calling on this iPhone” switch and select “Enable”. If your telco label is showing “WiFi” (e.g. “U Mobile WiFi”), that means Wi-Fi Calling is currently enabled. You would need a working and fixed WiFi in order for this to work.Once enabled, you can use WiFi Calling as if you’re making a normal call. This is great for dead zones in your home or office where signal strength is weak. When connected to our office WiFi, we immediately get “U Mobile WiFi” on our iPhone SE. When we tried to make a call, the connection seems quick and we find the call quality to be pretty good.Next, we tried to test if WiFi calling is able to handle a wonky WiFi connection. We connected our phone to a WiFi hotspot and then turn it off while we’re in a conversation half way. Immediately, the phone call was disconnected while the other party is still on the call in total silence. After that, we tried making a WiFi call while walking further away from our WiFi hotspot. When we got too far, both parties couldn’t hear each other but surprising when we got closer in range, we managed to resume our voice conversation without disconnecting. From what we’ve experienced, this works best when you’re stationary with a stable WiFi connection. The voice call doesn’t switch seamlessly from WiFi to cellular, so you may get cut off if you’re moving out of range. UPDATE: WiFi Calling works on both U Mobile postpaid and prepaid.
At time of writing, this seems to work only on U Mobile postpaid and we couldn’t get it to work on our prepaid SIM. Have you tried WiFi calling on your phone? Do share with us your experience in the comments down below."
Rory Lee,ZTE Blade V7 series hands-on: Is this truly premium for the masses?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/13/zte-blade-v7-series-hands-on-is-this-truly-premium-for-the-masses/,"android,smartphone,zte,zte blade v7,zte blade v7 hands on,zte blade v7 lite,zte blade v7 malaysia,zte blade v7 max,zte malaysia,mobile devices,mobile os",,2016-05-13,"ZTE recently launched two new devices to add to their Blade series lineup. The new Blade V7 Lite and Blade V7 Max is the company’s attempt at letting everyone own a metal smartphone.This means that they’re bringing the full-metal experience to an even lower price point than before. Have they succeeded?The ZTE Blade V7 Lite is powered by a 1.3GHz MediaTek MT6735P quad-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. The 5-inch device also packs an HD 720p display on the front with a 2.5D curved edge glass panel on top.The interesting thing to note here is that the smartphone comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which until this day still isn’t all that common. Granted, it’s a heavily skinned version of Android, but it still has all of 6.0’s goodies.The key feature here, though, is the metal build and ZTE’s round design language. It was supposed to help ergonomics and to an extent it does, as the rounded edges feel pretty good in the hand. However, the metal itself doesn’t feel particularly premium, but I suppose that’s to be expected considering the price point.In terms of optics, the Blade V7 Lite comes with a 13-megapixel rear camera, but it was kind of hard to judge how good it was considering the poor lighting conditions in the venue. It also packs an 8MP front-facing selfie camera with a dedicated LED flash and smile shutter for easy selfie snaps. Keeping the lights on is a 2,500 mAh battery.As a whole, the device is pretty decent, though admittedly the performance leaves a lot to be desired. Then again, it’s feature packed but a lot of the execution isn’t as smooth as it could have been. For example, the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor requires you to have the screen on before it will start detecting your finger. ZTE has since updated us that there is an option within the fingerprint settings to enable fingerprint-unlock when the screen is off.ZTE have also packed a bunch of gimmicky features to “help” you launch apps/tasks faster and easier, but when the product guy was demoing them to me, they seemed more like some inconvenience instead. It definitely takes a lot less effort to just launch the app normally.That said, at RM669, the Blade V7 Lite isn’t too bad value for money. If you factor in the RM499 promotional price that ZTE are selling the V7 Lite for right now, you’d really be hard-pressed to find something that has a more premium build for less. Still, I don’t know if build is the biggest concern when it comes to phones at this price range.ZTE are also having an event this Sunday (15 May 2016 at 12.30pm) at their ZTE Concept Kiosk in Low Yat Plaza where you will get the chance to pick up the Blade V7 Lite at 50% off (RM335. Just follow these steps:STEP 1: Like ZTE’s Facebook Page.
STEP 2: Attend and post a photo of the event on your Facebook wall with the hastags of #ZTEMalaysia #ZTEbladev7lite and tag three friends.
STEP 3: Show ZTE your posted photo & NRIC at the ZTE counter. You’re limited to one unit per IC.
STEP 4: Enjoy 50% off your ZTE Blade V7 Lite."

It obviously will pack less punch than headsets like the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive, because those have to be connected to a PC to work and have much more processing power at their disposal.There’s also rumours that Google will be releasing a VR device that supports many a model of smartphone, like the Gear VR but with many more compatible phone options.However, what’s interesting to note is that the device won’t need third-party apps, simply because Android VR will be built right into the OS. Speaking of OS, it probably will be native to Android N as well.The headsets are set to launch next week at Google I/O from 18 – 20th May 2016 so stay tuned for more info as we get it.[SOURCE][VIA]"

With the new app, you can directly search from the keyboard itself, on top of being able to post Gifs and emojis to whoever it is you happen to be chatting with.The search results will even appear as cards so as to streamline the whole information transfer process, so you can just directly copy and paste the necessary info into the message. Think of it as a miniaturised Google search.It will even suggest emojis and Gifs based on words you enter into the search. No more rolling through Google search looking for that perfect reaction meme. Last but not least, Gboard also supports Glide Typing, which allows you to quickly type by sliding your finger from key to key, much like what Swiftkey.Unfortunately, only iOS users get Gboard for now, with Android users to get access to the app at a later date. You can download Gboard for iOS right here.[SOURCE][VIA]"

It further went out of control when the image was mistaken as the Moto E (2016).Surprised there was so much confusion here. Thought quoting the G4 Plus leak would make it obvious that it’s the G4. https://t.co/dVa8wcR0oT— Evan Blass (@evleaks) 15 May 2016But what’s really strange about the press render is that it lacks a front fingerprint sensor, which was present in the front panel leak some time back. Everything else on the other hand, looks mostly identical to the leaks.With the launch practically happening tomorrow, it won’t be long till we officially get to see the Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus and unravel the mystery of the missing button.[SOURCE][VIA]"
Rory Lee,Winnergear MicFlip reversible MicroUSB cable review: The cable you never knew you needed,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/16/winnergear-micflip-reversible-microusb-cable-review-the-cable-you-never-knew-you-needed/,"accessories,fully reversible microusb cable,micflip,microusb cable,product review,reversible microusb cable,smartphone,usb cable,usb cable review,winnergear,winnergear micflip,winnergear micflip review,cool stuff,mobile accessories,others","Cool stuff,Mobile Accessories,Others,Product review",2016-05-16,"I love instant noodles. When I was much younger, instant noodles were a breakfast treat and the mornings where I got to have a packet were the only mornings I would wake up early. The thing is, in the past, I only ever had Cintan’s Perisa Asli noodles and I never thought of trying the other flavours because Perisa Asli was already so good. That was until I tried one of the super spicy kari berapi type noodles. One slurp and I was hooked, I could never go back to good ol’ Perisa Asli.In a way, this is the same case for me and USB cables. I’ve always only used the USB cables that came out of the box because I figured they’d work the best with their device. I never thought I’d need anything else.Well, that was until I got my hands on the gold-coated Winnergear MicFlip Fully Reversible MicroUSB cable. A mouthful, but this is essentially the kari berapi of USB cables and it’s awesome.If you want a spec sheet for this cable, a lot of it is in the name. So let’s break it down and allow me to answer all of your pressing questions.Well, when USB Type-C devices first came out, one of their biggest selling points was that you didn’t have to fumble around when you want to plug your cable into your smartphone. This was because Type-C cables were reversible, something Type-A and MicroUSB cables weren’t.The MicFlip solves this with a complicated hexagonal shape that looks sort of like two MicroUSB ports glued back to back. At first, it took some effort to get it plugged into our Galaxy S7 edge, but after the first time, it was a whole lot easier to stick it in.I didn’t think it’d make much of a difference at first, but once I went back to a regular MicroUSB cable, I kept forgetting and getting it wrong. It’s not something you immediately notice, but it definitely makes a difference.On Winnergear’s site, they say that the gold helps keep the USB plugs corrosion resistant. That makes sense because gold is the least reactive of all metals, existing in a state that’s benign to the environment.In case you didn’t already know, corrosion is a natural process that reduces a refined metal into a more stable form such as oxide, hydroxide or sulfide. It is basically the gradual destruction of the metal (or sometimes other materials) via a chemical reaction to its surrounding environment.Science lesson over, since gold is so stable and non-reactive, it doesn’t undergo this process (do correct me if I’m wrong) and as a result, will not corrode naturally even on a geological time scale.Theoretically, this means that your cables won’t corrode as easily or as quickly as the regular cables that come with your smartphone. Does it work? Well, so far our gold-coated USB tips are still as shiny and golden as they were when they first arrived about a month ago. Good stuff.I feel you. One of my biggest problems with rubber cables is the rubber breaking. I’ve killed many a USB cable by tripping over them, rolling my chair over them, using the cable to fish for my phone, using them in tug-of-war competitions…Okay maybe I’m just a cable abuser, but the point is that I’ve killed plenty of out-of-the-box cables.With the MicFlip though, this isn’t that easy. The cable is braided (so not your usual rubber cable) and wound really tight. This makes the cable rather firm and that might take some getting used to if you’re coming from a flimsy rubberised one.But, that tight winding pays off in terms of build. This cable feels so solid you could probably jump rope with it. Actually, you can totally jump rope with it, we’ve tested it.That said, it will take some getting used to as it’s not as easy to bunch up or wind as regular cables. But, the good thing about that is that your cable won’t get tangled so easily. I keep all my charging cables and power bricks in a tiny bag (I know, I know, that’s a disaster in the making) and often times the MicFlip is the only cable that doesn’t get tangled into a knot.Well, I definitely didn’t notice any difference between the MicFlip and a regular cable. Our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge got its adaptive fast charging just as it would with a regular cable. Data transfer speeds were the same between the MicFlip and a regular cable too. It took about 5 seconds to copy a 100MB file from my PC into a smartphone and 6 seconds to copy it out.Now here’s where it gets tricky. The way I see it, the MicFlip has two things going against it: The price and the fact that it’s still MicroUSB.MicroUSB isn’t a bad thing by any means if you’re looking at smartphones being launched this year. It probably won’t be a big deal next year either. But this cable is marketed to last a really long time — that means several years down the line — and that’s where MicroUSB will probably end up hindering its value. Smartphones and other devices are slowly but surely moving on to USB Type-C ports so why on earth would you blow a considerable amount of money on a cable that will probably be obsolete two years down the line?When I say a considerable amount of money, I suppose that’s relative to the individual. It costs USD19.90 (around RM80) which if you compare it to the cable that comes with your smartphone, that’s USD19.90 extra.This then brings us to the conclusion. Is it a necessity to buy one of these cables? No, absolutely not. But I can say that once you’ve had a taste of this cable, stock MicroUSB cables will never be the same again.UPDATE: Since many of you are asking, you can pick up this handy dandy MicroUSB cable from Winnergear’s website. They also provide free worldwide shipping."
Rory Lee,Acer’s answer to the Surface Pro 4 lands in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/16/acers-answer-to-the-surface-pro-4-lands-in-malaysia/,"acer,acer aspire e 14,acer aspire e 15,acer aspire f 15,acer aspire r 15,acer aspire s 13,acer malaysia,acer malaysia launch,acer switch alpha 12,malaysia,mobile devices,windows 10",,2016-05-16,"Revealed earlier at their Global Press Conference in New York, Acer has finally brought the new Switch Alpha 12 and Aspire S 13 laptops to Malaysia. The good news? They’re pretty good value.Leading the pack is the Acer Switch Alpha 12 — an impressive liquid-cooled 2-in-1 laptop that is powered by a 6th generation Intel Core i Processor. It’s also got a beautiful 12-inch QHD (2160x1440p) touch-sensitive display.I was quite impressed with this particular device when I first saw it in New York. It had a great build, an excellent keyboard and a reasonable price which made it a great challenger to the Microsoft Surface Pro 4.The fact that it had a fanless liquid cooling is also a plus because it makes the tablet completely silent and more resistant to dust build-up over time.Acer has brought three variants of this tablet to Malaysia and the prices are as follows:Intel Core i3-6100U processor, 4GB of DDR3L RAM, 128GB SSD — RM2,499
Intel Core i5-6200U processor, 8GB of DDR3L RAM, 256GB SSD — RM3,499
Intel Core i7-6500U processor, 8GB of DDR3L RAM, 256GB SSD — RM4,499That’s incredible value considering the price includes a keyboard and an Acer Active Stylus. An entry-level Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (Intel Core M3 processor) with a keyboard costs RM4,269. On the other hand, if you choose to pick up an Acer Switch Alpha 12, you can get an Intel Core i7 processor with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for only RM4,499 — that’s only RM230 more for a whole lot more power.However, it’s worth noting that only the bundled keyboard with the i7 model will come with backlight. The others will not.Next up is the ultra-portable, ultra-slim 13-inch Acer Aspire S 13 laptop. It’s designed to be a great workstation on the go, weighing in at only 1.3kg, with a thin 14.58mm edge.In terms of performance, you get a 6th Generation Intel Core i5-6200U processor and a choice of either 4GB or 8GB of RAM. The Aspire S 13 also comes with a 13.3-inch full-HD IPS panel that performs incredibly well under sunlight thanks to its matte finish.It’s mostly constructed of plastic but has a nice textured finish to the top of the laptop. Acer’s Aspire 13 comes in two specifications:4GB of DDR3L RAM, 128GB SSD — RM2,799
8GB of DDR3L RAM, 256GB SSD — RM3,399For more information on these two devices, check out our hands-on with them.Alongside these two products, Acer also launched the Aspire R 15, a 360-degree convertible laptop with prices starting from RM2,699 (Pricing and specs here), the Aspire E 14 with prices starting from RM2,199, Aspire E 15, RM2,399 (Pricing and specs here) and Aspire F 15 with prices RM2,699 (Pricing and specs here) laptop plus the ultra-thin (6.6mm thin) R1 series monitors (Pricing and specs here).The Aspire E, F and R1 monitor are already available while the Aspire S 13 will be available starting this week. The Switch Alpha 12, on the other hand, will only be arriving starting next week but Acer did not provide an exact date.For more photos, head on over to our gallery."

This might also mean that the Xperia C6 Ultra we’ve been seeing might instead be the Xperia X Ultra at launch.Sony Mobile presentations show that the Xperia X series is just the start of Sony’s “Chapter 3”, with the theme of “Xperia for new communication” which will run till 2018; marking the beginning of the Xperia X as a new visual identity for the brand. The new X logo branding will also be used on promotional material, as well as merchandise.Chapter 1 happened between 2010-2012 which was about “Open OS for web communication” with the Xperia X10 as its highlight, and Chapter 2 ran over 2013-2015 and focused on the “best of Sony” highlighting the Xperia Z series.Sony is still committed to producing a flagship device, just that future phones will be under the Xperia X range irrespective of the specs. It will be interesting to see what naming convention Sony will now have now that their new devices are under one umbrella.[SOURCE,1,2][VIA]"

The P series is Huawei’s flagship line that focuses on a premium build as well as camera photography. On the latest Huawei P9, it gets a pair of cameras at the back that are co-engineered with the German optics company. To have Leica branding on a smartphone is a respectable stamp of approval but how does it fare in actual usage? To find out, we’ve pitted the P9 against other top end contenders such as the iPhone 6s Plus, Microsoft Lumia 950 and the current champion, the Galaxy S7 edge. To recap on the specs, the Huawei P9 gets a pair of 12MP sensors that are assisted with dual-tone LED flash and Laser Auto Focus. Unlike the P8, the new P9 lacks optical image stabilisation (OIS) which puts it at a disadvantage against the other 3 contenders. While the aperture is smaller at f/2.2, it gets a pixel size of 1.25 microns for better low light performance. In most dual-camera set-ups, the second camera usually plays a minor role for depth of field, however on the P9, the second unit shoots 12MP images in monochrome. This according to Huawei helps to capture greater detail when combined with its RGB colour sensor. For the front, it gets an 8MP f/2.4 selfie camera which is quite similar to the Nexus 6P. If you have’t seen it yet, you can check out our hands-on of the device here.The iPhone 6s Plus gets a 12MP f/2.2 iSight camera that’s assisted with dual-tone LED flash. There’s also optical image stabilisation and a respectable 1.22-micron pixel size. For the front, there’s a 5MP FaceTime HD and it lets you illuminate your selfies using the screen’s Retina Flash. For the Lumia 950, its 20MP PureView camera is a formidable rival for the P9. It gets a large f/1.9 aperture size and it is assisted by not two, but 3 LED flash. While it has the highest resolution camera for this comparison, the pixel size is the smallest at 1.12 micron. For selfies, it features a 5MP shooter with a f/2.4 aperture.  The Galaxy S7 edge is still our favourite camera smartphone. Starting the 12MP dual-pixel camera is just a double tap away and it is super quick to focus. For brighter photos, it gets a f/1.7 lens for both front and back. The main 12MP camera gets optical image stabilisation and it boasts a larger 1.4-micron pixel size. For the front, it gets a 5MP sensor and it also gets a screen flash for better-lit selfies in low light. With all smartphones set to auto mode without flash, head over to the next few pages for a 4-way shootout."

We travel from place to place using GPS navigation apps like Waze and Google Maps, take photos, check our social media feed, watch videos and play games.It’s pretty insane how much we rely on our smartphones but many of them can barely keep up with us, needing to be constantly recharged. As a result, power banks have become a mainstay in our bags or clutches.Huawei wants to change that with the Mate 8, claiming that you can leave your power bank at home. Well, we’re going to put that to the test.For this battery stress test, we’ve identified four different aspects of rather heavy daily usage and devised four tests to really find out what this 4,000 mAh battery in the Huawei Mate 8 can do. First, we will look at charging speeds, then video playback, followed by gaming and finally we’ll use the Mate 8 to charge an iPhone SE.Huawei’s Mate 8 has a massive 4,000 mAh battery which by normal standards would take quite long to charge. The Redmi Note 3’s comparable 4,050 mAh cell takes a whopping two and a half hours to get from 0-100% on the bundled charger. Let’s find out how long the Mate 8 takes.With the bundled 9V/2A fast charger, here are the charging statistics for the Mate 8 from 0% charge:30 minutes: 35%
60 minutes: 70%
90 minutes: 94%
110 minutes: 100%In just under two hours, the Mate 8 is fully charged. What’s more, with a mere 30 minutes on the plug, the resulting 35% charge should be more than enough to last you a working day as it gave us 9 hours of time on battery with about 1.5 hours of screen on time.On your typical working day, we figured the average person would spend about 1 hour in total consuming video. A couple of minutes during transit, a couple of minutes while waiting in the bank and even a couple of minutes during one’s lunch break. Of course, usage habits vary with the individual but 1 hour seems like a decent baseline to begin testing.With that established, we wanted to find out how much battery the Mate 8 would consume after 1 hour of video playback. So, we fired up a movie on iflix and spent an hour watching it at full brightness and maximum volume. The result? Our Mate 8 only dropped 17% of charge with data on, GPS on, max brightness and video streaming. You could probably do better if you set the brightness to auto.Following the same principle, we figured the average person on the average day also spends about 1 hour in total playing video games on their smartphone. Hence, we set out and launched into an intense gaming session with Asphalt 8 running at full brightness with full volume for one hour straight.The device did get a little warm under the load, but once the dust had settled, the smartphone only consumed 21% of battery charge — keep in mind this is also with GPS, data, and WiFi running in the background.Pretty impressive that after one solid hour of gaming and one solid hour of video streaming, the Mate 8 still has 62% of battery left for your lighter and less battery intensive tasks.Now, for the ultimate test. Huawei boasts that the Mate 8 can become one’s saviour by giving devices that have run low on battery a charge via OTG in the case of an emergency. Well, it so happens our iPhone SE with a 1,624 mAh battery, completely ran out of juice so we thought we’d let the Mate 8 save the day.Hooking up the OTG cable to the Mate 8 and the iPhone, the iPhone immediately started charging. However, it is worth noting that this isn’t the most efficient way to charge a smartphone and if you have the option, hooking it up to a wall socket is much better.Nevertheless, we were able to give the iPhone SE a quarter charge while only depleting 15% of the Mate 8’s battery reserves.As a whole, the Mate 8 performed rather well in all of our tests so if you’re one that worries about running out of juice before the day is up, the Mate 8 is definitely the smartphone to put those worries to bed."

Rory Lee,Google adds some awesome new features to the Translate app,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/13/google-adds-some-awesome-new-features-to-the-translate-app/,"android,apple,google,google translate,google translate new,ios,iphone,new features,smartphone,mobile apps,mobile os","Android,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-05-13,"Google does some pretty awesome things with the internet to helps us learn more about the world around us. There’s stuff like Maps, Analytics and of course, who could forget, Google Translate.Not only is Google Translate a crucial source for people like me, it can also spawn a whole bunch of absolutely hilarious content for people to get creative with. Now, Google’s making Translate even better on the mobile device than ever before.What Google have done for Translate on Android is add a new feature called Tap to Translate. It’s basically a pop-up extension of the Translate app that appears whenever you copy text that might need translating. Once the popup appears, simply hit it and you can paste your text directly into Translate and get the translation.This eliminates the need to minimise your current app window, launch a new one, copy-paste the text…you get the idea. This new feature basically makes it easier for us to have almost instantaneous access to Translate all the time. Think Facebook Messanger and you sort of get the idea.Being a banana (born a Chinese but is unable to speak/read/write the language), Google Translate is one of the most useful apps for me during the festive season. When Chinese New Year rolls around, I usually get bombarded with a whole bunch of season greetings in a language that looks about as legible to me as stray hair on the bathroom floor.It’s not that I don’t appreciate all the well-meaning (probably) messages from my relatives/friends, it’s just that I simply can’t understand them. As a result, my replies usually go along the lines of a thumbs up emoji…or three. Sometimes the big grinning face one.Gooogle Translate helps me with this problem. True, the app’s translations probably aren’t 100% reliable (actually they’re probably only 30% reliable for complex sentences), but it gets enough of the sentence right that you can sort of infer the meaning of the message. So, anything that makes it easier for me to translate long messages on WhatsApp is a welcomed improvement.But that’s not all, Google is also improving Offline Mode on iOS. It now works on Apple’s operating system and it joins Android in using small offline packages so that they don’t take up too much space on your smartphone. The best part is, Offline Mode also works with Tap to Translate.Google have also added support for the Chinese language in Word Lens. With this, Google will have 29 languages that you can instantly translate with the camera in Google Translate.These updates are only beginning to roll out and will continue to do so over the next few days. If you haven’t already received it on your device, be patient and hang on, it’s coming. For those who already have access to these new features and have something interesting to point out, drop a comment down below!"

But considering that they’re pushing the date by just a month, it’s still not too large of a move.The new Zenfones are to come in three flavours, the Asus Zenfone 3, Zenfone 3 Deluxe and Zenfone 3 Max, all of which are to enter the mid-range market. Prices are expected to be a wee bit higher than the Zenfone 2 series of phones though, as the brand is going back to MediaTek and Qualcomm chips due to Intel rethinking their mobile chip strategy.The brand is expecting sales to be rather flat as the new phones fit into their market segment, but they’re heading in toe to toe with brands like Huawei and Oppo when it comes to price-point.We’ll see what Asus has in store for us with the new Zenfones when the launch rolls around next month.[SOURCE][VIA]"

Of course, a flagship device must have a smooth performance and good specifications, but we’ve come to a point where performance alone isn’t really enough to set you apart from the pack of existing devices.A flagship device needs to unique, one of a kind…somewhat special.Lenovo’s flagship, the Vibe X3, is an interesting device. Although its specs in terms of hardware and camera optics may be rather similar to the other flagship devices in the market, the handset does have something rather special up its sleeve.Trying their hand at the immersive world of virtual reality, Lenovo set out to make the Vibe X3 unique and what they came up with was TheaterMax — Lenovo’s stab at giving you the most immersive smartphone viewing experience of any device.In a nutshell, TheaterMax converts everything on your smartphone’s display into content viewable in a VR headset. It duplicates the screen — much like YouTube’s VR video content — so that when both images are combined with a VR headset, like the RM99 ANTVR headset for example, it transforms into what looks like a 60-inch television screen mounted inches from your face. It’s magnificent.When watching videos, you get the sense that you’re incredibly close to the action, something you don’t really get with other smartphones or even tablets. Pair that with the Vibe X3’s excellent front-facing Dolby Atmos stereo speakers and you’re in for one amazing ride. It’s a mish-mash of native software enhancements in the Vibe X3 plus the hardware lenses of a virtual reality headset that allows this device to to do what it does.True, it may not be the ultimate exercise in a virtual reality experience, but there’s no denying the level of immersion this smartphone affords. The unique thing is that basically everything you do daily — watching youtube videos, using the camera app — becomes incredibly immersive.This opens up a bunch of interesting ways to use the smartphone features, one of the ones we did was record a first person video with the camera app in VR mode strapped to our face. That way, the camera could literally record everything we set our eyes one.TheaterMax is merely one of Lenovo’s innovations, if you’re not into that there is already an entire world of VR content ready and waiting for you to give it a shot. Some of our personal favourites include Hardcode, Germbuster and InCell. If you’re willing to pony up a little bit, some other awesome titles like End Space and Bandit Six put you in the pilot’s seat for some dope flying and air-to-air combat.That said, TheaterMax is something rather new and special and that’s pretty rare in a smartphone world populated by what are essentially the same device with a different brand or built out of slightly different materials. It isn’t easy to distinguish yourself from the current crop of powerful flagship smartphones, but the Lenovo Vibe X3 does it and that’s all down to TheaterMax and the experience it provides."

The brainchild of ex-premier Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Proton was conceptualised to boost Malaysia’s industrial capabilities, in addition to stimulating the local economy.For those of you who don’t know, the Proton name is an acronym derived from Bahasa Malaysia: Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional, which roughly translates to national automotive enterprise/company. Its infancy was spurred by a joint venture with Japanese industrial giant Mitsubishi, which birthed the venerable Saga. From then, the national carmaker has progressed through, offering many firsts in the local industry. Over the years, Proton has had many opportunities to acquire, research and develop world-class technology seen their cars today. Here is a look at the top ten technological milestones that Proton has given us through the years.Proton SagaPerhaps the most obvious in this list, the Saga, which was rolled out in September, 1985, is Proton’s first car, automatically making it Malaysia’s first car model. The Saga, derived from Mitsubishi’s Lancer Fiore saloon, has all the basic functions of a late 20th century vehicle, which simply means that it does not have any of the luxuries we are accustomed to now: no ABS, no airbags, no automatic air-conditioning, no daytime running lights, and definitely no uppity in-car entertainment.Still, the car oozed swag at the time of launch, and coupled with a dash of government-encouraged patriotism, meant that the Saga single-handedly helped Proton establish the groundwork needed to conquer the local market in its coming years. In fact, the Saga still holds the distinction of being the longest-running production model for Proton: 7 years @ >300,000 vehicles produced."

In terms of dimensions, the tablet weighs in at 525g and 8.2mm thick (probably owing to the big battery within) as well as having two speakers which are placed on the bottom side. No love for front facing speakers?It will also have a gigantic 7,300mAh battery and have a 8MP and 2MP camera combo for the rear and front. The device will come with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box.There will be Wi-Fi only and LTE-enabled units avalable, with the Wi-Fi model going by SM-T580 and SM-T585 for the LTE unit.No idea when (or if) the device will come to our shores, but the Wi-Fi only unit will retail for  €289 (about RM 1331) while the LTE capable unit will retail for €349 (about RM 1607) with Black and White colour options.[SOURCE][VIA]"

Dubbed simply as the Mi Max, this handset is here to take your MIUI experience to the next level.Alongside the launch of the company’s new Android skin MIUI 8, the Mi Max is by far the largest smartphone Xiaomi has ever made.On the front, it packs a massive 6.44-inch full-HD 1080p display. Despite the large display, this smartphone still manages to maintain a thin edge of just 7.55mm. Xiaomi places a lot of emphasis on the fact that you can fit this device in your pocket despite the massive display. So, they’ve made a lot of effort in reducing its footprint and weight, even incorporating a 2.5D curved glass panel to improve grip in hand.Inside, the device is powered by either a Snapdragon 650 hexa-core or 652 octa-core processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. On board storage is also expandable via a MicroSD card.For optics, the Mi Max gets a 16-megapixel PDAF rear camera and a 5MP front snapper for selfies. Keeping the lights on is a massive 4,850 mAh battery. This smartphone also has support two SIM cards (network speeds up to 4G+/LTE-A) or one SIM and a microSD card via a hybrid SIM slot.Additionally, the all-metal Mi Max will come with an IR blaster and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor much like the Redmi Note 3.The smartphone comes in three colours –gold, silver and grey — and will come in three variants:RMB1,499 — Snapdragon 650 processor + 3GB RAM + 32GB storage (around RM931)
RMB1,699 — Snapdragon 652 processor + 3GB RAM + 64GB storage (around RM1,055)

Inside, the smartphone is powered by a home-grown Kirin 950 processor — a half-step below the Kirin 955 chip found on Huawei’s P9 flagship. In terms of memory, the full-HD variant will come with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage while the higher-spec QHD variant ups the storage to 64GB.In terms of optics, the V8 gets two 12-megapixel sensors on the back with laser autofocus and f/2.2 lenses. On the front, it gets an 8MP f/2.4 selfie snapper. These cameras seem awfully similar to those on the Huawei P9 with one notable difference — the missing Leica badging.There is also no mention about whether the dual cameras differ in specifications from each other (the P9, for example, has one monochrome sensor and one RGB sensor) but they do have large 1.76-micron pixels which are rather large. This should translate to better imaging in low-light conditions.The full-metal smartphone also sports a fingerprint sensor on the backplate which covers a large 3,500 mAh battery which charges via a USB Type-C connector.As far as connectivity is concerned, all models will support LTE connectivity, ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS. However, support for NFC will vary depending on the model. Pricing for each device is as follows:4GB RAM/32GB storage, Full HD display – CNY2,299 (around RM1,430)

Rory Lee,Google Maps “Driving Mode” is rolling out worldwide,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/12/google-maps-driving-mode-is-rolling-out-worldwide/,"android,apps,driving mode malaysia,google,google maps,google maps driving mode,mobile apps,mobile os","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-05-12,"Awhile back we published an article about Google Maps‘ latest feature: Driving Mode. Back then I downloaded an APK to try the program out early, but now it’s finally rolling out, for real, globally.Driving Mode is, in a way, Google’s method of telling you that they know exactly where you’re going all the time. I jest, of course, the true purpose of this is to help you get to where you’re going as fast as possible with as little effort as possible.In a nutshell, once you “Start driving”, Google will guess where you’re going based on the time of day and your travel history, and suggest the fastest route to that destination.You can then just leave the timer to run down and Google Maps will kick in and navigate you to your desired destination. If you don’t want to, you can just hit the tiny “x” and just drive. Driving Mode will continue to show you which roads are congested with a colour scheme (green for good, orange for heavy, red for congested).To access this, simply fire up the app and pull out the hamburger menu. Then, hit “Start driving” and you’re good to go. Maps will ask you if you want to add a Driving Mode shortcut to your home screen for added convenience.I was honestly a little disappointed in Driving Mode because I expected more. I wanted a more passive navigation system, rather than have it set a route then kick into the regular Maps turn-by-turn navigation that often beeps at me for not sticking to their pre-planned route.Instead, I would rather have them find out where I’m going, suggest a fast route and then as I’m driving along whatever route I chose, passively detect if there is congestion ahead. Should there be congestion ahead, I would have liked it if Maps prompted me and informed me of a faster route indicating how much time I would save and ask me if I would want to deviate instead.Of course, this is probably just me getting wrapped up in my own selfish fantasies of what technology should do. Driving Mode, I’m sure, will please a whole bunch of people who are tired after a long day at work and want their navigation app to guide them home.Though I can’t help but feel that it, in its current iteration, is a little more like a gimmick than a useful standalone feature. What do you guys think of Driving Mode? Let me know in the comments below![SOURCE]"

No? Well, it’s awesome and you should totally watch it. Those of you tech enthusiasts who have watched it, you would have undoubtedly noticed some of the cool gadgets they featured on set, including Captain Steve Roger’s vivo smartphone.Oops, uh, spoiler alert?The thing is, out of all the smartphones in the world, why do you think the Captain picked a vivo smartphone? Well, we believe we have some ideas. Let’s take the vivo V3Max as an example.If you’re at all familiar with the Cap, you’d probably have noticed that the he has an affinity for cold hard steel. Look at his trusty shield that the flings around (defying the laws of physics) at bad guys, I doubt he ever leaves home without it.So, it would make sense that he would want that same reassuring feeling for what is probably the Cap’s second most held object — his smartphone. With the V3Max, Steve can feel right at home gripping the handset’s full-metal unibody and be confident that it’ll survive a clash with Tony Stark.And you know what they say, confidence is the key to victory.The battery is usually a smartphone’s biggest kryptonite. What’s the point of having all those amazing features if your device runs out of juice every two hours? Not even the mighty Captain America can fix that, which is where the V3Max can come into play.The vivo V3Max has a large 3,000 mAh cell that will easily last an entire day on a single charge. What’s more, it comes with vivo’s Dual-Charge Circuits fast charging technology which can top the phone up in only 1.5 hours.That’s really important for Steve because he can’t be worrying about his phone dying on him while he’s punching Hydra (or RDJ’s perfect jawline) in the face. And even if it does die on him, the fast charging will get him back up to speed in a jiffy.When you’re an Avenger, being able to multitask is super important. It’s one of the strengths you need to list down in your CV when applying (probably). So, naturally the Captain would need a smartphone that can keep up with him.With the vivo V3Max’s Smart Split, he can have two windows open simultaneously which saves the Cap time and we all know every second matters when you’re trying to save the world.So, with the V3Max Captain America can, for example, use one window to look at security footage of a criminal while he uses the other window to Google the identity and location of the criminal. Y’know, just the usual stuff the Cap does when he’s off camera.High quality audio isn’t just eargasmically good for listening to music, it’s also important when you need to pick up the little nuances in, say, a secret message being transmitted by the forces of evil to their minions. Well, the AK4375 Hi-Fi chip located in the V3Max provides some of the highest quality smartphone audio you can find right now — SNR 105dB and a distortion rate of -97dB.That’s not all, the V3Max can also produce some truly impressive audio from its onboard speakers. That Hi-Fi chip isn’t messing around. It’s almost as amazing as Captain America himself when he’s giving orders and explaining tactics to his fellow teammates — crisp and crystal clear.Much like Steve Rogers himself, the V3Max is no slouch, as it packs a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor mated to 4GB of RAM. So, the Captain can run fast? Well, so can the vivo V3Max and it’s even faster with vivo’s intuitive FunTouch OS UI.It’ll definitely be able to keep up with ol’ Stevie.Captain America is famous for his Vibranium shield. He’s the protector of the weak, defender of the innocent, guardian of the galax–wait, wrong show, but, you get the idea. The question is, while he’s so busy protecting everyone else, who’s going to protect him?Well, the vivo V3Max of course! This sophisticated smartphone comes with fingerprint biometric security that not only keeps the phone and all his data safe, but it also unlocks the smartphone in a single touch — 0.2 seconds in fact.This means that the Cap doesn’t have to fumble around with passwords or pin numbers when he needs to unlock his smartphone. Just one tap will do — super handy for when he wants to grab a quick selfie to update his Instagram feed during a covert operation. Or maybe while he’s hopping from rooftop to rooftop. Or maybe even when he’s pursuing bad guys in a high-speed car chase and needs Waze to help him find the fastest route.To the regular mortals though, please don’t use your smartphone while you drive — that’s dangerous….unless you’re Captain America.Well, it looks like it’s safe to say that Captain America has found the right smartphone for his…unique lifestyle as a superhero. Maybe he can get his other Avenger buddies to pick up one too."

Or smart wearables, whichever you prefer.For people like us at SoyaCincau.com, smartwatches may not be the “latest” in terms of tech, but for everyone else who doesn’t blow all their money on gadgets, this is a relatively new concept. And oh boy what a concept.I mean, you have to charge your watch every day?When I think of smartwatches, one of the OG smartwatches to really revolutionised the smartwatch industry — especially in terms of looks — has to be the Moto 360. When I first laid eyes on it, I was stunned.I didn’t mind the flat tyre or the fact that it runs Android Wear (which, btw, is mighty confusing to use), it just looked right. It reminded the world that the smartwatch doesn’t need to look radically different from the regular watch.I yearned for one of these, so imagine my excitement when I finally got my hands on a brand new Moto 360. Not just any Moto 360, mind you, it was the Moto 360 Sport edition. Unfortunately, the saying “don’t meet your idols for they will disappoint you” rings painfully true.Having never used a piece of wearable tech before the Moto 360, this was the most jarring change I had to adapt to. On average, watches can go on for ages on a single charge. I even have a digital watch from when I was in primary school which — until this day — still beeps me occasionally to remind me that a new hour had begun.With the Moto 360 Sport, you don’t get that luxury. Charging each day is a necessity. It doesn’t matter if the quoted battery life is 1.5 days, you really don’t want your watch running out of juice in the middle of the day do you?The good news is that Motorola gives you a nice little charging cradle that you can dock your watch into. Once it’s docked, it turns into a little desk clock that dims and brightens depending on the brightness of the surrounding light. It sits quite elegantly perched on the side of your bed. What’s more, when you charge it each night, how fast it charges doesn’t really matter (about 2 hours if you’re curious) anymore.Getting used to this will take some time, and at the end of those long tiring days where you forget to charge your watch, you’ll just have to manage the next day without a smartwatch. Alternatively, you could bring your charging cradle along to your office.Well, it’s supposed to be sportier than the classic Moto 360. To achieve that, Motorola has augmented this 360 Sport with built-in GPS functionality. They’ve also given the watch a more rugged and weather resistant look with a case encased in the same rubberised material that the strap is made from.The only problem with that is the strap then becomes a proprietary piece of hardware that doesn’t seem very user-swappable — and that’s a problem since the strap is rather fragile.First thing’s first, I really dislike this Sport band. Not only does every single fleck of dust/particle/fibre/hair stick to it, it also isn’t very durable. By the end of my review session (about 2 weeks) the top layer of the rubberised band started peeling.It also doesn’t look particularly pretty — especially when compared to its classier brothers. In fact, I think the Gear S2 pulls off that sporty look even better. The worst part? This watch isn’t even very sporty because the only sport this thing can track is running.The Moto 360 Sport does track running rather well with Motorola’s Moto Body app and the built-in GPS is incredibly accurate, but can you really call it a “Sport” watch? Perhaps they should have called it the Moto 360 Run instead.If you’re a die-hard sports enthusiast looking for the perfect fitness tracker smartwatch, this isn’t the one for you. A Garmin Forerunner or Fitbit would definitely suit you better. That said, this watch isn’t completely pointless as there are things to like about it."

Your PC will be doing all the work while your phone simply streams the content and your head movements. The whole idea of it is to allow you access to said content without having to nuke your wallet with an expensive VR headset.But it still has some limitations though. Aside from potential hardware issues where it doesn’t play nice with the software, VRidge is still in beta, and its not designed to be a total replacement for a dedicated VR headset. The developer Riftcat, even advises against buying VR games just to play on the emulator.

Rory Lee,HTC One A9 review: My torrid love affair with a smartphone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/09/htc-one-a9-review-my-torrid-love-affair-with-a-smartphone/,"android,android marshmallow,htc,htc one a9,htc one a9 review,htc one a9 review malaysia,one a9 review,one a9 review malaysia,smartphone review,mobile devices,mobile os,product review",,2016-05-09,"Ah, so we’ve arrived at this. HTC’s infamous One A9, the smartphone that had a negative label pegged to it from the moment it was officially unveiled in Malaysia — overpriced — and for good reason.From a price-to-spec perspective, there is really no justification for the One A9’s absurd price tag. But, I wouldn’t be here if that was the end of the One A9’s discussion.On paper, the One A9’s specs are almost laughable when paired to its RM2,299 price tag. In fact, I had quite the hearty laugh when I saw that price printed — no doubt to the chagrin of everyone else there. Nonetheless, I was interested to see how HTC could possibly justify it.No surprise that I didn’t find it in the performance aspect of the smartphone, nor did I find it in what was previously (before the HTC 10) the Taiwanese company’s best camera smartphone according to DxO Mark.So, what’s left?"

Sponsored,GrabHitch — the carpooling innovation beta launches in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/05/grabhitch-the-carpooling-innovation-beta-launches-in-malaysia/,"car pool,car pool malaysia,carpool,carpool malaysia,grab,grab malaysia,ride share,sponsored,android,cool stuff,ios,mobile os,others","Android,Cool stuff,iOS,Mobile OS,Others,Sponsored",2016-05-05,"GrabHitch enables anyone to offset the cost of their journey and meet awesome peeps. So be cool. Carpool.Carpooling is one of the most efficient ways to travel, and it lives up to the adage, “killing two birds with one stone”. After all, the end goal is the same destination, and it makes sense to travel in one vehicle where possible, right? This is the same mentality that a local startup has looked into providing for their users.With that in mind, ride-sharing platform Grab has just introduced GrabHitch, an affordable door-to-door service which caters to commuters who are traveling to and from a specific location. It covers the cost by picking up those who are heading to the same location in the first place.It’s easy to see how carpooling will make sense, it’s one of the most efficient ways to travel, its simply people matching two people going into the same direction and that is exactly what GrabHitch will do.By riding together, both drivers and passengers will be able to save cost together, meet new people and laugh together and both drivers and passengers will be able to save on cost of travel.
Since the advent of ride sharing apps, commuters in the Klang Valley have slowly started to embrace the idea of leaving their cars at home. However, most are still accustomed to having the flexibility and freedom of driving. Happily Grab has now introduced a very local solution that will enable drivers to cover the cost of owning a car all at their own convenience.Enter GrabHitch, a carpooling service available via the Grab app that allows drivers to pick up passengers going along the same way on their daily commute.“This latest service caters to both drivers and passengers who are cost-conscious. Drivers with extra space in their vehicles have the option of picking up passengers who are going the same way to offset the cost of his/her journey, whilst passengers only need to pay for a fraction of the cost compared to other option of transportation,” said Ngiam Xin Wei, Regional Head of GrabHitch.In essence, GrabHitch addresses the very uniquely Malaysian problem of single occupancy vehicles (SOVs) on the road. According a study conducted by Nielsen, Malaysia has the 3rd highest car ownership globally whereby 93% of Malaysian households own at least a car whilst 54% have more than one car. To add to that, 6 million trips are made in the Klang Valley alone on a daily basis via private cars, most of which are SOVs, that’s 83% of all travel on a daily basis.“Therefore, there is a significant pool of vehicles with extra seats for more passengers. Every car has the potential to play a part in improving Malaysia’s public transport network and meet the growing demand of rides each day,” said Jaygan Fu, Country Manager of Grab Malaysia.In addition to the convenience and price factor, GrabHitch is a welcomed alternative for various other reasons. Passengers can pre-book a ride from seven days in advance to up to 2 hours before pickup, by simply by entering their pickup location and destination. Drivers and passengers will be notified when a successful match of the route is made.GrabHitch drivers should only pick up one booking per trip and the fares will only cover the driver’s variable costs, such as petrol and car depreciation. Drivers can also enjoy the security of choosing their passengers according to preferences built into the app such as, same gender only, nearest, least detour, best price or has mutual Facebook friends.GrabHitch is now open for the driver signup. Drivers can download or update their Grab App to the latest version which is available for free on Google Play or App Store. To sign-up, just click on the “GrabHitch” icon, select the “Drive” button and follow the instructions. For commuters, they can start scheduling rides GrabHitch effective May 15, 2016. In fact, to kick off this new service, on May 16, our GrabHitch pioneers, consisting of staff of Grab Malaysia and our very first batch of GrabHitch drivers, will be on the road offering free rides to passengers.To find out more about Grab and GrabHitch, please log on to www.grab.com/my/hitch"
Rory Lee,Lenovo’s funky concoctions make it to our shores and they’re pretty awesome,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/06/hands-on-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-tablet-yoga-tab-3-pro-yoga-900s/,"2-in-1,android,convertible,laptop,lenovo,lenovo malaysia,lenovo thinkpad x1,lenovo thinkpad x1 tablet,lenovo yoga,lenovo yoga 900s,lenovo yoga tab 3 pro,tab 3 pro,tablet,cool stuff,mobile devices,mobile os,windows 10","Android,Cool stuff,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-05-06,"Lenovo launched a massive roster of devices today. These products come in from all across the range from entry-level to high-end plus a bunch of funky new items. While time was rather limited, I did get to spend time with some of the more interesting items at the launch.First up is the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet. This is the same one we saw at CES earlier this year and it honestly feels pretty good. I like new approaches that disrupt the way everyone builds devices, which is probably why I love modular devices so much.The ThinkPad X1 Tablet isn’t exactly modular, however, as it functions a lot like the LG G5 when it comes to how modules work. The G5 is a solid smartphone by itself and will probably work just as well regardless of whether it has a special module in it.Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Tablet is pretty much the same story. This device has three modules — a RealSense camera module, a battery module, and a projector module — that attaches to the bottom of the tablet.At the demo, the tablet only had the battery module — which gives it an extra 5 hours of battery life on top of its 10 hour quoted life. The battery module snapped on pretty easily (and securely) plus it’s hotswapable so you don’t have to power down the tablet before hooking it up.Lenovo calls it a productivity module and I can sort of see that as it does come with a HDMI, OneLink+ and a full sized USB port plus it raises the tablet to a nice height for typing. Speaking of typing, the ThinkPad X1 Tablet has a pretty awesome keyboard, but it has a peculiar Fn key placement that I keep accidentally pressing when I want to hit Ctrl instead.In terms of build, the ThinkPad X1 Tablet feels pretty solid and I rather like the rear kickstand’s rigidity. The only qualm I have with it is the way you need to pop it out from it’s latch. I guess that would eliminate accidental kickstand releases, but I would’ve prefered a nice strong magnet instead.Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet specifications:Operating System: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, Windows 8.1 Driver Support
Processor: Up to Intel Core m7 vPro
Graphics: Intel HD Integrated Graphics
Memory: 16GB LPDDR3
Storage: Up to 512GB SSD

Weight: Tablet — 770g, Keyboard — 300g
Security: Touch Sensor Fingerprint Reader
I/O Ports: 1xUSB3.0, 1xUSB Type-C Power Delivery, Mini DisplayPort, microSD Audio, Nano SIM.
Price: RM6,699I’ll be frank, the YOGA 900s is gorgeous. It’s Lenovo’s super-light super-portable convertible laptop with their signature watchband hinge. TL;DR? Well, it’s super light, weighing in at only 999g and the hinge works like a marvel.When it comes to the hinge, it’s really fun to flip it into laptop and tablet mode thanks to that watchband design, but because of how light it is, don’t expect to be able to do the one-handed flip open.It’s display is pretty good too, packing up to a 12.5-inch QHD IPS panel that’s touch sensitive. The only thorn in its side is the mushy keyboard.Compared to the one on the ThinkPad X1 Tablet, the YOGA  900s just feels incredibly dissatisfying. Key presses were nowhere near as tactile or as satisfying and that’s a pretty big deal to me since I’m eyeing this as a productivity device.Still, if lightness and portability are your thing, then the YOGA 900s is a pretty solid device in my books. Regarding performance, I can’t really judge because of my limited time with it, but it does come with up to a 6th generation Core i7 processor and a 265GB PCIe SSD.Lenovo YOGA 900s specifications:Operating System: Windows 10 Home
Processor: Up to 6th Generation Intel Core i7

Weight: Starts at 999g
Connectors: 1xUSB Type A 3.0, 1xUSB Type C 3.0 with Video-out, 1xDC-in with USB 2.0 function, Audio combo jack.
Price: From RM5,999The third and final product that really caught my eye was this 10.1-inch Android tablet with a built-in pico projector. Yup, located inside the hinge-like end of this tablet is a 50 lumens 480p pico projector that lets you project what’s on your screen to the nearest wall.Lenovo says that this can project a screen up to 70-inches but I figure that has to be in a rather dark room because even on the show floor’s tiny demo, I was rather disappointed with the brightness and resolution of the projected display.Nevertheless, this is a really cool piece of technology because you don’t have to worry about lugging around an extra accessory around for presentations or sharing funny cat videos with your friends. That said, the hinge area is rather thick and gets quite hot once the projector gets up and running.Then again, since it’s a projector, this really isn’t surprising as even Lenovo’s Pocket Projector get’s super hot (almost too hot to touch) after awhile. This YOGA Tab 3 Pro is designed to be the ultimate “video tablet” thanks to its 10.1-inch QHD display and its Dolby Atmos enabled 4-JBL speaker sound bar.Unfortunately, I couldn’t see how well this actually performs as a “video tablet”, so I won’t pass judgement on that claim yet. It does look promising, though.Lenovo YOGA Tab 3 Pro specifications:Operating System: Android 5.1 Lollipop
Processor: Intel Atom X 5-Z8500 (2M Cache, Quad Core, up to 2.24GHz)
Memory: 2GB LPDDR3

If you’ve ever been lost or utterly befuddled by travel or credit card insurance plans, then GoBear is here to help you.GoBear calls their service an insurance Meta Search engine. What this means is that it’s like Google or TripAdvisor but for insurance/finance policies and plans.One of the things GoBear prides themselves on is their unbiased comparisons. The company accomplishes this by not taking any incentive or payments from insurance companies. In other words, they do not do paid content (banner ads, etc) on their website so that frees them from any bias stemming from financial sources.Besides that, GoBear also claims to make the process of comparing insurance plans simple and easy to understand by stripping the plans down to their “bear” essentials. Take travel insurance plans, for example. GoBear has identified five major categories — Personal Accident, Medical Expenses, Loss of Baggage, Trip Cancellation and Emergency Medical Evacuation — that they think consumers will value most.To search for a plan, simply enter your destination, type of trip, the number of people travelling, duration of travel and hit “search plans”. The results can then be filtered appropriately according to your needs.Users can also pick up to 4 plans to do a detailed comparison between them. Once they’ve decided on a plan, simply hit “Go to provider” and GoBear will transfer the user to the provider’s site.It’s a pretty slick interface and the fact that there are no ads or pop-up banners makes the overall experience that much smoother.For now, GoBear Malaysia can only compare travel insurance and credit card finance plans, but the company plans to add personal loan, car insurance and life insurance by the end of the year. Currently, GoBear has records for over 40 travel insurance plans, 196 credit cards and 37 Islamic cards.For more information, you can head on over to their website to check it out for yourself. For now, there is no mobile app for GoBear yet but there are plans for it to come in the future. However, it is worth noting that the GoBear site is very well optimised for the mobile browser."

The leak comes from NowhereElse, and details the successor to the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra which launched last year. The previous leak showed off what looks like a prototype of the gigantic phone, along with a closeup of its massive front camera.In terms of design it looks surprisingly close to its Xperia X siblings which were launched at MWC this year.
The Xperia C6 Ultra will have an octa-core MediaTek MT6755 processor clocking 1.9GHz under the hood, alongside what might be 2GB RAM as well as 16GB expandable storage. As for the display, it will be a rather phablety 6″ full-HD screen, with a 16 MP camera parked out front with an LED flash and a 20 MP camera on the rear. It definitely looks like it will be carrying on the tradition of being a selfie centric phone with the rest of its innards being pretty mid-range.Aside from this, there’s no news whether or not the Xperia C6 and the Xperia C6 Ultra are the same smartphone, nor is there any info as to when the phone might be announced. As with all leaks, there’s still quite a bit that’s possibly subject to change so take it with a pinch of salt and hope that Sony says something soon.[SOURCE][VIA]"

The amount of time people spend on social media is also increasing exponentially. Social sites like Facebook and Twitter used to be for people, but now we’re finding pages for pets, cartoon characters and video game icons.Social media is taking over human lives and Malaysians are at the forefront of this revolution.Facebook recently set up shop here in Malaysia but the fact that they did isn’t that important. What is important is why, and the why is that Malaysians spend more time on Facebook than almost any other country in the world.By percentage alone, Facebook reveals that 80% of all Malaysians who have access to the internet are also on Facebook. That brings the number to 18 million users — that’s more than half of our entire population. What’s more, Malaysians also have 1.6 times more friends than the global average.We also spend a whole lot of time consuming video content on Facebook as their statistics reveal that we spend on average 159 minutes watching videos on the social media site. That’s 55% more than the global average of 102 minutes. We also spend more time watching videos on our smartphones (66 minutes) than we do watching live television (59 minutes)This places our tiny country in the top 10 in the world for video consumption (time spent watching) on Facebook. That is higher than any other country in the Southeast Asian region — a region that has more than 241 million Facebook users!We also find out about most of our stuff from Facebook. According to statistics provided by Facebook, 94% of Malaysians discover products and brands on Facebook and 62% of them makes a purchase after the discovery.Like it or not, Malaysians love their Facebook and the big blue giant has taken notice.

Alexander Wong,A closer look at the Huawei P9 trio,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/05/hands-on-with-the-huawei-p9-p9-plus-p9-lite/,"bali,huawei malaysia,huawei p9,huawei p9 first impressions,huawei p9 hands on,huawei p9 launch,huawei p9 lite,huawei p9 lite malaysia,huawei p9 malaysia,huawei p9 plus,huawei p9 plus malaysia,huawei p9 series,android,huawei,mobile devices,mobile os",,2016-05-05,"Huawei has started the year on a high note. According to IDC, they currently ranked #3, propelled by their focus on making premium smartphones. It all began with the Huawei P8, followed by the Mate S, Nexus 6P and the Mate 8.If you’re looking for a new flagship, they have just launched the Huawei P9 series during their South Pacific region event in Bali. The trio includes the standard P9 along with its P9 lite and P9 Plus variants. Read on for our first impressions.If you liked the Huawei P8, you would feel right at home with the P9. It retains the same 5.2” display size with full HD resolution and they have also kept the same placements for its buttons. The build of the P9 is noticeably refined compared to its predecessor. It has rounded corners around the edges, while the screen uses a curved 2.5D glass, making it super slick to swipe your fingers from the sides. The P9 at 6.95mm is slightly thicker than the P8 (6.4mm) but it retains the same weight of 144 grams. Moving towards the back, it gets a familiar matte metal feel as the Huawei P8. What’s noticeably different is a camera visor at the top, like the Nexus 6P. Aligned towards the left are two 12MP f/2.2 cameras that boast a pixel size of 1.25 micron. The two sensors play a different role, with one taking in RGB colours while the second unit takes images in monochrome, which is combined by its own picture algorithm for greater detail. There’s also laser focus that helps when dealing with closer subjects. Like the P8, the camera module is flush without any protruding camera bumps. On Leica’s involvement, Huawei explains that Leica has been instrumental in the development of both software and hardware. While the camera components are not made by Leica, the German optics company were deeply involved when developing P9’s picture quality algorithm. For a unique experience, the camera interface uses a custom Leica UI with their official fonts and shutter sound. After all, the Leica stamp is only given if a product meets its stringent standards. During our hands on, the interface takes a while to get used to as it is different from other Huawei devices we’ve tried before. Taking photos are snappy but it isn’t as fast compared to a Galaxy S7 edge. We will be posting a camera comparison soon to compare the results with other flagship smartphones. For the front, it gets an 8MP f/2.4 shooter for all your selfie needs. For security, Huawei makes one of the best fingerprint scanners in the market. The P9 takes bio-metric security up a notch with a forth layer that detects 3D ridges on your fingertips. It is still easy to set up with a couple of taps and it unlocks instantly on a single touch. Browsing through the P9, it feels rather smooth with no lag or performance issues to report. Huawei is still using its in-house developed Kirin processor and the P9 runs on their new Kirin 955 64-bit octa-core unit (4x 2.5GHz A72 x 4x 1.8GHz A53). There will be 2 specs coming to Malaysia – a higher end 4GB RAM + 64GB storage and a standard 3GB RAM + 32GB storage option. As usual, you can expect dual-SIM support with expandable microSD storage on its hybrid SIM tray. The P9 also has finally joined the reversible USB Type-C bandwagon and it gets a 3,000mAh capacity battery, which is larger than the P8’s 2,680mAh unit. It currently runs on EMUI 4.1 with Android 6.0, and Huawei says that it will stay buttery smooth after pro-longed use thanks to its built-in software optimiser. If you’re interested in getting one, expect to pay more than the RM1,799 launch price for the Huawei P8.Huawei P8 vs P9"

Those in the Empower theme revolve around enterprise offerings and security, those in the Engage line are for people who are always on the go and the Experience line are where the all-rounder devices reside.Among those launched today were the Yoga 900s ultra-light convertible laptop, the ultra light ThinkPad X1 Carbon and finally the ThinkPad X1 Tablet, which is the only tablet that supports a protector module.Made for those who need a bit of versatility, Lenovo’s Yoga 900s is capable of four usage modes and is capable of transforming on the fly thanks to its watchband hinge. So if you want to just watch stuff on it like on a tablet, just flip it and you’re good to go.The ultra-light ThinkPad X1 Carbon on the other hand, gets its name from its carbon-reinforced chassis and the fact it weighs just 1.18kg, just about as light as it gets. This is the 3rd 4th gen of the device so you get the choice of an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 4GB/8GB RAM and an optional touchscreen display.Last but not least, the ThinkPad X1 Tablet is specially made for those looking for a mobile workhorse which they can take anywhere. It even has an optional projector module out back that allows you to make presentations without having to fumble with hooking your laptop up to a big, old school projector.The keyboard is also detachable, so it can be a notebook one moment and transform into a tablet when you need it.All the devices will be available starting now at Lenovo authorized dealers and retailers.Pricing are as follows:Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet RM 6,699Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon from RM 7,000Lenovo Yoga 900s From RM 5,999You can check out the full list of pricing and release dates for the rest of the devices here."

Aside from letting you do advance bookings, it also lets you select the kind of Uber you want, location for pickup and the time you want it to come. The app will also check if you’re willing to pay extra if surge pricing is in effect when your request comes in.There is a caveat of course, as there’s no guarantee that an Uber driver will accept your request when you make it just because it was pre-scheduled. The rides are still subject to rider availability at the time.The app seems to only be available on iTunes as of the moment, so it’s a no-go for Android users for now. Perhaps this will encourage Uber to eventually implement the feature for themselves?[SOURCE][VIA]"

So why not have something that can do it for you?This is the ResetPlug, a device that’s designed to keep an eye on your internet connection and automatically cycle your router and modem’s power till your ‘net comes back, if it detects a problem. These features make it good for people who have smart appliances which are reliant on the ‘net to stay functional like security cameras or those who just don’t want to do it manually.It isn’t cheap though, as it carries a pretty fat $59.99 pricetag, but you won’t need a special remote or smartphone app to activate it. Probably won’t be all that useful to you if your router happens to be at arm’s reach but it would save you on a lot of trouble if you install it for someone who can’t (or is unable) to reset their connection on their own.If you’re keen on getting it for yourself, you can pick it up from their online store here.[SOURCE][VIA]"

Multiple GoPro Hero4s were strapped to the body of a rocket during its suborbital launch at Spaceport America in New Mexico on 6th November 2015.The rocket achieves speeds as high as Mach 5 and climbed to 396,405 feet (about 121,000 metres).

After eliminating the duplicates from the Russian hacker’s original 1.17 billion records, the company came to a total of 272 million unique IDs.Of which 40 million came from Yahoo Mail, 33 million accounts from Microsoft and 24 million from Gmail.

This replaces the Huawei P8 and it retains the same compact 5.2″ display as before.Huawei P9The design of the P9 is more refined with rounded corners and the use of 2.5D glass for the front as well as its rear camera visor. Underneath its unibody metal design is an Octa-Core Kirin 955 processor that’s mated to either 3GB or 4GB RAM along with a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of onboard storage. The display is a 5.2″ IPS unit that pushes full HD 1080p resolution.Photography is the main focus for the Huawei P9 which carries a twin 12MP f/2.2 camera set up that’s co-engineered with Leica. It is further assisted with dual tone LED flash and a hybrid AF system with laser auto focus. Unlike other dual camera smartphones we’ve seen before, one sensor shoots in colour while the other in monochrome to capture more details, contrast and light information.Photos are enhanced further with Leica’s Picture Quality Algorithm. For selfies, the P9 shoots 8MP pics from the front that’s enhanced with a host of beautification features. As you would expect from a flagship smartphone, the P9 gets a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner at the back which unlocks in a single tap.Powering the P9 is a 3,000mAh battery that charges up with USB Type-C. The headphone jack, this time, is also repositioned to the bottom. Out of the box, it runs on Android Marshmallow with Huawei’s EMUI 4.1 on top.P9 PlusFor those who prefer a larger screen experience, Huawei has also announced the P9 Plus with a larger 5.5″ Full HD AMOLED display. The specs are similar with a Kirin 955 processor and it comes in a 4GB RAM and 64GB storage option. The same Leica co-engineered cameras are retained and since it is a larger device, it packs a higher 3,400mAh battery.The P9 Plus also has another trick up its sleeve with Hi Fidelity audio playback from its speakers. It operates a lot like the new HTC 10 where the audio is separated into two portions — the treble from the top earpiece and bass from the bottom-firing speaker.

For imaging, it packs a 13MP f/2.0 main camera along with a 8MP f/2.0 front shooter. Despite being a Lite model, it also gets a 3,000mAh battery that charges via micro USB.

Rory Lee,Google Keyboard’s new update brings awesome new features,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/03/google-keyboards-new-update-brings-awesome-new-features/,"android,google,google apps,google keyboard,smartphone,mobile apps",Mobile Apps,2016-05-03,"Google Keyboard is by far my favourite keyboard app. It’s clean, minimalist and unobtrusive but perhaps the thing I like most about it is that it’s familiar. The keys are where I need them to be.The only thing is that the Google Keyboard is a little behind its competitors if we’re looking at functionality. Well, Google is looking to rectify that with a massive update to their Keyboard app.Version 5.0 is Google’s latest update to the Keyboard app and it comes with a whole host of new features. Stuff like one-handed mode, adjustable keyboard height in settings, and even improved gesture typing.One-handed mode will undoubtedly be welcomed by those who have large smartphones but want to use them with one hand. With this new update, simply hold the comma key and swipe your hand right to activate one-handed mode. Once there, you can switch which side you want the keyboard to be as well as hit a button to bring it back to full size.You can also now adjust the keyboard height in the settings menu. I don’t know about you but I prefer a shorter keyboard so that there’s more space for me to look at what I’m typing, plus I don’t have to reach too far to hit the top row of keys. Among my favourite quality of life improvements that came with the keyboard is the fact that you can now slide your finger on the spacebar to move the text cursor which does wonders for precise text selection. You can also swipe your finger on the backspace button to delete multiple words at a time.I liked the Google Keyboard for how barebones and minimalistic it was, but I have to admit, being able to slide your finger on the spacebar to move the cursor for individual text selection is something I definitely wanted to have.Maybe more features is a good thing, just as long as they keep the feel the same. I’d hate to have to start searching for a new keyboard app again.Keep in mind that these updates will roll out in stages so if you haven’t received it yet be patient. If you’d like to have a more detailed look at all the changes, check out Android Police’s article on it.If you’ve gotten the update already, what do you think about the new features?[SOURCE]"

This service is available for all existing Digi Postpaid plans with the only requirement being that the plan must have unlimited voice calls to all networks.That means, if you, for example, wanted to commit the bare minimum for an Internet Sharing activated plan, you can go for Digi’s lowest Postpaid 28 plan. With this, simply add RM10 for unlimited voice calls and an additional RM10 to activate the sharing feature within the plan which brings the total up to RM48/month excluding the cost of your supplementary lines.From there, you can choose (if you want) to purchase any of the three new internet top up booster packs that can be purchased with an Internet Sharing activated plan. These internet top up boosters offer a choice of either an additional 0.5GB of quota for RM5, 7GB of quota for RM35 or 12GB for RM50. This additional data is valid for 30 days from the date of purchase.In addition to this new service, Digi also introduced two new ways you can share your internet quota. The first is via an RM10/month “gadget SIM” which you can use to share your Digi Postpaid internet quota with your other devices like your tablet. This SIM is not capable of making calls, however.If you want to share between family members, Digi’s new Share with Family supplementary line gives you unlimited calls to all networks for RM38/month. This line does not have data, however, as its data quota comes from the shared quota of the principal line.To avoid unnecessary confusion, all the controls — including data allocation between supplementary lines — have been baked into the MyDigi app. This lets you easily manage the amount of data each supplementary line gets on the fly.The only caveat is that when you activate Internet Sharing on your principal line, you lose the ability to rollover your Internet data to the next month. But, all supplementary lines (should they come with their own data quota) will be able to roll over their own internet quota to the next month.For more information, you can head on over to their website."

The watch is compatible with phones on Android 4.4 Kitkat and up.Parents can monitor their kid’s location and set a “security zone” of sorts; which prompts said parents with alerts if they leave the area. Lastly, there’s an SOS button that will allow kids to broadcast their location along with 7 seconds of audio at a tap, in the event of an emergency.As for battery life, the Mi Bunny is home to a 300mAh battery, which Xiaomi says has about six days of standby time.Pricewise, the Mi Bunny is selling for ¥299 (about RM 181) with an adult version coming sometime later this year.[SOURCE][VIA]"

Launched at Acer‘s Global Press Conference in New York last week, the new Switch Alpha 12 and Aspire S 13 represents the company’s bid to strengthen their presence in this up-and-coming sector.With the limited time I got to spend with the devices, I was rather impressed.The Aspire S 13 promised quite a lot. I expected it to be an HP Spectre 13 killer considering both devices were designed to be ultra-thin ultra-portable laptops. But, that’s not what the S 13 is and I’ll be honest, I was a little disappointed going into this.However, this doesn’t mean that the Aspire S 13 is a bad laptop. During the brief amount of time I spent with the laptop, it does appear to fulfil a lot of what Acer wants it to be.One of the core foundations of Acer’s approach to tackling this year’s markets (and future growth) is their 2-in-1 and ultra-portable laptop/tablet devices. Alongside the Switch Alpha 12, the S 13 is supposed to be able to hit a section of the market that no other laptop in this form factor can.Priced at USD699 (around RM2,730), the Aspire S 13 is quite the steal considering the specs and just how thin this laptop is. But, at that price tag, some compromises were made and that’s evident when you pick the laptop up. It feels…cheap, for lack of a better word. The keyboard isn’t particularly impressive either as it feels rather mushy and unsatisfying.What was great, though, was the sunlight visibility from that 13-inch full-HD panel. The S 13’s screen has a matte finish to it — similar to that on the Predator 15/17 laptops — which does a great job of masking reflection and remaining visible even under the bright sunlight pouring in from the venue’s windows.It’s light too, coming in at a mere 1.3kg for the non-touch and 1.36kg for the touch variant. One benefit it has over the Spectre 13 is that this comes in a variant with a 10-point touch sensitive display. Some like it, some don’t, but I know after using one, it’s really hard for me to go back to using a non-touch display.Acer Aspire S 13 specifications:Operating System: Windows 10
Display: 13″ Full HD 1920×1080 IPS, 10-point touch (optional)
Processor: 6th Generation Intel Core i7, i5, i3U
Memory: Up to 8GB
Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 520
Storage: SSD up to 512GB
Dimensions: 327x228x14.8mm
Weight: 1.3kg (non-touch), 1.36kg (touch)
Battery Life: Up to 11 hours (non-touch), up to 13 hours (touch)I’ll be honest, I wasn’t expecting too much from Acer’s Switch Alpha 12. There are already so many 2-in-1 Windows laptop hybrids that have failed in their attempt to copy Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 that I wrote this device off before I even saw it.Once I did see it, though, I was pleasantly surprised because it was a Surface Pro 4 clone done right. Possibly done better.There is a common saying in many competitive sports and e-sports where if you can’t beat the best, copy them. And Acer has done that rather well. The first thing I noticed about Acer’s new 2-in-1 was how awesome the attached keyboard was — it was almost Surface Type Cover-like. In fact, it gave me the exact same typing experience the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover (so that’s great).Acer also borrowed a design cue from the Surface when it came to the rear mounted kickstand. The Switch Alpha 12’s kickstand works in pretty much the same way as the Surface Pro 4’s only that it takes the form of a handle instead of a flat panel. One improvement Acer made was to add a rubberised strip to the bottom of the kickstand which gives it nice grip when on a flat surface.In terms of build, the Surface Pro 4 wins out a little here, but the Switch Alpha 12 feels a lot more premium than Acer’s other portable workstation Aspire S 13 thanks to its anodised aluminium chassis.What does set it apart from the Surface Pro 4 (besides its much lower price tag of USD599 — around RM2,335), is that it’s the industry’s first fanless 2-in-1 laptop with a 6th Generation Intel Core i processor. Yup, even the base model comes with at least a Core i3U processor.Acer keeps everything cool and fanless with their new LiquidLoop technology. This uses a heat pipe to dissipate the heat through a continuous process of evaporation and condensation of the liquid stored within.A fanless solution is great for small devices because it means that Acer can seal the laptop up to prevent (or at least reduce) dust from getting in. It also means that the Switch Alpha 12 is completely silent even under heavy load.Pair that with a beautiful quad HD panel and the Switch Alpha 12 can really be an excellent workhorse that can last up to 8 hours on a single charge.Acer Switch Alpha 12 specifications:Operating System: Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Home

Rory Lee,Track your steps with the help of a familiar Italian plumber,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/03/super-mario-pebble-step-tracker/,"pebble,pebble smartwatch,pebble super mario,smartwatch,step tracker,smart watch",Smart Watch,2016-05-03,"UPDATE: Creator Steve Cicco informed us that the formatting for the Time Round has been updated!Step counters are usually limited numbers on a screen. Sometimes, they have a pair of shoes next to the numbers, other times they’ve got feet. Now, you can have the wonderful world of Super Mario as a visual gauge of how far you’ve walked today.Previously, website Mental Floss calculated the distance Mario had to run and swim in Super Mario Bros before he could rescue the princess. That came up to a total distance of 3.4 miles (about 5.47 km). Now, developer Steve Cicco has come up with a Pebble watchface that places you in the Mushroom Kingdom and tracks your steps to see how far you would make it in a day.Called Steps with Mario, this watchface isn’t a Mario game for your smartphone/smartwatch, however, it’s just a fun way to track your steps throughout the day.The watchface progresses through screenshots for each level of Super Mario Bros the more you walk and it also includes the date, time and battery percentage (represented by the coin count). Once you’ve hit 3.4 miles, you would have theoretically completed the game and the end screen will pop up only for it to be reset back to level 1-1 the next day.For now, this only works for Pebble smartwatches, but there is the off chance that someone might make something similar (or better) for Android Wear watches soon. Until then, if you have a Pebble smartwatch and you want to check this out, head on over here.UPDATE: The peculiar Time Round formatting has been updated.@Soya_Cincau I just updated the formatting for Round. Prob should’ve done that on 1st release! Check out the update & thx for the tweet 🙂— Steve Cicco (@scicco21) May 4, 2016I have to say, it definitely looks better.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

If you’re looking for the cheapest iPhone that’s usable in a single hand, you might want to consider this special iPhone 5s offer from Apple retailer, Machines.The iPhone 5s that was released about 3 years ago was previously priced from RM2,199 for the base 16GB model. With the imminent iPhone SE launch, Machines is offering the iPhone 5s 16GB at RM1,299 without a contract and it comes with a standard 1-year warranty. It is also available via installment from as low as RM113/month using HSBC, Citibank, Maybank and CIMB credit cards. Stocks are limited and the iPhone 5s promotion is valid at the following outlets:

UPDATE: Switch is also offering the iPhone 5s at RM1,299. More details here. To recap, the iPhone 5s is similar to the latest iPhone SE in size with a 4″ Retina Display (1136×640) and it is Apple’s first iPhone with a TouchID fingerprint scanner at the front. It is powered by Apple’s 64-bit A7 chip mated to 1GB of RAM and it features an 8MP camera with dual-tone LED flash at the back while the front gets a 1.2MP FaceTime HD camera. The iPhone SE, on the other hand gets their latest A9 chip, similar to its current iPhone 6s and it features a better 12MP main camera that shoots 4K videos. So instead of paying RM1,949 (iPhone SE 16GB), the iPhone 5s could be a cheaper alternative with a RM650 savings. Thanks Joshua Wong for the tip![ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Securing your phone is made easier without the hassles of entering pins or troublesome pattern unlock.  The honor 5X has one at the back and it does more than just keeping your phone safe. It does have a couple of interesting features to make this 5.5-inch smartphone a whole lot better to use.Read on to find out what you can do with the honor 5x’s fingerprint sensor. 
The honor 5X uses their newer Fingerprint Identification 2.0 that offers better performance, accuracy and it unlocks in just 0.5 seconds. Unlike other smartphones, setting it up requires only 6 taps. Unlocking the honor 5x with your finger is incredibly quick and it works with partial touches or with damp fingertips. On top of that, it constantly learns more about your fingerprint and it gets more accurate each time you use it. 
For a 5.5” smartphone, the honor 5X can be big for those with smaller hands. For those who love to take selfies, you can take the shot using the fingerprint sensor. There’s no need to stretch your thumb, just hold the device securely and tap the sensor gently with your index finger.
Your favourite contacts is just one touch away. The honor 5X allows you to preset a contact number to a specific fingerprint. Once registered, you can call your friends instantly even while the screen is locked.
Always find yourself launching Facebook or WhatsApp often? Similar to contacts, you can register specific apps to your desired finger. Regardless of which screen you’re on, you can launch your favourite app instantly with a single tap.

In addition, you can slide up on the sensor to view all your running/recent apps. To recap, the honor 5X is a premium looking mid-range smartphone that comes in a beautifully crafted all metal body. The front gets a 5.5” Full HD display and it is powered by a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core Processor with 2GB of RAM. It also gets a 13MP f/2.0 main camera and a front facing 5MP f/2.4 unit that has a wide 88 degree angle. For uncompromised connectivity and expansion, the honor 5X supports dual-SIMs with 4G support along with a dedicated microSD slot.

Its said to be much more accurate with a 0.002 percent failure rate, and being embedded in such a manner protects the sensor from physical damage and water.We don’t know when the tech will be hitting the market though, as LG hasn’t revealed when it will be releasing it and who might be adopting the technology into their mobiles.

Alexander Wong,Compared: Best postpaid plans with unlimited calls and lots of data for you and your family,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/02/malaysia-postpaid-comparison-with-supplementary-lines-digi-celcom-maxis-umobile/,"celcom,celcom first,celcom first gold,celcom first platinum,comparison,digi,digi postpaid,first blue,first gold,maxis,maxisone plan,maxisone share,postpaid comparison,u mobile,u mobile hero postpaid,u mobile p70,which postpaid,industry in general,players on the field",,2016-05-02,"Customers are really getting spoilt for choice when it comes to postpaid plans. After Celcom and Digi announced their latest offering, Maxis went out to boost their current MaxisONE Plans with even more data. On top of that, they have also upgraded their MaxisONE Share supplementary lines with a new DataPool feature. Similar to U Mobile’s Hero Postpaid Plus, DataPool lets you combine your overall data and you can share it across your supplementary accounts. So which postpaid plan is the best for your household? Read on to find out.
To recap Maxis’ latest offering, their MaxisONE Plan now comes with up to 20GB of data per month. On top of its unlimited voice and SMS bundling, the MaxisONE 98 still retains the last upgraded 5GB of quota, but the next MaxisONE 128 now gets 10GB of data. Meanwhile, MaxisONE 158 gets 15GB and their top of the line MaxisONE 188 gets 20GB. What’s new is their upgraded MaxisONE Share, where you can add additional supplementary lines (RM48/month) that comes with unlimited calls, SMS and 5GB of shared data. To make sharing easier, Maxis DataPool lets you share data between principal and supplementary lines which is somewhat similar to U Mobile’s Hero Plus Postpaid. For greater control, the principal line can manage how much data quota each supplementary line gets from the Maxis App. As an added bonus, Maxis is throwing extra 5GB/month of data video streaming quota for the principal line which is usable for iflix, viu, Eros now and hopster. 
For Digi, nothing much has changed since the last update. Following Maxis’ latest upgrade, Digi has increased its Digi Postpaid 238 (More Internet) data quota from 20GB to 30GB. Hitting the sweet spot is still their Postpaid 80 (More Calls & SMS) that offers 7GB (Anytime) + 3GB (Weekend) data and unlimited calls for RM80/month. Unlike the rest, Digi seems to have done away with dedicated supplementary plans. Instead, principal subscribers of Postpaid 48 and above can register additional Digi postpaid lines underneath them. The rest of the plan bundling remains unchanged and all you get is free calls and SMS between principal and supplementary lines.  
Celcom is probably having the simplest approach for postpaid. You get just 3 choices – FIRST Blue at RM45/month, FIRST Gold at RM80/month and FIRST Platinum at RM150/month. All three FIRST Plans are now extended until 31 May 2016. For additional lines, they have their usual FIRST 1+5 supplementary plan. At RM30/month you get 500MB of data, 50 minutes of calls and 50 SMS to all network. Also included is free calls and SMS between principal and supplementary lines. For the price, family members that need more data would be better off getting a FIRST Blue plan that offers 4GB of mobile data for RM15/month more. 
U Mobile has also extended its Hero Postpaid plan extra 8GB data offer until 31 December 2016. For RM70/month, it still a bargain offering a combined 15GB of data, unlimited calls and SMS. For additional lines for sharing, each Share 50 Member line costs RM50 and that gives you unlimited calls and extra 3GB of data that’s shared with the principal line. U Mobile also lets you watch unlimited video streaming 24/7 with no data charges with Video-Onz. This covers 11 video platforms including iflix, YouTube, viu, HyppTV Everywhere, Youku and Tonton. Note that speeds on Video-Onz are capped at 1.5Mbps which is said to be enough for standard definition. If you want to stream at higher quality, there’s an option to turn Video-Onz off. The Video-Onz promo is offered until 31 July 2016."

Rory Lee,Research says that e-cigarettes will help smokers quit tobacco for good,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/29/research-says-that-e-cigarettes-will-help-smokers-quit-tobacco-for-good/,"e-cig,e-cigarette,health,smoking,vape,vaping,others",Others,2016-04-29,"“Vaping” has taken the nation by storm. Where you used to see people chilling on their motorbikes or at a mamak stall taking a puff of their cigarette, now you see them inhaling questionable liquid through an unregulated electronic device.Why? Well, the argument was that vaping, or smoking an e-cigarette, was much healthier than a regular tobacco cigarette. In fact, the UK recently encouraged cigarette smokers to switch to e-cigs because it could “help them quit all tobacco use forever”.According to an article published by the New York Times, the Royal College of Physicians found that many of the earlier apprehensions people had with vaping and how it could potentially become a gateway into smoking traditional cigarettes were entirely false. In fact, they claimed that by making the switch to e-cigs, it could actually help people stop smoking entirely and urged smokers to make the switch.This contradicts the stand taken by many other countries including Malaysia. While our national government will not ban vaping outright on a national level, many states — like Terengganu, Kedah, Negri Sembilan, Johor and Kelantan — have done so on a state level. Last year, the National Fatwa Council of Malaysia also declared vaping as haram (forbidden).The rationale behind this apprehension is pretty straightforward: Although an e-cig is less harmful to the human body than a traditional cigarette (by up to 95% less) they’re still harmful.To make matters worse, these e-cigs (and the chemicals in liquid) are unregulated. This means that there is no set rule or guideline manufacturers have to follow when manufacturing vaping chemicals. Who knows what these manufacturers are willing to bake into their products to give it that extra kick.A while back, Wired did a piece on vaping and e-cigs to explore exactly how hazardous it was to a person’s health and wellbeing. Their findings leaned towards the unhealthy side of the fence. In fact, one of their interviewees even said that if accidentally ingested, the chemicals found in “vape juice” (the liquid that gets vapourised) could kill a child in about 20 minutes.To the average smoker, the appeal of e-cigs is pretty apparent. The e-cig serves as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes because they deliver nicotine without the cancer-causing substances like tar. However, I’m not convinced that vaping will eventually lead to someone quitting tobacco entirely, and for one simple reason:If there is a healthier way to do something I love, why on earth would I stop doing it? I know that if I could eat Big Macs every day without getting sick or fat, I definitely wouldn’t be in any hurry to stop.[SOURCE, 2, 3, 4, VIA]"

However, you won’t be finding any discounts on this store, as they still will be selling their products at official price.You can view the Samsung store on Lazada in its entirety here."

However, while it might share quite a bit in common with the former device, its certainly not similarly priced.Under the hood, the Honor 5C has a  Kirin 650 chip mated to 2GB RAM alongside 16GB expandable storage that can be bumped up to a max of 128GB via microSD slot. It also is home to a 5.2 inch IPS FullHD screen and a 3,000mAh battery. The camera you’ll be getting here is a 13MP rear snapper with LED flash and f/2.0 aperture as well as a 8MP selfie shooter with a similar f/2.0 lens.On top of all that, the phone also has dual-SIM support and comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with EMUI version 4.1 on top. For all its similarities to the P9 Lite, the Honor 5C doesn’t have a USB Type-C connection and is a tiny bit heavier at 156g. Of course, the phone has a fingerprint sensor out back as well.The device will be available in three colour options and retails for CNY 899 (about RM 543) for the 3G-only model, while the 4G model runs for CNY 999 (about RM 604) as opposed to the P9 Lite which runs for about $300 (about RM 1174).

Rory Lee,Here’s why you should pick up the Galaxy S7 over the S7 edge,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/28/heres-why-you-should-pick-up-the-galaxy-s7-over-the-s7-edge/,"android,galaxy s7,galaxy s7 better,galaxy s7 malaysia,malaysia,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy s7 edge,samsung galaxy s7 malaysia,samsung galaxy s7 price,samsung galaxy s7 vs s7 edge,smartphone,why buy the galaxy s7,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-04-28,"I feel like a broken record when I say this, but the Galaxy S7 edge is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best smartphones you can buy in Malaysia now. Mostly because when it came to Samsung’s two new flagship devices, only one made its way onto our shores…until now.But, why would you want to pick up the “little brother” Galaxy S7 smartphone instead of just going the extra mile for the bigger, more prestigious S7 edge? Well, now we’re going to tell you.Sure, when I say “go the extra mile” it sounds like an insignificant amount, but if you really do the math (there isn’t actually that much math, it just sounds more dramatic like this), picking up the Galaxy S7 over the edge variant will save you RM400.That’s a lot of dough no matter how you slice it. Let’s say you have RM3,099 to spend on a smartphone, you could just pick up the Galaxy S7 edge and that will be the end of it. But, if you were to opt for the Galaxy S7 (RM2,699) instead, you would have enough money to pick up a 128GB microSD card and still have about RM150-RM170 leftover to splurge on a case and screen protector of your choice.You’ve probably heard of the Galaxy S7 edge’s problems with palm rejection and accidental presses due to the dual-edge screen. Well, the Galaxy S7 doesn’t have any of those problems plus it comes in a smaller form factor so that makes one-handed usage all the easier.What’s more, the smartphone loses none of the power packed into its larger sibling. It still has that magnificent Exynos 8890 octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM and that gorgeous quad-HD SuperAMOLED display. In fact, the display looks even better because the same amount of pixels are placed on a smaller 5.1-inch panel which translates to a higher pixel density of 577ppi.The higher pixel density doesn’t only mean a better viewing experience in normal circumstances, it is also better for VR content consumption.Sure, you must be thinking: “But wait, the S7 has a smaller battery, shouldn’t that impact battery life?”. Well, yes, but it also has a smaller display which allows the device to be more frugal than its larger sibling so we should see roughly the same battery performance despite the smaller 3.000 mAh cell.Yup, all 12-megapixels of Dual Pixel glory. Easily one of the strongest highlights of Samsung’s new flagship smartphones comes mounted to the back of their devices. The primary camera is something absolutely remarkable not only because of how well it takes photos but also how easy and snappy it is to just point and shoot.The Dual Pixel technology allows near instantaneous focusing in almost all lighting conditions and the larger 1.4micron pixels paired with a super fast f/1.7 aperture lens translates to an epic low light performance. What’s more, with the smaller footprint, it makes one-handed snapshots that much easier.People often complain that smartphones don’t come in small sizes anymore. I agree with that, but I’m someone who likes big smartphones so that really doesn’t bother me at all.I do know that there are many people with small hands who really want a smaller smartphone. While I don’t think this smartphone is reasonable enough to use on the daily, the Galaxy S7’s 5.1-inch form factor hits a sweet spot.You get a large enough display to enjoy all the awesome things a smartphone has to give but it’s small enough to fit in one hand. The S7 also has a much more noticeable curve on the back (think Note5) so that makes it even easier and more comfortable to hold in the hand.You really don’t lose much of anything by picking up the Galaxy S7. Unless you’re hard pressed on the larger 5.5-inch display, I would definitely say pick up the regular S7 and save yourself a considerable chunk of cash without losing any of the magic that makes the S7 edge the amazing smartphone that it is."

The Galaxy S7 with a flat display is smaller at 5.1″, making it easier to hold in a single hand.  The Galaxy S7 is priced officially at RM2,699 and it comes in 3 colours – Gold, Silver and Black. Like the S7 edge, it comes with 32GB on board storage that can be expanded using microSD via a hybrid dual-sim slot. In terms of specs, the standard S7 still uses a Quad HD Super AMOLED display and it also runs on an Octa-Core Exynos 8890 processor with 4GB of RAM. For optics, it retains the same Dual Pixel 12MP main camera with OIS, while the front gets a 5MP selfie shooter. Photos are brighter with its f/1.7 aperture lens and it uses the front display to illuminate selfies in low light conditions. Obviously with a smaller screen it comes with a slightly smaller 3,000mAh (S7 edge: 3,600mAh) battery but it also supports quick charge and wireless charging. The Galaxy S7 is available starting tomorrow at all Samsung authorised outlets. So which would you get? The Galaxy S7 at RM2,699 or the S7 edge at RM3,099? Let us know in the comments down below."

After another disappointing performance by the Lumia 950 XL, we were all but certain Microsoft was going to axe it.It turns out though that Microsoft has other ideas.Thanks to an internal email obtained by Windows Central, it appears the software company isn’t ready to ditch its mobile efforts. Instead, Microsoft Windows and devices chief Terry Myerson has reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the underperforming platform.I understand that you are hearing concerns from certain partners about Microsoft’s commitment to the mobile space.Let me be very clear: We are committed to deliver Windows 10 on mobile devices with small screen running ARM processors.We are currently in development of our next generation products and I wanted to reconfirm our commitment to Windows 10 Mobile. We believe in this product’s value to business customers and it is our intention to support the Windows 10 Mobile platform for many years. We have a device roadmap to support that from Microsoft as well as our OEM partners who will also be selling an expanded lineup of phone devices based on this platform.One thing worth noting from that email besides the fact that Microsoft intends to continue support for Windows 10 Mobile is that they’re planning for a more business-centric approach to the platform. This probably hints at the rumoured Surface Phone that’s supposedly set to launch in April of 2017.Windows Central also suggests that the upcoming Surface Phone is the “most secure phone in the world” and the “best for productivity” — perfect for business then. The hints towards productivity could likely be an improved Continuum platform, which in its current state, turns your smartphone into a mini desktop computer.Either way, I look forward to Microsoft’s upcoming devices. Kudos to them for not abandoning existing Windows Phone users and promising to support the platform for “many years” to come. More choice is never a bad thing. Who knows, maybe the Surface Phone will be everything we ever wanted from a Windows 10 Mobile device.What do you guys think?[SOURCE, VIA]"

Now, this highly anticipated laptop has finally made its way to Malaysia.In the past, water cooling had always been a desktop-only affair for a multitude of reasons, one of them being the space required to run the liquid coolants. With the ROG GX700VO, ASUS opted for a slightly different approach.Instead of finding a way to cram all the gear necessary for a water cooling solution, ASUS has decided to opt for a water cooling dock which you can hook the GX700VO up to. With this plug-and-play solution, ASUS has managed to keep the GX700VO itself portable — at least by gaming laptop standards — when you just want to bring it to Starbucks with you for some lighter productivity work.Without the water cooling dock, the laptop weighs in at about 3.6kg (almost 1kg less than the newly launched Acer Predator 17X) but that weight gets bumped up by 4.8kg if you attach the dock (total weight: 8.4kg).Being a gaming laptop, the ROG GX700VO doesn’t skimp on specs. It packs a sixth-generation Intel Core i7-6820HK processor clocked at 2.7GHz with 32GB of RAM (expandable to 64GB) and a desktop-grade NVIDIA GeForce GTX980 graphics card with 8GB of GDDR5 memory. It gets two 256GB M.2 SSDs in raid0 for mass storage.That said, all of this comes at a price though as the ASUS ROG GX700VO will cost RM18,999. The good news is that ASUS will be throwing in a cabin-sized four-wheeled trolley bag to help you transport your massive gaming laptop and it’s water cooling unit. It will be available from today onwards at all authorised ASUS retailers. For more information, you can head on over to the product site.ASUS are also holding their first League of Legends Champion’s Cup tournament which is taking place at the Sunway Pyramid Ice Rink on 25 June 2016 with prizes worth up to RM60,000.

A total of 334.9 million smartphones were shipped which is a marginal 0.2% increase over the same quarter last year at 334.4 million. Maintaining its top position is Samsung with 81.9 million units shipped, which is a 0.6% YoY decline (Q1 2015: 82.4 million) but they have maintained a strong market share of 24.5%. Among the top 5, Apple suffered the biggest hit as expected with its first ever decline in 13 years. They have shipped 16.3% fewer phones at 51.2 million units and they currently have a market share of 15.3%.The Chinese brands are the biggest winners in the first quarter. While the top 2 are showing decline, the Chinese trio – Huawei, OPPO and vivo have shown tremendous growth in both shipments and market share. Huawei had shipped 27.5 million units, while OPPO and vivo shipped 18.5 million and 14.3 million respectively. Out of the three, OPPO was the fastest growing with a 153.2% growth in the first quarter. According to IDC, Samsung remained strong due to its vigurous push for its new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge flagships. This is also aided by its affordable Galaxy J series  in the emerging markets. For Apple, IDC reported that iPhone 6 owners may not be compelled to switch to the newer iPhone 6s/6s Plus. On the other hand, Apple hopes to tap into emerging markets with the iPhone SE. However, for the price, it faces more stiffer competition with more powerful and affordable Android devices in China and India.Huawei is still dominant in their home ground China market and they are aggressively growing their presence out of China to clinch the top 3 spot. The Chinese brand takes a two-pronged approach with great focus on premium models like the P9, Mate and Nexus 6 as well as entry-level models from its honor line up. As for OPPO and vivo, their biggest growth is said to be attributed to its push at lower-tier cities. OPPO’s marketing efforts are mostly leaning towards entertainment sponsorships while the vivo are focused towards pushing its audio capabilities. It’s been said before, the Chinese are taking over.[ SOURCE ]"
Rory Lee,Acer’s new Predators keeps things simple and focuses on what “gamers want”,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/28/acer-predator-17x-predator-g1-gaming-pc-vr/,"acer,acer gaming,acer global press conference new york,acer predator,gaming,gaming desktop,gaming laptop,next at acer,next@acer,portable gaming,predator gaming laptop,windows 10","Acer,Windows 10",2016-04-28,"Predator. A menacing word that describes a creature that preys on others in its specific food chain. In gaming, it refers to Acer’s line of hardcore gaming gear designed, no doubt, with a similar concept in mind: To dominate the competition.But, with Acer‘s latest Predator launches at their Global Press Conference event last week in New York, the gaming line seems to have taken a peculiar turn. A turn that might cause some to question if the Predator was starting to become the prey.At their global event, dubbed Next@Acer, the company launched two new Predator machines — the Predator 17X gaming laptop and the Predator G1 mini-tower desktop.Both of these devices are behemoths when it comes to performance, packing top-of-the-line specifications into incredibly portable form-factors. Acer also utilises their “expertise” in thermal management to ensure that despite the small cases (which are notorious for poor airflow and cooling) the devices will still run at acceptable temperatures.So, why this focus on portability? Well, when I had a chat with Acer IT Products Business president Jerry Kao, he was very passionate in explaining their direction when it came to these two new Predators. The gist? It was what gamers wanted.Take the Predator 17X for example. On the surface, it looks (and feels) a lot like the older Predator 17 laptop with its nice soft touch finish and red LED accents. That’s because what’s new with this is on the inside.Along with the Predator G1, the new Predator 17X is “VR Ready”. Virtual Reality is likely going to be the “next big thing” when it comes to gaming because it offers immersion like no other medium has before this. The problem with that level of immersion is that it requires a whole lot of high-end hardware to run smoothly.In fact, a recent article by BBC News suggests that less than 1% of all PCs out there right now are VR Ready. With the new Predators, though, you can join that exclusive 1%. What’s more, the Predator 17X is one of the few gaming laptops in the world that is capable of performing this feat and a lot of that is down to the full desktop-grade NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 graphics card with 8GB of GDDR5 memory.That means, when you hook this laptop up to VR headsets like HTC’s Vive and the Oculus Rift, you can be confident that there will be no stuttering or performance issues during your gaming sessions. That’s pretty darn awesome for a laptop.Sure, it hasn’t got a water-cooling unit like ASUS’s ROG GX700 or a mechanical keyboard like the MSI GT80 Titan, but it sticks to the roots of what makes it a gaming laptop — maximum power that still manages to be portable.Well, portable in the most literal of senses because the Predator 17X weighs a massive 4.55kg. But, at least it doesn’t have a gigantic optional water-cooling dock mounted on the back. Instead, Acer opts for a new triple-fan solution that sucks in cool air from the front of the laptop (not the bottom) and shoots it out the back.The Predator 17X, according to Acer, isn’t an exercise in pushing the boundaries of what you can feasibly add to a gaming laptop like the GX700 and GT80 Titan. Instead, it is an innovation that Acer says stems from giving gamers what they want.This means that while these new Predators may not have the flashy fangs of their competition, it doesn’t mean that they have lost any of their edge or lethality. They’re honed to accomplish one purpose and one purpose alone and on the surface, Acer seems to have done a pretty good job.What do you guys think of the new Predators?

Not only is it Huawei’s latest and greatest phablet, it’s also one of the most powerful ones in the market. Powered by Huawei’s homegrown Kirin 950 processor mated to 3GB/4GB of RAM and 32GB/64GB of internal storage, the Mate 8 has got more than enough horsepower to run with the big boys.What’s more, it’s got a much bigger display than a lot of this year’s flagships which puts it at #1 on the list for many who like to consume a lot of video content, browse web pages and play mobile games. But, it is up against some pretty amazing smartphones too.That said, the Mate 8 does have some tricks up its sleeve that you probably won’t be able to find on many of this year’s flagship smartphones, not even on the mighty Samsung Galaxy S7 edge.The Mate 8 has a massive 4,000 mAh battery.

That’s a pretty amazing battery performance especially from a smartphone that large.What’s more, you can also help a friend out who is running low on battery by giving them a quick charge via an OTG cable and still have enough battery power to last an entire day.First up is Knuckle Sense. Knuckle Sense is a feature on the Mate 8 that allows you to use Knuckle Gestures to get some additional functionality out of your device. There are many different gestures for getting the phone to do different things.The first is a simple double tap with one knuckle on your screen. That takes a screenshot which you can then choose to share edit or discard. You can also choose to screenshot a specific section of the screen by drawing on it with your knuckle.This is pretty handy because you won’t have to remember any archaic button combos or perform complicated swiping to get your screenshot.A double tap with two knuckles activates a screen record function which records whatever is on your screen. It also picks up audio from the microphone so you can narrate while recording your screen at the same time.Besides that, you can also draw a line horizontally across your screen with one knuckle to activate multi-window mode. Finally, you can draw alphabets on the display to open certain specific applications that can be preset in the settings menu.Most fingerprint sensors are there for the additional layer of biometric security, but not the Mate 8’s. In addition to the improved biometric security, you can also use it to navigate around your phone, answer a call, stop an alarm or even take a photo.To activate it, simply dive into the settings menu and look for Fingerprint ID. Inside, you can pick and choose what Fingerprint ID gestures you want activated as well as what kind of slide gestures you want to use."

Well, LEAGOO is here to put those worries to bed with their new Shark 1 flagship smartphone that packs a massive battery and quick-charge technology.The Shark 1 is a massive flagship phablet, sporting a 6″ full-HD LG LTPS display with a pixel density of 368ppi tucked under the protective arm of Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. Inside, the smartphone is powered by a MediaTek 64-bit Octa-Core MediaTek MT6753 processor mated to 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable (up to 128GB via microSD) storage.By far the smartphone’s biggest selling point is its massive 6,300 mAh battery that supports Pump Express Flash Charge technology. This quick-charging technology pumps up 9V/3A and can give users a full day of use after only 30 minutes on the plug. A full charge should last moderate users up to 3.5 days and heavy users up to 2 days.That’s not entirely surprising considering the massive power cell located beneath its dynamic metal unibody design. Despite the massive battery, the smartphone still manages to maintain a relatively thin 8.5mm profile, only about half a millimetre thicker than the Huawei Mate 8 which packs a 4,000 mAh battery.For optics, it gets a 13-megapixel Sony BSI-2 f/2.0 aperture rear camera with a 5MP front-facing selfie snapper paired with a front and rear LED flashes to help with low-light shots.Out of the box, the LEAGOO Shark 1 comes running Android Lollipop with LEAGOO’s own OS v1.2 skin running on top. The smartphone also sports a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which can unlock your smartphone in 0.39 seconds. The fingerprint sensor can also double as an alternate button for taking photos and launching your favourite apps.Priced RM999, this smartphone is pretty good value for money especially considering its large screen and massive battery. If you’d like to pick one up, the LEAGOO Shark 1 is available at LEAGOO’s flagship store in Low Yat Plaza and at all authorised resellers. It will come in three colours — Modern Gold, Elegant Black and Satin Silver."

But what if you’ve got a drone with both capabilities and the added bonus of being super safe? then you’ve got Zero Zero Robotics‘s Hover Camera drone.The Hover Camera drone, is obviously built for taking photos and video from the air. But this is one you can safely snag out of the sky whenever you feel like it, because the propellers are completely enclosed within its foldable carbon fiber frame and thus making it essentially impossible for you to shred your fingers on its four blades.Coming in at just 238g, the little drone is quite compact. When folded its about the size of a cassette tape and relies on your smartphone to work as its controller.The app it runs on not just controls the drone’s camera but it also lets you live stream video from the drone or copy a downgraded version of the video to your phone. Downloading the videos in their native 4K resolution will need you to plug it in to your computer via a USB 3.0 Type B cable.Other specs for the drone include a 13MP camera with dual tone flash, 32GB internal memory alongside a downward facing 3MP camera which serves to stabilize the drone. It also makes use of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Flight platform to run. However, the battery is fairly small, capable to last about eight minutes per charge.The drone will be capable of roughly smartphone camera quality images and video; but might be a bit better as its still getting its image stabilisation fine-tuned by the company.The Hover Camera is still undergoing beta trials but the company says they’re aiming for a price tag below $600, to be released sometime this Summer. Probably won’t be seeing the drone anywhere locally but its still a nice (and safe) drone concept we can get behind.[SOURCE]"
Alexander Wong,Apple reports their first revenue decline since 2003. Are they running out of steam?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/27/apple-reports-their-first-revenue-decline-since-2003-are-they-running-out-of-steam/,"apple,apple revenue,apple second quarter 2016 results,apple watch,ipad,iphone,quarterly update,second quarter results,mobile devices","Apple,Mobile Devices",2016-04-27,"Apple have just published their fiscal Q2 2016 financial results and it looks like they are showing its first signs of a slowdown. The Cupertino giant have posted a revenue of US$50.6 billion which is a 13% drop when compared to the same period last year (Q2 2015: US$58 bil). What’s more staggering is that this is their first revenue decline in 13 years and another decline is also expected in the next quarter. Apple, the world’s most valuable company have always been consistent in bringing revenue growth for each quarter. For them to post a decline, sparks a question on whether Apple’s glory days are coming to an end.    So what’s going on? The Apple iPhone 6s is a record seller and the Apple Watch is currently the best selling smartwatch.To break things down, Apple had sold 51.2 million iPhones, 10.3 million iPads and 4 million Macs with the majority of sales coming from Americas followed by Europe and Greater China for last quarter. The iPhone, their best selling products have dropped in sales by 32% compared to the last quarter and 16% when compared to the same period last year. It is worth pointing out thayt these numbers didn’t include sales from the iPhone SE. For the iPad, Apple is still having a tough time rejuvenating interest as it showed decline despite having a more powerful iPad Pro lineup.No doubt Apple had shaken up the industry with its runaway success of the iPod, iPhone and iPad, but it seems that they are struggling to create the next big hit in the post-Steve Jobs era. Apple under Tim Cook needs new breakthrough products for growth and it is obvious they can’t continue refreshing its current lineup. In terms of sales, India will be a key focus for Apple, where they believe it has a potential to grow like China. On services, Tim Cook shared that there are 13 million paying subscribers on Apple Music and they are looking into increasing its revenue from its base of over 1 billion active devices. In an interview with WSJ, Tim Cook said this was “a challenging quarter,” but denied that Apple was in decline. He mentioned that the recent drop was due to a stronger dollar, difficult economic conditions, and difficult comparisons for iPhone sales. He added “It’s a tough bar to hurdle, but it doesn’t change the future. The future is very bright.”What do you think? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

If you can take steps to be more environmentally conscious in your daily activities, you’re quite literally saving the world and I don’t think you need me to tell you that saving the world is incredibly cool.Since going green is cool, there probably isn’t a cooler way to charge your smartphone than with the Bioo Lite. Hint: It’s with a potted plant.In the most literal iteration of a power plant, Bioo has come up with a flowerpot that lets your plants generate power to charge your devices. In a nutshell, this pot basically turns the leaves on your plants into solar panels by harnessing the energy from photosynthesis. The resulting compounds generated by this organic process then react with embedded bacteria in the pot to create electrons which are subsequently gathered by a nanowire network and fed to an accumulator.The energy stored in the accumulator is then sent up via a USB cable to the top of the flowerpot which you can then plug your phone in and charge. If all of that sounds a little too complicated, check out Bioo’s video explaining this process:It’s pretty cool that from this natural organic process, the folks at Bioo were able to harness and generate 5V/1A of electrical current without damaging either the plant or the environment. Sure, this may be a pot now, but imagine the possibilities of this could be expanded to say an entire park or forest reserve.The biggest foreseeable problem with this flowerpot charger is the fact that it’s a crowdfunded project. Crowdfunding products are often fabulous on paper but have frequently run into problems when it comes to meeting production requirements and how well the actual retail device will perform.Either way, this is a cool product and I hope that Bioo can pull through with this piece of tech. They’ve already smashed their crowdfunding goal of EUR15,000 and are expecting to ship the pots by the end of this year.

To recap on the flagship specs, the P9 retains a similar 5.2″ Full HD IPS display as its predecessor, encased in a metal unibody design. Powering the device is their in-house developed Kirin 955 processor that’s mated to either 3GB or 4GB of RAM along with storage options of either 32GB or 64GB on board.The key highlight, of course, is its dual-lens set up that’s co-engineered with Leica.

Low light shots are assisted by its 1.25 micron pixel size and it focuses quicker with its hybrid focus technology. For selfies, it gets a front facing 8MP shooter that comes with a host of beautification features.Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh battery and it also gets a fingerprint scanner mounted at the back.

More clarification below.Two Malaysian students recently won a gold medal and best overall award at the International Exhibition of Invention for Geneva 2016. What did they create you ask? a power bank that can produce its own power from within.The International Exhibition of Invention is the world’s biggest innovation exhibition in the world, with this year being the 44th year running with over 695 exhibitors from 40 different countries converging to show their very best. And this invention of theirs managed to beat the innovations of over a thousand other contestants.The power bank, named the “Power Bank: Exieco PB” was invented by the two form 5 students from Maktab Rendah Sains Mara (MRSM) Kuala Terengganu, Ahmad Ashraf Aqil and Ahmad Luqmanul Hakim Ariffin Ahmad Tirmizi. The idea for this power pack came to them when flooding ravaged their hometown and caused a loss of electricity.Regular power banks store electricity from outside sources to be used later, but this one generates its own power though the oxidization of the fuel cell within. The cell produces energy through chemical reactions of the materials within; namely coal compounds, aluminium and a salt solution to generate electricity.The team is currently seeking approval from SIRIM for the “Power Bank: Exieco PB” for the purpose of marketing the innovation under MARA. If they succeed, its quite possible the Exieco: PB might become a great power source in times of emergency. Malaysia could use more young innovators like these two fellows; and hopefully they inspire even more.====As it turns out, the two (among many others) are just one of many who returned to their home countries with the said gold medals. The special award to them was, in fact, from Egypt’s science committee, as they were interested in their project. The teacher who accompanied the duo, Anuar Ghani, clarified that the gold medal was given to any team that scored enough points to quality and it didn’t indicate that they won the best invention award. He added they did win the gold medal but it is based on merits if it scored enough points. According to the official site, the Grand Prix title was awarded to Professor Kok-Wah Cheah from Cathay Photonics for his process of reinforcing glass surfaces by applying a thin layer of sapphire.

This latest rumour from Taiwan also states that the prototypes currently being tested have a capacitive home button on the front, which you only need to touch to activate. Said button also might be 3D Touch-enabled so you can do more depending on the length and strength of your presses.There’s also reports that the iPhone 7 might be just 6.1mm thin, stereo speakers, wireless charging support, improved antenna bands as well as a Smart Connector like the new iPad. Last but not least, the iPhone 7 might be sporting a dual-lens camera out back and have a bigger battery.However, these are still only rumours so best take it with a pinch of salt.[SOURCE][VIA]"

The app will also have photography filters thanks to Facebook purchasing MSQRD last month; and will have some of its features integrated in.Said content can be then shared to Facebook owned apps like Instagram, or posted directly to Facebook itself.While the app is currently in development, there’s a chance that it might not even be completed as there’s a pretty severe lack of users who are sharing content on site (as opposed to linking in material from outside sources) so fingers crossed.[SOURCE][VIA]"

The BBG will provide an alternative route to Europe for TM’s IP traffic, allowing for more reliable traffic and help mitigate potential congestion while extending broadband connectivity to wider audiences.The BBG is also unique in the sense that it rides on TM’s protected terrestrial network from Penang all the way to Singapore to avoid the more cable cut prone and busier areas up and around the Malacca Straits.The cable systems will also provide connectivity between our region and Africa and Europe though the Indian and Middle East links; and possibly more in the future as the BBG adopts the state-of-the-art 100Gbps tech in order to provide for future upgrades.TM has about 20 submarine cable systems in their ownership or lease; which connects to a 200,000 fiber-route mile network spanning the globe.

Under the hood you’ll find a 6th Gen Intel Core i7 processor that can be overlocked to 4.0GHz, up to a whopping 64GB of memory, and features a full sized GeForce GTX 980 GPU. Now that’s power.Keeping all of that cool is the Aeroblade custom triple-fan cooling system that sucks in air from the front grille and shoots it out the back to keep a steady flow of air. The Predator 17X also features a water cooling system after a sense, with a vapour chamber helping to remove heat.As for the display, you have a choice between a 17.3 inch FHD IPS (1920 x 1080) or UHD IPS (4K 3840 x 2160) display, both of which use NVIDIA G-Sync to match the refresh rate of the GPU, minimizing stuttering and screen tearing. Of course, the keyboard is supported by Acer PredatorSense to allow you to program in macros, and customise your backlighting to suit your taste. This 4.55kg behemoth will retail for $2,799 (about RM 10,948) when it debuts this June in the US.Acer Predator G1Acer’s smallest portable gaming rig yet, the Predator G1 is all power in a small form factor. The reason why they made it so small is because its geared both towards regular users as well as those who are into e-Sports. The idea is to let you take it with you if you’re headed to a tourney or just headed to a friend’s place for a friendly game over LAN.They’ve also somehow managed to cram in a full sized NVIDIA GTX Titan X under the hood, alongside an 6th Gen Intel Core processor and up to 64GB worth of RAM. It will also support G-SYNC and 4K2K Ultra High Definition visuals for smooth graphics while a Creative Soundblaster X-Fi MB5 handles 7.1 channel surround sound.For storage you will have the choice between a huge 4TB hard drive or 512GB SSD, with a USB 3.1 Type-C Gen.2 port for fast data transfer. Like the Predator 17X the Predator G1 is customiseable via Acer’s PredatorSense where you can fiddle with the PC’s front chassis lights.The Predator G1 will initially roll out in 13 countries, starting with Canada, Belgium, the UK, France, Spain, Finland, Germany, Poland, Austria, Italy, Taiwan, Singapore and the Phillipines. The first 1000 customers who pick up the desktop will get a custom designed carrier case for the Predator G1 for free.For those looking for accessories, there will be a mechanical keyboard, headset and wheeled carrying case available at a later date.Stay tuned for our hands on of Acer’s latest devices at Next@Acer NYC."

Of the devices launched are the Acer Switch Alpha 12 2-in-1 PC, the rather skinny Acer Aspire S13 and the tough Chromebook 14 for Work.Acer Switch Alpha 12Acer’s latest premium 2-in-1 PC, the device is not only the first to feature Acer’s LiquidLoop fanless Liquid Cooling system, but also is the first of its kind to sport 6th Gen Intel Core i processors. There will be three variants available which have all of the same specs save for a choice of processor (i7/i5/i3U) and up to 8GB RAM and up to 512GB storage.The Switch Alpha 12 is also bundled together with a full-sized keyboard that features a large touchpad and functions as a cover for the device’s 12″ (2160 x 1440) IPS display as well. If that’s too small for you, you can also hook it up to multiple 4K displays via its USB Type-C port or an optional dock. If you like being able to use a pen with the Switch Alpha 12 there’s the optional Acer Active Pen which pretty much is a compatible stylus.Though take note that the Liquid Loop Cooling doesn’t really use much in the way of real liquid so there’s no tank for you to fill up.The Acer Switch Alpha 12 will be available for $599 (about RM2337) starting June.Aspire S13One of the thinnest notebooks in its class (and its pricepoint) the Aspire S13 has a super thin profile but it doesn’t skimp on performance. It’s also got Nano imprint lithography to create stylish textures on both the keyboard are and on the cover to give it a touch of good looks, with a design inspired by the Aspire V Nitro.In terms of specs the Aspire S13 has a 13.3 inch full HD display with optional touch, up to 8GB RAM and 512GB storage, and the choice between an i7/i5 or i3U processor. In terms of graphics its got an Intel HD Graphics 520 chip and a battery life rating of up to 11 hours for the non-touch variant, 13 hours for the one with touch.The Aspire S13 will launch in May and retail at $699 (about RM 2724).Chromebook 14 for WorkDesigned for those needing to work on the go, the Chromebook 14 has a rather unique Corning Gorilla Glass cover that’s both tough and highly customiseable. Designed to US military spec, its spill resistant , can handle up to 45cm drops and oddly has a namecard holder on its rear end. It charges with a USB Type-C port and sports up to 12 hours battery life.As for specs, the Chromebook 14 is home to a 14 inch Full HD IPS screen (with a 1366 x 768 variant) , 6th gen Intel Core processor coupled with an Intel HD Graphics chip, 2GB, 4GB or 8GB RAM and the choice between 16/31GB storage.The Chromebook 14 for Work will retail starting $349 (about RM 1361).Stay tuned for our hands on of Acer’s latest devices at Next@Acer NYC."

Its also home to a 5.5″ 720p display and a simply gigantic 5,000mAh battery. Its even got fast charging, so you won’t have to wait around for hours just for the battery to fill up.You’ll also be getting a rather standard camera combo here, with a 13MP rear shooter with Tri-focus and 5MP wide-angle selfie camera up front. Tri-focus apparently stands for the three autofocus systems employed by the camera; phase detection, contrast detection and laser autofocus. Last but not least, the Zest Plus will have Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.Its interesting to note that internally its pretty similar to that of the Asus Zenfone Max which was released late last year, which sports the same specs, with the exception that it runs on a Snapdragon 410 chip.We’re not entirely sure of the price or when it will hit locally, but the Acer Liquid Zest Plus will retail at under $250.Here’s more images of the Acer Liquid Zest Plus:"

Malaysian telcos were dishing out competitive postpaid plans with lots of data, while TM prepares to make an entry with its new 4G service. Despite the aggressive price war, Maxis remains steady according to its latest Q1 2016 financial update. Compared year-on-year with Q1 2015, Maxis has managed to maintain a revenue of RM2.1 billion (Q1 2015: RM2,127 mil, Q1 2016: RM2,126 mil). For postpaid, revenue has increased slightly by 2.3% (Q1 2015: RM972 mil, Q1 2016: RM994 mil) while prepaid has declined by 3.5% (Q1 2015: RM1,052 mil, Q1 2016: RM1,015 million). In terms of profit after tax, they grew 0.4% from RM482 mil to RM484 mil.In terms of subscribers, Maxis currently has 2.7 million users on postpaid which is a dip of 4.5% versus Q1 2015. Meanwhile, there are 8.2 million subscribers on prepaid which is 8.8% less compared to the same period last year. Despite the slight decline of subscribers, Maxis has managed maintained a steady growth in average revenue per user for both segments.  According to Maxis CEO Morten Lundal, one of the key drivers behind its growth in postpaid is their MaxisONE Plan which currently has close to 1 million subscribers. In terms of 4G coverage, Maxis is now covering 74% (Q1 2015: 39%) of Malaysia’s populated areas. This includes 36 key towns and cities in East Malaysia. He also added that nobody invests as much as Maxis onto their network. They have invested RM1.4 bil for 2015 and for Q1 2016 alone, they have invested another RM160 mil. In terms of 4G LTE usage, the numbers have doubled to 3.2 million users versus 1.6 million users from the same quarter last year. To break it down, 77% of their postpaid customers are on 4G while prepaid stands at 67%. Data usage wise, Maxis customers use an average of 2.6GB a month. Morten concludes that Malaysian users want data and they want more of it. Moving forward, Maxis doesn’t just want to just provide more data, but also the opportunity to do more with it.

Its not too different from its predecessors either, looking very similar in design to its original counterparts.Coming in a myriad of colours, the wearable is more of a fitness monitor for those who really, really want to keep a constant eyeball on their health.The main feature of the device here is that it has an always-on heartrate monitor and its ability to remind you to keep up on your medication once synced with Acer’s fitness app. The notifications are clearly displayed on the Leap Fit’s 1 ” OLED touch display, which isn’t fancy but it gets the job done.Said app will not only keep track of your activity but will also coach you to keep healthy, like many of the fitness apps out in the market. The Liquid Leap Fit also apparently has up to seven days battery life so it should go a fair bit between charges. While that is not nearly as long as a lot of other fitness trackers out there, the constant monitoring does do a number on its battery life.No word on pricing and release dates for the fitness band just yet, but its siblings the Leap Active and the original Liquid Leap are already available for purchase.Stay tuned for our hands on of Acer’s latest devices at Next@Acer NYC."

For those with additional lines for their family members, they have also revamped their supplementary data offering with a new Data Pool feature. According to its CEO Morten Lundal, this is the largest auto-upgrade they have done and it is also the largest ever in Malaysia. He added that unlike other competitors that offer short-term offers or limited time upgrades, the new MaxisONE revamp is applicable to all customers permanently for free. In terms of subscribers, MaxisONE plan has just passed the one million mark this week.Starting today, all MaxisONE customers both new and current can start enjoying the new upgraded plan. You still get unlimited calls and SMS, while your monthly data quota is now increased as follows:
MaxisONE 98 (RM98/month) 1GB -> 5GB
MaxisONE 128 (RM128/month) 3GB -> 8GB -> 10GB
MaxisONE 158 (RM158/month) 5GB -> 12GB -> 15GB
MaxisONE 188 (RM188/month) 7GB -> 16GB -> 20GB
At the same time, they have also revamped their MaxisONE Share supplementary line offering. For RM48/month, your extra lines not only get unlimited calls and SMS but also 5GB of extra data. This data goes into the same pool as your primary line which is shared across all users. For greater control, you are allowed to set data quota limits for each sub-line from the Maxis app.  If you’re travelling overseas, you can also take the Data Pool with you when you roam. This is applicable via MaxisONE World of RM38/day that offers extra 500MB/day data, unlimited calls and SMS when you’re abroad. To sweeten the deal, Maxis is also giving 5GB of free data each month for video streaming on iflix, Viu, Eros Now and Hopster for life. If you need more, you can top up another 5GB video quota for RM5/day."

Its pretty much a pain to get a VPN set up without having to fork out cash for it. However, Opera now has an inbuilt VPN for their desktop browser, perfect for those days when you need to mask your IP to get your fave shows streaming.The feature comes on the latest developer version of the Opera browser for Windows or OSX; where you need to just flip on the VPN settings (on your computer’s settings, not Opera’s) and you’re good to go. Mac users will find it in Preferences while Windows will find it in Settings. Piece of cake.After that you should be able to view content that’s not available for your country or from your workplace, if you’re running on a virtual network. You apparently can browse with an unlimited amount of data for practically free with the feature as well. The IP masking isn’t perfect though, as it will only mask you as coming from the US, Canada or Germany as for now.When the feature gets a more stable release there should be more countries added to the list of virtual countries for you to use.[SOURCE][VIA]"

For supplementary lines, they have upgraded their MaxisONE Share with 5GB of data along with unlimited calls and SMS. Similar to U Mobile’s Hero Plus Postpaid add-on, the 5GB data is shared together with the main line’s data. So if you have a MaxisOne share with an existing MaxisOne 98 line, you’ll get a combined 10GB of data shared for 2 users.As an added bonus, they are giving 5GB extra data (for the main line) to stream video content on iflix, Viu, as well as the recently added Eros Now and Hopster. Note that it is limited to the first four months of the plan being in use.If any of this is true, Maxis might just have a bit more punch to throw at its competitors.

Not only does it have two dials that let you control settings between seven pre-set basic modes and three advanced settings.These include Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Sport, Snow, Selfie and Video modes, with the advanced settings including Shutter priority, ISO priority and Manual controls. You also get a Zoom ring that also doubles as a selfie button (letting you swap between the front and rear cameras of your phone), a cold shoe mount for an external flash and finally a multi-state shutter release button.The Shutter release button will focus with a half press and a full press will snap a shot, much like a DSLR. The exposure compensation wheel of course, lets you adjust the brightness before you shoot.There is also an 1/4 inch tripod socket on its rear that would take most standard tripods if you don’t want to get the dedicated one that sells with the Pictar.The kit starts at $90 for the basic kit which includes a Wrist Strap, Padded Pouch and the Pictar App, with each increasing tier adding more perks and accessories.The Pictar will work with most models of iPhone, running from the Apple iPhone 4 all the way to the iPhone SE, but bear in mind that the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus won’t be able to run on it because they’re too large. As of the moment, the project has about 36 days left to go and having raised $46,986 of their targeted $100,000 goal.If the Kickstarter gets funded (which is looking quite likely at this point), we’re expecting to see the Pictar roll out sometime in November.

There are 6 fibre pairs on the ASE and 2 of them are TM’s very own Cahaya Malaysia. The restoration works were supposed to be completed by 31st March but it looks like it took a bit longer than expected.

And most importantly, what does it even mean to you as a consumer?To keep you better informed, webe CEO CC Puan wants to debunk some common myths about 4G networks. He wants to tell it as it is so that you as a consumer can see beyond the advertising claims. Check out the videos after the break.Webe is Malaysia’s newest telco by TM and they aspire to rejuvenate the mobile space. At the moment, they are running internal trials and are expected to roll out commercial 4G services later this year. For us, a telco has to be reliable and it is their responsibility to ensure that we can make and receive calls all the time in populated areas. In terms of data speed, regardless of 3G or 4G, the network should be able to provide a consistent and seamless experience for web browsing and surfing videos. What’s the point of claiming widest and fastest if you can’t load web pages or watch videos without buffering even in urban areas? Do you agree with CC Puan?

At the moment, webe is having internal trials and it is available only to selected staff.  If you’re curious about webe’s 4G network performance, we’ve gotten some speedtest results from a tipster. Unlike other 4G LTE networks, webe’s 4G network utilises LTE Band 5 at 850MHz as shown in the screenshot above. As a comparison, other 4G telcos including Maxis, Celcom, Digi and U Mobile are running on 1800MHz or 2600MHz. Most flagship smartphones these days support Band 5 which includes the latest iPhone 6s/SE, Galaxy S7 edge and Huawei Mate 8.  In terms of speed, the tipster gets an average download between 4-9Mbps, while uploads were faster around 8-9Mbps. It isn’t blazing fast but we are told it is fast enough to watch 1080p videos on YouTube without buffering. When the webe SIM is popped into an iPhone, it only supports 3G for now. Webe also rides on Celcom’s network where it isn’t available as part of its domestic roaming arrangement. In order for 4G LTE to work, webe would need Apple to push a software update for all iOS device. This was the same situation when Celcom and Maxis introduced 4G LTE 3 years ago.Of course, these are still preliminary results and the performance may vary depending on location. From what we’ve seen yesterday, TM’s LTE coverage is quite extensive covering most major towns and cities in Malaysia including Sabah and Sarawak. Hopefully, webe can deliver faster 4G speeds once it is officially available for the public."

This unfortunate event is a strike of extreme bad luck and what’s likely to be an unsafe charger.Basically what happened was Suhana was making a call on her mobile while it was plugged into a socket, charging.  This is relatively common practice, everyone does it, but it can be a particularly dangerous if you’re using uncertified, third party accessories.Cheaper, third party (or dubiously sourced) accessories can seem like they’re a better alternative to the original item. When a charger is just a charger why should you pay more for the original, right? Because that cheap China-made piece of junk could cost you your life. The fact is, very often these third-party accessories do not meet the required safety standard set by authorities such as SIRIM. This is especially so in cheap third-party replacement batteries and chargers.These accessories rarely have the appropriate protection mechanisms put in to ensure that they don’t suddenly explode or leak electricity. There’s very little stopping you from getting seriously hurt by electrical discharge or in a worst case scenario, a ruptured battery exploding in your face.Always use certified, original chargers when charging up your devices. This incredibly tragic incident need not repeat itself just because you tried to save a few bucks.[SOURCE, 1]"

To recap, FIRST Platinum comes bundled with 18GB of mobile data with 9GB for all time use and another 9GB allocated just for the weekends. For the weekend data, it is split with 2.25GB for every weekend in a month. If you can’t finish it, FIRST Platinum allows you to carry forward up to 9GB (from your all time quota) to the following month.

The data roaming plans start from RM38/day or RM138/week which includes unlimited calls and SMS.To entice those who are still clinging to other telcos, Celcom is giving away a Perodua Axia every 2 weeks. This is open to all new subscribers including port-ins, and the giveaway is running until mid July 2016.For connectivity in the home, Celcom is also extending its Home Fibre Broadband offering to FIRST Platinum customers.

Cheryl Bates,Is Leica’s branding on the Huawei P9 just a marketing ploy?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/21/is-leicas-branding-on-the-huawei-p9-just-a-marketing-ploy/,"huawei,huawei p9,huawei p9 camera,huawei p9 dual camera,leica,leica smartphone,leica smartphone camera,summarit,mobile devices","huawei,Mobile Devices",2016-04-21,"Sometimes a phone’s unique selling point can pretty much make or break a phone. Huawei pretty much is using the Leica branding to help sell their two latest flagships, the P9 and P9 Plus, but as it turns out, both devices don’t have Leica certification on their lenses.When the Huawei P9 got announced, people were pretty excited, especially since the cameras had Leica branding on the back of the phone. Since both brands started collaborating earlier this year, people were more or less expecting a smartphone camera from Leica on the back of a Huawei device and this is the result.But like we mentioned earlier, the cameras aren’t Leica certified, making us wonder if Huawei was simply riding on Leica’s branding to sell phones. The lenses themselves are in fact produced by Sunny Optical Technology of China, and the new information hasn’t got people very happy about the phone.However, recently Huawei issued an official statement on the matter stating that the P9 phones may not be certified by Leica but they were co-engineered by the two brands.“The P9 and P9 Plus were co-engineered between Huawei and Leica. This is the first collaboration between the two companies following a long-term partnership that was announced in February. From the very beginning, Leica has been deeply involved in the development of these devices. There has been significant technological collaboration between Huawei and Leica around many aspects of the camera, including optical design, imaging quality, image data processing, optimization, and the mechanical construction of the camera module to the graphic user interface. The devices meet Leica’s highest imaging quality standards.”So far reviews for the phone have claimed that the image quality for the P9’s snappers have been pretty good but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and we’ll see if the P9 can live up to its expectations when we get our hands on one.[SOURCE]"

Announced on the same day at MWC 2016, the LG G5 is another worthy flagship and you can get it here in Malaysia thanks to parallel importer DirectD. If RM3,099 is too much to pay for a smartphone, you’ll be happy to know that the G5 is slightly affordable at RM2,999.To recap, the LG G5 is probably the most customisable flagship smartphone at the moment. Underneath its metal body design, the G5 has a removable slot at the bottom which allows you to swap batteries and add-on additional accessories. Up front it gets a 5.3″ Quad HD display and underneath it runs on Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM. The unit that DirectD is offering comes with 32GB of internal storage that’s expandable via microSD along with dual-SIM support. At the back, it features a fingerprint sensor that doubles up as a power button while the upper part sports a dual camera set up for wide angle 135 degree angle shots. The main camera is a 16MP shooter with OIS, while the secondary shooter uses an 8MP sensor. For selfies, it also gets an 8MP shooter up front. Powering the device is a 2800mAh battery and it charges using USB Type C supporting QuickCharge 3.0. Like the Galaxy S7/S7 edge, the G5 also has an always-on display which LG claims to drain just 0.8% per hour. Out of the box, it runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. DirectD’s listing indicates that Titan and Pink colours are ready to be shipped in 2-3 days, while the Gold colour version will be ready in 1-2 weeks time. Since this is an import set, it comes with a 1-year warranty from DirectD. Other LG G5 modular accessories are also available and they are priced as follows:
LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play – RM899
LG CAM Plus – RM499To enjoy a full VR experience, DirectD is also offering the following accessories:
LG 360 VR – RM1,399
LG 360 CAM – RM1,399Since LG Malaysia has been quiet in the smartphone business, DirectD is probably your best bet for now. The LG G5 is currently going for SGD$988 (around RM2842) in Singapore, so its RM2,999 asking price is quite reasonable for a new imported device. Is the LG G5 more appealing to you than the S7 edge?

Vulnerabilities that aren’t going to be fixed.The only platform which is an exception for this is QuickTime on the Mac OSX.While there’s no telling if there are any active attacks against said vulnerabilities as of yet, the best way to protect against them is simply removing Apple QuickTime from your system.So here’s a quick guide on how to uninstall Apple QuickTime for Windows, stay safe!"

The reasoning given for it however, is because its a “natural colour that provides a sense of comfort” as opposed to being a shade aimed specifically at the ladies.It’s not the first time they’ve popped out a pink device (namely for the Note 5 and Galaxy A series) though it seems oddly coincidental with Apple and Sony also popping out pink devices within this short time frame.

Not exactly a brilliant way of concealing info from the public eye. Read on for more details. To check it out yourself, just view the webe invitation page and hit View Source. If you search for “Pioneer Plan”, you’ll be able to read more details of its current offering. For starters, the Webe Pioneer Plan is open to selected individuals and they will be able to register for the plan between 31st March until 6th May 2016. After 31st July, all users will be converted to the normal commercial plan.It comes bundled with 20GB of domestic mobile internet, 1,000 minutes of domestic voice and 1,000 SMS. Priced at RM10.60 (as opposed to the RM8 on the mockup) the plan does have some limits. For one, you cannot tether your device as a WiFi hotspot. To do so, you would have to buy a Personal Wi-Fi Pass that will cost RM6.36 for 2 hours. This is probably the first time a Malaysian telco restricts your mobile data from WiFi hotspot use.Also, once you have used up your 20GB, you can still surf for free but your speed will be throttled to 128kbps, which is double the standard 64kbps speed offered by other telcos. Oddly enough, its been mentioned that Webe users are allowed to download P2P files but at throttled 64kbps speeds and they cannot carry forwards their unused data.For coverage, it seems that they’ve got most major towns and cities covered, even in East Malaysia which is likely the same footprint as TMgo. What’s interesting to note though, is that its 4G network runs on the 850MHz spectrum instead of the usual 1800MHz/2600MHz that are being used by other telcos. This means you would need a 4G LTE enabled phone supporting 850MHz to make full use of its 4G network.However, the leak doesn’t mention anything about that fantastic everything unlimited RM80 plan that cropped up as part of the first big leak.

That is more than double that of the Samsung Galaxy S7 which outputs about 539 nits of brightness. Also a HDR display on the phone would mean that it could display up to 1.07 billion colours, as opposed to the 16.8 million colour depth on most other flagship devices. The Xperia X Performance uses a 5.5″ Whitemagic LCD display that pushes a standard Full HD resolution.The full specs isn’t known yet and it should be a notch above its the current Xperia X Performance. The X Performance has a Snapdragon 820 under the hood, mated to 3GB RAM with the choice between 32/64GB storage. The phone will be sporting a 5-inch Full HD display alongside a USB Type-C port. Do note that the 64GB option will be a dual-sim setup.No word yet on when the Sony Xperia X series will launch in Malaysia.[SOURCE][VIA]"

They look…oddly familiar if you ask me.Dubbed the Huawei VR, these VR headsets bear a striking resemblance to Samsung’s Gear VR, from the dials to the touch sensitive navigation buttons and back key. The three variants are separated based on which Huawei flagship you’re using, which means that at least two of the variants will be USB Type-C capable.It mounts your smartphone the same way too, by popping off the front visor, plugging your device into the port at one end (with the VR app running) and snapping the smartphone in with the clip at the other end.This headset also supports 360-degree sound field, but you will need to have the right content loaded and your own specialised headphones that can support this audio format.One way the Huawei VR might fall short of the Gear VR is that Huawei’s smartphones are all running at a 1080p full-HD resolution compared to Samsung’s Quad HD panels on the supported Samsung devices.The Huawei VR headsets receive 20ms low latency and 95-degree field of view specifications but with an added bluelight filter which should translate to less tired eyes.You won’t be able to wear your glasses with the headset, but the lenses are adjustable and will accommodate myopia of down to -7.00. At launch, Huawei will offer over 4,000 free movies, over 40 games, over 350 panoramic images and over 150 panoramic tours with the Huawei VR.Unfortunately, Huawei has not revealed any pricing or availability.[SOURCE]"

Celcom has announced an even higher postpaid plan with larger quota while Digi has introduced a new plan (sort of) with more data for the weekends. Not to be left out, U Mobile has also extended its P70 Hero postpaid’s extra 8GB promo until the end of 2016.So how do the new plans stack up? Read on for our full comparison.Celcom FIRST Platinum
Just to recap, the new FIRST Platinum at RM150/month offers 18GB of data which is split with 9GB for all time use and 9GB for the weekends. It also gets unlimited calls and SMS, along with additional perks including 1 year iflix subscription and a one-time access to Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge. Like the rest of its FIRST postpaid offering,  you can also carry forward unused data up to 9GB to the following month. Digi Postpaid 80
For Digi, the new Postpaid 80 appears to be a direct hit on Celcom’s FIRST Gold postpaid plans that offers 10GB of data at RM80/month. Unlike Celcom’s 50-50 split, the Digi plan offers 7GB for all time use and 3GB for the weekends. On the plus side, Digi does not segregate your weekend data further so you are free to use the full 3GB quota on a single weekend. Essentially, the Postpaid 80 plan is the same old Postpaid 78 (More Voice & SMS) with the RM2 for 3GB weekend data add-on. Calls are also unlimited while SMS is unlimited only to 3 numbers on Digi. For a detailed postpaid comparison against other telcos, check out the tables below. We’ve also added Maxis SurfMore50 and MaxisGO plans into the mix."

With many big tech companies coming up with their own solutions to VR, Google has stuck with their Cardboard and Cardboard app — unless, of course, if you want to count this.But with Android N’s second developer preview, it looks like the next version of Android will have a much bigger push towards VR support.Buried within the app and configure app settings, the folks over at Ars Technica have discovered that apps will soon be able to register themselves as a “VR Listener” or “VR Helper” in Android N. Not only that, there is also a permissions warning related to the VR service that states “[App name] will be able to run when you are using applications in virtual reality mode”.This not only hints that Android N might have some kind of VR Mode (perhaps like Lenovo’s VR Mode?), but there will be certain helper apps that will be able to pop up within that Android VR Mode.It’s interesting to see the search engine giant make a more substantial push towards virtual reality considering their current offerings are rather lackluster. Perhaps this is timely considering the rumours that have come about where Google was allegedly working on a Gear VR-styled headset and a standalone VR headset that doesn’t require a PC or smartphone to function.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Its also a tad bit cheaper, which allows the funds to be dedicated to RAM and other upgrades, like the display for example. They won’t replace Intel’s high end Core processors, but they’ll do well in bringing beefier PCs and laptops to the budget market.There isn’t that much more revealed by Intel about Apollo Lake (like pricing and release dates) but Intel’s got more Celeron and Pentium processors set to launch later this year.[SOURCE][VIA]"
Alexander Wong,Uber is now accepting cash in Kuala Lumpur,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/18/uber-is-now-accepting-cash-in-kuala-lumpur/,"cash payments,uber,uber cash,uber kl,uber kuala lumpur,uber malaysia,mobile apps",Mobile Apps,2016-04-18,"In a bid to make Uber more accessible for the masses, the ride-sharing app is now accepting cash in Kuala Lumpur. Last month they had rolled out cash payments in Johor Bahru, followed by Ipoh and Penang two weeks later.The cash payment option is rolled out in stages and you can make the selection when confirming your pickup location. Just tap on your credit/debit card number and you should see a cash option if it’s available to you. Do note that if you don’t have exact change, Uber will round up your fare to the closest ringgit. This means if your trip costs RM10.20, you would need to pay RM11. Is cash the way to go? According to Uber, cash will allow more people to experience their ride-sharing service which was previously limited to electronic payment. As mentioned previously, we prefer cashless transactions by card as it saves time and the hassle of finding small change. It would be more efficient for drivers as well since they can drive off immediately after dropping a passenger. With the latest change, we foresee Uber drivers being more vulnerable to harassments from taxi drivers as they would need to make longer stops when dropping passengers. For Uber, each trip is calculated based on time and distance, so you wouldn’t know your final fare until you’ve arrived at your destination. Meanwhile, Grab has a better implementation as they will tell you upfront of how much your trip would cost. This is possible as Grab calculates based on distance, allowing passengers to prepare the exact change even before they start the trip. What do you think?

Rory Lee,Digi’s new Postpaid 80 plan gives 10GB of data for RM80/month,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/15/digis-new-postpaid-80-plan-gives-10gb-of-data-for-rm80month/,"digi,digi new postpaid plan,digi postpaid 80,digi postpaid plan,digi weekend data,new postpaid plan malaysia,players on the field,promotions","DiGi,Players on the Field,Promotions",2016-04-15,"Hot on the heels of Celcom‘s latest postpaid plan announcement, Digi has come up with their own new plan — the Digi Postpaid 80 (More Calls & SMS) — which offers a 10GB of data quota for RM80/month plus unlimited calls and unlimited SMS to 3 Digi Friends.Sound familiar?No matter how you spin it, 10GB of quota for RM80/month isn’t too shabby as we have seen a similar offering from Celcom with their FIRST Gold plan. The problem with Celcom’s plan is that they split your quota between data that you can use anytime and data that is reserved for weekends.Unfortunately, Digi’s new postpaid plan operates under this same mechanic — the only difference being how they split it. With Digi’s Postpaid 80 plan, the telco is offering 7GB of anytime data with 3GB of weekend data.On the surface, it seems like a better split compared to the 5GB+5GB that Celcom gives because it offers you more flexibility. Unlike Celcom, who splits your weekend quota evenly between each weekend, Digi gives you all 3GB upfront, leaving it up to you to decide how to manage your weekend data usage.But which is really better?Well, the good thing about Digi’s weekend data solution is that it is up to you to manage your weekend data. Say, you were connected to your home’s WiFi network for an entire weekend, you still have all your quota to split between the remaining weekends.With Celcom’s split, if you happen to spend a weekend in an area devoid of coverage or if you don’t switch on your data, you immediately lose one weekend worth of data quota. However, the good thing about that is if a month has 5 weekends, you get an extra weekend worth of data.Digi’s Postpaid 80 also comes with unlimited calls to all networks and unlimited SMS to 3 Digi Friends (standard SMS rates are 10sen/SMS). However, you won’t be able to sign up for a device contract with this plan.Looking through Digi’s website, we noticed that this new postpaid plan is essentially Digi’s old Postpaid 78 plan plus Digi’s new RM2 for 3GB of weekend data add-on service. This weekend data add-on service is also applicable for customers on Digi Postpaid 98 More Internet and above, as well as Digi Postpaid 78 More Calls & SMS and above.Digi already has the most postpaid plans of any telco in Malaysia, did they really need to add another one?

That means, once you’ve purchased a data bundle, your data usage is unlimited and will only be throttled once you’ve depleted the quota.The local price war among the telcos in Malaysia has been heating up recently with new offerings from Digi, Celcom and even U Mobile adding a little spice to their existing lineup.One big problem with that price war is that these postpaid plans all hover around the RM70-RM80 mark which isn’t an insignificant amount to pay for a plan. What if you want something basic that won’t burn a hole in your pocket?Besides the four (soon to be five) telco companies in Malaysia, there are also mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) who operate by piggybacking on an existing telco’s network — so wherever that telco has coverage, the MVNO will too. red ONE is one such company (piggybacking on Celcom’s network) and they’ve just introduced a back-to-basics postpaid plan that starts from as low as RM8/month.What do you get for RM8/month?Well, for starters, you get 500MB of data for free. However, once you’ve depleted your quota, you will be charged at a Pay Per Use (PPU) rate of 10sen/1MB, capping off at RM250. After 10GB of usage, your speeds will be capped at 64kbps.To avoid expensive to PPU rates, red ONE offers data bundles which you can purchase to add on to your postpaid plan. These bundles are RM20 for 1GB, RM30 for 2GB, RM40 for 3GB, and RM60 for 5GB.There is a caveat according to red ONE’s Facebook page. red ONE says that data speeds will depend on which data bundle you purchase. For example, if you were to pick up the RM20 for 1GB of quota, your speeds will be limited to 7.2Mbps (3G speeds). If you want to enjoy 4G LTE speeds, you will need to subscribe to a data bundle of at least 2GB (RM30).Besides data and internet quotas, red ONE’s Data8 plan also offers users free calls to all red ONE mobile numbers, limited to 100 hours/month. Calls to other mobile networks will cost you 15sen/min while SMSes are priced at 10 sen/SMS to other networks and 5sen/SMS to red ONE users.If you’re interested in signing up for the Data8 postpaid plan, you will have to commit to a contract of 6 months. The good thing about red ONE is that they will even allow users who have been blacklisted by other telcos to sign up, though they will have to make an upfront payment and deposit before registering.You can sign up for this plan at any red ONE agent/partner or do so online at their website.[SOURCE]"

Thanks to the extra row of keys it also rolls up into a neat pentagon.The Rolly Keyboard 2 retails at around $110 (about RM 427) and unfortunately will only be available in South Korea as for now.

Alexander Wong,Celcom unveils its FIRST Platinum postpaid plan with 18GB of data,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/15/celcom-unveils-its-first-platinum-postpaid-plan-with-18gb-of-data/,"18gb data plan,celcom,celcom exclusive benefits,celcom first,celcom first platinum,celcom postpaid,celcom postpaid plan,data plan malaysia,postpaid,players on the field","Celcom,Players on the Field",2016-04-15,"Looking for the ultimate plan from Celcom? The new FIRST by Platinum offers more internet and additional privileges compared to its current FIRST Gold plan. At RM150/month, it comes with a whopping 18GB of data along with unlimited voice calls and SMS. The Platinum plan matches its earlier appearance and this is Celcom’s most premium offering at the momentSimilar to its current FIRST Blue and FIRST Gold, the 18GB mobile data quota is split between 2 segments. It gets 9GB that you can use all the time and another 9GB that’s reserved specifically for the weekends. That means you get to enjoy 2.25GB of dedicated data quota each weekend. In addition, they are giving 9GB of complimentary WiFiPlus, which is useful if you can find one in the first place. If you can’t finish your mobile data, you get to carry forward up to 9GB (from 9GB all day quota) to the following month. In case 18GB isn’t enough, you can Max Up 1GB at RM20. If you do spend RM225 and above, Celcom will grant you 1GB of extra data and 2GB if you spend RM500 and above. Note that roaming charges don’t count for this usage accumulation. Since domestic calls and SMS are already unlimited, the only possible way is probably through making more IDD calls. As a FIRST Platinum member, Celcom is also offering free 1-year iflix and 1 year of Zip-it-chat service, along with unlimited access to Yonder Music. Perhaps the biggest highlight is the exclusive access to Malaysia Airlines’ Golden Lounge where you can dine and relax before departing from KLIA. Once you’ve subscribed to FIRST Platinum, you can redeem your access here. You would need to redeem the Golden Lounge voucher, which is valid for 7 days for 1 person, to enjoy all complimentary facilities in the Business Class section of the Golden Lounge at KLIA. According to the FAQ, every Platinum customer gets to enjoy 1 access and it is available on a first come first serve basis (First 1,000). For international travelers, Celcom’s Wonderoam offers a worry free experience with a RM38 daily plan for data only and a RM138 weekly plan that comes with 3GB data, unlimited calls and SMS. On Celcom, they boast 165 supported countries (for daily plan) with access to 2 partner telcos for greater accessibility. To prevent crazy expensive data roaming charges, your mobile data will be disabled if your phone connects to the wrong telco partner overseas.For more information, head over to Celcom’s FIRST Platinum page."

However, thanks to leaked snapshots of what looks like a pre-launch briefing, we now have an early look at Celcom’s FIRST Platinum plan and it’s pretty massive.At the launch event of Celcom’s Wonderoam international roaming plans earlier today, we tried to push them for some information about the plan, but they wouldn’t budge.Unfortunately for them, it looks like their dealers weren’t so reluctant to divulge information as pictures of what looks like briefing slides were posted on, not one but two, Facebook pages.Sticking to Celcom’s hierarchy of colours, the Celcom FIRST Platinum is supposedly designed for the “heavy user” and as a result, it offers a combined data quota of 18GB/month. The caveat is, like the other plans in Celcom’s FIRST roster, the monthly data quota is split between two buckets.This means you get 9GB of data that can be used anytime while the remaining 9GB is spread out over the weekends. If the current FIRST postpaid plans are anything to go off, this should mean that you will get 2.25GB/weekend. Celcom also allows you to carry forward unused quota up to 9GB to the next month.You also get unlimited calls and SMS plus 9GB of complimentary Celcom WiFi all for RM150/month. However, based on the slides, this price of RM150 is a promotional price that is will be available for users who subscribe from 15th of April to 31st of May 2016.Besides the plan itself, Celcom is also throwing in 1-year free subscription to iflix, Yonder music and Zipit Chat. What’s more, you get access to a bunch of privileged services including personalised customer service, preferred number offerings, an extended credit limit and extended payment of 45 days. You also get exclusive access to Malaysia Airlines’ Golden Lounge.What do you guys think of this plan? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

Not saying the Google Play Store is any less messy; it probably has more junkware than the App Store.Regardless, the kind of changes that will be made by the team (lead by company vice president, Todd Teresi) who will be handling the project are still pretty vague and Apple hasn’t dropped any big statement yet so take this rumour with a grain of salt.However, it also looks like Apple will be rebranding their OSX operating system to simply MacOS in the future, as they’re moving to remove the “i” from many of their product lines in favour of a more unified naming scheme.Whether or not any of these changes will come into effect, we’ll have to wait for Apple’s WWDC developer conference in June to find out.[SOURCE][VIA. 1]"

The problem with streaming content on mobile/data plans is that they take up a lot of your quota, leaving mobile users hesitant to expend valuable quota to watch videos or stream movies.Well, Digi plans to solve that with what they call “bite-sized video passes” that let customers enjoy streaming content without worrying about using up their internet quota. Meet Digi Video Freedom.Much like Digi’s Music Freedom pass, Digi Video Freedom allows users to purchase value-add passes to stream content without having to tap into their existing quota. Digi is offering two passes for Digi Video Freedom — an hourly pass that costs RM1/hour and a daily pass that costs RM5/day (24 hours).Both of these passes lets you freely stream content from popular host sites like YouTube, iflix, Astro on the Go, Viu, tonton, Dailymotion and HyppTV. Of course, these passes are subjected to a fair use policy which limits the hourly pass to a quota of 3GB/hour and the daily pass to 10GB/day. If your quota ends up running out, you can always re-purchase the pass to refresh your quota.These video passes cover quite an extensive number of video streaming platforms and content which should delight users, however, there are several big streaming sites that have not been included. Twitch, for example, has been left out in this initial launch, but at least you get access to YouTube Gaming.The good news is, much like the Digi Music Freedom pass, the telco will continue to update and expand its roster of supported platforms in the future. Digi subscribers who are interested in these video passes can purchase them via the MyDigi app (Android and iOS) starting 15 April 2016.Love streaming content on your phone?

Its likely designed to make heavy duty games run better, and there’s also a handful of bug fixes going with the update. Apps will also be able to define intent shortcuts, which can then be added to the launcher for ease of access. For example you could have a shortcut that immediately starts you on the way home using Waze or a shortcut that would let you message a particular contact at a click.Last but not least, you will get Emoji Unicode 9 support out of the box for more “human looking” emoji with more skin tone variation and Unicode 9 glyphs.If you’re already on the Android N Developer Preview, you should get this update automatically.

The array is designed to create “truly spherical video” and can capture the stereoscopic images that 3D needs to to complete the illusion.Captured footage will be rendered online via a web-based software that’s made just for it. Said software will then stitch together the video from the footage from each individual camera in 4K, 6K and 8K formats. The software apparently will also be available to use on similar 360 rigs, and won’t be proprietary to Facebook’s Surround 360.Video from this rig of course, is destined for the Oculus Rift which was acquired by Facebook not too long back. Its also not the first 360 degree rig out there, with brands like GoPro having adopted the technology earlier on.As cool as it looks, Facebook won’t be selling the rig, but the designs for the array will be available on GitHub this summer.More images:[SOURCE]"

Under WONDEROAM, users get to choose from a range of daily and weekly roaming plans.WONDEROAM comes in three forms — the WONDEROAM 1 DAY SOCIAL RM10, WONDEROAM 1 DAY INTERNET RM38 and WONDEROAM 1 WEEK RM138.WONDEROAM 1 DAY SOCIAL is pretty self-explanatory as it gives users 1GB of quota per day for Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp along with 50MB of high-speed internet and 50MB of basic internet for RM10/day.Unfortunately for postpaid subscribers, this plan is only available for XPAX prepaid users. To subscribe simply key in *118# then navigate to Wonderoam > Wonderoam 1 Day Social RM 10 > Subscribe.On the other hand, the WONDEROAM 1 DAY plan is available for both postpaid and prepaid customers. It gives users quota allocations ranging from 50MB onwards (depending on country) for RM38/day. Postpaid subscribers will automatically be charged upon using the Internet service while connected to preferred networks when roaming while prepaid subscribers will have their credit balance deducted upon purchase via the *118# USSD.The big benefit of this WONDEROAM daily plan is that there will be no bill shock as Celcom doesn’t offer any pay-per-use plans with it. Additionally, you won’t be able to connect to data if you’re not connected to one of Celcom’s preferred roaming partners. What’s more, if you have finished your internet quota, you can still surf but at throttled speeds.Celcom also offers a WONDEROAM 1 WEEK that’s available exclusively for Celcom FIRST Gold and the new FIRST Platinum subscribers. This plan will cost RM138/week and will give subscribers unlimited calls, unlimited SMS and 3GB of internet. If you finish your allocated 3GB of quota, data connection stops and you will have to resubscribe for another 3GB of data. Calls and SMS remain unlimited though.Celcom boasts that with WONDEROAM 1 DAY RM38, you can take advantage of their extensive roaming network that extends to 165 countries (which Celcom claims is the most of any local telco). They also say that there will be at least two roaming partners in each country which should mean much better accessibility.Unfortunately, WONDEROAM 1 DAY SOCIAL RM10 and WONDEROAM 1 WEEK RM138 are only available in 10 selected countries: Singapore, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos and Macau.Another tidbit Celcom revealed during the WONDEROAM launch is that they will be rolling out a brand new plan to add to their FIRST line of postpaid plans — the FIRST Platinum. According to Celcom, details on this new plan will be revealed tomorrow (15 April).Teased awhile back as the plan for the “heavy user” Celcom has been talking about launching the FIRST Platinum plan to complement the “light” FIRST BLUE and “moderate” FIRST Gold plans for some time now."

There are two ways to activate this plan: If you’re an existing U Mobile customer (more than 6 months), you can simply call them at 1318 and  they will sort you out.On the other hand, if you’re a new customer (less than 6 months), you will first have to activate auto debit for bill payments, then call U Mobile at 1318 to get your roaming plan sorted. Alternatively, port-in customers can also walk-in with their past 2 months’ bill, one month of which must indicate international roaming usage.If you happen to run out of quota, you can continue surfing at managed speeds. Alternatively, you can pick up U Mobile’s Booster Plan via the MyUMobile app which gives you 1.5GB of quota valid for 3 days for RM10.This is a pretty interesting move by U Mobile which should ease user’s data roaming when travelling. Allowing you to use your local data plan overseas without having to pay extra is a pretty good deal. The only complication is that you have to be connected to specific roaming operators to be able to benefit from this deal. The good news is that U Mobile has step-by-step guides on how to select a preferred roaming operator for Android, iOS, Windows, BB10 and BB OS7 platforms on their website.What do you guys think of this plan?

It looks absolutely stunning from almost any angle.Impossible Project calls their new-old camera the “only new camera for the original Polaroid format” and it is designed to shoot on their type 600 film. This particular film has been painstakingly reverse engineered from Polaroid’s discontinued 600-type film, but if you happen to have any of that original film lying around, the I-1 will also accept that.It’s classic with what it shoots on, but completely modern with how you shoot with it. The I-1 is designed for simplicity with very few buttons, no knobs and an auto-adjusting LED flash that compensates for ambient light and distance.The camera also connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth. Install the companion app and it will give you a lot more control over this camera. Users can adjust aperture, shutter speed, flash settings and even remote trigger the camera.The app also provides users with several preset effects like double exposures and open-shutter long exposure shots. What’s more, you can also charge it via a microUSB cable which means it should hook up to your powerbank/wall socket without a problem. No more pesky batteries to worry about.That said, this awesome-looking camera will be priced at USD299 (around RM1,550) when it goes on sale on the 10th of May. Unfortunately, when I checked out the site, it seems that only purchases from their EU store will be shipped to Malaysia, so the price may differ."
Rory Lee,Can HTC’s new flagship smartphone score a perfect 10?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/12/can-htcs-new-flagship-smartphone-score-a-perfect-10/,"android,htc,htc 10,htc 10 reveal,htc 10 smartphone,htc 2016,htc best smartphone,htc flagship,htc flagship 2016,htc power of 10,marshmallow,power of 10,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-04-12,"The power of 10.HTC has made many bold claims about their brand new flagship device, the HTC 10, and after all the hype, it’s finally here. Does it stack up?Well, on paper, it definitely doesn’t skimp on power. On the front, the HTC 10 has got a beautiful 5.2-inch quad-HD Super LCD5 display being powered by a 2.2GHz Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor on the inside mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB/64GB of expandable (via microSD up to 2TB) internal storage.For its “World First, World Class” camera, HTC is putting its money on a 12-megapixel UltraPixel 2 primary camera on the back with a fast f/1.8 aperture lens, OIS, laser autofocus and a dual-tone LED flash. It uses the same fewer megapixels with larger pixels (1.55µm, same as the Nexus 6P) formula found on a lot of the newer flagship smartphones.On the front, it’s got a 5MP UltraSelfie camera also packing a fast f/1.8 aperture lens, OIS and a wide 23mm focal length. What’s more, it also supports autofocus and full-HD 1080p video recording.The 10 has got BoomSound too. Yep, HTC are calling the speakers on the 10 re-engineered BoomSound Hi-Fi edition which is supposed to be the best BoomSound speakers to date.Encased in its full-metal unibody is one of the largest batteries HTC has ever fitted on a smartphone — a 3,000 mAh unit. It sounds small by modern-day standards but HTC has often been one to shy away from larger batteries so this is a pretty big move for them.HTC’s 10 will be running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with the latest HTC Sense running on top of it. One interesting thing is that HTC says the 10 is doing away with the conventional icon-grid layout, giving users more opportunity to get creative with the Freestyle Layout. It apparently lets you drag icons, stickers and widgets anywhere you like across the UI.The walls are closing in on the Taiwanese company that used to be at the forefront of Android smartphone development. We all remember their heyday, but that time has long past and now it’s time to look towards the future, but that future is a little muddy for HTC.I love HTC’s smartphones. My first smartphone ever was an HTC so it really pains me to see this company crumble beneath the weight of its own hubris. Refusing to adapt despite a lackluster performance was one of the biggest factors that put HTC in the position they’re in right now.For that very reason, the 10 has to be magnificent. It has to be the best smartphone HTC has ever made. It’s crunch time for the Taiwanese company and while the 10 looks pretty good on paper, it’s how it stacks up against the competition that will be the deciding factor on whether this phone can bring HTC back to their glory days.According to TheVerge, the HTC 10 will start shipping next month in the US and will be priced at USD699 (RM2,720)."

If you’re curious about its camera performance, imaging authority DxoMark has finally given it its stamp of approval.With a total score of 88 points, the HTC 10 shares the same podium with the current champion, the Galaxy S7 edge. Following HTC’s tradition of going for larger pixels, the 10 uses a 12MP 1/2.3″ sensor with 1.55 micron pixels. According to DxoMark’s review, the HTC 10 was outstanding for both stills and videos. For photos, the 10 offers great details and fast auto focus while keeping noise down low in low light conditions. For capturing videos, the HTC 10 is capable of shooting 4K (2160p) videos in 30fps. Focus while recording is fast and accurate in most cases except for panning situations. Their review for the HTC 10 is pretty brief compared to the Galaxy S7 edge and for video, it scored an overall sub-score of 86 points.

Rory Lee,DJI’s Osmo and Phantom drones officially land in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/13/djis-osmo-and-phantom-drones-officially-land-in-malaysia/,"buy dji malaysia,dji,dji drone,dji malaysia,dji osmo,dji osmo malaysia,dji phantom,dji phantom 4,dji phantom 4 malaysia,drone,drone camera,malaysia,cool stuff,others","Cool stuff,Others",2016-04-13,"Drones have changed the landscape of photo and videography. Shots that previously required massive cranes and even helicopters can now be accomplished by virtually anyone anywhere in the world.At the forefront of drone development is none other than Chinese company DJI and they’ve just brought their iconic Phantom drones into Malaysia.The Phantom series of drones have to be one of the most iconic drones in the world, making appearances in movies and cartoons around the world. It has become difficult to think of a drone without the image of the Phantom’s iconic design popping into your head.DJI’s brand new Phantom 4 keeps to that same look plus a few added improvements. The arms that hold the propellers are slimmer and thinner to help the drone be more aerodynamic. Its camera also gets a new gimbal and even the propeller blades can be mounted more easily.The Phantom 4 is designed to make flying a drone easy and from what I could tell based on their brief demonstration — it does. One of the most astounding things the Phantom 4 brings is its obstacle avoidance function.Thanks to two front mounted optical sensors, the drone can “see” obstacles when it’s flying and will stop when it thinks it’s going to crash. This works both when the drone is flying on autopilot and when you’re flying it via the controller.On autopilot, when the drone detects an obstacle, it will make one decision: Can it fly over the obstacle? If the answer is yes, then it will do just that, otherwise the drone will stop and beep your controller. If you’re the one behind the wheel (controller?) and you mindlessly run into an obstacle, the drone will stop and beep your controller to let you know you’re being a bit of a tool.Not into using a controller? You can also tap on your connected (via the DJI app) smartphone’s display to tell the drone to “Go” to a particular location.The Phantom 4 also has an active track function that allows the drone to autonomously track a subject of choice. Simply select the subject on your smartphone’s display and the drone will scan it, recognise its shape and features. then proceed to track the target.This gives pilots the freedom to move their drone without worrying about losing their subject in the frame — an awesome feature for new pilots who aren’t that good with the controls yet.DJI’s Phantom 4 shoots crisp 4K video at 30fps and full-HD 1080p at 120fps. What’s more, the camera gets a new 8-element aspherical lens that eliminates unwanted fisheye distortion and reduces chromatic aberration in its footage. The drone’s battery gets a boost too, allowing DJI to rate flight time at 28 minutes per charge.The Osmo is an interesting piece of tech. It’s sort of like a drone’s camera and camera mount without the drone. DJI are calling it a stabilised handheld 4K camera — and it’s exactly that.A Zenmuse X3 camera mounted on a stick allows DJI to bring their drone’s video stabilisation to the ground. It’s fairly simple to operate with only two buttons and a trigger. The video stabilisation is pretty awesome but I believe its portability and light weight are the Osmo’s strongest features.Camera stabilisation rigs usually weigh a tonne, but the Osmo shoots crisp 4K video while weighing about the same as a 500ml water bottle.This is the first time DJI are bringing their drones into Malaysia officially. Partnering with ECS Malaysia, these drones will make their way into all ECS retailers like All IT hypermarket and online at sites like Lazada.If you want to pick a Phantom 4 up, be prepared to pony up as the drone will be priced at RM6,199. However, if you’re on a tight budget, ECS have also brought in three different variants of the older Phantom 3 (priced at RM2,129 for the Standard, RM3,499 for the Advanced and RM4,499 for the Professional). The Osmo OM 160, on the other hand, costs RM2,499.For now, ECS Malaysia is only bringing in these three models. However, they did say that if there is a demand for the other drones in DJI’s extensive lineup, ECS Malaysia will bring put them up for sale as well.I know what drone I’m looking forward to — the Inspire 1 — but what about you guys? Or are these products everything you need? Let us know in the comments below."

The information was dropped alongside the specs for an unknown Sony Xperia device as well as what looks like the LG G Flex 3.Other rumours about the Note 6 include IP68 certification, a 5.8 inch QHD display, 6GB RAM (though here its stated to have up to 8GB, maybe a variant?) and 64/128GB internal storage options for the device.

Rory Lee,5 things you need to know about the HTC 10,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/12/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-htc-10/,"5 things you need to know about the htc 10,htc,htc 10,htc 2016,htc flagship,htc new smartphone,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-04-12,"HTC promised the world with their HTC 10. While we can’t say for certain that this smartphone will live up to all the hype it has claimed, there are several interesting things that HTC has done with their latest flagship.Everyone can say they have a world class smartphone camera. HTC claims that they’re obsessed with providing the best camera experience ever. What they went with was a 12-megapixel UltraPixel 2 primary camera on the back. This unit has large 1.55µm pixels (same as the Nexus 6P) with a fast f/1.8 aperture lens, OIS and laser autofocus. An impressive spec sheet, but that’s not all.The front-facing UltraSelfie camera looks pretty good on paper too. It comes with OIS (which is very rare for a selfie snapper) and autofocus. What’s more, it’s got pretty large 1.34µm pixels which should make for good low-light performance.Well, on paper at least. This is the first time HTC has placed 4GB of RAM into their flagship smartphone. Pair that with Qualcomm’s super-fast Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor clocked at 2.2GHz and this smartphone should do pretty darn well when it comes to performance.BoomSound was one of the most iconic features associated with HTC’s flagship smartphones. They were fantastic sounding dual front-facing stereo speakers that blew almost every other smartphone speaker out of the water. HTC claims that the HTC 10’s BoomSound Hi-Fi Edition with Dolby Audio is the best BoomSound speaker ever.It no longer uses the twin front-facing stereo speakers, though, instead opting for a new setup that utilises a bottom firing speaker and the earpiece to project sound.If you’ve ever used an HTC smartphone, you would’ve probably have noticed that they don’t like to place big batteries in their smartphones. This time, HTC has broken a norm and placed a large (by HTC standards) 3,000 mAh battery in the 10 which HTC claims can last you two days on a single charge.Not only that, HTC has also included support for Quick Charge 3.0 which gives the 10 a 50% charge from dead in just 30 minutes.Customisability has been Android’s calling card. HTC takes this to a whole new level with their new Freestyle Theme. This theme essentially allows users to place apps and icons wherever they please, creating a UI look and feel that is unique to each individual. This theme does away with the grid layout found on your regular smartphone and that lets users get creative with app placements and app icons among others.For more information, check out our announcement post."

The Pro 6 has suffered from quite a few leaks following up to the launch but this is the biggest one yet.The latest leak not only spills the beans on the specs of the device but also has images of the phone in the flesh, as well as AnTuTu benchmark scores. Wow.As far as the specs go, the Meizu Pro 6 will have a MediaTek MT6797T (Helio X25) chipset mated to 4GB RAM, a 21 megapixel camera with 10 LED flash ring under the main camera and a front snapper at 5 megapixels. Both cameras will feature laser autofocus. The display will be a Samsung made 5.2 inch Super AMOLED with 3D Touch-like capabilities at 1080p. The device will have 32GB internal storage but no microSD slot, but it will support dual-SIM. Last but not least, it will be running Android 6.0 Marshmallow skinned with Meizu’s Flyme OS. Oh, and fast charging.The 3D Touch feature will only operate with certain native apps on the phone, and apparently isn’t as well implemented as Apple’s own Force Touch.The leakster also managed to run AnTuTu on the Meizu Pro 6 and it scored better than its predecessor the Pro 5, which only averaged at about 86,322 while the Pro 6 clocked in a good 91,165 points. Of course its left in the dust by the likes of the the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (134,599) and the Xiaomi Mi 5 (136,875) but puts it close to the Huawei Mate 8, which averaged about 91,157 points during AnTuTu testing.The Meizu Pro 6 is set to drop 13 April, so fingers crossed they’ll still have something to surprise us with at launch.[SOURCE][VIA]"

According to its CEO CC Puan, webe isn’t just a refresh but a leap forward in the telco space. To get things started, they have introduced webe community. It is somewhat similar to Kickstarter except that you won’t need to fork out a single sen. At the moment, they have 7 projects on board which includes a local zombie movie that will be distributed online for free. All these projects are already funded and they just require the community’s support to get it moving. To pledge your support for a project, all webe community members can support using webits which are given for free. All new signups get 50 webits for free and you can earn more webits by sharing the project on your social networks. You can try it out yourself using the official webe app that’s available on iOS and Android.Webe hasn’t shared any details on its plans and the launch today is simply to reveal the brand’s ambition. Expect them to reveal their consumer offering later sometime in the 2nd half of this year.

Among those is an apparently thinner body, a bigger battery and a dual camera setup.First off, do bear in mind a lot of these are still hearsay so take it with a pinch of salt.To start off, Apple will be trying to make the next iPhone even thinner than the iPhone 6s, meaning they are aiming to make it way thinner than 7.1mm body of the iPhone 6s, possibly somewhere in the margin of 6 to 6.5mm. That’s already ridiculously thin but that would mean impacting the capacity of the battery. Though to be perfectly honest, we’re not expecting any change in terms of design, especially not after the release of the iPhone SE.However, a different leak states that the iPhone 7’s battery will actually be bigger, being marked at 7.04 watt-hours; being a leap and a jump higher than the iPhone 6s’ rating of 6.61 and the iPhone 6s Plus’ 7.01 watt-hours. So how exactly are they going to squeeze in a bigger battery when they’re trying to make the chassis thinner?Last but not least the iPhone 7 is rumoured to have a dual camera lens. The feature has been more or less “confirmed” by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo but its too early to say that if will be implemented. Especially since some earlier leaks showed two camera holes (or in some cases an elongated single hole) for the rear camera in the chassis.The next big iPhone is expected to release this September, barring no changes.What would you like to see on the next iPhone?[SOURCE][VIA]"

While the Spectrum i100 is pretty explanatory (its like a slate in some ways) the PC Stick on the other hand is a teeny thing that will allow you to make any screen (with a keyboard and mouse of course) into a PC just by plugging it in.Under the hood, the Spectrum i100 is home to an Intel Atom z3735F chip at 1.33GHz, 2GB RAM, alongside 64GB internal memory. It also runs off Intel HD graphics and a large 8900mAh battery. The device also sports a 2 megapixel front and 5 megapixel rear camera combo and a 10.6 inch 1080p IPS screen. The Spectrum i100 doesn’t look like a Surface killer but with the bundled keyboard and Windows 10 on board it could make for a decent work machine if you don’t want to lug around a heavy notebook.As for the PC Stick, it has an Intel Atom z3735F, quad-core SOC on board mated to 2GB RAM, 32GB storage (expandable via microSD slot) and Intel HD 2D/3D graphics capabilities as well as Windows 10. Its not too different from Intel’s own Compute Stick as its design to power any compatible smart tv or monitor into a functional PC.The STOM Spectrum i100 retails for RM 1,099 while the PC Stick retails for RM 599, and there plans to bundle together the devices with a plan with YES in the future.If you want to snag it, head on over to Thundermatch’s online store or visit Lazada, which is already offering both devices at a discount (RM 999 and RM 399 respectively) as part of the launch promo.

The phone also has a curved back and front panel as well as relatively slim side panels.The Xperia C6 is also rumoured to sport a 5.5″ full HD display up front, with a 2.0GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor running on the inside.The most recent Xperia C device was the Xperia C5 Ultra which launched last year.

Early this year we’ve seen several brands offering out of the box 360 VR content creation devices like the Nikon 360 and Samsung Gear 360.GoPro did have a couple of 360 tools like their circular rig with 16 GoPros mounted on it but it isn’t exactly designed for spherical VR and it’s far from practical for mainstream use. For something more livable, GoPro has finally unveiled this little cube and it’s called the Omni. It has six GoPro HERO4 Black cameras with one mounted on each side. When you hit record, all 6 cameras will shoot simultaneously and it will stitch all those footages together for a seamless 360 degree video. There’s no pricing yet but 6x GoPro HERO4 Black Edition cameras alone would cost RM13,794 in total. You could build your own rig but GoPro’s official solution takes out the hassle of synchronising and stitching the videos after you’re done shooting.The next big thing to expect from GoPro is a Karma drone. They have yet to reveal any clues but it will be compatible with current GoPro cameras and it could have a foldable design. There’s no official launch date yet but Engadget reckons that it could be released after June. With more platforms such as YouTube and Facebook already supporting 360 videos, what’s missing are practical devices to create such content.

The best part? This is applicable to both new and existing MaxisONE customers.During Maxis’ Facebook Live announcement at 3pm today, CEO Morten Lundal and Consumer Business head Dushyan announced that the telco will be launching its upgraded plans later this month. The new plans will offer customers much higher data quotas at the same price.In Dushyan’s examples, plans that are currently offering 1GB (RM98/month) of quota will now offer 5GB of quota while plans that are offering 3GB (RM128/month) of quota will be upgraded to 8GB of quota. What’s more, all existing MaxisONE Plan customers will also be receiving these upgrades for free.While these plans are only going to be launched later this month, Maxis are offering free 3GB of data to all MaxisONE Plan customers starting next week to tide them over until the new plans arrive.Maxis also has upgrades in store for MaxisONE Business plans.It appears Maxis concerned from top to bottom, evident from the CEO personally addressing their customers. Maxis is really trying to make things right but the question remains whether this will be enough to win back their subscribers after the recent debacle. This serves as a reminder to telcos that they should pay close attention to their customers.// <![CDATA[

Check out the latest postpaid comparison here.Maxis has finally responded to the recent postpaid price war by upgrading all MaxisONE plans with up to 9GB of extra data. These new upgraded plans will be rolled out to all new and existing subscribers by the end of this month. While waiting for that to kick in, Maxis is giving 3GB extra data next week to all MaxisONE plan customers.So how does Maxis’ postpaid offering compare against the rest? It’s time for another round of postpaid comparison.Maxis
In our previous comparison, Maxis looked pretty costly with a paltry 1GB of data for its base RM98 plan. Now they have bumped up their data allocation from 1GB to 5GB, 3GB to 8GB, 5GB to 12GB and 7GB to 16GB. The monthly subscription fee remains unchanged except for East Malaysia, where they are offering RM30 off each month and they are offering unlimited data usage between 1AM to 7AM daily. Celcom, Digi and U Mobile
For Celcom, they have extended its FIRST postpaid offering until 31st May. To recap, FIRST Blue at RM45/month comes with 4GB of data (2GB all time + 2GB weekend), 50 minutes of calls and 50 SMS. For heavy duty users, FIRST Gold offers 10GB of data (5GB all time + 5GB weekend) plus unlimited calls and SMS for RM80/month. Digi on the other hand revamped its postpaid offering last month with more data and internet rollover. As a limited time promo, they are allocating more data for its higher “More Internet” plans and a RM20/month discount for its “More Talk” options of RM98 and above. Hitting the sweet spot for Digi is probably their Postpaid 98 (More Voice), as it offers 7GB of data and unlimited calls at RM78/month.   Over at team orange, U Mobile has recently boosted its P70 Hero Postpaid plan with a whopping 15GB data for RM70/month. This plan also comes with unlimited voice calls. Note that the extra 8GB is given as a promo until 30th June 2016. So how does it all stack up? Click on our comparison table below for a clearer view. Conclusion
It is commendable for Maxis to bump up more data for their plans but the pricing is still on the high side when compared to its competitors. If you’re looking solely at cost per GB, Celcom’s FIRST Gold is likely your top pick as it offers 10GB of data at RM80/month in addition to its unlimited calls and SMS. Both U Mobile and Digi are quite generous as well by offering more than 5GB of data for RM70 and under. If you can’t finish your data quota, Celcom and Digi lets you carry forward unused data (up to a certain limit) to the following month. Beyond the cost of data, calls and SMS, there are other factors to consider such as network quality and customer service. Each telco will perform differently depending on location, so it is best to pick one that has optimal coverage for both home and work. You can use OpenSignal to get a rough idea of which network performs better in your area. After all, what’s the use of getting lots of data if you can’t use them?For those that travel, another factor to consider is their international roaming packages. Most telcos these days do have daily roaming plans but they could vary in terms of price and countries supported. Most recently U Mobile has started offering RM10/day data roam for selected countries while Maxis has thrown additional unlimited calls and SMS with MaxisONE World. Looking for a newer alternative? Webe is launching next week. If their purported unlimited plan is real, this could be the best postpaid ever."

The 5.5 inch iPhone 7 Plus is also expected to feature a dual camera system, a feature that is predicted to become more standard across smartphones in the coming year.As for the Apple Watch 2 which might come around this June or September, it might be up to 20-40% thinner than it currently is, at 10.5mm.

It gives users a near bezel-less experience that is difficult to find on any other smartphone. However, with a display that bleeds over to the side of the smartphone, it becomes really easy to have unintended accidental touches when you’re typing or just with general use.While I personally didn’t have any problems with that, my colleagues ran into this particular problem quite often.

Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.For photos, the device gets a 13-megapixel primary camera with PDAF and a front-facing 8-megapixel selfie shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000 mAh battery.While the internals are impressive, we’re a little on the fence about the looks of the smartphone. Sure, it’s got a nice full-metal unibody with rounded edges for better feel-in-hand. But, it just looks so much like an OPPO R series smartphone and I think we have more than enough of that design.That said, the V3Max also packs a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, dual-SIM support, LTE connectivity, Quick Charge and will come running Android Lollipop out of the box.You can’t exactly buy the smartphone right now, but you can pre-order the device from authorised Vivo retailers in Malaysia, or online at DirectD for RM1,399.

Rory Lee,Huawei P9 is official — twin Leica lenses eyeing to be the world’s best,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/06/huawei-p9-is-official-twin-leica-lenses-eyeing-to-be-the-worlds-best/,"huawei,huawei p9,huawei p9 launch,huawei p9 official,huawei p9 reveal,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-04-06,"After making its rounds in the rumour mill, Huawei has finally unveiled the P9 and its bigger sibling, the P9 Plus. Touted to reinvent smartphone photography, the twin lenses mounted on the rear of the P9 and P9 Plus are designed to emulate the human eye.Sounds promising. But while it does have Leica certification, the camera maker’s role in the development of the P9’s cameras is a little vague.On the surface of things, Huawei’s P9 seems to keep up with the rest of the flagship smartphones that have come out this year. Dominating the front of the metal-bodied P9 is a 5.2-inch full-HD IPS display boasting a pixel density of 424ppi. Being powered by the Chinese company’s own Kirin 955 processor (four Cortex-A72 cores and four A53 cores) mated to 3GB/4GB of RAM on the inside, the P9 should be a monster when it comes to performance.It’s also got a modest 3,000 mAh battery to keep the smartphone going, along with a USB Type-C port located at the bottom of the device for charging and data transfer. Apparently, storage options will vary depending on the market. In Europe, the P9 will come with 32GB of internal storage but have an option for expansion via a microSD card slot. On the other hand, China’s P9 will receive the 64GB variant of the P9 but have its microSD card slot replaced by a second SIM slot.The P9 looks like a gorgeous smartphone with a premium build. It’s pretty amazing how they’ve managed to cram a rather sizable battery and two camera modules (no camera bump!) into a device that’s only 6.95mm thick. In terms of looks, it shares many similarities to the P8 that it succeeds, but the P9 seems to be more rounded and more comfortable to hold.The P9 Plus shares many of the P9’s specifications barring a few tweaks that give the device its name. Being the bigger of the duo, the P9 Plus will pack a 5.5-inch full-HD AMOLED panel on the front, instead of the IPS LCD display found on the regular P9, which should translate to better contrast and deeper blacks.Inside, it’s also powered by the Kirin 955 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (China is also getting a 128GB variant). The P9 Plus also gets a pressure sensitive display called Press Touch (much like one of last year’s Mate S variants) and an IR blaster. It’s also got a larger 3,400 mAh battery to power the larger screen.Both the P9 and P9 Plus will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Huawei’s EMUI 4.1 running on top. The duo will also sport Huawei’s rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which history tells us should be pretty stellar. The smartphones also share an 8-megapixel front camera with AF for selfies.Much of the hype built around the P9 duo comes from Huawei’s partnership with Leica. A team-up between the legendary camera maker and one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world is the stuff of dreams when it comes to advancing smartphone photography. But, it seems that the German camera-maker may not have had such a big hand in designing the P9’s snappers.On paper, the Huawei P9 and P9 Plus sport two 12-megapixel Sony IMX286 sensors on the back mated to a pair of Leica Summarit H 1:2.2/27 lenses (f/2.2 with a 27mm focal length). But, as The Verge reveals, there is slightly more to the cameras and Leica branding than meets the eye.The biggest hint is the fact that Huawei consistently claims that the P9’s dual cameras are “Leica certified”. Not Leica engineered or Leica developed, simply Lecia certified. According to The Verge, when they pushed Huawei to define what that meant, the Chinese company said that the cameras were developed through a “co-engineering process”, which is rather vague if you’d ask me.Could it just be Leica simply stamping its brand on a smartphone?That said, the P9’s primary cameras are pretty interesting. Of the two 12MP snappers, one of them is a monochrome module. Apparently, when the monochrome unit works together with the regular camera unit, the two sensors can improve contrast in photos by 50% while tripling the light information taken by the phone. This is due to the monochrome sensor’s ability to soak up more photos because of its lack of an RGB light filter that its colour sibling requires.How this actually translates into real-world photography remains to be seen, but I can tell you that I’m more than excited to test the cameras out.The P9 Plus is said to be available in May in both Asia and Europe while the smaller P9 will go on sale in both continents by the end of this month. The P9 will be priced at EUR599 (around RM2,660) for the 3GB RAM/32GB storage version while the 4GB RAM/64GB storage variant will go for EUR649 (around RM2,882). The P9 Plus, on the other hand, will set you back EUR749 (around RM3,330) for the 4GB RAM/64GB storage model.What do you guys think of this smartphone? Are you sold yet?[SOURCE, 2]"
Rory Lee,This could be the best postpaid plan in town — RM80/month for unlimited everything,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/06/webe-unlimited-postpaid-plan/,"p1,packet one,packet one networks,telekom,tm,tm 4g lte,webe,webe mobile operator,players on the field","P1,P1,Players on the Field,TM",2016-04-06,"Many of you might not have heard of Webe, but after today’s set of events, they’re probably going to be on everyone’s lips. We have speculated in the past that Webe might become the next 4G LTE operator (under P1 and TM) and it looks like our suspicions might have just become reality.What’s more, it also seems that Webe might just have the best mobile 4G LTE plan yet.After some digging, Lowyat.net came across a staging site for the aforementioned Webe. This staging site not only reveals that Webe is going to begin operations as a 4G LTE operator, but also that they’re offering ridiculously good value plans.From the looks of things, Webe’s starter plan will offer consumers 20GB of data, 1,000 minutes of calls and 1,000 SMSes from only RM8 a month. Keep in mind that the RM8/month price tag is only available for existing P1 customers who choose to pick up a device plus the plan.If someone is an existing P1 customer that doesn’t want to pick up a plan, they would have to pay RM9. For non-P1 customers, you would have to pay RM10 for the plan instead.As peculiar as it sounds, Lowyat.net also discovered that if you wanted to enable tethering for your Webe data plan, you would have to add on an additional RM10. That brings the total up to RM20/month which is still a pretty smashing deal.But that’s not all. It also seems that Webe are looking to introduce an unlimited plan for RM80/month. And when they say unlimited, they truly mean unlimited as the page indicates that users who subscribe to this plan will get unlimited 4G Internet, unlimited calls and unlimited SMS. The plan also allows for shared lines (up to 3 lines) which could mean that up to four different lines sharing one unlimited quota.Comparatively, an existing RM80 plan like Celcom’s FIRST Gold plan only gives you 10GB of data (split between weekends and weekdays).However, as this is only a test page, we do urge you to take this with a grain of salt as its seems too good to be true. These numbers could only be placeholder figures and not reflect the final plan’s pricing. Either way, this is exciting stuff and we will find out the truth of them come the 13th of April when P1 finally unveils its big secret.What do you guys think of these plans?[SOURCE, 2, 3, VIA]"

A space that used to be dominated by people who had access to the right equipment is now almost a level playing field for anyone with the creativity and drive to shoot.Don’t believe me? Check these photos out.These images come courtesy of a group of EyeEm photographers from across Europe who were each given a brand new Huawei P9 smartphone  and told to capture their city through the eyes of the P9.Huawei has made big claims about its Leica certified dual 12MP primary shooters mounted on the back of its P9, but we never really got to see how it would perform in the real world — until now, that is.As you’re browsing through these stunning images (click on each one to view a larger photo), do keep in mind that these photographs were taken by people who know what they’re doing. Still, as professional as these photographers might be, it’s pretty hard to ignore just how good the image quality is.         The Huawei P9 utilises two Sony IMX286 sensors mounted side by side — one monochrome sensor and one colour sensor. Both sensors are paired with Leica Summarit H 1:2.2/27 lenses. The reason for the monochrome sensor is that it can absorb more light information for each photo.Working together, the two cameras can improve contrast in photos by about 50% while also supposedly giving the P9 the best black and white photos in the market.What do you guys think of the photos?[SOURCE]"

From the photos, the new mobile brand is going to be called Webe and it looks like they are ready to launch very soon.

OPPO’s F1 Plus has arrived in all its wafer-thin magnificence hoping to take your selfie game to the next level. In terms of raw on-paper specifications, it does have a pretty good shot at it too.Also known in some markets as the OPPO R9, the F1 Plus is a significant bump up in terms of specifications and build compared to the F1. The phone it succeeds has a plasticky finish that felt good at first but loses its charm after some time.On the other hand, the F1 Plus is a completely different beast. Firstly, it’s got a gorgeous metal unibody that feels awesome with its rounded edges. It’s also got a larger and more crisp 5.5-inch full-HD AMOLED display which is a treat if you’re coming from the old F1’s 5-inch 720p panel.Inside, it’s also got a little more horsepower in the form of a MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core processor mated to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable internal storage. It also has a 2,850 mAh battery (with VOOC flash charge support) and comes running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with colorOS 3.0 running on top. To beef up security, the OPPO F1 Plus features a front-mounted fingerprint scanner that also doubles as a physical home button.The handset’s party piece, though, is its selfie camera. On the front, it’s got a massive 16-megapixel f/2.0 snapper which gives it its “Selfie Expert” title. That’s nearly double the megapixel count on most of the smartphone selfie cameras currently in the market. At the back, it gets a modest 13MP snapper with PDAF and an f/2.2 aperture lens.Despite the original title belonging to the F1, the smartphone didn’t really live up to its name. It’s 8-megapixel camera was decent, but it was nowhere near good enough to be called an “expert”.We all know that megapixel count isn’t the only think that makes a camera good, so while 16MP looks good on paper, it may not automatically translate into fantastic image quality. Whether this smartphone is fit to bear the “Selfie Expert” title will require a lot of testing and a whole lot of selfies.If you are interested in this sexy device from OPPO, the F1 Plus will be priced at RM1,898 and be available in all authorised OPPO retailers starting the 11th of April. You can secure your very own OPPO F1 Plus now, though, as OPPO have put the device up on both their online store and 11street. However, the smartphones will only begin shipping on the 11th of April."

At the moment, they have a triple play lineup with Fibre Internet, voice services and a formidable IPTV offering. Having a mobile service will be the final piece of the puzzle as TM will be able to cover users both at home and while on the go.According to TM’s group CEO Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa in an interview with TheStar, it’s going to be exciting and they are on track to roll out its mobile service through P1.TM is no rookie in the mobile business. They were a key stakeholder when Celcom first started and they had also started TM Touch with its 013 mobile number prefix. With TM acquiring P1 back in 2014, they now have access to run a 4G LTE network on 2600MHz in addition to its current 850MHz LTE network for TMgo.So what about availability? TM’s new mobile network should be able to provide nationwide coverage from the get go. Similar to U Mobile, TM had signed domestic roaming agreement with Celcom which will keep you connected when TM’s 4G network isn’t available. In exchange, TM will enable Celcom to offer Fibre Broadband services on HSBB and provide robust high-bandwidth connectivity to Celcom’s 4G LTE sites.Responding to critics, Zamzamzairani says that P1 is still a new investment and it will take a couple of years to turn profitable. He added that P1’s business has stabilised and they currently have 170,000 subscribers while TM’s own TMgo broadband service has 60,000 subscribers.When touching on the subject of competition, Zamzamzairani added that senseless competition is not good for everyone but nonetheless, competition is good to keep TM on its toes. For us, consumers, we hope that TM will bring more to the table than just throwing cheaper data plans.On the expansion of fibre broadband, TM is now in the next phase with High-Speed Broadband Phase 2 (HSBB2) which will include extensions in Sabah and Sarawak.  In addition to fibre, TM also embarks on a Sub-Urban Broadband (SUBB) project that involves upgrading works of existing copper lines to support faster speeds up to 20Mbps. Both projects will be rolled out across a 10 year period.Are you looking forward to Malaysia’s 5th 4G LTE telco? Let us know in the comments below.[ SOURCE ]"

Inside, the smartphone packs a MediaTek Helio P10 processor mated to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable internal storage.The device will also come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with colorOS 3.0 running on top.

In fact, this device is so focused on selfies that the rear camera only sports a 13-megapixel f/2.2 unit with PDAF.The build and looks are very similar that of the F1 and if you’d like to take a closer look at this smartphone, you can check out our album on Facebook.If you’re interested in preordering one for yourself, you can do so in two ways. The first is online via the OPPO Malaysia store. Simply place a pre-order, non-refundable fee of RM1 and you can lock in your device. Alternatively, you can place a pre-order offline at authorised OPPO concept stores in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. If you choose to place an offline pre-order, you will be required to pay an RM200 down payment.Pre-ordering the device does have some perks as OPPO are throwing in a selfie stick worth RM49 with every pre-order placed. Additionally, if you’re among the first 100 customers to complete the purchase on the day of the launch, OPPO will throw in a Bluetooth headset worth RM178.Pre-orders start today and will go all the way to the 6th of April 2016 at 6pm. The price for the OPPO F1 Plus will be revealed on the day of launch at 3.30pm.

This is mostly a darker theme, with game-based navigation and a live tab plus new pages to manage your games and channels.
So you can use these tabs to scroll through your favourite channels or find new channels to watch based on which games they have in their playlists. You can even set it to display only the games you want to watch playthroughs for or check out channels that are currently streaming it live.However, the most important feature is probably the live-streaming capabilities of the app, as you can now record and live-stream mobile gameplay from you devices using Mobile Capture. No more wrangling weird capture cards just to record; hit the Go Live button, turn on your selfie cam and record commentary straight off your phone.This is great for devs of mobile games because before this it was a bit tougher to grab gameplay footage straight off phones, maybe we’ll be having more channels dedicated to mobile gaming now?You can grab the app straight off the Google Play Store or the App store for free."

It’s difficult to justify purchasing this smartphone over any of the other 2016 flagships that have and are soon to be arriving on our shores.But, here’s the thing, you don’t have to do that because the Huawei Mate 8 has one big advantage over the competition.Don’t get me wrong, the Mate 8 will run pretty much as smoothly as any of the other flagships in the market right now. With the help of Huawei’s new silicone and Android 6.0 Marshmallow, you probably won’t even notice any of the minor stutters I did unless you’re coming from a significantly more powerful device.It’s even pretty good in the camera department. Nothing to shout about, but it is certainly capable of taking some great shots. It’s also got a massive battery that should easily last the average user an average day.But, if I had to pick one standout feature, it would be the device’s big screen. It makes content consumption so satisfying but is this enough to tempt you away from the majority of this, or even last year’s, flagship smartphones? Well, that depends on the user. I will say this, though, if you want an enormous top-of-the-line smartphone, you would be hard pressed to find something that runs better."

Rory Lee,Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 review: Best smartphone on a budget?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/05/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-review-best-smartphone-on-a-budget/,"000,android,budget,redmi note 3,redmi note 3 review,redmi note 3 review malaysia,smartphone,smartphone under rm1,xiaomi,xiaomi redmi note 3,xiaomi redmi note 3 review,xiaomi redmi note 3 review malaysia,mobile devices,mobile os,product review",,2016-04-05,"For the longest time, Xiaomi has been king of the entry-level and affordable market. Their ability to consistently forge great phones and sell them at low prices is nothing short incredible.In recent months, a demand grew in the entry-to-midrange smartphone market for budget devices with a premium build. Feeling their competitors close in, Xiaomi made a move that shocked many — they introduced the all-metal Xiaomi Redmi Note 3.It was shocking because the Redmi Note 3 comes not even half a year after the Redmi Note 2 was released. Many were perplexed by that move because seemed like that meant Xiaomi were cannibalising their popular Redmi phablet before it could even hit its first anniversary.On paper, the full-metal Redmi Note 3 has great value for its price. With an upgraded processor, more RAM and a better build, it wasn’t hard to see why the critics thought so.But, after spending some time with the smartphone, I don’t think it will cannibalise the Redmi Note 2 at all. Instead, I think this device complements the Redmi Note 2 because it gives consumers what they’ve always wanted — more choice."

Initially released only for Android users via Open Whisper Systems, the new encryption now covers all forms of communications including WhatsApp calls, photos, videos and file transfers on both Android and iOS platforms. If you’re running on the latest version of WhatsApp, encryption will be enabled automatically by default.Whether you’re chatting to an individual or in a group, you can be rest assured that no third party will be able to tap into your conversations. You should notice a subtle message indicating that your chat and voice calls are encrypted end to end. This will only work if all parties have encryption enabled and you can check if your contact or group is secured by going into Group Info > Encryption. If a member doesn’t have encryption enabled, an open lock icon will appear and they would need to update WhatsApp to close the loop. To verify if the encryption is valid with a specific individual, you can check the Security code by comparing the 60 digit code or by scanning the QR code. For group chats, you’ll get a lock icon if all members are compliant. The folks at WhatsApp have a strong desire to protect personal privacy and they believe encryption is ultimately the key for the future of personal communication. Co-Founder Jan Koum also shared about life in the former USSR where people couldn’t speak freely under communist rule. Today WhatsApp assures that more than a billion of its users can talk freely and securely. [ SOURCE ]"

Well, 11street would like to serve you a counter offer.The iPhone SE made waves when it was first announced. Many were happy that Apple decided to go back to the 4-inch form factor, but most were a little disappointed that they simply recycled their old iPhone 5s body.We think it’s actually a brilliant move on Apple’s part because not only does it offer an affordable iPhone with top-of-the-line specs for consumers, it also gave users who hung on to the iPhone 5/5s for its size a viable upgrade.If you’re on board with the idea of an iPhone 6s crammed into the body of an iPhone 5s and you want to pick one up, 11street is having a special promotion on their imported iPhone SE devices.As part of their “Shocking Deals” 11street are knocking 7% off the top of the imported iPhone SE’s original price tag of RM2,049, meaning those who are interested can pick up the 16GB iPhone SE for RM1,899 (incl GST) with free shipping.If you want more storage, you can top up RM519 for the 64GB variant, which brings the total device cost to RM2,418 inclusive of GST. Keep in mind that this unit, according to their Seller Information table, is being shipped from Kowloon, Hong Kong and is sold without a warranty.However, if your device is dead on arrival, the terms state that you can make a claim within 7 days of receiving the delivery. If you do decide to pick this unit up, we do hope you don’t end up with a padlock instead."

This came shortly after the two companies announced a collaboration to reinvent smartphone photography.Now, it seems we do have some concrete evidence that the P9 would indeed sport the twin Leica lenses as was foretold.In previous leaks and iterations of the Huawei P9 — including those from serial leakster @evleaks — the smartphone was devoid of any branding, not even Huawei’s, which left many wondering about the validity of the Leica smartphone camera claims.In new pictures and renders by both @evleaks and @stagueve, the Huawei P9 is now proudly displaying it’s Leica branding. What’s a little disappointing to me though is that Leica didn’t go for the “red dot” branding, instead opting to just print their name on the back of the familiar P9.That said, the typeface used for the branding is consistent with those found on Leica’s own camera lenses so this lends some credibility to the images. From the pictures, the camera is bearing Leica’s Summarit badge with what looks like an aperture of f/2.2 and an equivalent focal length of 27mm. The lens array could also feature an aspherical element as denoted by the “ASPH” markings (though do correct me if I’m wrong).Besides the Leica glass, the Huawei P9 is rumoured to feature a dual camera setup on the back with each sensor featuring 12-megapixels. Said to be an evolution of the one on the honor 6 Plus, the P9’s dual snappers should sport much of the features found on the 6 Plus including post-capture refocus and simulated aperture adjustments.This is exciting stuff. If I’m being honest, one of my biggest qualms with any of the Huawei devices I’ve used was the rather lackluster camera performance. Now with the German camera maker’s help, Huawei could very well have shored up one of their big weaknesses.Huawei’s P9 is set to be launched on the 6th of April — and rumoured to come in four variants — so we’ll get confirmation of this and everything else then. For now, these are still just rumours so do take it with a grain of salt.What do you guys think of the P9? Would Leica glass be good enough to tempt you into picking one up?[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

More details here.The iPhone SE has hit first wave countries including our southern neighbour Singapore. While it will take some time before it hits Malaysia, a few enterprising stores have already started selling imported sets. If you can’t wait to get your hands on the most powerful 4-inch phone, you can get one now and the price markup isn’t as insane as its former flagships.Over at Lazada, the iPhone SE can be yours from as low as RM2,049 for the 16GB version in Silver and Grey, while the Gold and Rose Gold colours are going for slightly more at RM2,088 for the same spec. The larger 64GB iPhone SE is offered at RM2,549 for the Silver and Grey, and it’s the same extra RM39 if you prefer Gold or Rose Gold.Over at DirectD, they are offering the 16GB version at RM2,099 for Rose Gold/Gold, while the 64GB version is going for RM2,599. Alternatively, SatuGadget offers the iPhone SE 16GB at RM2,088, while the iPhone SE 64GB is offered at RM2,588.Is RM2,000 too much to pay for a 16GB iPhone SE? Over at Singapore, they are selling them officially at S$658 (RM1,897) and $828 (RM2,387) for 16GB and 64GB respectively. Depending on how Apple perceives the strength of our ringgit, we are guessing that the iPhone SE could be priced from RM1,999 when it gets here. If you can wait, the iPhone SE should be out on our shores in the next 2 months and our 4 big telcos have already started teasing that it’s coming soon. According to Apple, the iPhone SE will hit 110 countries by end of May.Thanks @KevinNgTK for the tip!3 reasons why the iPhone SE is a big deal

Well, it’s up for pre-orders on Lazada for less than RM1000.The 5-inch Microsoft Lumia 650 gets a 720p HD panel on the front and a Snapdragon 212 quad-core processor clocked at 1.3GHz mated to 1GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable (up to 200GB via microSD) internal storage. While these aren’t incredible specs, it was built for Windows 10 Mobile so we suspect that Microsoft has optimised the performance properly. Well, we hope, anyway.Well, we hope, anyway.For photos, the smartphone gets an 8-megapixel rear-facing primary camera that has an f/2.2 aperture with an LED flash to help out with low-light conditions. On the front, you’ll find a 5-megapixel wide-angle selfie-shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 2,000 mAh battery.Perhaps the best thing about this device is its build because we reckon it’s built even better than the flagship Lumia 950 and 950 XL. The Lumia 650 comes with a highly polished, diamond cut and anodized aluminium frame which should feel pretty premium in the hand. It’s also the thinnest Windows Phone in the market, coming in at only 6.9mm thick.If you’re interested, Lazada is having a pre-order for the smartphone and it’s priced at RM899. However, you can’t place an order just yet as the button is still greyed out and labeled “Coming soon”. The good news is that the title lets us know that the device is estimated to arrive on the 11th of April 2016.If you do decide to pick one up, Lazada will throw in a chance for you to win 13,000 AirAsia BIG points (customers who are already BIG members will receive an additional 899 BIG points) plus an RM25 Lazada voucher that you can immediately redeem on your Lumia 650 purchase if you so desired (only for Lumia 650 DS).Would you guys pick this Windows 10 Mobile device up for RM899?Thanks Lok Zaii for the tip!"

Nearly every major electronics company has poured resources into developing and owning this space and this year we’re starting to see some of the fruits of their labour.But what if Virtual Reality isn’t enough? What if we want something more immersive? What if we need something more real?Google‘s got you covered. The search engine giant says that it’s done with “putting something between you and the world”, which is why they decided to put something transparent between you and the world.Meet the Google Cardboard Plastic — the first Actual Reality headset.It’s magnificent.The Google Cardboard Plastic gives its users 100% full immersion in actual reality so you won’t get distracted by anything else. It’s also constructed with a lightweight plastic so that it fits unobtrusively into your lifestyle. With VR displays being notorious for their low-resolution display, the Cardboard Plastic gives users 20/20 resolution — it’s almost like you’re looking at real life.Worried about compatibility? Fret not, the Cardboard Plastic works with all apps and across all platforms, even your Nokia 3310. It’s also got 360-degree audio for the ultimate cinematic experience.With the Cardboard Plastic, Google has also shored up one of its biggest weaknesses with the original Cardboard — water resistance. The Cardboard Plastic is fully waterproof because…well, it’s made of plastic, not cardboard.We think Google has really hit the nail on the head with this one.

Rory Lee,The iPhone SE has the same display as the 5s according to iFixit’s teardown,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/01/the-iphone-se-has-the-same-display-as-the-5s-according-to-ifixits-teardown/,"apple,apple iphone,apple iphone se,ifixit,iphone,iphone se,iphone se teardown,iphone se teardown ifixit,smartphone teardown,ios,mobile devices,mobile os","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-04-01,"When a new phone comes out, the popular thing to do these days is to tear it down to find out exactly what’s inside these devices because clearly people want to know what they’ve spent their hard-earned money on.While Chipworks had their go at prying open the iPhone SE, now it’s iFixit’s turn to have their way with Apple‘s latest and what they reveal is actually rather interesting.It doesn’t take a genius to guess what smartphone the iPhone SE was based on, one look will tell you that it’s the spitting image of Apple’s older iPhone 5s. The question is, what’s new?Well, not the display apparently. In iFixit’s comprehensive teardown, one of the first things they noticed was that the iPhone SE had the exact same display as the older iPhone 5s. So similar, in fact, that they’re practically interchangeable.Yup, that means not only are the guides already available for those who want to DIY swap their broken iPhone SE displays for a new one, but you could theoretically use an old iPhone 5s’s panel too. The best part is that the display is plug and play between the two devices, so once you hook up the necessary connectors, the panel fires right up.Many have labeled the iPhone SE as an iPhone 5s stuffed full of iPhone 6s parts but that may not actually be entirely accurate. The 12-megapixel iSight camera, for example, may theoretically be the same as the one on the iPhone 6s, they’re not interchangeable. It is, however, quite different from the old iPhone 5s’s snapper (note the number of connectors) on the left, which is to be expected.You’d be happy to know that the iPhone SE also comes with a bigger 1,624 mAh battery, up from the iPhone 5s’s 1,560 mAh. Not a major upgrade, but coupled with improved battery optimisations, users should see an improvement in battery life over the iPhone 5s. Unfortunately, unlike the apparently interchangeable displays, the battery connectors on the iPhone SE differs from the 5s’s so no supercharging your old 5s.Another interesting thing that iFixit discovered was the waterproofing seals. Apple placed foamy silicone seals surrounding some but not all of the logic board connections. Curious. Wouldn’t Apple have wanted to maximise water protection throughout their device? I guess some corners had to be cut after all, but then again you shouldn’t be too disappointed as Apple didn’t market the iPhone SE as a waterproof device anyway.Be sure to check out iFixit’s full teardown of the device if you want to learn more. What do you guys think of the iPhone SE’s internals? Is it worth the money?[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

The new Mi 20,000mAh power bank is hitting their online store at only RM99 while its updated Mi Band Pulse with heart rate monitoring is going for just RM79.The largest Mi Power Bank packs fantastic value and it is only RM10 more than its current 16,000mAh Power Bank. It also gets 2x USB outputs pushing a combined 3.6A but it is lighter due to its polycarbonate construction instead of aluminium. On the plus side, the new power bank supports fast charging inputs supporting various chargers including 5V/2A, 9V/2A and 12V/1.5A. Xiaomi reckons that fast charging can replenish 11,000mAh in just 3 hours. Like the rest of its power banks, it gets a 9 layer circuit protection system by Texas Instruments for safer and reliable charging/discharging. Below is the full price of Mi Power banks for Malaysia.
5,000mAh Mi Power Bank – RM39
10,000mAh Mi Power Bank – RM59
16,000mAh Mi Power Bank – RM89
20,000mAh Mi Power Bank – RM99
The next product is their latest Mi Band that comes with a heart rate sensor underneath. This not only tracks your activity and sleeping patterns but also monitors your heart rate in real time. The Mi Band Pulse uses a Mi Fit app and it syncs via Bluetooth. Apart from being an activity tracker, it also works for notifications and it can be a subtle vibrating alarm on your wrist. For RM79, this is quite a steal for those who want a basic activity tracker. The standard Mi Band without the heart rate monitoring is still available at RM69, but you can snap it up during the Mi Festival 2016 sale next week. Want a better deal? You can try your luck with its limited flash sales where you can pick up a Mi In-Ear headphone, Redmi Note 2, Mi Band Pulse or the 20,000 Power Bank for only RM1.Xiaomi Malaysia is also throwing another new accessory with the Mi USB Car Charger. It is going for RM35 and it comes with two USB ports that can support up to 5V/3.6A on a single port or 5V/2.4A when both ports are in use. The Mi USB Charger has a metallic body and Xiaomi says you can charge your MacBook with your own USB Type-C cable. From the product shot above, it even lights up in the dark.To refresh your memory, the Redmi Note 3 is sitting on top of our list for the best smartphone under RM1,000. The base 2GB RAM and 16GB storage model is going for RM749, while its higher spec 3GB RAM and 32GB storage option is priced at RM849. Xiaomi is also bringing a couple of accessories for the Redmi Note 3 and they are listed below:

Available for FIRST Gold customers in the Klang Valley only.The fixed fibre broadband scene is heating up as Celcom joins the race with their Home Broadband service offering speeds of up to 10Mbps.According to Lowyat.net, the telco’s new plan would be called the Celcom Home Broadband and will offer speeds of 10Mbps for RM145/month (excl GST). If you’re a Celcom FIRST Gold subscriber, you will receive a 50% discount for the first six months of your Home Broadband subscription. That means you pay RM72.50/month (excl GST) for the first six months. Lowyat.net also claims that this plan is targetted towards Celcom subscribers, but made no mention on whether non-Celcom subscribers are eligible.For calls, the Celcom Home Broadband will charge users 8sen/min to all networks, while IDD calls will follow Celcom Postpaid’s IDD rates and will be charged in 30-second blocks. The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the plan:Lowyat.net’s information came from an anonymous source, so we thought we’d call Celcom up and see if we could verify it. According to the Celcom customer service representative, the telco did indeed “launch” their plan today which lends credence to Lowyat.net’s source.The customer service rep confirms all the plan details in the table above and that it is indeed available from today onwards, however, he did not have any information regarding the coverage area. That said, he did inform us that users who wished to sign up or find out if their area was covered could simply visit a Celcom Blue Cube for more information.We have a hunch that Celcom’s fibre service will be using TM‘s High-Speed Broadband infrastructure (like Maxis Fibre) due to an earlier agreement between the parties. This means if your area is covered by UniFi, you will likely be able to get Celcom Home Broadband too.Although today was supposed to be the launch, there is still no information about this plan on the Celcom website. The Celcom customer service rep ensures that you will be able to get more information on their website soon.It is worth noting that this isn’t Celcom’s first stab at a fibre broadband as they did have a First Home broadband plan back in 2012.Looking at the plan, we’re not terribly impressed by it. It’s fine if you’re a light user that only wants to spend the bare minimum on fibre Internet connectivity, but if you’re a moderate or heavy user, you’re better off topping up a little extra for about two or three times faster speeds on UniFi or Maxis Fibre.You could also add RM4 more and get TIME‘s 100Mbps plan — if you can find yourself within their coverage area, but that’s only slightly less difficult than finding a unicorn.The way we see it, the most attractive thing about this plan is the fact that you can get 50% off for the first six months if you’re a Celcom FIRST Gold plan subscriber. Besides that, you’re probably better off with one of the new plans from the other fibre providers.Want more information on the new fibre plans from TIME, TM and Maxis? Check out our fibre comparison.

That’s incredible value, something TM’s 100Mbps UniFi Pro plan (RM299/month) simply can’t match in terms of raw speed per dollar. What’s more, TIME offers speeds of up to 500Mbps compared to TM’s 100Mbps cap.Gaining this little edge, TIME simply couldn’t resist dropping a little celebratory burn on TM with a cheeky Facebook post:OHHH!The folks managing TIME’s social media must’ve been high-fiving each other for that. A solid 6/10 on the burn scale, a much cheekier jab compared to the one they directed at Maxis. But, their celebration is short lived as TM responded in timely fashion with a jab of their own:Ouch!Granted, I believe they could’ve been more subtle and do away with the capslocked words but I think TM came out ahead here.At the time of this article’s writing, TIME hasn’t responded yet. Maybe they’re stuck trying to come up with a witty comeback. Would any of our readers care to help them out?In the meantime, here’s some advice for TIME:UPDATE: TIME finally came up with a response…but it’s a little disappointing:I don’t know about you, but I think turning something fun into something political is a pretty lame move. It’s like someone shouting “MAK KAU HIJAU“. Takes all the fun out of it.Shortly after TIME’s reply, TM had this to say:So, who do you think came out ahead in Round 2?UPDATE 2: This should mark the end of this little kerfuffle:And the winner is…?[SOURCE]"

If you love Korean series, they are also offering Viu, a video on demand service that lets you watch TV shows 8 hours after its original broadcast in South Korea. Similar to what Celcom and Digi are offering, you get 2 months free trial worth RM20 for iflix which can be activated with no registration required. Make sure you’re on Maxis 3G/4G and disable WiFi before launching the iflix app. After the 2-month trial is over, you can subscribe at RM10/month which can be charged directly to your postpaid bill or deduct directly from your prepaid credit. It is the same story as well for Viu with 2 months free viewing and it will cost you RM10/month if you wish to continue. If you’re hooked to iflix, it is probably better for you to sign up for an annual plan of RM96 which comes up to RM8/month. According to the FAQ, you’ll be charged automatically after 60 days but you will be reminded by SMS before the trial period is over. Note that there’s no free streaming so it is best to binge-watch over WiFi instead.

Before a customer ports out, a telco can try to retain them and word has it that Maxis is giving special offers that are better than ones on the menu. A while back, there are customers complaining of discrimination when Maxis introduced a special East Malaysian plan that offered 5GB of data, unlimited calls/SMS and free unlimited off-peak internet for RM68/month. As a comparison, the standard MaxisONE Plan comes with just 1GB of data and unlimited calls/SMS for RM98/month.As word got out, Maxis has came out to issue a statement on these “selective offers”.
You may have read of an exaggerated Maxis save offer in the lowyat.net forum that has been circulating recently when it was first posted on 9 March 2016. We just want to say that this save offer does not exist in the way it was described.As with any company that has good data on customers, we often design and run targeted campaigns based on factors such as tenure, types of services used, payment history and many more. These targeted campaigns are to ensure that customers get to try out the varied services and plans that Maxis offers.Sometimes Maxis uses offers to stimulate trial of new services. Every now and then we also offer special deals to get our customers to switch in their family members as Maxis customers or to extend a contract.Additionally, in conjunction with Maxis’ 4G expansion into more towns in Sabah and Sarawak, we launched an introductory 4G promotion that comes with more data. We simply want the East Malaysian residents to enjoy the 4G experience with the upgraded network. The network upgrade has already happened in other parts of the country and now brings the same improved performance to 8 towns across East Malaysia.
What do you guys think? We do have readers and friends being quietly offered a better deal. According to Maxis, they are calling it targeted campaigns but are you convinced? Let us know if you’re offered something similar by Maxis.[ SOURCE 2 ]"
Alexander Wong,The OPPO F1 Plus comes to Malaysia on 7 April,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/30/oppo-f1-plus-malaysia-official-launch-7-april/,"oppo,oppo f1,oppo f1 plus,oppo f1 plus launch,oppo f1 plus malaysia,oppo malaysia,oppo r9,oppo r9 malaysia,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-03-30,"Looks like Nora Danish is getting a new phone soon. OPPO Malaysia will be launching the F1 Plus smartphone next week and it’s more than just an OPPO F1 with a bigger screen.When OPPO Malaysia CEO William Fang posted pictures of the F1 Plus, it looked very similar to the OPPO R9 that was announced earlier. Today, OPPO has officially confirmed that the OPPO R9 will be sold as the F1 Plus outside of China and Taiwan. Since the OPPO F1 has been marketed in our region as the “selfie expert”, it probably makes more sense for them to push it under the F1 banner especially when the newer device focuses on its 16MP selfie camera.To recap on the specs, the OPPO F1 Plus (aka OPPO R9 in China) gets a 5.5″ full HD AMOLED display and below it lies a front-facing fingerprint scanner that doubles up as a capacitive home button. Underneath its rounded metal unibody, it runs on MediaTek’s 2GHz P10 processor that’s mated to 4GB of RAM with a huge 64GB of storage. It is also a dual-SIM 4G LTE device with a hybrid SIM tray slot that accepts microSD up to 128GB.In terms of optics, it gets a high-resolution 16MP camera at the front, which is double the pixel count of its OPPO F1 8MP selfie cam. Over at the rear, it gets a 13MP f/2.2 shooter with PDAF. Following the spec sheet of the OPPO R9, it gets a 2,850mAh battery that supports VOOC charging. According to OPPO, a quick 5-minute charge is enough to provide 2 hours of talk time. Out of the box, it runs on their newer ColorOS 3.0 that’s based on Android 5.1 Lollipop.So what about the bigger OPPO R9 Plus? So far there’s no indication if they are bringing that in and if they do, the local naming is going to be complicated. We’ll find out more from their launch next week, so stay tuned for details."

Well, now it’s going to be much easier because if you’re on an iPhone, the text messaging service will let you use text formatting in your conversations.Unfortunately, this doesn’t apply to the Android version of WhatsApp.Right now, if you fire up your WhatsApp for iPhone app, it gives you limited text formatting options like bold, strikethrough and italics. This opens up plenty of opportunities to make conversations more colourful and even inject a little sarcasm into your chats.Although you don’t have access to more complex text formatting like superscripts or subscripts, I’m sure simply having access to bold, strikethrough and italics is more than good enough for daily conversations. Here’s how you can do it:To bold your text, simply add and asterisk or “*”to the beginning and end of whatever text it is you want to bold. For example *oranges* will become oranges.If you want to strikethrough a particular text, simply add a tilde or “~” symbol to the start and end of whatever text it is you want to strikethrough. For example ~funky grapes~ becomes funky grapes.Finally, to get access to the italics text formatting, simply add an underscore or “_” to the front and back of a word or sentence. For example, _zwanky passion fruit_ becomes zwanky passion fruit.Be careful about using it when chatting with your friends using the Android version of WhatsApp because they will not see the text formatting since it isn’t supported. Instead, they’ll just see the symbols as-is, which means your text might come out looking a little silly.[SOURCE]"

However, at the end of last year, we reported that there would be a new player entering the scene in 2016 and it seems this could be it.We received an email invitation from Packet One Networks (P1) regarding a “P1 secret” that was due to be unveiled on the 13th of April 2016. Now, what could it possibly be?  Well, from the looks of things, it certainly seems like they’re going to officially announce their mobile 4G service.Since Telekom Malaysia‘s acquisition of P1 in 2014, TM has worked towards developing P1 into their mobile arm and mobility centre, initially eyeing a 2015 launch of their mobile services. That initial plan didn’t come to fruition but it looks like their revised schedule of a 2016 entry will.TM has said that their overall LTE network rollout, the core of which is being managed by P1, was proceeding as planned so being able to meet their revised target of a 2016 launch may not come as such a surprise.This isn’t TM’s first foray into LTE technology as they launched their very own 4G broadband-only service TMgo back in 2015 which runs on 850MHz. TMgo was designed to replace TM’s older Wireless Streamyx on CDMA.What does TM’s entry into the 4G operator industry mean for us as consumers? Well, many good things we hope.More competition is always welcomed because it keeps the other telcos on their toes. A firm monopoly on any industry hurts us, the consumers, the most because it means that we’re at the mercy of whoever holds all the cards in that particular industry.Competition, on the other hand, means that these companies have to keep their plans competitive and try to undercut or trump the competition to attract consumers. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price war.With TM’s entry, things will surely get more interesting for the current four-way horse race as TM will be bringing in all their expertise and experience that they’ve accrued over the years to shake up the scene. How effective will they be as a telco? I guess we’ll have to wait to find out.What do you guys think of TM entering the 4G LTE game?"

Maxis followed soon after. Now, it’s TM’s turn to round up the trifecta of new plans with their new UniFi Pro plan that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. As an early bird promo, TM is offering RM30/month off and you can start enjoying 100Mbps from as low as RM299/month with voice calls and IPTV bundled in.On the surface, it seems like a negligible difference compared to Maxis’ 100Mbps Home Fibre (RM330/month for MaxisONE postpaid customers) but if you take all the extras that come with your UniFi Pro plan into consideration, it offers much better value for your money.The base UniFi Pro plan is supposed to offer Internet speeds of up to 100Mbps plus a base HyppTV package (Aneka, Varnam or Ruby) for RM299/month (Normal: RM329). If you want the HyppTV Jumbo pack, you will have to top up an additional RM30, bringing the total to RM329 per month (Normal: RM359). Besides that, the UniFi Pro plan looks to offer a free Voice Pack (worth RM20) which gives you 600 minutes of calls nationwide per month. If you exceed 600 minutes, you will be charged 10sen/min for calls to other fixed lines and mobile numbers but calls to TM fixed lines remain free.What’s more, you will also be able to stream HyppTV Everywhere on 2 devices, plus receive 500MB/day for TM WiFi. In addition to that, you will also have access to other UniFi perks like a free 12-month iflix subscription (worth RM96) and 3 months of Viu access.For Business users, the 100Mbps plan is offered at RM379/month (Normal: RM399) and it also comes with voice calls worth RM70. Any excess usage for fixed line numbers are still free but calls to mobile numbers are charged at 8 sen/minute. To be fair, this UniFi Pro plan and Maxis’ MaxisONE Home 100Mbps plan, once again, doesn’t really compete with each other. The MaxisONE Home 100Mbps plan is only available in Maxis’ own areas of coverage (that is about 75,000 ports). These ports don’t overlap with UniFi’s own 1.89 million ports so the end result for the consumer is whether you have one or the other. Another difference is speed where TM offers 100Mbps for download and 50Mbps for upload. As usual, all subscription are tied with a 24-month contract. If we were to take those factors out of the equation, the UniFi Pro plan is far better in terms of value-for-money as you’re getting high-speed Internet connectivity as well as a bunch of other goodies like IPTV and free streaming subscriptions.Another point against Maxis’ favour is that you have to be a MaxisONE Plan 158 and above subscriber to be eligible for the 100Mbps MaxisONE Home fibre Internet plan. If you were to factor that in with your monthly RM330, you’re paying RM488/month excluding GST.What do you guys think of the UniFi Pro plan? Is it worth the upgrade?

The first device as teased above is their new powerbank that packs a huge 20,000mAh capacity.  The new 20,000mAh powerbank is huge on power but it is considerably light at 338 grams. As a comparison, their 16,000 mAh powerbank weighs 350 grams while two 10,000mAh power banks weigh 414 grams combined. For better grip, the body uses polycarbonate with a perforated texture. There are 2x USB outputs that push a maximum of 5.1V/3.6A combined.Replenishing this 20,000mAh brick is done quickly as it supports quick charge via 5V/2A, 9V/1.2A and 12V/1.5A. They reckon that you can charge up 11,000mAh in just 3 hours. In China, the 20,000mAh power bank is going for 149 CNY which is about RM90, but we reckon it will be priced higher when it gets here. The 2nd device is their new updated Mi Band which now comes with a heart rate sensor. It looks the same as before but you’ll find an optical sensor underneath. Like the current version, it also tracks your steps, sleeping pattern and you can also use it to unlock your Mi smartphone when you’re within range. It is also IP67 resistant and this could probably last up to 30 days depending on your usage. The new Mi Band is priced at 99CNY which is about RM60. With the Redmi Note 3 going on sale next week on 6 April, we are guessing that these 2 new products could go on sale on the same day as well. The Redmi Note 3 is priced at RM749 for the 2GB RAM + 16GB storage model, while the higher spec 3GB RAM + 32GB storage version is going for RM849. We’ll let you know once we have more details.

But that’s not all, they’ve also released a budget device that is now the cheapest device in Malaysia with a fingerprint scanner.The highlight of DOOGEE’s launch has to be their Android flagship smartphone, the F7 Pro. On the front of the smartphone, you’ll find a 5.7-inch full-HD IGZO display that has slim bezels and is tucked under 2.5D glass for a more rounded finish.Encased in its metal is the world’s first deca-core processor — the MediaTek Helio X20 — mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. For photos, the F7 Pro gets a 21-megapixel Sony IMX230 sensor on the back with Phase Detection AF. Selfies are taken care of by a 13-megapixel front-facing snapper. Keeping the lights on is a generous 4,000 mAh battery that can be charged up via a USB Type-C port and the smartphone will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow.While this is DOOGEE’s flagship device, there was no mention of a price, but the company did say that the smartphone will go on sale sometime in Q2 of 2016.Having a phone with a big battery is like having big hands –some people like to tell everyone about it. If you’re this kind of person, then the DOOGEE T6 is the Android smartphone for you as it packs a massive 6,250 mAh battery. Everything else is a little underwhelming, however.On the front, it gets a 5.5-inch HD 720p display with a MediaTek MT6735 quad-core processor mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. For photos, it gets an 8-megapixel/2-megapixel camera combo. The smartphone will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop.The DOOGEE T6 is priced at RM599 and will come in Marble White and Titanium Grey. It will go on sale exclusively at Gemfive from today (31st March) onwards.Rounding up the smartphone launches is another budget friendly device — the Y200 — one of the cheapest smartphones with a fingerprint sensor in Malaysia. Coming in at RM699 it is a touch cheaper than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and its fingerprint sensor is mounted on the front of the device, not the rear like both the Redmi Note 3 and the DOOGEE F7 Pro.In terms of specs, the Y200 gets a 5.5-inch HD 720p display and pretty much the same internals as the T6 above, except it has a 32GB of internal storage. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000 mAh battery while photos are taken care of by an 8MP/5MP camera combo. It will also come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box.Alongside its three smartphone reveals, DOOGEE also launched a pico projector called the Smart Cube P1 and a 3G smartwatch called the S1.The Smart Cube P1 is a funky little device that is a projector and a speaker unit rolled into a cube that can fit in the palm of your hand. The projector beam can shoot up to 3.3m to a width of 90 inches. As it has a built-in speaker, you can use it as a nifty portable media consumption device on-the-go. You won’t be getting super high-resolution projects, though, as it only projects at a resolution of 854×480 (WVGA).The Smart Cube P1 supports multiple devices with Air Play, DLNA, Miracast, Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity. The P1 offers a Texas Instrument DLP with 70 lumen/3W brightness, OSRAM LED and 30,000 hours of LED lifetime. Keeping everything running is a 4,800 mAh battery which can double as a powerbank with a 5V2A output. Priced at RM999, it isn’t a cheap device, but you do get a decent amount of features for it. The Smart Cube P1 will go on sale in Q3 of 2016.DOOGEE claims that their S1 smartwatch is a full-featured wearable and to a certain extent, it is. It’s compatible with Android and you can insert a 3G SIM card into the watch. Since it has a microphone and speaker, you can make and receive calls with the device. It’s also got a heart-rate monitor, a 5MP camera, a 1.54-inch IPS (240×240 pixel) screen and is IP67 water resistant.Priced at RM599, it’s pretty decent value, but how good it is to use and how well it performs remain to be seen. Also, it doesn’t seem to be compatible with iOS devices."

These plans are designed to give customers high-speed Internet connectivity anywhere within Digi’s LTE-A coverage areas via the company’s new LTE-A capable MobiFi device.The Broadband 145 plan offers 50GB of Internet quota for RM145/month while the Broadband 185 will offer 100GB of Internet quota for RM185/month. Both plans will be available to customers starting 1st April 2016.If you’re a Digi Postpaid plan subscriber, you can get RM25 off the monthly bill which brings the total down to RM120 and RM160 for each plan respectively. Additionally, Digi Postpaid plan subscribers can also pick up the MobiFi mobile wireless router (which is a Huawei E5786Bs MiFi) for RM203 instead of the retail price of RM754.Digi also lets you pick up the MobiFi portable wireless router on contract. If you’re going with the Broadband 145 plan, you will have to pay a total of RM300 (RM145 for plan + RM155 for device upfront payment) while Broadband 185 subscribers only need to pay RM280 upfront (RM185 for plan + RM95 for device upfront payment).In addition to the upfront payments, you will also have to pay RM9 for the first 12 months. That means, if you get the Broadband 145 with a MobiFi device, you will be paying a total of RM263 (RM155 upfront + RM108 device) for the MobiFi while the Broadband 185’s MobiFi device will set you back a total of RM203 (RM95 upfront + RM108 device)This means, if you’re a Digi Postpaid customer going for the Broadband 145 plan, it’s actually cheaper to buy the MobiFi device outright because you will only need to pay RM203 for it.Of course, the Broadband 145 and 185 plans will work with pretty much any mobile wireless device that is LTE-A capable, so you don’t have to splurge on Digi’s MobiFi if you already have one lying around, or can pick one up for cheaper. Digi’s Mobifi does boast Cat 6 LTE speeds with support for 802.11ac WiFi, though.Keep in mind that the 50GB and 100GB of Internet quota are split between anytime quota and off-peak quota. For the Broadband 145 plan, 20GB will be allocated as anytime quota while 30GB is filed under off-peak quota (2am-8am).Meanwhile, the Broadband 185 sees an Internet quota split of 30GB of anytime quota and 70GB of off-peak quota. Once the quota is depleted, Broadband 185 users will have their speeds throttled to 512kbps but can still continue using the plan, unlike the Broadband 145 plan that simply cuts off once your quota has been exhausted.LTE-Advanced works via Carrier Aggregation using both 1800MHz and 2600 MHz bands to give you more consistent high speeds. As of today, Digi claims that their LTE-A network is the widest in the country, covering 31% of the population. To enjoy LTE-A speeds, you will need to have a 4G SIM, at least a Cat 6 device and be within their coverage area. If you meet these three criteria, any Digi customer can enjoy 4G LTE-A speeds regardless of whether you’re on a postpaid, prepaid or broadband plan.Digi also demonstrated their 4G LTE-A capabilities, reaching speeds of 100Mbps in the Taman Bukit Jalil area. If you’d like to see a map of Digi’s LTE and LTE-A coverage, head on over to their coverage page."

The question is, which one is the best for you?Don’t worry because, as usual, we’ve got you covered.
Click to enlargeWe saw strong offerings from the four major players in the fibre broadband industry, but as with most plans, there are pros and cons to each plan. Let’s dive into each one and see if we can find which is the best.TM kicked things off by upping their UniFi game to the current UniFi Advance plan which offers 30Mbps download speeds for RM179. If you desire more speed, you can opt for the upgrade to 50Mbps for RM50 extra. TM also have a new UniFi Pro plan that offers speeds up to 100Mbps.Much like the original VIP UniFi plans, you will also get a free HyppTV subscription though only for the base channels. If you’re a big TV or movie buff, TM’s UniFi also offers a 1-year free subscription to local streaming service iflix worth RM96. With iflix, you get access to a moderately large catalogue of old and some relatively new shows that you can binge, including exclusives like Mr Robot.Opting for the UniFi Pro plan gives you additional benefits on top of those that you get with the UniFi Advance plans. Firstly, the UniFi Pro plan comes with a free Voice Call voice bundle (worth RM20) that gives you 600 mins of calls, beyond which you will be charged 10sen/min to mobile and other fixed lines (calls to TM fixed lines remain free). You also get a free 3-month access pass to Viu — a streaming site that offers Korean dramas, varriety shows and other asian programs.There is a caveat, however. With UniFi Advance and Pro, your download and upload speeds are not symmetrical, meaning for the base RM179 plan, you will be getting 30Mbps download speeds but only 10Mbps upload speeds. The same goes for the 50Mbps which have its upload speed limited to 20Mbps and the 100Mbps Pro plan which has it’s upload speeds limited to 50Mbps.Do keep in mind that these prices for the UniFi Advance and Pro plans are still under a promo price (original prices: RM199 (30Mbps), RM249 (50Mbps), RM329 (100Mbps) so the original prices are a tad higher. While TM has extended the promotional period for the UniFi Advance plans in the past, it remains unclear if they will do so for the “early bird promo” price for the UniFi Pro plan.TIME, on the other hand, released their latest range of broadband services with symmetrical speeds of up to 500Mbps for RM299. If you don’t want to pay the premium for 500Mbps, they also have lower tier plans rated at 100Mbps and 300Mbps that costs RM149 and RM189 respectively.With TIME, you don’t get many luxuries in terms of add-ons, just raw Internet speed. In this aspect, TIME is unmatched by the other local fibre broadband operators, but, they have their hands tied when it comes to coverage as TIME’s services only extend to 250,000 ports nationwide. Most of TIME’s ports can be found in apartments and condos so if you’re living on a landed property, odds are, you won’t be able to subscribe to TIME.Maxis are notorious for not participating in price wars, instead, opting to improve customer service and reliability. With that in mind, Maxis launched their latest MaxisONE Home fibre broadband plans which focus on customer service and installation experience.What they’ve come up with is the Maxperts which, in their own words. are a “SWAT-like team of Internet experts” who specialise in optimising your Internet connection. We can see how this is useful for those who are less than tech-savvy, but if you are anything like us, the services these Maxperts provide become much less valuable as you could probably do the optimising yourself.In true Maxis fashion, their fibre plans are the most expensive in this comparison. For the base 20Mbps plan, Maxis are charging RM170/month while the 30Mbps plan is going for RM220/month. You will also have to be subscribed to a MaxisONE Plan (excluding the MaxisONE Plan Lite) before you are eligible to subscribe to the MaxisONE Home.To make matters worse, the prices mentioned above are after a special promo discount for MaxisONE Plan 128 and above customers. That means, if you’re a MaxisONE Plan 98 subscriber, you will still have to pay the full price of RM198 for 20Mbps, RM270 for 30Mbps and RM398 for 100Mbps.Speaking of the 100Mbps plan, this plan is only available within Maxis’ own area of coverage (which reaches 75,000 ports) and does not extend to the ports they share with TM. Besides that, you will have to be a MaxisONE Plan 158, 188, MaxisONE Business and MaxisONE Business Extra to be eligible for the RM330/month price.Celcom became the latest player to join the recent home fibre network race when they released their Home Broadband service. After their earlier agreement with TM, Celcom can now utilise TM’s HSBB network to provide home fibre broadband plans to their customers.Their plan offers a speed of 10Mbps for RM145/month. The caveat is that this plan is only available for Celcom FIRST Gold subscribers in the Klang Valley area.That said, the plan itself isn’t that attractive. If you’re only interested in paying the bare minimum for fibre Internet connectivity and are a Celcom FIRST Gold subscriber, then perhaps this plan could be for you. Celcom are also offering a 50% discount for the first six months of your Home Broadband subscription so that could be quite attractive for the user on a budget.However, if you’re a moderate or above user, you’d be better off topping up a little bit extra for two or three times faster speeds with Maxis Fibre or UniFi. You could also just top up RM4 for 100Mbps if you happen to find yourself within TIME’s coverage area.In all honesty, these four companies aren’t exactly direct competitors because (especially in the case of TIME) you either have one or the other. Besides Maxis, Celcom and TM, these services rarely overlap.That said, it is worth taking a look at who can provide the most well-rounded package out there. If it was up to me and I could choose between these three services, I would pick TIME. I’m a heavy Internet user so all I care about is Internet speed and stability — I don’t need all the extra goodies like IPTV bundles and calls or streaming subscriptions.But, I’m willing to bet that not many share my usage habits. So, if I were to consider the average household — including family members, guests, children, etc. — TM’s UniFi Advance and Pro plans provide the most well-rounded fibre experience.They’ve got free iflix (which my mum loves to watch old movies on), clear free-to-air TV channels (which my dad loves), and a fast enough download speed + low latency for my gaming needs. A decent compromise that will probably tick the most boxes for the average family.Which plan would you pick?[IMAGE SOURCE]"

At 12 noon on 29th March, Xiaomi is set to officially launch their highly anticipated smartphone — the Redmi Note 3. However, thanks to a reliable source, Zinggadget got hold of the official price for the new handset, and perhaps to nobody’s surprise, the device is priced below RM1,000.The media were given a briefing last Thursday (24th March) regarding the device, as well as given some time with the smartphone, but the details for the pricing as well as which variant of the smartphone Xiaomi were bringing into Malaysia were not revealed. Instead, we were told to hang on to our hats and wait for the official launch to find out.But, in what looks like a dinner of some sort for the potential resellers of the Redmi Note 3, a slide containing the price and a fact sheet for the Malaysian Redmi Note 3 model were leaked. Based on the images posted by Zinggadget, Xiaomi is bringing in the version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable (up to 32GB via microSD) storage. What’s more, the device looks to be priced at RM849, placing it right in the crosshairs of the honor 5X.Other specifications include a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display on the front, with a Snapdragon 650 hexa-core processor running on the inside. For optics, the smartphone gets 16-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with PDAF plus a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. Encasing the respectable internals is a full-metal unibody — the first for a Xiaomi device. It’s also sporting Xiaomi’s first ever rear-mounted fingerprint sensor placed right below the camera, as well as a large 4,050 mAh battery.It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box and yes, this time there might actually be a retail box. In case you didn’t pick up on it earlier, the images look to have come from a retailer’s dinner hosted by Xiaomi which means that they might actually be using physical retail stores to sell their smartphone too — not just online. Besides that, if you look at the bottom right of the spec-sheet image, you’ll see Thorus Technology listed as an authorised reseller.This is pretty rare for the Chinese company but we believe it could be because the Online market has reached its peak and Xiaomi has hit their saturation point for online sales. Even in China, Xiaomi is working with big retail brands to sell their devices on the shelf so it might not be surprising if they decided to do so here as well.What do you guys think of this move by Xiaomi? Would you pick up the Redmi Note 3 from a physical store or stick to the online store? And of course, what do you think about the RM849 asking price for the handset?Let us know in the comments below.Thanks @KevinNgTK for the tip![SOURCE, VIA]"

Rory Lee,Samsung’s Galaxy J5 and J7 receive the upgrades they deserve,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/29/samsungs-galaxy-j5-and-j7-receive-the-upgrades-they-deserve/,"revealed,samsung,samsung galaxy j,samsung galaxy j5,samsung galaxy j5 2016,samsung galaxy j7,samsung galaxy j7 2016,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-29,"Samsung has finally revealed their new Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016) smartphones, fixing many of the issues we originally had with the devices. The duo got a bump in specs as well as a few nice new features.The Galaxy J5 was a rather underwhelming device from the get-go with a measly 1.5GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. With the Galaxy J5 (2016), Samsung has bumped the specs up by quite a bit.Now, it sports a larger 5.2-inch HD Super AMOLED panel on the front of the device with a 1.2GHz octa-core processor mated to 2GB OF RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Now with twice the storage, users start with 10.6GB of available storage compared to the old device’s 4.3GB of available storage.In the camera department, its got a 13MP f/1.9 primary camera mounted on the back plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie shooter with front-facing flash for those crucial low-light selfies. Keeping the lights on is a larger 3,100 mAh battery.Perched higher up the ladder is the bigger and more powerful Galaxy J7 (2016). Along with a larger 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel, the J7 (2016) also sports beefier internals with a 1.6GHz octa-core processor on the inside mated to 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage.While the bump up in screen resolution to full-HD from the HD panel on the previous model is nice, the best part of this new model is the increased RAM — double that of the old J7’s 1.5GB.For photos, the Galaxy J7 (2016) sports the same optics as on the Galaxy J5 (2016) which should result in a similar photo-taking experience. Since it’s a bigger device, it also gets a bigger battery — rated at 3,300 mAh — which is also a bump up from the previous J7.The new Galaxy J duo also has support for microSD expansion (up to 128GB) and dual-SIM capabilities via a dedicated microSD card slot and dual-SIM slot. That means you don’t have to choose between 2 SIMs or 1 SIM and one microSD card.Besides that, these devices now have support for NFC which should mean pairing and mobile payments are now that much easier. They’ve also got a metal frame that should lend a more premium feel in your hand. As a whole, the upgrades these devices received are definitely necessary as it helps them keep up with the other low-end good-value smartphones in the market. However, with this bump in specifications, it is likely that the duo will also be marketed at a higher price.These devices will soon see an official release in China, but there is currently no word on when the Galaxy J duo will see an international release or when they will arrive in Malaysia.With the upgraded specs on the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016), these entry-level Samsung devices actually have better internals than the South Korean company’s mid-range Galaxy A3 (2016) and Galaxy A5 (2016) smartphones. However, the Galaxy A series devices have a more premium build and finish (plus a fingerprint scanner on the A5) which does feel great in the hand.What do you think of these new Galaxy J devices?[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"
Rory Lee,Xiaomi’s Redmi 3 Pro packs more power and a fingerprint scanner,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/29/xiaomis-redmi-3-pro-packs-more-power-and-a-fingerprint-scanner/,"android,redmi 3,redmi 3 pro,redmi 3 pro launch,smartphone,xiaomi,xiaomi fingerprint scanner,xiaomi redmi 3,xiaomi redmi 3 pro,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2016-03-29,"Xiaomi is taking over 2016’s entry-level smartphone markets with premium-built devices that pack a punch without burning a hole in your wallet. The existing Redmi 3 and Redmi Note 3 have garnered a lot of attention, but Xiaomi’s not done yet.Meet the brand new Redmi 3 Pro — possibly one of the cheapest smartphones with a fingerprint scanner yet.When we first saw it, the Redmi 3 looked like a seriously good value phone. It had a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Plus, it had a metal unibody — with some models even sporting a sophisticated diamond etched design — which is very rare at that price point.Now, Xiaomi has upped the ante with the Redmi 3 Pro, bumping up the RAM to 3GB while doubling the expandable internal storage to 32GB. It’s also got a fingerprint scanner mounted on the back of the device — similar to the Redmi Note 3 — but that also means that it loses its diamond-etch pattern.Besides that, the phone keeps all of its other specs including a 13-megapixel PDAF camera with an f/2.0 aperture lens and a 5MP front facing snapper. The Redmi 3 Pro will also have dual-SIM and microSD support (up to 128GB) via a hybrid-SIM tray.Keeping the 5-inch HD screen lit is a massive 4,100 mAh battery that should easily last an entire day. The device will come running MIUI 7 out of the box and will go on sale in China starting 6th April 2016 at CNY899 (around RM551).For more information, check out the Redmi 3 Pro’s product page.[SOURCE]"

They have a large catalogue products ranging from personal mobility scooters to air purifiers. Now, they’re adding a new product to their roster — a rice cooker.Together with the launch of Xiaomi’s new sub-brand, the Mi Ecosystem, the Chinese company has unveiled the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker. Now that’s how you name a rice cooker.Like its name suggests, the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker is a WiFi-enabled rice cooker that is designed specifically to cook your rice in the best way possible. According to Xiaomi, their rice cooker follows the three concepts applied by expensive Japanese rice cookers to cook rice perfectly: Pressure control, heating method and the cooker’s lining material.The Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker employs a magnetic relief valve to precisely control the pressure in the rice cooker while using an electromagnetic heating technology for higher thermal efficiency and to ensure even cooking of the rice.It also uses a grey cast iron that has undergone a 69-step process to maintain an even heating and ensure strong thermal performance during use. The cast iron pot is coated with PFA powder to ensure that your rice doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot.Perhaps the most amazing feature of the Xiaomi rice cooker is the fact that you can scan a pack of rice with the Mi Home app to identify the type of rice, brand and origin. Then, based on that, the rice cooker can adjust its heating methodology to best suit that brand of rice so that the end result is a perfectly cooked pot of rice. Users can also customise the cooking and have their own preset preferences to cook the rice. It currently supports over 200 brands of rice but this support will be expanded in the future.As a cherry on top of the proverbial cake, the Mi Home app also comes with recipes that you can cook using the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker like brown rice, crispy rice and even cakes.Right now, the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker is on sale in China for CNY999 (around RM614) for a 3L pot, but there is no information on when it will arrive in Malaysia.

In its latest teaser, HTC is boasting top notch performance claiming that it will be the fastest and smoothest Android yet. That’s a very bold statement and we’ve already seen benchmarks of it beating other devices including the Xiaomi Mi 5, Galaxy S7 edge and iPhone 6s. Coupled that with their slick Sense UI, this could be the best Android experience after the Nexus 6P. To shed more light on its hardware, the HTC 10 has surfaced on GFXBench database. It confirms what we’ve already know such as the 5.1″ Quad HD display and it runs on Qualcomm’s top-end Snapdragon 820 processor that’s mated to 4GB of RAM. The database also listed a 12MP main camera at the rear that’s capable of shooting 4K videos while the front is having a 5MP shooter. Out of the box, it runs on Android 6.0.1 and if it follows the One A9’s “within 15-days after Nexus” update promise, this could be a serious contender. We’ve seen a couple of leaks of the exterior and it looks pretty sleek with its two-tone metal finish at the back. While it won’t have a pair of front facing speakers, HTC appears to be working on an alternative Boom Sound that might deliver an even better audio experience. Can HTC bounce back in 2016? We’ll find out next month.[ SOURCE 2 VIA ]"

Whether you’re travelling in an unfamiliar part of town, don’t want to worry about parking, or are just too tired to drive, Uber becomes your personal chauffeur.If you’ve been a little creative with your use of Uber, I’m sure you’ve probably discovered that you can have an Uber driver send stuff like a parcel or a birthday cake instead. Of course, this may come with complications as the Uber service isn’t exactly meant for stuff like this, but as there aren’t many services like that, many have had no choice but to use Uber.Well, that’s not the case anymore. Meet NeonRunner.Funky name aside, NeonRunner offers same-day delivery services for “almost anything that can fit in their waterproof 18″ x 18″ x 16″ insulated carrier box that is below 12kg”. That’s a pretty wide range of stuff, but you probably won’t be able to use them for furniture delivery.NeonRunner offers two separate services — the first being a buying service where they buy stuff and send it to you while the second is a delivery service where they pick up whatever package or parcel you have and sends it to your desired location. Within the delivery service, you also have the option to get NeonRunner to complete specific tasks for you like banking in a cheque or paying your bills.Requesting a delivery, purchase or task is fairly simple. Simply create/log in to your NeonRunner account and choose either BUY or DELIVER. Then, enter the location details, item descriptions (you can add a photo too) and contact information before hitting the “Request a runner button”.To the right of the order page you will see a floating window that gives you a total estimate fee to get the task, purchase or delivery done. In the fee breakdown, they charge an RM0.25/km Distance Fee plus a RM0.50/min Time Fee for both services. However, for the BUY service, NeonRunner charges you an RM5 + 3.5% of the purchased item Service Fee while the DELIVER option gets a flat RM3 Service Fee.This service is reminiscent of something like GoGet or MatDespatch, but the biggest difference is the method of payment. With GoGet, you will need to have cash ready when the delivery arrives while MatDespatch operates on a prepaid credit system. NeonRunner, on the other hand, is cashless (much like Uber).Simply input your card information and billing address and you’re good to go. Easy and hassle free, two things I believe are a necessity for people who require these services. Though, it is worth noting that the operation only runs from 10am to 10pm daily, so no midnight deliveries for you. NeonRunner also only operates within the Greater Kuala Lumper and Klang Valley area.For more information, you can drop by their website or call 012-232 0854."

Today, they pulled back the covers on the Neffos C5 and C5L — two entry level smartphones with decent specs.Kicking things off is the higher spec Neffos C5. The C5 comes packing a 5-inch 720p HD display with a MediaTek MT6735 processor mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable (via microSD up to 32GB) internal storage running on the inside.In the camera department the C5 comes with an 8MP primary camera mounted on the back while selfies are handled by a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. Giving the device juice is a 2,200 mAh battery.Moving on to the more entry-level of the two, the Neffos C5L features a 4.5-inch FWVGA display on the front. Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 210 processor mated to 1GB of RAM and 8GB of expandable internal storage.For optics, the device gets the same 8-megapixel rear-facing camera as the more expensive C5, but the selfie shooter gets a slight bump down to 2MP. Keeping the lights on is a modest 2,000 mAh battery.Both devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop and have support for 4G LTE and dual-SIM capabilities.
From left: Neffos C5L, C5, C5 MaxIt is unfortunate that TP-Link didn’t bring in the more powerful C5 Max as that device looked quite promising so we will just have to settle for these two for now. That said, there was a C5 Max on display but it was labeled “Coming soon”.If you want to pick one up for yourself, the Neffos C5 is priced at RM539 while the Neffos C5L will set you back RM359. Both devices will be available in pearl white and dark grey, and will go on sale online at Lazada Malaysia beginning 12th April. If you’re one of the first 100 customers to pick up either device, you will receive a free powerbank (worth RM99) and a screen protector.For more information, head on over to their website."

Alexander Wong,Celcom and Digi are offering the iPhone SE soon,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/26/iphone-se-malaysia-celcom-digi-coming-soon/,"apple iphone se,celcom,digi,iphone se,iphone se celcom,iphone se digi,iphone se malaysia,iphone se malaysia contract,ios,iphone,mobile devices,mobile os,players on the field","Celcom,DiGi,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field",2016-03-26,"The most powerful 4-inch smartphone will be available soon on our big 4 telcos in Malaysia. Celcom’s website has started teasing the iPhone SE, while Digi takes a step further with its registration of interest exercise.  For Celcom, there’s no info at the moment and we are wondering if they are extending its FIRST postpaid plans that will end on 31st March. Over at team yellow, we expect Digi to bundle the iPhone SE with their latest postpaid plans that offer more data plus the ability to rollover unused quota to the following month. If you’re interested in getting the iPhone SE on Digi, you can fill up the registration form here. To recap, the iPhone SE is basically an updated iPhone 5S with iPhone 6s internals. While it maintains the same 4″ Retina display, the iPhone SE gets a faster A9 processor and a better 12MP camera with dual-tone LED flash as the iPhone 6s. In terms of pricing, the iPhone SE is expected to be priced under RM2,000 based on its Singapore price tag of S$658 (about RM1,932) for the 16GB model. For those holding on to their iPhone 5/5s, the iPhone SE could be a viable upgrade for you. Related iPhone SE Posts

Alexander Wong,OnePlus 3 to be announced soon?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/25/oneplus-3-to-be-announced-soon/,"android,antutu,oneplus,oneplus 3,oneplus 3 antutu,oneplus 3 specs,oneplus tree,mobile devices,mobile os,rumour mill","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus,Rumour Mill",2016-03-25,"The OnePlus 2 was a disappointment. Announced mid-last year with a self-proclaimed “2016 flagship killer” title, it had gotten itself killed even before the year was out. Now it appears that a new one is coming and it could be announced as early as next month.According to Antutu, a new OnePlus model was spotted with the model number A3000. From what they can gather, it carries a Full HD (1920×1080) display and it runs on the latest Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM. Storage is listed at 32GB and it also comes with a 16MP main and 8MP front-facing cameras. In terms of OS, it is currently running on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with a likely OxygenOS or HydrogenOS skin on top.There are no details on the screen size or battery capacity at this point. So far there’s also no visual clues either. From the specs, it looks quite similar to the Xiaomi Mi 5, which is currently the most affordable Snapdragon 820 smartphone. For OnePlus 3 to make headlines, it has to carry top notch hardware and slick stock-like Android UI with a competitive price tag. The folks at Gizmochina are hinting that a 7th April release is possible but so far we haven’t seen any solid indication or clues at this point. In OnePlus typical fashion, they would usually create the hype weeks if not months ahead of launch. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

You’ll need to pay RM93.28/month inclusive of GST after receiving the “monthly rebates”.Want a different way of owning the Galaxy S7 edge? 4G WiMAX operator Yes is offering the Samsung flagship at RM799 (before GST). Unlike other telcos, Yes is offering it with their MiFi broadband bundle and it packs quite a punch at RM88/month. The Galaxy S7 edge is tied with 24 months contract of Super 168 postpaid plan but at a discounted RM88/month instead of the usual at RM168/month subscription fee. The plan gives you 2,000 minutes of calls and 2,000 SMS (within Yes network via Yes Life app) plus 20GB of internet each month. That’s more than the 16GB quota that’s being offered right now.In addition, you’ll also get the Huddle XS MiFi device worth RM509 for free and an extra 32GB memory card but there’s no mention what type it is. During registration, Yes requires a rather steep RM1,888 upfront payment which will be rebated back to your account over 24 months. So that’s a total of RM2,687 you’ll need to fork out before 6% GST. Note: The RM88/month subscription fee isn’t a promo. It is the price (before GST) after deducting the monthly RM1,888 rebate. In total, you will be paying RM168 for 24 months (excluding GST), which comes up to RM4,032 overall just for subscription fees. RM168 for 20GB is quite expensive considering they are currently offering 16GB for RM88/month on a shorter 12-month contract.Interested? Head over to Yes’ Galaxy S7 edge page.

Rory Lee,OPPO Malaysia CEO teases F1 Plus — looks exactly like the R9,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/oppo-malaysia-ceo-teases-f1-plus-looks-exactly-like-the-r9/,"malaysia,oppo,oppo f1,oppo f1 plus,oppo r9,oppo r9 plus,smartphone,android,mobile devices,mobile os,rumour mill","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo,Rumour Mill",2016-03-28,"OPPO has been known, especially with their recent smartphones, to stick to a similar design language when it comes to new devices. Just take a look at the F1 compared to the R7 series of smartphones — they’re nearly identical.However, the keyword here is “nearly”, as there are some noticeable physical features that separate the two smartphones. If we’re looking at the recent slew of photos shared by OPPO Malaysia CEO William Fang of the supposed F1 Plus, the same distinction can’t be made because it looks exactly like the newly announced R9.There’s no denying it, it’s identical from the rounded camera hump all the way to the front mounted fingerprint sensor. What’s peculiar here is that when the F1 Plus was announced in Mumbai early this year, there was no mention of a fingerprint scanner at all.You would think that a fingerprint scanner on what should likely be a mid-range device to be a big deal, but there was no mention of it in the slides. It could then simply be a home button, but that seems unlikely.With smartphones that share a similar design, it isn’t too uncommon for companies to sometimes get them mixed up, so it is possible that William simply made a mistake. But, with each subsequent post, it seems more and more likely that this isn’t a mix-up and could indeed be the F1 Plus.If it isn’t a mix-up, what could it be then? Our guess is that the F1 Plus could be a rebranding of the R9. They line up in terms of specs with a 5.5-inch full HD display and 4GB of RAM, but we can’t say for certain as no further specifications have been revealed.Earlier, we reported that OPPO Malaysia was bringing in the R9 to Malaysia a month after the device’s official launch on the 17th of March. However, with OPPO Malaysia’s latest teaser posted on their Facebook page, it seems more likely that the next device that they’re launching is the F1 Plus.So this opens up the question: Will the R9 be arriving in Malaysia as the F1 Plus?To us, the name doesn’t really matter as long as the device is solid. What do you guys think?[SOURCE, 2, 3]"
Rory Lee,HTC 10 to have a Snapdragon 652 variant,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/htc-10-to-have-a-snapdragon-652-variant/,"android,htc,htc 10,htc 10 leak,htc 10 rumour,htc 10 snapdragon 652,htc 10 snapdragon 820,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os,rumour mill","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-03-28,"HTC’s 10 has been a hot topic of discussion lately. As information about the device trickles out, rumours regarding the device also start to heat up and one of the more interesting ones is that there may be two processor variants of the HTC 10 — a Snapdragon 820 variant and one that’s powered by a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor.That’s a pretty shocking jump in processing power no matter how you spin it. Although manufacturers have been known to release lower-end versions of their flagship devices, these devices often featuring either lower-clocked processors or slightly less RAM.HTC, on the other hand, seems to have gone down an interesting path with its choice of smartphone variants opting for a completely different SoC. This is pretty similar to the rumoured LG G5 “Lite” which is also a Snapdragon 652-powered G5.The low-spec HTC 10 is said to pack 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage to go along with the new Snapdragon chip. That’s quite a limited amount of space for a device bearing the flagship name — especially in 2016. On the other hand, the Snapdragon 820-powered devices are said to be packing either 3GB of RAM plus 32GB of storage or 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.HTC’s 10 does seem to pack a punch though as recent AnTuTu benchmarks reveal a smashing score of 156.091 which completely beats everything else in the market right now. Considering this incredible performance, HTC must have worked some magic on their device’s optimisation because a similarly spec-ed Xiaomi Mi 5 is only capable of scoring 142,000 points.With this optimisation, it begs the question of how well the Snapdragon 652 variant would fair. We certainly wouldn’t expect another record-breaking score, but it should be pretty interesting to see.What is a little troubling to see is the rumoured price that the HTC 10 is said to retail at. According to phoneradar, the Snapdragon 652 variant will be priced at CNY3,799 (around RM2,343) while the higher Snapdragon 820 variants will be priced at CNY4,999 (around RM3,083) and CNY5,888 (around RM3,631).Other specifications rumoured for the HTC 10 are a 5.1-inch Quad HD Super LCD 5 display, a world class camera, a large 3,000 mAh battery and a new kind of BoomSound audio experience.How many variants HTC will really launch and what will be powering each device still remains unconfirmed so take it with a grain of salt. The good news is that the wait won’t be much longer as all will be revealed on 12th April 2016.[SOURCE, VIA]"
Rory Lee,5 things that you may not know were designed by Malaysians,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/5-things-that-you-may-not-know-were-designed-by-malaysians/,"intel,intel compute stick,intel iot gateway,intel malaysia,intel malaysia design centre,intel nuc board,internet of things,malaysia,malaysia design centre,malaysians,usb 1.0 microcontroller,cool stuff,mobile devices,others","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-03-28,"“Buatan Malaysia” often gets a bad rap even in our own country. But, the truth is, there are many Malaysians out there making some seriously awesome stuff.In tech, we’re making big strides too especially when it comes to major breakthroughs with one of the largest chipmakers in the world — Intel. Here are five awesome technological advancements Malaysians have made with the chipmaker that you probably didn’t know about.Intel has put a big emphasis on Asia to help drive its growth in recent years. They established their first facility outside of the United States right here in Penang in 1972. However, as the years went by, Intel nearly shut the facility down in 1991 as the micro-controller business wasn’t profitable back then.That obviously would have put the engineers that worked there in a tough spot so rather than give up, the engineers proposed that Intel keeps the business running by adding value with design work. Since then, the relatively small team of 30 engineers has now grown to over 2,000 engineers all working under what has become the Malaysia Design Centre (MDC).This meant that Malaysia was no longer just a hub for the production of hardware, but also a contributor to the research and development of new products and technological innovations.Over the years, the MDC, working under Intel, has conceived many innovative breakthroughs in technological development but we’re here to tell you about the five biggest ones that have made a pretty significant impact on the world we live in right now.[IMAGE SOURCE]I’m sure you’ve seen this little guy making its rounds. If you haven’t, the Intel Compute Stick basically offers the full desktop experience of a computer, in something that looks like an oversized pen drive. It’s small and easy to carry around, plus the ease of being able to just plug it into any HDMI-enabled TV or display and turn it into a full-fledged PC makes it pretty nifty. Perfect for school and college use.[IMAGE SOURCE]As we develop towards the miniaturisation of the PC, Mini PCs become the next stepping stone to that of the full sized tower desktops. Stuff like the Remix Mini we saw awhile back are often enough for most people and their daily tasks. At the forefront of Mini PC development is Intel with its NUC (Next Unit of Computing) line of computers. These are basically computer kits that come with a custom Intel motherboard and an Intel CPU plus slots in which you can install RAM and a hard drive yourself. Super compact, totally upgradable, and designed by Malaysians.[IMAGE SOURCE]Intel’s Atom processors can be found in many netbooks, 2-in-1s and even smartphones. As a product line, the Atom processor is often associated with relatively inexpensive or portable netbooks and smart devices, but did you know that the first purpose built Low Cost Intel Architecture based System on a Chip design (codenamed Pineview Intel Atom) came out of the MDC team? Pineview processors cover the N4xx, D4xx, N5xx, and D5xx processors, all of which came with integrated graphics while boasting improved performance and a 20% drop in power consumption compared to previous generations.This particular design propelled the growth of lightweight, compact and affordable netbook market, netting seven world-class manufacturing records before it was even launched in 2009.With modern computers, simply plugging and playing your pen drives, mice and keyboards among other things into the desktop’s USB ports is practically a norm. It is this convenience and seamless peripheral connectivity that the Malaysian designed USB 1.0 micro-controller has made possible. No hassle, no fuss, just plug and play.The Internet of Things is a fascinating notion that is becoming more and more complete as each day passes. Smart TVs, smart fridges, smart air purifiers, all contribute to the connectivity of objects with each other. But what about legacy objects that were conceived and created before the IoT was a thing?Well, the MDC designed Intel IoT Gateway is one of these solutions that helps companies connect these legacy devices to the Internet. The device and sensor management application is an end-to-end IoT solution that has been successfully applied to smart agriculture systems and across a range of industries including hospitality, asset tracking and industrial automation.These are truly amazing things that this home-grown team of engineers have accomplished since their inception. So, as the MDC celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, let’s all take our hats off to these awesome technologies and the Malaysians behind their design.

Rory Lee,HP Pavilion x2 review: A capable supplementary device,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/23/hp-pavilion-x2-review-a-capable-supplementary-device/,"2-in-1,hp,hp pavilion x2,hp pavilion x2 review,hp pavilion x2 review malaysia,hybrid laptop,malaysia,tablet,tablet hybrid,windows 10,mobile devices,mobile os,product review",,2016-03-23,"2-in-1s are pretty popular these days because they provide the convenience of a tablet plus the productivity capabilities of a full-fledged laptop. Granted, most of them can’t permanently replace a dedicated laptop or computer, but they’re good enough for work that you can leave your heavy laptop at home and bring a space-aged tablet hybrid around with you.HP’s Pavilion x2 is one that fits into that hybrid laptop category and I quite like it despite some of its obvious drawbacks.There’s no denying that it’s a handsome device. Closed or open, it will look good on any dream desk as it looks very modern and fairly premium despite its plastic construction. That said, you should be extra careful with the white version because that picks up quite a bit of dirt over time.You can tell that thought was put into the construction of the device when you look at the hinge. When the device is open, the screen rolls out and elevates the keyboard, giving you better ergonomics than a flat keyboard. Plus, the magnets holding the tablet to the keyboard are quite strong, letting you lift the device without worry of either part coming off.Since we’re on the topic of the keyboard, it does give a nice typing experience. For something so small and compact, the keys are well spaced and give great travel when typing. I had no problems typing on it for a full day despite coming from a mechanical keyboard.But, all that comes with a price as we arrive at my biggest problem with the Pavilion x2 — its weight. For something that only takes up half the space in my bag’s laptop sleeve, this 2-in-1 is pretty heavy, weighing in at a little over 1.1kg with both keyboard and tablet attached. It feels almost as heavy as the 13-inch Dell Inspiron 13 7000 series laptop I use as a daily driver."
Alexander Wong,Maxis is the leading mobile network in Malaysia according to OpenSignal’s report,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/25/maxis-is-the-leading-mobile-network-in-malaysia-according-to-opensignal/,"4g lte,4g lte malaysia,celcom,celcom 4g,digi,digi 4g,malaysia 4g lte,maxis,maxis 4g,maxis 4g coverage,open signal,opensignal,u mobile,u mobile 4g,players on the field","Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-03-25,"Postpaid plans in Malaysia are getting cheaper with competitive telcos dishing out more data for your money. Apart from cost, another crucial factor to consider is network quality. What’s the point of getting loads of data on the cheap if you can’t use it when you needed it the most?4G LTE was introduced in Malaysia back in 2013 and currently we have 4 major LTE telcos – Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. To find out which network is best, OpenSignal has just published a State of Mobile Networks report specifically for Malaysia. The findings were derived from a data sample size of close to 40 million that were contributed by 21,109 OpenSignal app users in Malaysia between 1 December 2015 to 29 February 2016. According to OpenSignal, Maxis gets their top pick for having the best 4G coverage and best speed in Malaysia. From their report over a 3 month period, Maxis users are connected to 4G LTE 70% of the time. Since Maxis customers are having 4G more frequently, this also brings up the overall network speed to first place with an average of 5.20Mbps. For 4G specifically, Maxis delivers an average speed of 13Mbps.Out of the 4 telcos, Celcom is ranked the worst due to lower network speeds and higher latency on both 3G and 4G. They noted that Celcom’s performance was better around the Klang Valley area. When compared to the global average, Malaysia’s 4G LTE speed is quite close to the standard average of 13.5Mbps.  To measure 4G coverage, OpenSignal uses the time coverage methodology which calculates the proportion of time a user is connected on 4G. This gives a better measurement especially when you could be getting just 3G indoors while being in a 4G covered area. As seen on the chart above, Maxis leads at first place at 69.98% followed by Digi at 57.60%. Celcom takes third place at 52.94%, while U Mobile is last at 44.23%. U Mobile obviously takes a beating here as it relies on Maxis for 2G/3G coverage where their network is not available. When looking at speed, U Mobile is the fastest in both 3G and 4G specifically. However, it takes 2nd place overall as most of it users are connected to 3G most of the time. Despite that, it is worth noting that U Mobile is faster overall than Digi and Celcom which has more 4G LTE sites in comparison.  Celcom, unfortunately, ranks the slowest among the four in any given scenario. Maxis and U Mobile are the top picks for 3G with a latency of less than 105ms. Meanwhile for 4G, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile have a 3-way draw with less than 56ms. The lower the latency indicates a more responsive network and unfortunately, Celcom trails behind for both 3G and 4G segments. To conclude, OpenSignal’s latest report ranks Maxis as the better network for overall 4G LTE availability, speeds and latency. This is contrary to what we’ve seen on their website earlier on. For this year, we can expect our telcos to push for more 4G coverage aggressively particularly Maxis and Digi. Both telcos will be refarming their 2G 1800MHz spectrum for 4G use. On top of that, both are also pushing for more LTE-A sites which provide even faster speeds with carrier aggregation. If OpenSignal’s report is an accurate indicator, Celcom has a lot of room to improve. With its value-for-money FIRST postpaid plans, the blue telco has the pulling power to draw other subscribers to their fold. To expand and to upgrade a 4G network is a costly affair. There are concerns whether affordable plans with loads of data can sustain telcos in the long run. If you haven’t seen it yet, you can check out our postpaid comparison post.

The boom sound stereo speakers is likely to be omitted and it will sport a reversible USB Type C port with Quick Charging.We’re expecting HTC to tease more as the date draws closer, though if the leaks are to be believed, we won’t be expecting any big surprises.[VIA][SOURCE]"

We’ve seen countless of leaks of the new flagship and many were disappointed by the lack of a twin speaker grill.HTC has always been our favourite for media consumption with its epic front-facing Boom Sound Stereo speakers. In its latest teaser, HTC is promising a new Boom and they say that you’re going to hear it.If you look at the main image above, it looks like a pair of separate speaker grills. The tiny rounded cut holes above resembles the usual earpiece speaker grill while the bottom elongated holes looks like your typical loudspeaker grill found at the bottom of the device. As pointed out by reader Jack, there’s a possibility that HTC is going for an earpiece + bottom speaker combo for stereo audio playback. Apparently HTC has done this combo on the Desire 825. With some virtual audio trickery, it gives a similar Boom Sound experience without the need of actually putting a pair up of speakers front. What do you think? Can HTC pull off a “virtual” Boom Sound better than its current HTC One M7/M8/M9s?[ SOURCE ]"

So imagine our surprise when we found out they launched not one, but three different smartphones under the brand Neffos.What’s more, TP-Link will be bringing some of their devices to Malaysia next week.It seems the pull of taking a slice out of the smartphone market was simply too strong for the computer networking manufacturer to resist. Branded Neffos, TP-Link launched three different Android devices under the Neffos C5 line — the C5L, C5, and C5 Max.Starting things off is the smallest of them all, the C5L. It’s got a 4.5-inch FWVGA display being powered by a Snapdragon 210 processor with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of expandable storage. For photos, it gets an 8-megapixel main camera with a 2MP front-facing unit to help out with selfies. Despite the low-end specs, this device will have support for LTE connectivity and a 2,000 mAh battery.Moving up the pack, we get to the C5. Much more similar to a mid-range device, the C5 packs a 5-inch 720p IPS LCD display on the front. Inside, it’s powered by a MediaTek MT6735 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. For camera optics, the device gets an 8MP/5MP front and rear camera combo, all powered by a 2,200 mAh battery.Sitting at the top of the line is the largest C5 Max. It’s got a large 5.5-inch full-HD IPS panel which runs on a MediaTek MT6753 processor and 2GB of  RAM plus 16GB of expandable storage. It gets a bump up in the camera department as well, sporting a 13MP/5MP front and rear camera combo. Giving the device juice is a large 3,045 mAh battery.We’re not entirely sure which Neffos device TP-Link will bring in, but they’re going to launch two new smartphones on the 30th of March which is next Wednesday. In the meantime, you can head on over to their website for more information.What do you think of these devices? Let us know in the comments below."

It’s a sweet spot if you think about it. With how good cheap phones are getting and how cheap good phones have become, smartphones that hover around this price range can be absolutely great value for money. Plus, keeping your device expenditure within three figures is easier to justify to your bank account in the long run.We took a look at several notable manufacturers who create some reasonably priced value-for-money handsets and picked their best with two important criteria:1. It must have 4G LTE support2. It must have at least 16GB of internal storageWhy these two? Well, it’s 2016 and if you’re going to be spending almost four figures on your device, it better be able to at least get you connected to the 4G LTE network your telcos are boasting about in all of their advertisements. For 16GB of internal storage, well, that’s pretty self-explanatory don’t you think?Keeping that in mind, here are some of the best devices you can get for RM1,000 and be sure to head to the last page for our top 3 picks of what we would pick up ourselves if we had to spend RM1,000 on a smartphone.We’ve also included a comparison table at the end of the post to help with comparing spec sheets."

While it is late to the party, HTC thinks that the 10 will be worth the wait. It has released teasers hinting that it will carry another world’s first in cameras, plus a different kind of Boom Sound that won’t disappoint. For those who are particular about performance, a purported HTC 10 was spotted running Antutu and it smashes every flagship smartphone out there. And it’s quite a huge margin. The HTC 10 hardware is quite identical with the Xiaomi Mi 5. It runs on the latest Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB RAM which Xiaomi claims to be capable of scoring over 142,000 points on Antutu. From the image above, the HTC 10 scores over 150,000 which is insane. What’s more intriguing is that the HTC 10 carries a Quad HD display which obviously is more power intensive than the Mi 5 that settles for a Full HD screen. Benchmarks aside, the HTC 10 pictured looks pretty polished like the HTC One A9. With a rounded glass around the sides and that silver metal frame, the HTC 10 looks like a mashup between a Galaxy S7 and a Nexus 6P. Are you excited about the 10 yet? [ SOURCE ]"

The rates start at RM 18 to RM 39.90 depending on the location.The app in itself is pretty simple to use, you register your basic information and then just set the airport you need to head to, your pick up point and the date/time you wish to be collected. Then you’ll get an email with payment details. So far we’re finding it rather rudimentary but this is as straightforward as it gets.However, even if you book for just one person you’ll still be sharing your ride with others as the pickup points will sort of act like bus terminals for ride sharing. It still a bit less hassle than taking the bus to the airports but if you’ve got a lot of luggage it might be a bit of a problem.Price wise its still a bit cheaper than your average taxi ride that could set you back more than RM80 per trip, but it still looks like grabbing an Uber would still be a more versatile option as airport2u doesn’t do return pickups and has limited pickup locations.You can check out the app on airport2u.com or on Google Play.[SOURCE]"

It’s something you can do on most navigation applications and it allows you to have quick access to your favourite destinations.In a recent update, Google added a little feature that’ll add some pizzazz to your navigation experience.Google Maps now lets you put stickers on your Work and Home saved locations. These stickers range from igloos to barn houses so if you’re bored of what your current house looks like, at least, you can now change what you see on your navigation app.This is a cute personalisation gesture that I will surely mess around with at least for awhile, but pretty stickers aren’t the only thing Google added to their navigation app. Maps now also lets you add labels to your favourite destinations like the gym, school or underground bowling alley that you frequent.Again, this gives you a degree of personalisation and customisation on the experience you want to have when navigating with the app, rather than actually functionality. This is because you can simply save a location by tapping the “Save” button with the golden star and it will turn up in “Your places” when you pull out the hamburger menu.I suppose the biggest benefit is if you give a place with a complicated name a simple nickname or code via the label. All you have to do then is type label or nickname into the app’s search bar (for example, AMPM Cafe is labelled Mmm Yummy in my Maps) and the location will appear at the top of the search results.Pretty nifty quality of life changes, but nothing too radical from what we can tell. Well, except the fact that you can change your house into a flippin’ dragon whenever you want to and that’s pretty awesome if you ask me.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Its got a lot of the stuff that makes the iPad Pro tick under the hood and Apple is marketing it as the ultimate PC replacement.Apple is quite confident that the iPad Pro could be the “PC replacement device” that people are looking for, especially since there are 600 million PCs that are over 5 years old. They’re pretty sure that these users will just jump straight to the iPad Pro 9.7.Specs wise, the iPad Pro sports quite a bit of the same specs as its bigger counterpart; featuring the same A9X processor and four speakers. However, it does have an upgraded 12MP rear camera that can shoot 4K video alongside a 5MP front snapper with Retina Flash. The display has also gotten a significant bump up, as Apple claims that the new iPad Pro is 40% less reflective than the iPad Air 2‘s screen and apparently that its got the lowest reflectivity while being the brightest tablet on the market.The iPad Pro’s screen also has some new tech called “True Tone Display” which adjusts the display’s colour temperature based on the ambient light plus its got blue-light reduction for all you late night users.The new iPad Pro will come in four different colours, space grey, silver, gold and rose gold, with preorders starting 24th March with the device officially hitting the market on 31st March. The iPad Pro 9.7″ is priced at US$599 (RM2418) for 32GB, US$749 (RM3024) for 128GB and US$899 (RM3629) for 256GB for the WiFi only models. Our neighbour down south in Singapore will be among the first wave countries to get it and so far there’s no indication yet for Malaysian availability.Apple will also be selling a smaller version of the Smart Keyboard that is roughly identical to the one for the larger iPad Pro.

Alexander Wong,3 reasons why the iPhone SE is a big deal,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/22/3-reasons-why-the-iphone-se-is-a-big-deal/,"apple,apple iphone se,iphone,iphone 6,iphone 6 malaysia,iphone 6s,iphone 6s plus,iphone malaysia,iphone se,iphone se malaysia,iphone se price,ios,mobile devices,mobile os","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-03-22,"Early this morning Apple had announced its latest iPhone that’s simply called the iPhone SE. It is a brand new model and it doesn’t even have a number on it.In the past, the cheapest iPhone you can buy is basically a rehash of an outdated model with a smaller storage option. We’ve seen this since the iPhone 3GS/iPhone 4 days. That’s no longer the case with the iPhone SE. It is Apple’s most affordable new iPhone and it’s just as powerful as their current flagship.Smartphones these days are getting bigger and we’ve seen how Apple has succumbed to this trend when they introduced a larger 4.7” iPhone 6 and a phablet-sized 5.5″ Plus model. Of course not everybody wants a bigger phone. In 2015, Apple is still selling over 30 million iPhones with a 4” screen which included the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C.Well, it isn’t a huge chunk considering that’s only 13% of its total 231.5 million iPhones sold, but nevertheless it is still quite a significant number.Remember the ad above? It is still relevant today and there are people who are still sticking to their old iPhone 5/5S because of the size. Try tapping the “back” button on the larger iPhones and you’ll get what I mean.The iPhone SE looks exactly like an iPhone 5S and you can even have it in Rose Gold. Underneath that familiar 4” 1136×640 Retina display, the iPhone SE is just as good as the current iPhone 6s. In fact, they are calling it the most powerful 4-incher yet.It gets the same top notch iPhone 6s performance with a 64-bit A9 chip and it also packs the same 12MP iSight camera with dual-tone LED flash, Live Photos and it also shoot videos in 4K. Over at the front, it settles for the same old 1.2MP camera as the iPhone 6/5S but it supports Retina Flash for brighter selfies. Connectivity wise, the iPhone SE will work with a wider range of LTE networks and it also comes with NFC support for Apple Pay.Our fluctuating exchange rates have made Apple products ridiculously expensive in Malaysia. You would have to fork out more than RM3,000 for the latest iPhone and that’s for the pathetic 16GB model.The iPhone SE is probably the best alternative for Apple to reach out to the mid-range segment. It packs flagship hardware at Apple’s “entry-level” price range. Make no mistake, Apple isn’t doing a Xiaomi but it is pretty much like how Sony does their Xperia Z compact line. In fact, there are rumours suggesting that Samsung will counter the SE with a compact Galaxy S7.The iPhone SE is very likely to be priced from under RM2,000 when it gets to Malaysia. This enables those on a budget to enjoy the very latest hardware from Apple. In Singapore, the iPhone SE 16GB is priced at S$658 (RM1,954), which is lower than the iPhone 5S 16GB at S$728 (RM2,162). It is also the same in Australia, with the iPhone SE 16GB priced at A$679 (RM2,083) versus the iPhone 5S 16GB at A$749 (RM2,298).Before the iPhone 5S was removed from the Malaysian online store, the 16GB model is going for RM2,199 while the 32GB version is priced at RM2,499. The above table is our iPhone SE price estimate which shouldn’t stray too far from our southern neighbour. Let’s hope our RM doesn’t slide further against the US Dollar. Pre-orders are starting this week in first wave countries and the iPhone SE should reach Malaysia latest by end of May 2016.If you’ve been eyeing for an iPhone 6 16GB, forget that and get the iPhone SE 64GB instead. Yes, it is a smaller phone but you get better specs, better camera and most importantly 4X the storage. Trust us, you definitely need more than 16GB on an iPhone.Will you be making the switch to an iPhone SE? Or would you rather save up and go for the bigger iPhone 6s/6s Plus. Let us know in the comments below."
Rory Lee,Fitbit Blaze and Alta have hit local shores,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/22/fitbit-blaze-and-alta-have-hit-local-shores/,"fitbit,fitbit alta,fitbit alta malaysia,fitbit blaze,fitbit blaze malaysia,fitbit malaysia,fitness tracker malaysia,harvey norman,mobile accessories,mobile devices,smart watch","Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Smart Watch",2016-03-22,"Fitbit has made waves in the smartwatch industry despite not being technically a smartwatch. While their wearables have not been the prettiest of devices, they’ve always offered a pretty reasonable set of functions for the price. Early this year, Fitbit was determined to shore up that weakness too, launching the Blaze and the Alta — both of which look pretty good on anyone’s wrist.Now, sticking to initial launch plans, these two wearables have finally hit our shelves.What sets the Blaze apart from the highest end Surge? Well, for starters, it looks a whole lot better if you ask me. It has a much sleeker and classier look to it compared to the chunky Surge, which means that it’ll go well with almost every occasion. It’s also got a colour LED touch screen — a first for the wearable maker.It also pushes notifications like call, text and calendar alerts to your wrist from your smartphone. You can also control music playback and is also sweat and water resistant though no IP rating is given. What’s more, it’ll feature Fitbit’s SmartTrack which automatically recognises and records exercises for you. You can also pop out the head and swap it with another strap if elastomer is not your thing.However, it does lack one big feature from the Surge that fitness enthusiasts will undoubtedly miss — built-in GPS. Fitbit says it has “connected GPS” but that’s just a fancy term for saying “you need your smartphone to track distance and route”. Boo. Still, that has allowed Fitbit to keep the battery life on this device to 5 days but is admittedly shorter than the 7-day Surge battery life.Nevertheless, Fitbit is also placing it at a lower price point in their food chain, with the Blaze going for RM950 (incl GST) — comes in Black and Plum colours — meaning that the Fitbit Surge still sits on top as the apex predator. As far as bands go, here’s the full catalogue on Harvey Norman:Luxe Accessory Band (Large) Black Leather — RM450
Luxe Accessory Band (Small) Black Leather — RM450
Luxe Accessory Band (Small) Camel Leather — RM450
Luxe Band (Large) Mist Grey Leather — RM450
Luxe Band Stainless Steel Links — RM580The Alta is two down from the Blaze in terms of its position in the Fitbit family, slotting in right between the Flex and the Charge HR. As a result, it has much less functionality but gets many of the core features right. It’ll track your activity all day, remind you to move and automatically records your activities via SmartTrack. It’ll also track your sleep and double as a clock plus push notifications like call, text and calendar alerts (something the Charge HR doesn’t do).However, it does lack an altimeter and a heart-rate sensor, but there’s really only so much you can cram into such a small form-factor. It looks pretty sleek and stylish which means that this little wristband-like smart wearable should fit in any occasion. If you’re interested, the Fitbit Alta is up for preorders now at RM630 (incl GST) and comes in three colours — Blue, Black and Plum.Neither tickle your fancy?

How else do they get away with selling everything they do as a reinvention of technology? It’s as uncanny as it is amazing and while you either hate Apple or love them, you can’t help but admire how well they get people to eat out of their hands.Take their latest device, the iPhone SE, for instance. When Cupertino revealed it, I was blown away because it was the single most brilliant but dumb thing they’ve done.Apple’s March 2016 Keynote special event was by no means a large event, in fact, it was almost intimate as far as mobile launches go. Many, including us, weren’t expecting too much from them because they don’t usually make big announcements this early in the year.However, we were still holding out hope for some other kind of mobile accessory like a reinvented pair of VR goggles or a completely innovative 360-camera. Instead, what we got was a hint that Apple may be losing grip on their “world-changing” ways.All that the most valuable brand in the world had to show for their March Keynote was a smaller iPad Pro, an even smaller iPhone trapped in a body of a three-year-old smartphone and some Watch bands. Has one of the largest tech companies in the world nothing else to show at an internationally broadcasted event but a “new” iPad and iPhone?It honestly looked a little like Apple were shaken by how good their competitors have gotten and simply told Liam to throw something together out of spare parts. They could have done something as simple as tweak the design of the iPhone SE and it would have made all the difference.Instead, the only way you can tell the iPhone SE apart from the three-year-old 5s is that it weighs 1g more and comes in rose gold. It seems that Apple is resorting to rehashing an old device just to keep up with the competition.Of course, you could argue: Why fix something that isn’t broken? But that’s not what Apple does. Apple prides themselves with breaking the mould and not only improving existing tech but also “reinventing” it. With the iPhone SE, Apple had instead shown that even they can’t keep innovating.I say this because none of that matters. The main point of the iPhone SE is that now more people can buy iPhones. With the iPhone SE, not only are loyal customers who have previously hung on to old 4-inch iPhones going to have a viable upgrade, it’s also cheap.Well, cheap by Apple’s standards. But if you want an iPhone, Apple’s standards are the only standards you need to live by. So, instead of looking at a rehashed smartphone, people see an affordable and small iPhone with flagship-level performance.It doesn’t matter that it looks exactly like the iPhone 5s, or that it’s probably made using the same stuff. Nor does it matter that Apple had the audacity to put a rudimentary 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera on a 2016 smartphone that costs nearly RM2,000. What matters is that Apple found a need for a small, powerful yet affordable iPhone and are now owning that need.To be able to do that by simply recycling old parts with a new processor is nothing short of brilliant."

TIME has revamped their Home Fibre Broadband offering with even faster speeds up to 500Mbps. At RM299/month, TIME’s latest offering is significantly cheaper than Maxis’ Fibre Internet that offers 100Mbps for RM398/month.There are 3 Home Fibre options available. The base 100Mbps broadband option now costs RM149/month, while an extra RM40 lets you triple your speeds to 300Mbps (RM189/month). Both 100Mbps and 300Mbps plans come with a D-Link DIR-850L router. For the ultimate experience, the 500Mbps option is their fastest offering at RM299/month and it comes bundled with a Linksys EA6350 Router. For those who need to make calls, you can get an annual 2,000 minutes pack for RM10/month with a 1-year contract. Alternatively, you can pay per use at 9 sen/minute for fixed and mobile numbers. All three plans come with unlimited usage and you get symmetrical speeds on fibre. So if you’re on a 500Mbps plan, that means you get the same 500Mbps speeds for both upload and download. Overall, TIME’s latest plans offer faster speeds and lower subscription when compared to its previous 100Mbps Home Fibre plan with 100GB quota at RM179/month. As a comparison, TM is now offering RM179/month for 30Mbps (10Mbps upload) and RM229/month for 50Mbps (20Mbps Upload).The only limitation for TIME is its service availability. Unlike TM, TIME’s fibre optic network currently covers 250,000 homes, mostly metropolitan areas in Klang Valley and Penang.

It will also have a 5 MP front camera with a 13 MP rear snapper. The Galaxy J7 is also rumoured to ship with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow under the hood and will be home to a 3,300mAh battery.As for its looks, Samsung hasn’t strayed very far away from its tried and true design formula so it looks very similar to its predecessor but now uses a metal chassis instead of plastic.No idea when we might be getting the device locally but we expect the pricing to be at the very least in the sub-RM 1000 category. More images below:    [SOURCE, VIA]"

As we wait for the iPhone SE to hit the shelves, it appears that the new device is faster than its bigger models.According to its Antutu listing, the iPhone SE gets an A9 processor mated to 2GB of RAM. This is the same configuration as the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The camera listed is a 12MP main shooter with a 1.2MP front camera. In terms of performance, the iPhone SE scored 134,358 which is higher than the iPhone 6s Plus that did 132,620. Not surprising since the iPhone SE has a lower resolution display which puts less strain on the processor. Despite having just dual-core processors and 2GB of RAM, the latest iPhones are capable of whopping other flagship smartphones in benchmarks.  So would you consider the iPhone SE? Or would you rather spend on something else from the Android camp? For many, a 4-inch smartphone is just too small and this could be Apple’s most brilliant dumb idea yet.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"
Rory Lee,The Apple iPhone SE is the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/22/the-apple-iphone-se-is-the-most-powerful-4-inch-phone-ever/,"4-inch iphone,apple,apple iphone se,apple keynote march 2016,ios,iphone se,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Apple,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-03-22,"Apple has welcomed a new iPhone to their smartphone family — the iPhone SE — and it’s a 4-inch device designed for people who simply love smaller iPhones. It’s packing a whole lot of horsepower that makes it the “most powerful 4-inch phone ever”.At the heart of the iPhone SE (pronounced “essay” apparently) sits Apple’s powerful A9 chip and M9 motion coprocessor. This means that the device has the same amount of performance as their iPhone 6s flagship device. This 4-inch smartphone also features Apple’s Retina display, boasting a pixel density of 326 ppi.That’s a mighty little device if we’ve ever seen one. What’s more, the iPhone SE will pack the excellent 12-megapixel iSight camera with Focus Pixels and a True Tone flash. To ensure the best camera experience, the iPhone SE also sports the A9’s new image signal processor which should ensure excellent photos. On the front though, things aren’t so pretty as the FaceTime HD camera is only capable of taking 1.2-megapixel images.One of the biggest complaints we’ve heard from our readers (and apparently every other iPhone 5s customer) was its terrible battery life. Well the iPhone SE is supposed to bring an improvement to battery performance, despite all that extra horsepower, which should keep you running for longer.It also has support for, faster LTE (50% faster than iPhone 5s), VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and faster 802.11ac WiFi connectivity. It’s also got Touch ID to ensure your device is secure, plus help you unlock and access your smartphone with just a tap of your finger.What is missing is Apple’s 3D Touch, which seems to have been abandoned for the iPhone SE. In terms of looks, the device does look almost exactly like the old iPhone 5s which perhaps speaks to Apple’s efforts and desire in their recycling devices.If you’re interested, the iPhone SE will go on sale on 31st March (with preorders beginning 24th March) with prices starting at USD399 (around RM1,611) for the 16GB model and USD499 (around RM2,015) for the 64GB model. In Singapore, the smartphone will go for SGD658 (around RM1,955) for the 16GB model and SGD828 for the 64GB model (around RM2,460).The first wave of iPhone SE devices will hit several countries including Singapore, but for us folks in Malaysia, you can expect it to arrive latest by the end of May as Apple rolls its device out to over 110 countries."

Before this, Uber was running as a cashless service with your rides charged automatically thru credit or debit card. Is this a good move?The beauty of Uber is the ease of getting on and off a ride. There’s no need to worry about small change so you can get from point A to B hassle free. Prior to this, Uber has started accepting cash at selected markets where card payments have limited reach. According to them, there are many potential customers that couldn’t experience Uber as they lack any form of electronic payment. To make clean and safe rides more accessible, they are experimenting cash as an option. This is similar to Grab, which initially accepts only cash and eventually they have started accept card payments. Johor Bahru is picked as the first city to roll out cash payments for Uber rides in Malaysia. If this is successful, they could introduce this to other cities in the country. Personally, I feel that automated card payments are the way to go. Not only it provides a seamless experience, but it is also more time efficient as the drivers would not need to make longer stops to look for change. Furthermore, you won’t want to get into the same taxi experience where the driver runs out of change for your freshly ATM-withdrawn RM100 note. For drivers, this could also pose a risk for carrying more cash at hand and possibly being caught by SPAD or taxi drivers. In terms of electronic payment accessibility, most ATM cards issued by local banks are already debit cards carrying either Mastercard or VISA.The new payment feature is rolling out in stages and customers in JB should be getting the cash option gradually in the coming weeks. To pay by cash, make sure CASH is selected before you request for a ride. When the trip ends, just pay for the amount that’s displayed in the app. Is accepting cash a good move or would you prefer Uber to stay as a cashless system?

To recap, the iPhone SE is a 4″ iPhone that’s powered by an A9 processor and comes with a 12MP main camera like the iPhone 6s. It is expected to be priced starting from under RM2,000 for its 16GB model based on its pricing overseas.

One of the world’s most valuable companies, the pioneer of the smartphone as we know and love today, as well as a company who dares to try some truly interesting things with their devices (removing the CD drive on computers, and potentially the headphone jack on the next iPhone).Now, I’ve been called many things in the past, “Apple basher” being one of them, and much of that is because I don’t agree with many of the things the Cupertino company does. But, there has always been one thing I like that Apple gets so right — their ads.Debuting their latest piece showcasing the “Hey Siri” hands-free functionality on the iPhone 6s, Apple enlisted the help of Sesame Street’s favourite cookie-loving monster.It probably isn’t the best representation of Siri’s accuracy considering how it often struggles with strong accents (no offence Cookie, but you’ve got a pretty strong accent too), but it does leave you with a warm feeling and a smile on your face.I don’t know about you, but it’s ads that evoke this feeling that I remember best.Now I’m not one to buy something because I saw what it could do in an ad, but I know there are many who do that. Ads are really powerful and more and more companies are realising that the best ads aren’t really ads at all — they represent something special or human. Apple does this by adding a touch of humour and wit.It’s subtle and smart, and that makes all the difference. It humanises the ad.Nobody gets it right the first time, not even Apple. Just look at their old ads for the older iPhones. What they mostly did was boast about the features and it wasn’t until the iPhone 6/6 Plus commercial about Health that I started to see them get it right.They’ve almost perfected this aspect of ad-making and it’s truly awesome to see. It’s almost magical how Apple can take some of the most mundane and gimmicky smartphone features, build an ad around them, and make the audience feel like they must have it on their smartphone right now.I can tell you that the next iPhone will have killer specifications and some kick-ass features, but in all honesty, the thing I’m looking forward to the most are its ads. Not the launch one because that will probably be pompous if the iPad Pro’s ad is going to be a trend, but the ones that come after.The ones like this 3D Touch ad that I absolutely love."

Ultimate Device 135 (24 months) – RM1,799
Ultimate Device 95 (24 months) – RM2,099

So probably it is more worthwhile to get the S7 edge outright (RM3,099) as the amount you save from monthly subscription can “subsidise” the device down to RM1,539, which is cheaper than RM1,799 on Ultimate Device 135 plan.

The microSD card is an important feature but Samsung decided to go with a hybrid SIM tray which meant users had to choose between two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card.What if we told you that you could have two SIMs and a microSD card slot?No Replied figured out a way to “hack” the hybrid SIM tray in the Galaxy S7 edge, allowing them to use two nano SIMs and one microSD card at the same time. You must be thinking, how on earth do you “hack” hardware?Well, apparently you hack it literally because what No Replied did was chop up the secondary SIM and superglue it to the back of the microSD card.Brilliant right?The steps No Replied too seemed simple enough with the trickiest part, we reckon, to be the removal of the chip from the nano SIM. It involves heat, prying and some luck to safely get your chip out of its plastic body. Once that’s done though, the rest looks pretty simple and the result actually looks pretty slick and elegant.Clearly, if you’re going to chop up your SIM card, you should really be careful and we will not be held responsible for any damage caused by this little hack.

Aptly named the 6P, it seems that 2015 was the year of the six-branded smartphone, as the Nexus 6P, together with the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, carved a “holy-trinity” out of the smartphone crop.With these three priced at the top of the food chain as no-nonsense, no-compromise, best-phablets-money-can-buy devices, consumers everywhere were torn. The line separating these three devices were so thin that no matter which device you chose, you would end up with a great phablet nonetheless.But, c’mon, we have to crown a winner. There is only one sport at the top of that podium, and today we fill it.These devices are monsters when it comes to performance. They’re absolutely savage, devouring applications, multitasking, gaming, media consumption and everything else you can throw at it. They are the ultimate devices after all. But, like we said, there can only be one winner so we delve into the depths of multitasking and intense usage to try and find a winner. For a full list of specifications, please refer to our last page where we have a detailed table letting you know all the nitty gritty details of each device.First up is the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. It has Samsung’s Exynos 7420 processor, powering it through daily activities. Multitasking was smooth and it had no problems munching up the slew of applications and games we threw at it.Next, we fired up the iPhone 6s Plus and gave it the beans too. Switching between apps was ridiculously quick and snappy. It did help that iOS’s animations made everything so much more fluid (like what Windows Phone does) and as if it was instantaneous. Some might call it cheating, we call it proper optimisation.Finally came the Nexus 6P. Two words: Stock Android. Fantastic multitasking experience, launching every application we could find and flipping through the multitasking card window as we wondered what application to flip between was lots of fun. It handled the switches like a champ. Android’s multitasking animation easily takes the cake. For gaming, well, is there a word to describe something that is buttery-er than buttery?In conclusion, when it comes to performance and multitasking, the iPhone 6s Plus snags the win by a hair over the Nexus 6P. The gap between the two and the Galaxy S6 edge+ though is a little further than expected. Somehow the home button on the Samsung device had a little delay when exiting applications.iPhone wins"
Alexander Wong,Digi counters Maxis with their own East Malaysian plan,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/18/digi-postpaid-rm68-5gb-east-malaysia-plan/,"digi new postpaid,digi postpaid,digi rm68 plan,digi rm68 postpaid,east malaysia,postpaid,sabah,sarawak,digi,players on the field,promotions","DiGi,Players on the Field,Promotions",2016-03-18,"A week ago, Maxis had quietly released a MaxisONE Plan that offers 5GB of data with unlimited calls and SMS for RM68/month. Many had gotten riled up as the plan was offered exclusively to those in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan. According to MDroid, Digi has just rolled out a similar plan which competes directly with Maxis. The folks on the east side are really getting spoilt for choice now. Simply called as the New Digi Postpaid 68 promo, this RM68/month postpaid is exclusive to East Malaysian customers for a limited time only. It also packs 5GB of data like the MaxisONE Plan as well as unlimited calls to all networks. SMS is unlimited but it is only for 3 of your favourite contacts. On top of that, you also get internet rollover to carry forward unused internet to the following month. As an added bonus, there’s also 1 year free iflix subscription worth RM96 plus Capture Cloud storage of 30GB. As a comparison, Digi’s current RM68/month postpaid plan offers 6GB of internet with 150 minutes of calls and SMS. Alternatively, you can go for their unlimited calls and text option but it comes with 3GB of data. So if you don’t really make more calls, the current RM68 for 6GB data offer is probably better but at least, you get a peace of mind of having unlimited calls with this East Malaysia exclusive promo. There’s no info on Digi’s website yet but we reckon you can find out more at your local dealer in East Malaysia.Thanks KevinNgTK for the tip![ SOURCE ]"

Seeing the world in all its glory is an amazing experience, but in the modern technological world that we live in, we need to stay connected and it’s often hard to do that when you’re in a foreign country.Sure, you could roam, but that’ll blow up your phone bill. You could get a local SIM, but can be challenging in certain countries. Or, to keep things simple, you can rent a portable wireless router from Travel Recommends with one of their packages and enjoy unlimited internet connectivity abroad.Travel Recommends has multiple packages covering several countries in Asia, Europe and even the States. From as low as RM15 a day, you can rent a wireless router unit from them for the duration of your trip.Compared to a roaming packing like the MaxisONE World plan, this “Internet rental” is considerably cheaper and covers many more countries. With the MaxisONE World, you would have to pay RM38/day for 500MB of high-speed internet and it will tap into your local quota once you’ve finished the 500MB. If you’ve finished both local and the allocated 500MB quota, your speeds will be throttled. But, the upside is you get unlimited calls and SMS.However, you would have to be a MaxisONE postpaid plan subscriber to take advantage of that plan.With Travel Recommend’s plan, you get unlimited Internet connectivity when travelling. Yep, we checked with Travel Recommends and they told us that it is “truly unlimited”. They didn’t mention what kind of speeds you’ll be getting, though.Simply visit their website at least 5 days before departure, fill in the required fields and choose whether you want to collect/return the unit yourself at KLIA or have a courier deliver it to you within Malaysia.After that, simply make the payment plus an RM200 deposit via bank transfer and you’re good to go.If you’re planning to travel to more than one country during your trip, Travel Recommends also provides package deals that supports coverage in China, Hong Kong, and Macau, as well as an Asia (Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) package.Here is a full list of the countries they support and the rates they charge per day:

It’s been a long wait, but no doubt Windows fans will rejoice.Software updates are great, but looking at the downward spiral that Windows Phone is heading into, one really has to wonder if it’s too little too late.Following the announcement of the rollout, Microsoft released a list of supported devices, and while there are more than initially expected, it’s still a fairly limited affair — for instance, my Lumia 625 isn’t on the list.Here are a list of devices that can be upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile 10586.164:Lumia 1520

MCJ Madosma Q501According to their blog post, Microsoft stated that only these devices were chosen because Windows 10 delivers “significant new innovations” that if applied to older devices might “impact customer experience”. They then continued to say that with this crop of devices, they are confident that they can continue to deliver a good customer experience.Well, good customer experience or not, that remains to be seen, but from what we could tell based on our Lumia 950 XL review, it’s a tough promise to make.Updates are usually fun and if you find your device on that list, you can download the Upgrade Advisor app from the Windows Store to check if Windows 10 Mobile is available for your device (if you haven’t already received it OTA).Keep in mind that even if your device is on the list, you may not get this update today as there are other variances to account for. Stuff like your region, mobile operator or service provider among other things may factor into a delay on the update.Windows Phone as a platform has faced many problems. Poised to be an OS that should have shaken up the Android-iOS hegemony, it simply tripped over itself before it could even stand with the big boys.Recent news seems to make matters even worse for Microsoft’s operating system as one of the key selling points of the platform, their maps and navigation service HERE Maps, is pulling support for the Windows platform. That’s like if Google Maps left the Android platform.What’s more HERE aren’t the only people stopping support for Windows Phone, even WhatsApp are cleaning up their supported devices by killing off support for Windows Phone 7.1. Things aren’t looking that good and we can’t honestly say that we’re surprised.[SOURCE, VIA]"

The Taiwanese company is in a tough spot and it looks like a lot of whether they will sink or swim is riding on their upcoming flagship device.We’ve seen some spec leaks and rumours in the past and now thanks to everyone’s favourite leakster we have even more information on the 10’s display — it’s LCD.In the past, rumours have pointed towards the HTC 10 featuring a 5.1-inch quad-HD panel mounted on the front and according to @evleaks, that panel will be Super LCD 5 instead of an AMOLED panel like the one on the One A9.Super LCD 5 is a variant of the LCD display that has no air gap between the outer glass and the actual display component. This is done to reduce glare and increase visibility. It is also supposed to be more frugal with power consumption.Speaking of power consumption, @evleaks has also revealed that the HTC 10 would have a large (for HTC’s standards) 3,000 mAh battery juicing up the device. Battery capacities upwards of 3,000 mAh is a rare sight on HTC devices, so this is definitely a welcomed addition if it proves true.On the inside, the 10 supposed to pack a powerful Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It’s also said to feature a front-facing fingerprint scanner and home button combo along with 2 capacitive buttons.Unfortunately, it looks like HTC have done away with one of their flagships biggest features — the BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers. A bummer, but at least it’s said to get a USB Type-C port with support for quick-charging.The HTC 10 has a lot to prove if it’s going to save HTC from the downward spiral that it’s caught in. Previous smartphone flagships have promised much but faltered in the delivery, especially when it came to optics.HTC are making similar promises with the 10, previously boasting “world first, world class” cameras on both the front and back of the device. This time, the stakes are a little different though as the HTC 10 would actually have to make good on that promise if HTC wants to keep from sinking.That’s a tall order especially considering how stacked the smartphone camera market is right now. Could it possibly be better than the phenomenal Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 edge‘s 12-megapixel Dual Pixel shooter? I guess we’ll have to wait to find out.What do you guys think of the HTC 10?[SOURCE, VIA]"
Rory Lee,OPPO R9 and R9 Plus — the real selfie expert,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/18/oppo-r9-and-r9-plus-the-real-selfie-expert/,"android,malaysia,oppo,oppo r9,oppo r9 malaysia,oppo r9 official,oppo r9 plus,oppo r9 plus malaysia,oppo r9 plus official,oppo smartphone,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-03-18,"“Selfie, wefie, wherever we go…”By now I’m sure many of you have heard this incredibly catchy (and sometimes annoying) PSA from OPPO. As often as it gets stuck in your head, it does highlight one important thing — we’re taking more selfies today than we ever have in the past.If you’re a smartphone maker, you’d definitely want to cash in on this — many are — and while OPPO’s recent attempt at a “selfie expert” fell sort of flat, their new duo looks much more promising.Kicking things off, the newly announced OPPO R9 and R9 Plus have front facing cameras that are designed to give you 16 megapixels of selfie goodness. In sheer megapixel count alone, they’re double nearly every other smartphone selfie camera out there.But we all know megapixels aren’t everything and thankfully the R9 duo also packs a fast f/2.0 lens to allow as much light as possible to hit that sensor. They’ve also got OPPO’s improved beautification plus selfie panorama modes which should go down well with selfie enthusiasts.Beyond that, the R9 is a pretty standard midrange device. It’s got all the usual suspects in a mid-level OPPO device with a 5.5-inch full HD AMOLED panel sitting on top of a 2GHz MediaTek Helio P10 processor mated to 4GB of RAM. Keeping everything running is a 2,850 mAh battery.Since it’s a camera-centric device, it does pack more internal storage as users can get 64GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). But it becomes pretty obvious which camera you’re supposed to be using when the “primary” rear-facing shooter is only a 13MP sensor with PDAF and an f/2.2 5-element lens.With the name being the biggest hint, the R9 Plus has a larger 6-inch full HD AMOLED panel on the front. Despite the larger screen, the device does have slightly wider bezels (1.76mm versus the R9’s 1.66mm) but it still has a better screen-to-body ratio of 79.3% (versus the R9’s 77.7%).Inside, OPPO has also upped the specifications to a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB (128GB version to follow) of expandable internal storage. The primary camera unit does make a little more sense here as the R9 Plus packs a 16MP Sony IMX298 sensor with PDAF and an f/2.0 lens. It has a larger 4,120 mAh battery which should give it pretty decent battery life.Design wise, the devices have a pretty sexy look with the near bezel-less screen and thin profile accentuated by nice round edges for better grip. OPPO have also abandoned the rear-facing fingerprint scanner, choosing instead to mount it on the front of the device below the display. While that does make it easier to unlock when it’s on the table, I’m still more of a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor kind of guy.The most unfortunate thing is that the Chinese company’s super-fast Super VOOC flash charge doesn’t make an appearance on the R9 duo. You’ll just have to “settle” for regular VOOC (70% charge in 30 mins), I guess. They do come in two colours though — gold and rose gold.Another bummer is that both smartphones come with colorOS 3.0 that is still built on top of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop (Android N previews are out, OPPO, c’mon) but we certainly hope it gets updated when it leaves China.Unfortunately, there is no information on global availability, but it will hit shelves in China on 12 April with the regular R9 being priced at CNY2,799 (around RM1,755) while the bigger R9 Plus will cost CNY3,299 (around RM2,068). According to OPPO Malaysia, it will be arriving on our shores sometime next month. [SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Although it was downsized from 16MP to 12MP, the new Galaxy gets a brighter f/1.7 lens, larger pixels and faster focus thanks to its new Dual-Pixel sensor. DxOMark, the camera benchmark authority has just named the Galaxy S7 edge as the new smartphone champion with an overall score of 88. This knocks out the Xperia Z5, which they previously crowned as the best camera on a smartphone.In the photo category, it shares the same spot alongside the Galaxy S6 edge and the Xperia Z5 at 88 points. According to DxOMark, the Galaxy S7 edge offers excellent exposure with good dynamic range for both indoor and outdoor shots. Autofocus is one of the S7 biggest traits with fast response and accuracy in bright and low light situations. White balance is said to be accurate without flash but it is noticeably warmer when paired with a tungsten light source. The video category is where the S7 edge overtakes the Xperia Z5 at 88 points. Video recordings offer good exposure, strong colours and great details. Stabilisation was handled well for minor handheld or walking motion. Of course, video stabilisation on the S7 edge is still no match for Sony’s SteadyShot with Intelligent active mode. We’ve done a quick camera comparison during MWC 2016 and you can see how it stacks up against the Galaxy S6 edge+, Xperia Z5, Nexus 6P and iPhone 6s Plus. Below is DxoMark Mobile’s current ranking.

If you’re planning to get one on contract, it is also available from the big 4 telcos (Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile) in Malaysia. So which offers the better deal? And should you also consider getting one with the Maxis Zerolution or Celcom NewPhone program? We’ve crunched the numbers, so read on for our Galaxy S7 edge price plan comparison.
Across the board, all telcos are offering 24-month contracts for the Galaxy S7 edge. The only exception is Celcom, with a shorter 12-month option for its higher FIRST Gold plan. With the ongoing postpaid price war, Celcom is the most competitive of the lot. Celcom’s FIRST Blue postpaid comes with 4GB of data at RM45/month, while the FIRST Gold plan packs 10GB for only RM80/month.For Digi, they are offering the Galaxy S7 edge with their new Postpaid plans that come in either More Internet or More Voice and SMS. The new plan offers RM20 off for those who sign up with their Postpaid 98, 148 and 238 (More Talk and SMS) plans before 30th June 2016. However, this offer isn’t applicable with the Galaxy S7 edge bundle. Fortunately, they are still giving extra 2GB data quota for its More Internet option. During registration, Digi also requires you to pay 1-month advance subscription on top of the device upfront payment. Alternatively, you can sign up for a 0% EPP via credit card to pay no cash upfront during registration. Maxis is still the most expensive option for postpaid contract. The entry level MaxisONE Plan 98 offers unlimited calls and SMS but it comes with just 1GB of data. It simply pales in comparison to Digi and Celcom that offers 10X more data for less. On the highest MaxisONE Plan 188, they are giving 1GB extra data for the first 6 months. U Mobile did stir up the competition with its Hero Postpaid plan. Unfortunately, you can only get the Galaxy S7 edge with their Ultimate Device Plan. The plan isn’t as value-for-money compared to Hero Postpaid but you do get a decent device subsidy as the S7 edge is being offered from as low as RM1,799. The upfront payment can be waived if you pay for the device via credit card and opt in for their auto debit billing service.Instead of getting the Galaxy S7 on Ultimate Device Plan 135, we think it is more worth it to buy the Galaxy S7 edge outright and sign on with their P70 Hero Plan. This comes out to RM4,779 (before GST) for a 24-month subscription (RM1,680) and the device (RM3,099).Are you the type that loves to switch phones every year? You might want to consider Maxis’ Zerolution or Celcom’s NewPhone. Both lets you own the device with monthly instalments and the option to swap to a newer phone every 12 months. Without Device Protection
With Device Protection
For the phone swap to work, you are required to return your existing device in pristine condition. So to avoid any possible penalties, the device protection program not only gives you a better peace of mind, but also ensures a seamless upgrade when the time comes. For Maxis, Zerolution lets you pick up a device with no upfront payment plus you have the freedom to opt out from the Zerolution upgrade. For example, if you do plan to keep the device, you can choose not to pay RM30/month for the Zerolution upgrade fee. On the downside, Zerolution is only available on its MaxisONE Plans which is quite costly. On Celcom’s NewPhone program, you have the flexibility to go with any Celcom postpaid plan of your choice including its affordable FIRST Blue postpaid plan. Unlike Maxis, you’re required to pay an upfront payment according to the plan (e.g. FIRST Blue – RM150, FIRST Gold – RM80). A downside to NewPhone is that they lump the monthly instalment and the “upgrade” fee together. So if you plan to keep your phone, there’s no option to opt out from the upgrade and you have to pay the same monthly instalment across 24 months. Another advantage for Celcom NewPhone is that you can switch phones earlier but there’s an Express NewPhone fee that can go as high as RM1,000. For the comparison above, we compare based on the assumption that you would make an upgrade after 12 months. Note that for the second year, it all depends on whether you will keep the same phone or switch to a newer device. If you do change to another smartphone, the instalment amount would be different. Before signing up, we recommend picking a plan that would fulfil your needs. You can study your current bill and data usage to get a better idea of how much you really need each month. Other factors to consider is the network coverage and quality in your area. Not all networks are built the same and the experience may vary depending on location. If you’re happy with your current provider, it might be a better idea to stick with them. As usual, if you spot any errors in the tables above, please do let us know in the comments below.

Rory Lee,Battle of the edges — S6 edge vs S7 edge vs S6 edge+,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/17/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-vs-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-vs-galaxy-s7-edge-malaysia-comparison/,"android,battle of the edges,best smartphone 2016,dual edge display,edge display,flagship smartphone,malaysia,phone comparison,samsung,samsung galaxy s6 edge,samsung galaxy s6 edge plus,samsung galaxy s7 edge,smartphone,smartphone comparison,mobile devices,mobile os",,2016-03-17,"Dual-edge displays are a magnificent thing to behold. They look utterly unique and gives everyday smartphone tasks a little pizzaz. It’s hard to put into words what the experience is like, it’s really something you should see for yourself.Sure, you could head to a Samsung store to play with one of the demo units, but from my experience, you fully appreciate the experience only once you start using it as your daily driver. If you’re keen, the only thing left to ask is: Which edge do you get?To date, Samsung has churned out four edge devices — the single edge Galaxy Note Edge, the Galaxy S6 edge, the Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Galaxy S7 edge. While the Note Edge did get the ball rolling, it didn’t have a dual-edge display and its edge functionality is slightly different from the dual-edge displays we know of today. It’s more of a one-of-a-kind smartphone.If we’re looking at dual-edge smartphones. the choice would then fall to the remaining three — the S6 edge, S6 edge+ and S7 edge — all of which are enticing choices.Logic would dictate that the latest S7 edge is the easy choice, being the latest and most powerful of the trio, but, people might take issue with the 5.5-inch panel on the S7 edge. They might, for instance, prefer the larger 5.7-inch S6 edge+ or even the smaller 5.1-inch S6 edge. But what are the trade-offs?On paper, the S7 edge definitely wins out here as it sports Samsung’s newest top-of-the-line octa-core chip in the Exynos 8890. Paired with 4GB of RAM and Android 6.0 Marshmallow and this device will zip through and remain snappy regardless of what you’re doing with the device.However, it’s not to say the other two are sluggish — Samsung’s 2015 flagships still pack a punch. Throughout our usage of both the S6 edge and S6 edge+, we didn’t encounter any problems with lag or stuttering going through daily tasks. It’s still a powerful device by today’s standards and will likely keep going strong for quite some time.Likely the biggest difference you’d notice is the heat under stress. The S6 edge and S6 edge+ gets noticeably hotter than the S7 edge though not to the extent where it gets uncomfortable.Here’s where the S7 edge nudges ahead of the other two devices too. It’s simply got a better camera, despite the drop in megapixels, as that 12MP Dual Pixel camera is one of the best smartphone snappers in the market right now.In addition to an awesome low-light performance, the camera on the S7 edge focuses incredibly quickly too — basically in the blink of an eye. That said, the S6 edge and S6 edge+ were renown for their excellent cameras. Everyone in the office was impressed with how good of an experience it is and that kind of quality doesn’t just disappear when a new camera comes out. The S6 edge duo are still very solid smartphone shooters."

You’ve seen the reviews. You’ve seen the camera comparisons. You’ve even seen the drop tests. And if you’ve coveted this device since its launch in February, now is your chance to get your hands on the brand new Samsung Galaxy S7 edge.Not only have Samsung Malaysia brought in the South Korean electronics giant’s newest flagship handset, they’ve brought along a familiar face as well. South Korean actor and entertainer Lee Kwang Soo posted a video recently about how he lost his smartphone and was seeking the help of locals to find it.Obviously, the missing device is none other than the Galaxy S7 edge, and that has brought the actor all the way to our shores in an attempt to locate the elusive smartphone. Our friend Najib, over at The Skop, had a much simpler solution to help Lee find his device, but it seems more drastic measures were required.If you haven’t lost your device and want to get your hands on a brand new Galaxy S7 edge, here’s a quick recap. The 5.5-inch device sports a beautiful Quad HD Super AMOLED dual-edge panel on the front with an Exynos 8890 octa-core processor mated with 4GB of RAM keeping everything running smoothly on the inside. For storage, the device comes with 32GB of internal storage but you have the option to expand that via a microSD card slot that occupies the second SIM slot on the hybrid dual SIM tray.It’s also water and dust resistant up to IP68 which should give you peace of mind but perhaps the most magnificent thing about the smartphone is its camera. On the front, you’ll find Samsung’s usual 5MP snapper, only this time with a faster and brighter f/1.7 aperture lens, but around back is where the magic happens.Mounted nearly flush to the back of the smartphone’s glass back is Samsung’s brand new 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera with the same fast f/1.7 aperture lens that is easily one of the best smartphone cameras right now. With the new Dual Pixel technology and the fast lens, the Galaxy S7 edge promises up to 95% brighter photos as well as an uber fast focusing speed.Inside, a 3,600 mAh battery gives the device juice allowing you to make full use of the Galaxy S7 edge’s new gaming enhanced features in the Game Launcher and Game Tools options. The Galaxy S7 edge will be available in all authorised Samsung retailers from 18 March onwards and will set you back at RM3,099. The smartphone will come in three colours — Black Onyx, Silver Titanium and Gold Platinum. The first 2,o00 customers to pick up the Galaxy S7 edge will receive a free Gear VR.If you’d like to find out more about the device, be sure to check out the following links:Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review

Samsung Galaxy S7 edge: The perfect smartphone?As well as our hands-on and first impressions video:"

Besides the phone launch, Samsung also revealed that two big things would hit our shores later this year — Samsung Pay and the Gear 360.Starting with Samsung Pay, the South Korean electronics giant revealed at their SEA Forum that the mobile payment service would be coming to Southeast Asian regions later in the year, but there was no indication of when exactly. Today, Samsung Head of Mobile and IT division Lee Jui Siang confirmed at the local launch of the Galaxy S7 edge that Samsung Pay was due to arrive in Malaysia in Q4 of 2016.It will be interesting to see how well this gets integrated into our payment services as well as what banks will be supported, but based on their ads, the payment service should work just about anywhere you can swipe your card which should mean a relatively easy implementation process.On to the Gear 360, Samsung has announced that the little 360-degree camera would be making its way to Malaysia later in Q2 of 2016. We got to check out the cute little golf ball camera back in MWC 2016 and were quite impressed with it.The little device takes full 360-degree video with the help of two 195-degree lenses mounted on the front and back of the device. The fields of view overlap so that there will be fewer problems during stitching. It comes with its own tripod but can be mounted on basically any standard tripod head.As if to tease us, Samsung also brought a Gear 360 to the launch of the event and discreetly mounted it in the middle of the venue on a tall tripod. The less keen of those might have missed it in the chaos of screaming fans.Either way, we’re looking forward to both the Gear 360 and Samsung Pay and we’ll keep you updated on any developments that crop up in the future."
Alexander Wong,Digi currently ranks #1 in coverage by OpenSignal but…,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/15/digi-currently-ranks-number-one-open-signal-malaysia/,"4g coverage,celcom,digi,digi 4g network,malaysia network quality,maxis,opensignal,opensignal malaysia,telco,u mobile,mobile apps,players on the field","Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Mobile Apps,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-03-15,"Towards the end of 2015, our Malaysian telcos have been fighting over who has the widest 4G coverage. If you think about it, it is like having a bunch of guys boasting about their own manhood. Everyone claims to have the longest but nobody can actually verify it. According to OpenSignal’s latest data updated on 11 March 2016, Digi currently has the widest coverage in Malaysia. So looks like it’s a win for team yellow as it claims to currently cover 72% population with 4G LTE. But is this really true?When you view the OpenSource website, you should see a map which plots the coverage areas of the telcos around you. To get a nationwide sample, you can key in Malaysia from the search bar. Malaysia Mobile Overall – 2G/3G/4G
If you enable all 2G, 3G and 4G, Digi is ranked #1, followed by U Mobile, Maxis and Celcom. If you look at speed alone, U Mobile does seem to offer the fastest speeds here which goes in line with its “fastest mobile network” title from Speedtest.net.Malaysia – 2G only
You probably thought Celcom would have the widest 2G network in the country but it isn’t, according to OpenSignal. When we toggle the map to 2G only, U Mobile suddenly ranks #1 while Maxis takes last position at #4. The funny thing is that U Mobile doesn’t even own a 2G network. For areas that are out of U Mobile’s coverage, it relies on Maxis 2G and 3G networks as part of their RAN sharing agreement. Malaysia – 4G only
For 4G only, Digi is ranked first, followed by Celcom then U Mobile and Maxis. U Mobile which doesn’t even cover East Malaysia is ranked higher than Maxis for coverage. Very odd indeed. So what does this tell us? Looking at the above, it seems that OpenSignal may not be entirely accurate for Malaysia at the time being. It collects mobile quality data from their OpenSignal app that’s available for Android and iOS. Even OpenSignal themselves urge you to install the app in order to improve the maps. Think about how many Malaysians have installed the app? Most of you would have use Speedtest.net instead.When OpenSignal published its State of LTE report, it was derived from a sample size of 325,221 users. Out of those numbers, we won’t know how many of them are from Malaysia. Having crowd source data is good but the report is only going to be as good as the sample size itself. So if you want to contribute to better stats on network quality, perhaps it is time to give OpenSignal a try. This could work if OpenSignal becomes as popular as crowdsourcing GPS app Waze in Malaysia.  We’ve said it a number of times before, all that widest coverage claims doesn’t matter to consumers when there are still areas with blackspots and poor mobile internet connectivity. What do you think? You can view the OpenSignal rankings for Malaysia over here.  Thanks @_ravind for the tip!"

As users tend to follow more instagram accounts by the day, it can get really cluttered. As a result, it is harder to keep up with posts that are more relevant to you. To tackle this better, Instagram in their official blog had announced that a new feed optimisation is on the way and you can see this in the coming months. According to them, your feed will be sorted based on what they think will matter to you. So you’re likely to see posts that are more relevant to your interest, relationship and time priotised ahead of everything else. Once implemented, they promise that all posts will be there, just that it will be displayed in a different order. So whenever you launch instagram, you should be seeing your favourite artist, friends and favourite foodpornstar pics first. In short, this means your instagram timeline will not be shown in chronological order which is pretty much like Facebook. Twitter recently has started to implement a similar algorithm but at least there’s an option to turn it off. Instagram says that they will take their time to get this right and they will be open for feedback along the way.   What do you think? Would you let instagram prioritise your feed or do you prefer to catch up in the current time-based order? [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

The first gen HTC One M7 had introduced its Ultrapixel camera that boasts better low light shots with larger 2-micron pixels. However picture clarity suffers with its low 4MP resolution. Their latest HTC One A9 was an improvement with a 13MP f/2.0 shooter and it gets assisted with OIS. For the new HTC 10 flagship, they are teasing better imaging with the power of 10.  World First, World Class, Front and Back. You’ll see. #powerof10 pic.twitter.com/qN9HN6OP5i— HTC (@htc) March 15, 2016The new teaser doesn’t show much but HTC is hinting that it will be a world first and a world class feature for both front and back cameras. As the industry begins to downsize on pixelcount and focus on pixel size, hopefully we get to see the next iteration of UltraPixel with improved image stabilisation. The competition has really up their game in recent years and HTC needs to beat the likes of the Galaxy S7 edge, iPhone 6s Plus, Lumia 950 XL and LG G4 if it wants to be considered world class in smartphone photography. As far as specs go, the HTC 10 has been rumoured to go for a compact 5.1″ Quad HD display. The rest of the specs are similar to a top-spec Xiaomi Mi 5 with a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. As seen in a couple of leaked shots, it will feature a front facing fingerprint scanner and home button combo along with 2 capacitive buttons. The boom sound stereo speakers is likely to be omitted and it will sport a reversible USB Type C port with Quick Charging. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Rory Lee,Maxis doubles up its worry-free Pay-Per-Use threshold to RM100/month,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/16/maxis-doubles-up-its-worry-free-pay-per-use-threshold-to-rm100month/,"internet,malaysian telco,maxis,maxis pay per use,mobile data,pay per use threshold,players on the field,roaming,smartphone","Maxis,Players on the Field",2016-03-16,"Making the switch to a postpaid plan can be a difficult decision. Although you gain freedom in usage without having to worry about running out of credits, there is a chance that when your bill arrives at the end of the month, you will be paying more than you’d expect.In the past, one of the biggest worries when switching to a postpaid plan was bill shock — the possibility of paying for something you thought you’d never use. Some horror stories have users rack up thousands of ringgit because of accidental data usage and roaming on the wrong network.To combat that, Maxis implemented a Pay-Per-Use format where it charged users who were using data on their smartphone without a data plan. This format charged users RM10 for every block of 50MB data that they would use up to a cap of RM50/month which works out to 250MB/month.After 250MB, users could continue surfing without any extra charge but at a throttled speed. However, on 14 January 2016, they quietly revised their Pay-Per-Use conditions to increase it to 10 blocks, meaning charges now cap at RM100/month — double the previous threshold.Maxis says that this is to improve user browsing experience, and that’s true to a certain extent since users get to use up to 500MB of unrestricted speeds, but that also means users would have to pay more per month if their usage exceeds 250MB. If you’d like to find out more about this, you can head on over to their FAQ page, or view your Pay-Per-Use stats via the MyMaxis App (Android/iOS).That said, it is a little silly to use your smartphone data these days without subscribing to an actual data plan. That means this Pay-Per-Use plan acts more like a safety net for those without a plan who accidentally turn on their data than someone who actually wants to surf. Since this is the case, I’d think that a lower cap would benefit users more since they would ultimately be paying less.What do you guys think?Thanks WeiKeong for the tip!"
Rory Lee,The Exynos-powered Galaxy S7 edge is faster than the Snapdragon 820 variant,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/16/the-exynos-powered-galaxy-s7-edge-is-faster-than-the-snapdragon-820-variant/,"exynos 8-octa,exynos 8890,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy s7 edge,smartphone,snapdragon 820,speed test,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-16,"Samsung launched two versions of their flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 edge — one powered by a Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and another running Samsung’s own Exynos 8890 octa-core chip.While the other internals like the RAM and storage remains the same, these two chips are quite different. The question then became: is one faster than the other?Well, according to this speed test video, the Exynos 8890 (White) unit is just a touch faster than the Snapdragon 820 (Gold) variant. It launches apps and returns to the home screen just a little bit faster than the SD820 unit, but not so much that it might be terribly noticeable in real world usage.For benchmarks, the Exynos 8890 unit also performs slightly better in the overall score. However, the breakdown does reveal that it falls behind quite significantly in terms of 3D GPU performance.This falls somewhat in line with a test ran earlier by PhoneArena where they pitted both devices against each other in a series of benchmarks. In PhoneArena’s test, the Snapdragon variant scored a higher average in both the overall AnTuTu benchmark as well as in the GPU-specific tests. However, the Exynos chip edged it out when it came to browsing benchmarks.It is worth noting that they ran the test on a Galaxy S7, not an S7 edge, but the end result should be fairly representative of the larger edge model as well.You can view their findings in the table below:From their tests, they concluded that the performance difference is nearly negligible as they are very comparable systems.Comparable in performance, perhaps, but what about things like battery life? Our review unit (Galaxy S7 edge) on moderate usage pulled out a measly 3 hours and 40 minutes of screen-on time, giving us about 17 and a half hours of time on battery. It’s a pretty big difference if you compare it to Dave2D’s review unit (Snapdragon 820) which gave him close to 6 hours of screen-on time with a day and a half on battery with moderate usage.Of course, that could be down to a number of reasons as well as what he deems moderate usage, but it beggars belief that he could pull out nearly double the SOT on similar usage.What do you guys think?[SOURCE, 2, VIA, 2]"

Their latest Xiaomi Mi 5 offers a lot of phone for your money and it costs about half of what the mainstream players are selling. The issue, of course, is availability and Xiaomi is struggling to keep up with demand even in their home ground in China. The Mi 5 flagship went on sale on 1st March and it would probably take months before they could start selling in Malaysia. If you can’t wait, you can get it now in Malaysia thanks to grey importer DirectD. Like any brand new imported smartphones, be prepared to pay a premium for this. The Mi 5 is offered at RM1,799 and this is for the lower spec model. It gets a lower clocked 1.8GHz Snapdragon 820 processor, 3GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. In China, this specific model is going for 1,999 CNY which is about RM1,255 with our current exchange rate. Despite its higher price tag, this is still the most affordable Snapdragon 820 powered smartphone you can buy right now and it’s cheaper than most 2015 flagships. In terms of official availability, there’s no visibility for the Malaysian market but the folks in India will be getting it as early as next month. Earlier this week, the Mi 5 has already gotten our Malaysian SIRIM approval but we reckon that will be released after the Redmi Note 3 launches in Malaysia in April.Want a cheaper alternative? The Mi 4S is also offered by DirectD at RM1,399. That comes with a 5″ Full HD screen, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB RAM and a larger 64GB of on-board storage that’s expandable with microSD.

At SXSW (South by Southwest) they pulled back the covers of yet another futuristic device that falls in line with the experience Sony are promoting with their hands-free Xperia Ear device — the Concept N headphones.Concept N is the child of Sony’s R&D arm Future Lab initiative — an arm tasked with showing off early prototypes of products and gathering feedback. On the surface, the N doesn’t look all too different or radical when compared to existing headphones from other manufacturers, but it does have a trick or two up its sleeve.The first thing you’ll notice is that they’re not connected to your ear and are designed to be worn around your neck. So how do you listen to music then? The N has a set of cleverly placed speakers designed to play music to your ears in a limited range around your head so you can also listen to your surroundings and have a proper conversation.We suspect that this wouldn’t be too great for sound quality if you’re mixing in a noisy background, but the folks at The Verge and Engadget seem pretty impressed with it. If you want a more quiet experience, though, Sony has a pair of “open-ear earphones” that go along with the N, letting you clip them on your ear for what we suspect would be a more private listening experience.Since these V-shaped earphones are open-ear though, you can still listen to your surroundings while your favourite track is on. The drivers are mounted at one end of the V, feeding audio to the other end of the V that goes in your ear, resulting in a slick minimalist design.That’s not all, Sony’s Concept N has a bunch of, although very limited, augmented-reality-esque features too — though not in the generic visual AR sense. Instead, the N responds to voice commands and can tell you useful stuff like the weather, local news updates and local restaurant information all with a simple trigger phrase “Listen up Arc!” before your command.What’s most impressive is that you can tell it to take a photo too.Once the command is inputted (or shouted, depending on how loud your surroundings are), the otherwise hidden camera mounted on the right edge of the neckband opens up and takes a photo before disappearing again. It eliminates one of the Google Glass’ biggest flaws when it comes to a wearable camera — people don’t feel like you’re always taking a photo/video of them.It’s an interesting device in the way it functions and brings aural AR into our lives giving me a very distinct Her vibe. Sony has always been one of the great pioneers of audio technology and it’s great to see them pull out something seriously cool.What do you think of the Concept N?

Ahead of its launch, the purported spec sheet has been leaked on Twitter and it will come in two sizes. The R9 is the smaller of the two with a sizable 5.5″ display that does Full HD resolution and it is only 6.6mm thin. On-board it gets an unspecified 64-bit Octa-Core processor with 4GB RAM and 64GB of on-board storage. In terms of design, the R9 has a iPhone-like appearance and it now comes with a front mounted fingerprint scanner that’s likely to double up as a home button. Powering the R9 is a 2,850mAh battery which is likely to retain the current VOOC charging technology that gives you 2 hours of talk time with a quick 5 minute charge.  The R9 Plus is a mammoth device, pretty much like the R7 Plus. It gets a large 6″ Full HD screen and it is juiced up by a large 4,120mAh battery. Under the hood, it runs on a Snapdragon 652 processor, which is similar as the Redmi Note 3 (international) but it gets 8 cores instead of 6. It is also mated with 4GB of RAM and there’s a choice of either 64GB or 128GB of storage. With a larger battery, the R9 Plus is thicker at 7.7mm and it weighs 185grams. In the imaging department, both R9 and R9 Plus will sport a 16MP front camera for higher resolution selfies. For the rear, the R9 gets a 13MP camera while the R9 Plus gets a 16MP unit. Yup, the R9 has a higher pixelcount camera at the front than its main camera. Both models are listed to be running on ColorOS 3.0 and we hope that it comes with at least Android 6.0 Marshmallow underneath. According to OPPO Malaysia, the new R9 series will be available a month later, which is sometime in mid-April. Colour wise, expect the R9 to come in Gold and Rose Gold. As mentioned previously, OPPO has yet to release a proper flagship device since the Find 7. While it isn’t the “Find 9” that we’re looking for, the Snapdragon 652 processor with 4GB of RAM should put this on par against other high-end phablet contenders. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

That’s 8GB more and yet they have maintained the same subscription fee.From what we can gather, the new postpaid promo will take effect tomorrow, 15th March and the 8GB extra data will be offered until 30th June 2016. So essentially you’re getting the extra data for about 3 and a half month before it goes back to the existing 7GB offering. This will be applicable to all current and new Hero P70 postpaid customers.

U Mobile has updated their website with the latest Hero Postpaid promo. The full 15GB internet can be used all day and there’s no offpeak or  “basic internet” quotas involved. The extra 8GB quota can also be shared on Hero Postpaid Plus. As mentioned before, this extra 8GB promo is only applicable between 15 March until 30 June, so that’s 3.5 months to enjoy more data before it returns back to the usual 7GB per month internet + unlimited calls for all customers.

When devastating flood hits, staying connected can be impossible for many as telecommunication systems go down due to damage or lack of power supply.To be better prepared for the next monsoon season, Ogilvy & Mather has created a backup network service for Maxis that’s called the S.O.S Network. These little black boxes will reconnect people when their main network goes down. Ogilvy & Mather – Maxis SOS Campaign from Work that works on Vimeo.To deploy the S.O.S network, they will place these weatherproof boxes on rooftops of buildings that will create a mesh network using WiFi. They are powered by built-in batteries that can last for a week and it can be recharged using solar, generators or car batteries. According to the video, the SOS network will work on any phone and on any carrier with no app required. Just switch on your WiFi and connect to MaxisSOS to reconnect to the outside world. At first glance, it looks like an award submission video but if this works, it can be a lifesaving solution. The SOS Network is currently deployed at Kuala Krai covering an area of 8.4 sq km and it will be extended to other areas if needed. MCMC has earlier released a list of tips of staying connected during floods. Those affected are advised to restrict communication to essential use and to switch to lighter forms of communication such as SMS instead of voice calls.  [ SOURCE 2 VIA ]"

At first, because it looked so much like their 2015 flagship devices, but later because of how amazing these devices were as smartphones.If perfection is something simply doing what it’s supposed to do flawlessly, then the Galaxy S7 edge that I have on review is a real contender. It has monster specs, an incredible build, a fantastic camera and the latest version of Android.Performance is absolutely buttery and for a glass-backed device, it’s really nice to hold in the hand, much nicer than something like the Galaxy S6 edge+. However, the most impressive thing is that camera which is probably one of, if not the best, smartphone camera right now.As perfect as the Galaxy S7 edge is as a smartphone, it simply isn’t a device I’d buy for myself — and there’s a very good reason for that."
Rory Lee,Is Samsung planning to kill the iPhone SE with the Galaxy S7 mini?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/15/is-samsung-planning-to-kill-the-iphone-se-with-the-galaxy-s7-mini/,"android,ios,iphone se,rumour mill,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy s7 edge,samsung galaxy s7 mini,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2016-03-15,"Remember the Apple iPhone SE? Well, it looks like it might have an Android challenger coming out of South Korean electronics giant Samsung, as rumours begin to sprout about a potential Galaxy S7 mini that packs a punch.The alleged 4.6-inch device from Samsung is rumoured to make an appearance with a set of fantastic features. And it would have to if it wants to take on the Apple A9 powered iPhone SE.According to the rumour mill, the upcoming mini flagship is said to pack either a Snapdragon 820 or an Exynos 8890 processor, and 3GB of RAM on the inside. There is currently no information on the internal storage but judging by the processor and RAM alone, the device is looking like a worthy challenger. The only drawback, it seems, would be the 1280×720 pixel display said to adorn the front of the smartphone. But, since it’s less than 5 inches, the pixel density should still be relatively high.What’s more, the S7 mini is said to sport a 12-megapixel primary camera packed into a smartphone package that is only 9.9mm thin. Based on the megapixel count, it looks like it could be the same Dual Pixel sensor found on the regular Galaxy S7 and S7 edge that we love so much.It’s not entirely surprising if Samsung does come up with a mini variant as they’ve done so in the past. One of the biggest problems with old the Galaxy S mini variants was that they always came with watered down specs. That’s kind of a bummer especially since they bore the Galaxy S flagship badge.The one company that really gets the “compact” or “mini” flagship variants right has been Sony, who packed the same flagship components into a smaller form factor. If these rumours prove true, that could mean Samsung are finally picking up on this trend. But, this also means it becomes a direct competitor for Sony’s Xperia Z5 Compact too.But, we don’t think that’s too fair of a comparison if we’re going off these rumoured specs as the S7 mini simply blows the Xperia Z5 Compact out of the water. The real battle royale would be with the iPhone and with the S7 mini’s price likely to be lower, this could prove to be an interesting fight.This is of course if these rumours prove true, which we can’t know for certain right now, so do take what we say here with a grain of salt.[SOURCE, VIA]"

It gets a bigger battery, support microSD expansion, better camera and dust/water resistance as well. To find out what makes it tick on the inside, ifixit has teardown a unit for your viewing pleasure. While physically it looks similar to the previous version, the new Galaxy S7 is actually harder to repair with a repairability score of just 3/10. As comparison, the Galaxy S6 scored 4/10, while the S6 edge scored just 3/10. The Galaxy S7 like its former model use glass for front and back. There are no screws so you’ll need to remove the back panel that’s secured with glue. The internals are easily replaceable with its modular components including the battery, cameras and the headphone jack. With Galaxy S7 having IP68 water resistance, it has rubber linings to keep water out from its internals.  For longer gameplay without overheating, they have also taken a closer look at the S7’s liquid cooling. The thin copper strip is less than a milimetre thick and weighs less than half a gram. In another video, cutting this copper strip reveals no visible liquid inside, but it does dissipate heat to its outer frame. Overall, ifixit found the S7 to be a tougher device to fix. Despite its modular components, the display needs to be removed if you need to replace the microUSB port. Since it uses glass for both sides, it is more prone to cracks if you were to drop the device. Another challenge is that it’s almost impossible to replace the front glass without destroying the actual display. While the device looks good, we suggest that you invest in a case or take up a device protection program that covers damages and theft. Since we are getting only the S7 edge in Malaysia, we can only assume that it could be harder to repair than this.   [ SOURCE, VIA ]"
Rory Lee,Apple’s iPhone SE looks almost identical to the iPhone 5S,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/10/apples-iphone-se-looks-almost-identical-to-the-iphone-5s/,"apple,apple 4-inch iphone,apple iphone,apple iphone 5se,apple iphone 6c,apple iphone se,ios,render,smartphone,spigen,mobile devices,mobile os,rumour mill","Apple,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-03-10,"Rumours have been floating around that Apple was going to launch a 4-inch iPhone during the first half of the year. What the device is supposed to be called has changed following each subsequent leak but it looks everyone has settled with calling it the iPhone SE.Allegedly, the handset is said to feature a best-of-both-worlds design, pairing the gorgeous looks of the iPhone 5S with the rounded front display of the iPhone 6/6S. How that will actually turn out remains to be seen, but thanks to MacRumours, it looks like we have what could be a solid glimpse at how the device will look like.MacRumours have obtained renders from popular case manufacturer Spigen for their iPhone SE cases. Based on the renders, the device does indeed look identical to that of the iPhone 5S with almost no traces of the rounded front display that was suggested.This is, of course, due to a few reasons. The first is that these are merely renders, not official images so the final product could turn out to be slightly different. In fact, if we’re going off the renders, Spigen has left some minor room for error in the case renders like space to include a potential camera hump in the back (which was rumoured) and since the case wraps around the front of the device, we can’t really tell if there is a curved glass panel on top of the display.Either way, these are merely rumours so don’t take them as fact — especially since they’re not on Spigen’s website. That said, Spigen has been fairly accurate in previous case render leaks so there is a fair chance that the iPhone SE will bear a striking resemblance to the smartphone in these renders.In terms of specs, the iPhone SE is said to come in at a small 4-inches which should appeal to those looking for a smaller device. It’s no slouch though as rumours indicate that the smartphone could be packing a top-of-the-line A9 chip which should give it more than enough horsepower to keep everything running smoothly.[SOURCE]"

While the actual launch date is still up in the air, here’s a clearer leak of the HTC 10. As seen on the earlier renders, the front gets a HTC One A9-like design that has a fingerprint scanner underneath the screen. Interestingly there are capacitive buttons for Back and Recent app accompanying the home button, which we think is a good move. The current HTC smartphones including the HTC One A9 and One M9+ use purely on-screen buttons along with its fingerprint scanner. Of course, some would definitely point out that this is starting to look a lot like a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. Surrounding the device is a metal frame that’s visible from the front, which is somewhat similar to the Nexus 6P. The back of the device is where the HTC 10 stands out. It gets a curve back with a polished chamfered edge. If we take a look at the camera module, it seems to protrude a bit, while next to it appears to be a dual-tone LED flash and possibly a laser AutoFocus light. According to @evleaks, the HTC 10 will come in 4 colour options – namely carbon gray, glacier silver (with either black or white coloured front) and topaz gold. There’s still no mention of an official launch but it could be after the Galaxy S7 fever starts to fizzle out. Huawei will be announcing its P9 flagship next month on 6 April.[ SOURCE 2, VIA ]"

When we first saw it at MWC 2016, we couldn’t wait to get our hands on the device. Well, after a long (it wasn’t that long, but it felt long) wait, it finally came…and I pounced on it.The unboxing experience was reasonable. Samsung was never one to have elaborate unboxing experiences for their flagships, often defaulting to a generic small box you could fit in a clutch. This one was a little different, though.In terms of dimensions, the box is pretty much the same size as last year’s flagship boxes but this time instead of pulling the lid off, you unwrapped the lip of the box and watch as it rolls out to reveal the phone tucked neatly in its tray.Underneath is business as usual where you have a box with the SIM tool and the relevant paperwork separating the phone tray and the accessories that come with it.Speaking of the accessories, the Galaxy S7 doesn’t come with a whole lot of kit compared to something like the Huawei Mate 8. It’s got a pair of in-ear headphones set in a tinted box, a charging cable, a power brick and a USB OTG adapter. The power brick is Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging brick that supports two voltages with different amps — either 9V, 1.67A or 5V, 2.0A.Setting up the device was the usual affair but the included USB OTG adapter does let you access a nifty Samsung feature: Smart Switch.Or at least it should, but for some reason, the Galaxy S7 edge didn’t recognise the HTC One A9 I was copying information over from. Instead, it repeatedly reminded me that the connected smartphone needed to be “Android 4.3 and above” which is weird because the One A9 is already on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.If you’re unfamiliar with Smart Switch, it’s basically an application that lets you copy your files — apps, contacts, data, etc — over from your existing device to your new Galaxy smartphone, or in this case, the Galaxy S7 edge. Despite the fact that we couldn’t transfer the files via cable, Smart Switch supports wireless transfer as well. Odd.Simply install the app on your old device (for a list of compatible platforms head on over here) and choose the stuff you want to transfer, then hit send. It will take awhile depending on how much information you want to transfer. Though it did take only about 10 minutes to copy files over wirelessly, we reckon a wired transfer should be faster.My first impressions of the device? It feels awesome for a glass-backed device. The rounded back really helps with grip and somehow Samsung has made the glass and metal seam even more flush than before. The camera feels excellent and focuses almost as quickly as my eye can, plus the overall performance of the device is just really, really snappy.Is it the perfect smartphone? I guess you’ll have to wait for our full review to find out. If you’d like to see more unboxing and device photos, be sure to check out our album on Facebook."
Alexander Wong,Huawei P9 to launch on 6 April,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/09/huawei-p9-to-launch-on-6-april/,"#00,#oo,android,dual camera,huawei,huawei p9,huawei p9 launch,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-03-09,"If the Huawei Mate 8 is too big for your liking, here’s something else to look forward to. Huawei now has a date for its P9 flagship smartphone and it’s happening on 6 April in London. This replaces the Huawei P8 that marks the beginning of its premium metal build smartphones. We’ve seen how Huawei has stepped up their game with the Huawei Mate S and Mate 8, so it is interesting to see what they will do next.  In the official invite above, there’s a #00 at the top with a line that says “change the way you see the world”. This could hint its new dual-camera set up which we’ve seen in photos from @evleaks. Remember the honor 6 plus? That came with dual-camera set up that provides extra bokeh effects and the ability to shoot higher-resolution photos by combining images taken from both cameras. Other brands that have tried dual-cameras include HTC and most recently LG with its new G5.Apart from making high-end devices, Huawei wants to reinvent smartphone photography by teaming up with Leica. That’s quite a bold move considering established players like Samsung and Microsoft’s Lumia (with its PureView) have raised the bar tremendously. So what can we expect? Like the P8, there will be couple of variants including a standard, Lite and perhaps a Max version. Under the hood, Huawei should be using their in-house developed Kirin 950 processor that offers a balance of both performance and frugal battery life. Looking at how competitively priced the Mate 8 is, you can expect the P9 to undercut other mainstream brands. We’ll find out for sure a month from now. [ SOURCE 2 3 ]"

For our local market, OPPO Malaysia has confirmed that it will arrive on our shores in April after its Chinese debut. From the teaser, it appears that it will be available in two colours – Gold and Rose Gold. In typical OPPO fashion, the R9 will be launched with ambassadors such as Yang Mi and Li YiFeng as shown in the video above. For Malaysia, we could get a local ambassador like Nora Danish being the face of OPPO F1.In terms of specs, its TENAA listing suggests that the R9 will be yet another mid-range smartphone. Similar to the R7 series, we can expect a standard R9 with a 5.5″ screen and a larger 6″ R9 Plus. The processor is said to be a 1.9GHz Octa-Core unit with 4GB RAM and at least, 32GB of storage. It is definitely not a flagship but it is a step up from its current R7 series. During MWC 2016 they have revealed 2 new features – a super VOOC fast charging and a smart image sensor with 3-axis stabilisation. For the OPPO R9, we expect them to retain the current VOOC feature but there’s a chance that it will carry its latest image stabilisation technology. It is rumoured to sport 16MP cameras for both front and back."

It is available now and even non-developers can give it a try. The name isn’t confirmed yet but we have a hunch that it could be called Nutella. Some of the notable features including a native split-screen which lets you run 2 apps side by side. This is similar to Samsung’s Multi-Window mode but it appears to be better integrated on the recent apps interface. There are also other subtle changes in Quick Settings and Notifications which improves usability. Doze mode is also improved further to squeeze more battery juice when the screen is asleep. Android N Preview is now available for Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Nexus 9 and Pixel C. Nexus 5 is said to be supported later on. If you want to give this a try, it is best to use it on a spare device instead of your daily driver. Being an early release, it is still buggy and you may face random crashes, unexpected behaviour and stability issues that will be sorted out in the coming updates. The best part is that you can get Android N via an OTA (Over the air) download. So that means no flashing required and you can upgrade without losing your personal files on the phone. If you’re aware of the potential bugs and still up for it, you can sign up for the Beta program here.So what is N? Nutella? or something else? [ SOURCE 2 VIA ]"

Computers back then were bulky with huge CRT monitors hooked up to desktop or tower boxes. If you could remember those things, you are likely to have experience dial-up using Jaring or TMnet.With the current generation of touch-enabled and wireless devices, many teenagers wouldn’t know how it’s like to go online back in the days. If you think it isn’t really a big difference, check out how these teens react to a machine from 20 years ago.They used a classic Pentium computer clocked at 133MHz and it comes with 32MB of RAM. Our current smartphones today have better specs than that. Unlike the current PCs with Windows 8 or Windows 10, starting up a computer back then can really take a long time.Before there was fibre or ADSL, most people rely on the good old dial-up modem. With download speeds of 14.4Kbps to 28.8Kbps (before 56K modems), it could take minutes to load a heavy web page and that’s slower than the throttle speeds you get today when you finish your mobile data quota. Remember the “It’s now safe to turn off your computer” message? Even shutting down a PC was a manual process as you would need to switch off the machine manually. That was before ATX power supplies became mainstream. [ VIA ]"

It just so happens that it is also International Women’s Day and they have also announced the Huawei Watch for the ladies. The watches come with rose gold case and the elegant variant adds more bling with Swarovski Zirconia that claims to be as brilliant as diamond. Essentially there are similar with the original Huawei Watch, with a 1.4″ OLED display doing 400×400 underneath a sapphire glass. Another minor difference is that these versions are slightly wider at 44mm from the usual 42mm. The most expensive of the two is the Jewel version with 68 Swarovski crystals lined up along the bezels. The Elegant is the more affordable alternative but it gets unique etched patterns around the edge. By default both models come with a genuine leather strap which is user replaceable.Since it runs on Android Wear, it will be compatible for both Android and iOS devices.

At one corner, you have the iPad Pro, the largest from Cupertino with a 12.9″ screen, four-speaker set-up, an optional keyboard cover and a stylus that’s called the pencil. On the other camp, you have the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 that’s their thinnest and lightest.During the launch of the Huawei Mate 8, they have also announced the MediaPad M2 10.0 and it isn’t just a bigger version of the MediaPad M2 8.0. If you’re looking for a tablet to consume your iflix and Netflix shows, this could be your cup of tea.Like the name suggests, this is a 10″ tablet (10.1″ to be exact) with a wide 16:10 display aspect ratio. The screen does 1920×1200 resolution which gives a pixel density of 224 PPI (pixels per inch). The design is nothing to shout about but it gets a metal back like most of its unibody smartphones. At the front of the M2 10.0, there’s a fingerprint scanner that unlocks on a single tap. While it looks like a Samsung tablet, there are no capacitive keys on either side, as it uses on-screen buttons. You can, however, access the back and recent apps from the fingerprint scanner by swiping either to the left or right which isn’t as intuitive. The fingerprint unlock is super quick but setting it up require more fingerprint taps than usual. As an “M-series” tablet, this is a multimedia-centric device. Unlike the smaller M2 8.0, this doesn’t have two but a total of four speakers (2 treble + 2 bass) enhanced by harman kardon. The speaker grills are located at the top and bottom, and the audio is output is actually quite impressive for video and music playback.On the inside, the MediaPad M2 10.0 runs on a Kirin 930 processor with either 2GB or 3GB RAM. It also comes with a choice of either 16GB or 64GB of storage but you can still expand it further with microSD. WiFi and 4G LTE variants are also available too depending on spec levels. For those who wish to sketch, the tablet is also available with a stylus that’s called the M-Pen. It boasts 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity which is the same as the Galaxy Note5 S Pen and double of a Surface Pen with the latest Surface Pro 4. The M-Pen is like a typical ball-point clip pen and it feels just right. There are two buttons on the side – one for selection and another for eraser. At the other end of the M-Pen is a metal clip which helps to secure itself in a shirt pocket. In case you need to take a picture with it, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 main camera that comes with a flash light. For selfies and skype videos, it gets a 5MP front shooter. The MediaPad M2 comes with a 6,660mAh battery and it still maintains a respectable 7.35mm thickness while weighing about half a kilogram. It feels bulkier than a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 but the four-speaker set up will definitely be appreciated for watching videos on demand.This multimedia oriented tablet is heading for Malaysia in late April 2016 and it will be sold in the following 4 options:
Silver: 2GB RAM+16GB storage, WiFi – RM1,299
Silver: 2GB RAM+16GB storage, LTE + M-Pen – RM1,599
Gold: 3GB RAM+64GB storage, WiFi + M-Pen + Case – RM1,699
Gold: 3GB RAM+64GB storage, LTE + M-Pen + Case – RM1,999"

Even with its entry-level price tag, it gets some uprated refinements including a smooth 2.5D glass at the front.The LEAGOO Alfa 2 has a 5″ HD 720p screen and it runs on a 1.3GHz Quad-Core Mediatek processor. On-board it gets 1GB of RAM and has 16GB of storage that can be expanded further with microSD. The rear cover is removable but it only gives you access to its dual-SIM and microSD slots as the 2,600mAh battery is non-removable. In terms of connectivity, it supports dual-SIMs up to 3G only. The device has the typical 3 capacitive buttons upfront and the home key doubles up as a notification light. Its photography credentials are quite impressive for this price range. The back gets a 13MP Sony Sensor with dual-tone LED flash, while the front gets a 5MP shooter that also has its own flash light for better-lit selfies. The neat party trick is a touchpad that’s called the Ion Smart Touch located just underneath the camera. This is somewhat similar to the O-Touch panel on the OPPO N1. It recognises taps, swipes and long presses, allowing you to interact the device easier with a single hand. The touch pad allows you to take photos, double tap to wake and to scroll around image galleries by swiping from either left or right. The build is pretty decent for a budget device and it looks quite similar to OPPO’s R7 Lite especially in its gold colour version. Overall it weighs 140 grams and has a thickness of 7.5mm. The Alfa 2 is priced at RM449 and it is available with a choice of 4 colours – dark blue, white, gold and pink. Out of the box, it currently runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop.

After its global debut during MWC 2016, the flagship smartphone had gone on sale in China and the folks in India will be getting it sometime next month. Now back in Malaysia a new Xiaomi device has just gotten the SIRIM greenlight carrying the model number 2015105 and it is newer than the Redmi Note 3. Could this be the Mi 5? Looking at the listing, the said device supports dual-SIMs, 4G LTE and faster 802.11 ac WiFi. The biggest indication that this would be the Mi 5 is that it supports NFC, a feature that was absent after the Xiaomi Mi 3. To recap on the specs, it gets a 5.15″ Full HD display and it runs on a Snapdragon 820 processor that’s clocked at 1.8GHz or 2.15GHz depending on variant and with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. Performance should be top notch as it uses a faster LPDDR4 RAM and UFS 2.0 flash storage, which are similar to Samsung’s recent flagships. In terms of design it looks like the Mi Note as it gets a 3D curved glass back but this time it curves smoothly into the metal frame. For imaging, it gets a 16MP f/2.0 Sony IMX298 camera with 4-axis optical image stabilisation. Meanwhile, the front retains the same 4MP “Ultrapixel” from the Mi Note for selfies. For the first time for a Xiaomi, it features a front mounted fingerprint scanner and they have managed to do so while maintain a compact front appearance. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh non-removable battery and it charges up quickly with a reversible USB Type C port. In China the Mi 5 is priced from 1,999 CNY (about RM1,295) for the base 3GB RAM + 32GB storage model and it goes all the way up to 2,699 CNY (about RM1,750) for its 4GB RAM + 128GB storage variant with a 3D ceramic back. The question is when is it coming? We feel that Xiaomi will first release the international Redmi Note 3 in Malaysia next month and we probably need to wait a couple of months for the Mi 5 to arrive. Thanks @Piratz for the tip!"

For less than RM3,000, that’s a pretty good deal considering it retails originally for RM3,199. A few days later, he had a shocking discovery as he opened the brand new box.Instead of a gold iPhone 6s, the box contained nothing but a padlock strapped in the middle as shown above. Obviously angry and frustrated, he shared his situation on Facebook which has garnered over 2,500 shares so far. The surprising part is the box looks legit with a full shrink-wrap and there’s even a Brightstar Distribution label at the back. How on earth did an iPhone in a sealed box turn into a padlock? Something must have happened between the distribution and the delivery. Fortunately, the folks at 11street had responded within 24 hours and they wasted no time to arrange a replacement unit. 11street says that they take fraud cases very seriously and this is obviously a criminal offence. To protect buyers, they have an ESCROW system in place where it will not release payment to the seller until the buyer is fully satisfied with their purchase. Being happy with the recovery, the affected customer had placed another iPhone 6s order from the same seller. As for the padlock, it has been returned for further police investigation.

These high end devices don’t come cheap and for bargain hunters, you probably need to compromise on some features if you don’t have a huge budget.What if there’s a way to get a smartphone with “flagship” class features without burning a hole in your pocket? That’s where the honor 5X comes in and it does look the part too. It has a metal body, a fairly large screen with great resolution and a fingerprint scanner works brilliantly well.Here are 5 reasons why the honor 5X should be your top pick under RM1,000.An affordable phone doesn’t have to feel cheap. With the honor 5X, it gets a premium look and feel with its unibody metal body. It isn’t just any metal slab as it gets a diamond polished aluminium back with a brushed look. While this is a mid-range device, it does look like a more expensive smartphone. With the worldwide web and social timeline in your hands, the honor 5X has a large 5.5” display with Full HD resolution. The screen size is similar to the iPhone 6s Plus but it is more compact to hold with thinner bezels and reduced height. With an IPS panel, you get great colour reproduction and viewing angles under a fully laminated screen. Get security that’s convenient to set up and use. Like the honor 7, the honor 5X comes with a rear mounted fingerprint scanner that’s easy to set up with just 6 taps. Unlocking the phone from your pocket is done instantly in just 0.5 seconds. It just unlocks with a gentle tap on the sensor. The fingerprint sensor also lets you do more such as taking photos including selfies, swiping down to view notification and view all running apps by swiping up. Micro-SIM, Nano-SIM or MicroSD card, the honor 5X fits them all. With a dedicated slot for MicroSD, there’s no compromise if you’re currently a dual-SIM user.

A company that once dominate the Android segment with stunning build quality and sleek UI. Without a compelling device to fend off its competition, the next flagship is critical to turn its fortunes around. Thanks to a friendly twitter faceoff between leaksters @evleaks and @onleaks, we have gotten a better picture of the next One. If you’re expecting it to be a HTC One M10, guess what? Having enough of “Ones”, the Taiwanese smartphone maker have leaped forward with the HTC 10.With regards to the name, it is surprising that HTC had dropped the “One” monicker that’s usually associated with its flagship line up. The model name was confirmed by a screenshot of the device which both leakster have approved. In terms of design, the 10 looks like a mashup of the HTC One M7/M8/M9 series and the latest HTC One A9.Over at the back, it gets a curved back with a matte metal looking surface which reminds us of the original HTC One M7. In terms of audio, it doesn’t seem to have a pair of front facing speakers, opting for a traditional down firing speaker grill like the current One A9. There is however, a BoomSound option under settings but this is likely to be an audio enhancement rather than an actual stereo speaker. As confirmed by the image above, it uses USB Type-C that’s reversible. Under the hood, the HTC 10 is said to be running on a Snapdragon 820 processor with probably 4GB of RAM. Preliminary benchmarks have shown 109K on Antutu which is lower than the similar-spec Xiaomi Mi 5’s 142K score. Of course, these are pre-release figures and it could do better in production units.There’s no date yet for the HTC 10 but it should be close judging by the #Powerof10 teasers.[ SOURCE 2 3 ]"

As demand for power on the go grows, the Chinese company has managed to make their power banks smaller and lighter. With USB Type-C becoming a new standard, they have just announced a new 10,000mAh power bank that comes with the new reversible port. At 12.58mm thin, it is almost as compact as their current 5,000mAh ultra-slim unit (9.9mm).Dubbed as the Mi Powerbank Pro, this isn’t just your regular powerbank to charge up your phone and tablets. It gets a couple of tricks including a fast charge with an 18W power source that replenishes the powerbank fully in 3 hours and 30 minutes. As a comparison, a standard 5V/2A charger will take about 6 hours to charge to 100%. Having trouble charging wearables with a powerbank? For smaller devices like the Mi Band and bluetooth headsets, you can set it to charge at low voltage mode by double tapping on the power button. In case you’re wondering, you can also charge up a USB Type-C enabled MacBook with this powerbank. The Mi Powerbank Pro is rated to charge a 3,000mAH Mi Note for 2.5 times, an iPhone 6 for 4 times or an iPad mini for 1.5 times. Like its other popular Mi Powerbanks, it gets a 9 layer protection system for safer charging and discharging with up to 93% conversion rate. While this is thinner than the current 10,000mAh powerbank, it is actually heavier at 223g (Current 10,000mAh powerbank: 207g). In China, it is priced at 149 CNY, which is about RM93 currently. For the same price, you can get the 20,000mAh that comes with 2x full USB ports. Meanwhile, the 16,000mAh powerbank is cheaper at 129 CNY (Malaysia Mi Store: RM89). The Mi PowerBank Pro is available only in China and hopefully they will bring this to other markets later this year. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Sponsored,Drive Less and Earn More with Grab,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/08/drive-less-and-earn-more-with-grab/,"#2kerja,apply to be grabcar driver,extra income,grab,grab driver,grab incentive,grabcar,grabcar driver,grabcar incentive,private driver,sponsored,others","Others,Sponsored",2016-03-08,"This post is brought to you by Grab –  Let your spare time to pay for your needs and heart’s desiresThe past year has not been easy on Malaysians and their wallets. With the onset of taxes, removal of subsidies and instability of workforce management, stretching your dollar is just not the same anymore, especially when you desire the little pleasures in life like a new car or a well deserved holiday. And sure, there is a variety of second or part-time jobs out there to help you attain them easily, but let’s face it! Having a second or part-time job requires a certain type of dedication and commitment that perhaps not many are in the position to do so for various reasons such as inflexibility of the current or part-time jobs.  But this is where Grab plays a role. Not just poised to providing a safer and alternative option of transport, GrabCar, which is available on the Grab App (formerly known as MyTeksi), offers a flexible and viable option for those who want to earn some serious money without minimal time commitment, something which other ride-sharing app platforms just cannot provide.So how does it work, you may ask…Pretty easy actually. 
With the updated Grab incentive, the focus is not on the hours behind the wheel, but on how many jobs are completed. For example, on normal weekdays (Mon – Thurs) you only need to accept one job while on the way to work and two after. With the minimum fare of RM7 per job, you will already hit tier 4 target and receive a bonus incentive which rounds each job to RM16, making your daily earnings RM48. Next, on weekends (Fri – Sun), you accept five to six jobs a day with the same minimum fare of RM7 and with each job rounded up to RM16, your daily earning is between RM90 to RM96. 
Yes, we are aware you have limited spare time but with just 14 hours a week (that’s as low as 2 hours a day!) you can take home a minimum of RM1,792 guaranteed gross income per month.*But what can you possibly do with RM1,792?So let’s break it down further. With this amount, you can easily pay for:
1. Monthly installments for a new Mazda 3 2.0 SkyActiv Sedan GL or a top-line Honda HR-V
2. Monthly rental at condos such as Neo Damansara or Fahrenheit 88, Bukit Bintang (and places like these are usually in demand for transport), or
3. A brand new iPhone 6s or Samsung S7 Edge within two months, or
4. A trip to Bali or Bangkok every month!
Your possibilities are endless just by sitting in your car for a few hours a day while listening to your favourite music and meeting new people. In fact, here are a few tips to consider to earn more!1. Target high demand areas during bonus hours
Bonus Hours, which usually coincides with office rush hours, are when Grab guarantees the minimum fare earned, therefore, you can definitely earn more with a lesser drive time. 
2. Minimize your cost
Another tip to maximize your earnings is by reducing your cost. Since it is now cheaper to fill your tank with petrol than to enjoy a glass of milo ais at your nearest mamak, best to make full use of it now!3. Refer your friends and family
Want in on a good deal to make more money? Get your friends and family to sign-up as well and you could earn up to RM175 per referral. Moreover, if your referral signs up between 1 – 31 March 2016, you will stand a chance to drive away a Nissan Almera worth RM69,800 (including insurance and tax)!** 1. Attend GrabCar Express Sign-up Day 
Date: March 13, 2016 (Sunday)
Venue: Bukit Damansara Community Centre
Time: 10am to 6pm
All you need is your NRIC, a valid driving license and a cover note for your car insurance. Grab will also give you RM50 for signing up on this particular day only!

It isn’t the most budget-friendly smartphone, it isn’t the most powerful device, nor is it a great value buy.So, what is this confused little device from the OPPO?As far as I can tell, the F1 is a reasonable smartphone in both build and performance. It’s fairly good looking too if you’re into this kind of look, and it comes in at a manageable 5-inches — something that should delight many who are sick of phablets.Performance is decent, but I do take issue with OPPO’s decision to call this a “Selfie Expert”. Nevertheless, I don’t think that its marketing title is this smartphone’s biggest problem."

This replaces the Ascend Mate 7 phablet that was one of their first devices to feature a fingerprint scanner back in 2014. With an aspiration to take on the big boys, the Mate 8 is targeting the high-end market with premium design and compelling hardware. Like the former Mate 7, it still gets a 6″ Full HD IPS-NEO display that does a pixel density of 386ppi and toughens with Gorilla Glass 4. Powering this metal unibody phablet is their top of the line Octa-Core 2.3GHz  Kirin 950 processor that’s accompanied by a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU. Like before, there will be 2 variants available. A standard version comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, while the premium variant comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. To differentiate the two, the standard version gets Space Grey and Moonlight Silver colours, while the Champagne Gold and Mocha Brown option is exclusive to the Premium edition.  In terms of optics, the Mate 8 rear camera uses a Sony IMX298 16MP Sensor similar to the Xiaomi Mi 5. It is further assisted with OIS, dual-LED flashlight and PhaseDetection AutoFocus. For selfies, it gets a large 8MP front camera. Like the latest devices from Huawei, it also gets a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner that unlocks instantly with a single tap. Powering the device is a large 4,000mAh battery which Huawei claims can last 1.5 days on a single charge. The Mate 8 supports dual-SIM 4G-LTE and it accepts a microSD card on its hybrid SIM tray slot. The Huawei Mate 8 is priced at RM2,099 for the Standard version and RM2,399 for the Premium model. These could be a worthy alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Note5 and Nexus 6P that are currently priced at RM2,699. On top of that, the Mate 8 also gets an exclusive service package including door to door pick up and delivery service, and a quick 3-hour fix service when you walk-in to their service centres.The Mate 8 will be available for pre-order starting today and you can order from VMall.my and Lazada. It will also be available at retail stores and telcos beginning 11 March. If you haven’t seen it yet, check out our hands-on with the Huawei Mate 8 below."

Sure you can free up space by moving your photos but recently there’s a bug on WhatsApp that appears to be sucking up more storage than usual.A couple of days back, WhatsApp had rolled out a new feature which allows you to send PDF documents to your contacts. After the initial update, a couple of iPhone users including our unit have been getting alerts that storage is running out. Even after uninstalling apps and clearing up photos, it didn’t take too long before the available storage space goes back to 0 bytes. If you’re having the same issue, it looks like WhatsApp could be a culprit. They have released a newer version (2.12.15) today that address crashes and storage issues on some iPhone. After updating the app, we managed to free up more space on an iPhone 6 16GB and the iPhone 6s Plus 16GB. To clear even more space, we suggest clearing up media files from your chat history as that also builds up after a long period of time. Do you have this issue? Let us know if WhatsApp had bogged down your iPhone and whether it is fixed after you’ve updated the app."
Rory Lee,There is no liquid in the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge’s “liquid-cooling” system,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/04/there-is-no-liquid-in-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-edges-liquid-cooling-system/,"galaxy s7 edge liquid cooling,galaxy s7 edge watercooling,galaxy s7 liquid cooling,galaxy s7 watercooling,liquid cooled,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy s7 edge,samsung watercooling,water cooled smartphone,android,cool stuff,mobile devices,mobile os,others","Android,Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Others,Samsung",2016-03-04,"The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is many things — a well built, well engineered, well spec-ed smartphone — but apparently the one thing it isn’t, is a liquid-cooled device. Well, not in the conventional sense.YouTube teardown specialist JerryRigEverything, in his dismantling of the Galaxy S7 edge smartphone, found out that there is no visible liquid within the heat pipe. There was, however, a copper wire mesh on the inside acting as a heat sink to draw away heat from the processor.Why is there no liquid?Unlike the heat pipe used in the Galaxy S7 phones, traditional liquid cooling involves a pump that keeps tubes full of liquid flowing, allowing the coolant to bring the heat from a CPU or GPU to a radiator/heatsink to be dissipated by a fan.In contrast, heat pipes use an evaporative cooling technique which transfers thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. So, whatever or however little fluid there was in the pipe, if there even was any to begin with, becomes vapour as soon as it heats up and would likely be released when the pipe was sliced open.Heat pipes can also be found in most traditional PC heatsinks or coolers, but we don’t exactly call those “liquid-cooling” solutions. We can see how this vapour heat pipe would be more practical in a smartphone, but can we really say that it is liquid-cooled?Samsung aren’t the only ones to employ this form of “liquid cooling” as the same system is currently employed in Microsoft’s Lumia flagships as well. One notable exception when it comes to liquid-cooled smartphones, as JerryRigEverything points out, is the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. When they tore that device apart, there was visible liquid within the heat pipes.To be fair, in their presentation during Unpacked 2016, Samsung did explain their cooling system pretty well — how it had some liquid that vapourises when hot and condenses when cooled — staying away from the actual usage of “water-cooled smartphone”. In fact, I couldn’t find any mention of “water-cooling” on their product page either.Perhaps then, the term water-cooling was coined more by the media and/or misinformed product guys than anyone else. What do you guys think of this “water-cooled” smartphone? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Nope, us neither. But still, once you’ve made a device water resistant, it doesn’t hurt that you’d prompt your customers that charging is imposible (yes, say it with a Spanish slang) – when it feels that your smartphone is a little on the wet side.Hey, but why are you complaining? You’re lucky the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge has this warning.Of course, waterproofing isn’t all that new. Samsung never did make a big fuss about its flagships last year but they were fairly resistant too. This year they’ve gone all out and managed to get the waterproofing down without any flaps (woohoo).A lucky bunch of techies are already testing out the Galaxy S7 as a daily driver and postings have popped up over on the XDA-Developers forum over the phone’s waterproof-ability. A user states that once the smartphone hits some water if you decide to charge it without letting it dry, a warning message will tell you that the charging port is still damp. So no charging till it’s fully dry.Are you mad? Well if you’re ever in the same position, don’t be. Just be thankful the South Korean manufacturers decided to ensure that your device doesn’t go boom or bust by short circuiting. You wouldn’t be too thrilled about being phoneless now would you?Besides, there’s always wireless charging if you’re that desperate to be connected to your Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. Oh, you can try that blowing puffs of air into the micro USB port too like we used to with PS2 memory sticks and Gameboy cartridges.No guarantee that’ll help, though.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Further “leaked” specifications hinted towards a flagship device too, but thanks to Chinese certification agency TENAA, we now know for certain one fact is true — the R9 is not the flagship you’re looking for.Two devices passed through TENAA — the R9 and R9 Plus — revealing their internal specifications as well as the smartphone’s overall design. There was no Snapdragon 820 SoC, no Quad HD display, which means it’s no 2016 flagship.Instead, for the smaller R9, we get a 5.5-inch full HD 1080p AMOLED panel on the front. Inside, it’s powered by a 1.95GHz octa-core processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage. Keeping everything running is a 2,850 mAh battery.Although the processor’s model name isn’t mentioned, it’s fairly obvious that this isn’t a quad-core Snapdragon 820 chip as the SoC in the R9 is an octa-core unit.Moving on to the larger R9 Plus we find a larger 6-inch 1080p full HD AMOLED panel on the front, with a 1.8GHz octa-core processor thrumming away inside. Paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage and a large 4,120 mAh battery, the R9 Plus is definitely the one with a better spec sheet — still no Snapdragon 820 in sight.Teased as a camera-centric phone, the R9 duo definitely packs the specifications to back that up as they feature two 16-megapixel cameras — one on the front and one on the back — with an LED flash. Besides that, both smartphones feature support for dual SIM 4G LTE connectivity and a rounded metal body.That’s not all, the smartphones will be sporting a front-mounted fingerprint sensor tucked under an oval home button. We can’t tell from the pictures if it is a physical button, but there is a coloured chrome frame around the button which suggests that it could. This would be the first time OPPO has mounted a fingerprint sensor on the front. Both smartphones will also come running Android Lollipop out-of-the-box.If you tuned in to our Mobile World Congress 2016 coverage, you would have picked up on OPPO’s blazingly fast Super VOOC charging technology where they fully charged a smartphone in 15 minutes. Now that is an awesome technological development, but unfortunately, it doesn’t look like it will be making its way into the R9.According to a recent teaser on Gizchina, OPPO advertised that the R9 will give you 2 hours of talk time from a 5-minute charge. That’s the same claim OPPO made for their R7 series of smartphones and those only use regular VOOC. SuperVOOC claims to give you 10 whopping hours of talk time after the same amount of time spent on the plug.That said, the camera-centric R9 series could potentially feature OPPO’s new 3-axis SmartSensor camera technology. Well, we will all find out soon enough as the launch date has been set for 17th March.[SOURCE, 2, VIA, 2]"

To make it more enticing, Celcom will be giving those that book a chance to walk away with the Galaxy S7 edge for free. At the moment, they have yet to reveal their bundling offers but it is likely to be tied with their new Celcom FIRST Gold postpaid plan that offers 10GB of mobile data with unlimited calls and SMS. Another possibility is that Celcom could be offering the Galaxy S7 edge on NewPhone, a direct competitor to Maxis Zerolution.If Celcom is offering the latest Samsung flagship on their FIRST Gold plan, this could be the lowest cost for bundled subscription. At RM80/month, it comes out to just RM8 per GB which is cheaper than other postpaid plans out there. Stay tuned to us, as we will compare all Malaysian telco deals for the Galaxy S7 edge soon.

Based on performance, he places them next to the useless systems of yesteryear – for Rift’s virtual reality headset at least.Considering that VR is about to go big in the near future, this could cause some concern to the execs at Cupertino. Well, Apple usually enters the race late anyway. And as usual, they’ll find a way to get vendors and developers on board when they think it’s the right time to enter the game.Initially during development, Rift headsets were friendly with Linux and Mac machines but ever since the launch a year ago, the team at Oculus (probably) guided by Mr. Palmer Luckey’s views on Mac’s GPU performance, have gone Windows only.The Oculus exec stressed that even the most pimped out Mac out there can’t keep up with the Rift’s VR hardware, making it not as enjoyable as pairing it with a PC. He added that “It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn’t prioritise high-end GPUs” and even if “You can buy a US$ 6,000 Mac Pro with the top-of-the-line AMD FirePro D700, (and) it still doesn’t match our recommended specs”.However, Luckey did mention that if Apple ever decided to change how it picks out internals, Oculus would be happy to support Mac systems in the future.Currently, we don’t buy PCs or laptops because they can handle virtual reality systems – it isn’t vastly adoptable yet but one day you can bet that almost every person will have a VR headset. For gaming and learning, virtual reality takes our senses to places that previously were never possible.An easy fix for Mac users would be having dual-boot software installed and probably upping that AMD card to a Nvidia graphics card. On the other end, here are some ready built PCs that’ll be ready to handle any VR task.Question is, are we ready for VR?On a side note, you’ve gotta love moments like these, rest in peace Steve.[ SOURCE, VIA, IMAGE SOURCE ]"
Rory Lee,Pebble Time and Time Round receives a price cut,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/02/pebble-time-and-time-round-receives-a-price-cut/,"pebble,pebble discount,pebble price cut,pebble time,pebble time round,smartwatch discount,smartwatch price cut,mobile accessories,promotions,smart watch","Mobile Accessories,Promotions,Smart Watch",2016-03-02,"One of the hardest habits to pick up when switching to a smartwatch is remembering to charge it nearly every day — something you don’t have to do with your run-of-the-mill watch. With Pebble, though, this process is slightly less jarring as the quirky company’s selection of wearables boasts battery lives of up to 10 days.To make the switch even easier, two of their newest wearable devices just got a pretty significant price cut.Pebble announced on their blog that the Pebble Time and Pebble Time Round will both be receiving USD50 price cuts, bringing their price down to USD149.99 (around RM620) and USD199.99 (around RM828) respectively.If you have placed an order at pebble.com on or after 21st January 2016 for a watch affected by the new pricing, Pebble will adjust the charge to match the new price. Simply drop them an email at order@pebble.com with the subject line “Price Adjustment” before 1st April 2016 and include the original order number or the email you ordered with, in your request.That’s a pretty good bargain especially if you take into consideration how fully featured these smartwatches are. But, one of their stand-out features has to be their battery lives. The super thin Pebble Time Round can last a good 2 days on a single charge while the much beefier Pebble Time can achieve about 7 days (realistically 5).This is thanks to the e-Paper display that the Pebble watches use, which is a much more power efficient display technology. Perhaps a dealbreaker for many when it comes to the Pebble line is the lack of a touch-capable display — resorting to buttons to navigate the watch’s UI.Nevertheless, it isn’t enough to pull focus from the other awesome features you get with a Pebble device, like the standard 22mm or 14mm bands that you can interchange with any other standard band of the same size.What’s more, if you’ve never picked up a Pebble device before, you can get 10% off your first device. They also offer free shipping worldwide with every purchase from their online store. Still don’t think the Pebble is the right smartwatch for you? Maybe our Smartwatch Buyer’s guide can offer more compelling options.[SOURCE]"

There will be 32GB of storage on-board and it will support further expansion with microSD up to 200GB on its hybrid dual-SIM tray.

They have just identified a submarine cable system as the root cause of the problem and a fix is underway. Unfortunately fixing a cable lying on the seabed isn’t easy and it will take a month before it gets a full restoration. This time, it is a different submarine cable. The 6 fibre pair and 7,500 KM long Asia Submarine Cable Express (ASE) located off Singapore is currently identified as the culprit and it affects 2 fibre pairs of TM’s own Cahaya Malaysia. The remaining 4 pairs belong to NTT, StarHub and PLDT. The repair will require collaborative efforts from consortium members and it is only scheduled to commence on 25th March with expected completion on 31st March. This is also subject to weather and sea conditions which may delay restoration efforts. As a temporary fix, TM is diverting international traffic to alternative routes to minimise the impact for Malaysian users. While restoration is in progress, expect slower speeds and high latency to international sites that are hosted in the US, North Asia and Europe. [ SOURCE 2 ]"

These remote controlled flying robots will maneuverer across a track at speeds over 100 km/h and zoom about in different zones that’ll test both the drone and the pilot’s ability.It seems like the World Organisation of Racing Drones (W.O.R.D.) is trying to emulate Red Bull’s Air Race on a smaller scale. The “pilots” of the drones are to fly in a “track” and in between obstacles.The racing drone will also be required to make one mandatory “pit stop”.  A drone racing team comprises of four or more members with a pilot, navigator, pit stop crew or technician and etc.Based on the video that the organizers have just outed, we can kind of put together that these drones will fly through markers – much like Red Bull’s Air Race. Sadly, there won’t be any MacLarens involved.In an extended FAQ, there’s a mention of a “Joker Lane” which would seem to add another thrilling element to it all. We’re expecting it to be something like a flying Mario Kart, with shortcuts and environmental obstacles but with proper safety measures and rules put in place.Two days’ worth of qualifying rounds of the World Drone Prix will begin on the 7th of March with 100 teams vying for the top 32 spots that’ll actually hit the “race track” on the 11th and 12th of the same month.The event will take place at SkyDive Dubai with a winning pool of US$ 1 million (RM 4.14 million) at stake.

The exec rolled around in the company’s Ninebot mini high-fiving and networking with eager Mi fans. He spent most of his time on stage talking about how the global variant of Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 that outperforms the Nexus 6P and the OnePlus 2.Launched in front of a huge crowd in India, the Redmi Note 3 runs a Snapdragon 650 processor (formerly known as the 618). In terms of benchmarks, it punches high above its weight, thanks to the ARM Cortex-A72 two BIG cores – beating devices that run the Snapdragon 810 and the Snapdragon 808.It’ll come in two variants 2GB/16GB and a 3GB/32GB for RAM and internal storage, respectively. There will also be microSD card expandability in the hybrid 4G LTE enabled dual-SIM slots on the smartphone. On the screen that sizes in at 5.5-inches, you’ll be viewing everything in a Full HD (1920 x 1080) display.For users who love taking photos, the Redmi Note 3 has a 16-megapixel rear sensor with a f/2.0 aperture and PDAF (phase detection autofocus). Under the dual-LED flash module, there’s a round fingerprint sensor that has Xiaomi quoting a 0.3 second unlocking time.Aside from biometric security, that fingerprint sensor will help you take photos on your selfie and rear camera as well. In MIUI 7, there will be an additional option to use App lock to secure apps and unlock them with your fingers. Mr Barra also decided to try out unlocking his Redmi Note 3 with his lips – it worked but only with his lower lip.Moving from the metal-clad rear to the front, the top right will greet you with a 5-megapixel camera shutter for your selfies. Another highlight is the chipset’s ability to support VoLTE (voice over LTE) and faster LTE speeds (Cat.7).Powering this Android 5.1 Lollipop running device is a relatively large 4,050 mAh battery that has some people quoting a six to seven screen on time of use. Charging is supported by Quick Charge technology for a faster than usual time to juice up your smartphone. It’ll be sold for Rs. 9,999 (RM 613.31) – 2GB RAM/16GGB internal storage and Rs. 11,999 (RM 736) – 3GB RAM/32GB internal storage.It’ll hit the online Mi store and Amazon on the 9th of March at 2 PM and be available in silver, gold and gray. Malaysians will probably get the Redmi Note 3 in April but if you want to win a chance to try it out earlier, you can do so here.Hugo didn’t just leave us at that, he also mentioned that the Mi 5 will come to India (Malaysia should follow shortly after) in a month’s time."

For an aspirational brand like Apple, they aren’t really that active especially on Twitter. Sure they have a few accounts like Apple Music and AppStore, but they are mostly one way channels to promote their products and services. With Apple continuing to break sales records for every release of its new product, the Cupertino company appears to be openning its doors for better customer interaction. Finally they have just created a new @AppleSupport twitter account to directly address customer questions as soon as possible.

DM us with what device you are using to get started.— Apple Support (@AppleSupport) March 3, 2016So whether you have a software or hardware problem, you can send a tweet to @AppleSupport and you’ll get a response almost immediately. From the looks of it, they are engaging quite instantly to various questions on Twitter. It is almost like having an Apple Store Genius Bar on twitter 24/7. Of course, most brands have been doing this across their respective markets but it’s still better late than never. The Cupertino company is certainly stepping up its customer service. Apart from having an online customer support, they are also in the process of revamping its Genius Bar appointment system. Instead of walking in and setting a specific time, the Apple Stores in the US will adopt a new “Concierge” service where they will prioritise your request by urgency. For example, a repair for a cracked screen will be attended before a customer having minor software issues. After registering with the system, they will send a text on estimated wait times and they will text you again once your turn is coming up next. Finally they will text you that your technician is ready and where you can locate them in the store. This is faster than the current appointment system and you can walk around the mall while waiting for your turn. While we don’t have an official Apple Store in Malaysia, their customer service through their authorised resellers have been pretty good. When they issued recalls for the iPhone 5 Battery and Power button, the replacement process was hassle-free and in some instances, they even offered a free refurbished replacement.

Well, Samsung are launching a pre-order offer for their latest flagship that will let you pick up a Galaxy S7 edge before the official launch on 18 March.Samsung really struck a home run with both their Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge flagship devices. They did such a good job with shoring up the Galaxy S6’s weaknesses that we think it’s a near perfect smartphone.Unfortunately, Malaysia is only getting the edge variant, meaning a higher price of RM3,099 — which is exactly the same price as the Galaxy S6 edge when it first launched.However, if you’re one of the first 1,000 customers to pre-order the device from 7-11 March 2016, Samsung will be throwing in a 20% discount, bringing the price down to RM2,479.20, plus a free 128GB microSD card and an additional year’s extended warranty. If you’re interested in this deal:1. Head to the microsite (Beginning 7 March).
2. Place a downpayment of RM300
3. Select one of the three colour options (Black Onyx, Silver Titanium, Gold Platinum)
4. Choose a Samsung store to collect your device from.Upon order confirmation, buyers can collect their Galaxy S7 edge on 17th of March, one day before the offical device launch date of 18th March.Among the duo, the Galaxy S7 edge definitely has the more attractive feature set. Edging out its little brother, the Galaxy S7, the edge variant bundles all the goodies that come with the standard model plus that sexy dual-edge screen and all the features that come with it.To recap, the Galaxy S7 edge proudly displays its 5.5-inch Quad HD (2560×1440 pixels) SuperAMOLED dual-edge curved panel on the front, right above the fingerprint sensor cum home button. Inside, this monster flagship is powered by Samsung’s latest and greatest Exynos 8890 octa-core processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage via a hybrid SIM tray.Imaging is perhaps the Galaxy S7 edge’s greatest asset with Samsungs brand new Dual Pixel 12-megapixel f/1.7 primary camera unit mounted on the back. It boasts up to 95% brighter photos and a near instantaneous focusing speed in any lighting condition. On the front, the selfie shooter is maintained at 5MP but the camera now gets a faster f/1.7 aperture lens.Other improvements include an IP68 water resistant rating and an always-on display that can that show useful information like your calendar, the time and personalised notifications. It’s also got a bigger battery, rated at 3,600 mAh.If you’d like to find out more about the device, head on over to our announcement post or check out the 7 reasons why you should pick up a Galaxy S7."

Paired with a 64-bit 1.3GHz MediaTek MT6753 octa-core processor, the Liquid Z630s should offer a much better performance compared to the standard variant’s MediaTek MT6735 quad-core chip.For photos, the device gets the same 8MP front and rear camera for your snapshots and selfies, plus a 5.5-inch HD IPS panel to view those pictures on. Keeping the lights on is a large 4,000 mAh battery with support for USB OTG charging.It will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out-of-the-box and have support for dual-SIM 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0, DTS Studio Sound and comes in a special new Black with a touch of Gold colour scheme.While these upgrades are nice to have, they do come at a cost. The Liquid Z630s will set you back RM799, up RM140 from the standard variant’s RM659 pricetag. This higher price tag does reduce its value-for-money, especially compared to devices like the Lenovo A7000 Plus and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, placing it in the range of the ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser instead.The Liquid Z630s will be available at major authorised Acer Resellers nationwide.

With the new Galaxy S7 packing more features like the new Game Launcher, we expect it tip the scales up a little. According to Droid-Life that managed to unboxed a unit, the Galaxy S7 takes up 8GB storage out of the box. That’s 25% of your 32GB storage utilised for system files. Fortunately, the Galaxy S7 comes with a microSD expansion that supports up to 200GB. By right with Android Marshmallow, it could have supported adoptable storage, a feature that lets you “merge” both on-board and microSD card storage as a single entity. That would create more storage for apps since most applications and its data files are often restricted to on-board use. According to Samsung, they have intentionally left out adoptable storage support to make file transfers using microSD card between phone and other devices possible. That’s quite true since adoptable storage will encrypt your microSD card and it will only work on your phone.Well, it’s not all that bad. Apparently the Galaxy S7 will let you move almost any application from your on-board storage to your microSD card. Droid-Life that has a working unit has managed to move a variety of games and apps successfully onto their microSD card. To prove that this works, the apps are automatically removed when they took out the microSD card. So overall, this should be good news if we are stuck with just the 32GB storage version for the Galaxy S7 edge.In case you missed it, Samsung Malaysia is only bringing the Galaxy S7 edge with pre-orders to start next week on 7th March. The device will be officially launched in Malaysia on 18th March. [ SOURCE 2, VIA ]"

The first 30 customers to make a purchase from 3-8 March 2016 will receive a free pair of VR goggles. Deliveries will begin from 9 March onwards.Immersion. An experience people everywhere are looking for this year. An experience that will probably define the rest of this year’s technological advancements. It’s an attractive notion, being able to completely immerse yourself in whatever content it is you’re consuming — be it gaming or videos — and if you add the 360-degree element to that, you can essentially travel the world from the comfort of your home.It then comes as no surprise that 2016 is the year of Virtual Reality or VR.

Pop in your headphones and you can basically ignore everything that is going on outside of the virtual reality you’ve created for yourself. Now that’s immersion.The Mobile World Congress 2016 pretty much set the stage for VR in 2016, with gigantic electronics developers like Samsung and LG offering VR experiences with their flagship devices.

Well, Lenovo wants to help the little guy out with their newly launched Vibe K4 Note and Vibe X3 — two smartphones that have been purpose built to give users the ultimate VR experience.The Vibe X3 is the better equipped of the two devices, sporting a large 5.5-inch full HD display on the front with a Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor clocked at 1.5GHz, paired with 3GB of RAM and 32 GB of expandable internal storage powering it on the inside. For optics, it gets a 21-megapixel Sony camera on the rear packing PDAF, with an 8MP front-facing selfie shooter.Giving it juice will be a large 3,500 mAh battery. It’s also got a bunch of nifty features like a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and support for 4G LTE. But perhaps the best feature is the dual Dolby Atmos front-facing stereo speakers that has support for Hi-Fi 3.0 thanks to OPA1612 amplifiers from Texas Instruments.Rounding up the duo is the more budget-friendly Vibe K4 Note. Also known as the A7010, this device features a 5.5-inch full HD IPS panel tucked under Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 on the front. Inside, it packs a modest MediaTek MT6753 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. The camera is a step down from Vibe X3, sporting a 13-megapixel sensor on the rear with PDAF and a fast f/2.2 aperture, plus a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies.Perhaps the best feature of all is the dual Dolby Atmos front-facing stereo speakers tucked into the top and bottom corners of the relatively thin bezel. It’s awesome that Lenovo decided to strap a pair of front-facing stereo speakers to their mid-range device, what more a Dolby Atmos enabled one. Keeping the lights on is a modest 3,300 mAh battery.Lenovo unveiled something called TheaterMax, a feature baked into both Vibe devices launched today that is supposed to immerse their audience in a widescreen cinematic experience with the aid of the Lenovo ANTVR headset. Both Vibe devices are the first in Lenovo’s line to incorporate the Lenovo VR technology that lets users view any content — be it movies, TV shows or games — on a super-sized virtual screen.How good Lenovo’s VR tech actually is, remains to be seen — and be sure we will definitely be testing these out later. I think it’s pretty cool that they’re trying to bring a good VR experience to a lower-to-mid point in the market.That said, even without the VR component the Vibe devices are pretty attractive handsets on their own. With the Vibe X3 going for RM1,899 and the K4 Note going for RM999, they’re a pretty good deal for the specs, especially that K4 Note with front-facing speakers. Both smartphones will also come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovo’s Vibe UI running on top.The Lenovo ANTVR will be available today onwards for RM99, but you can get it bundled as a free add-on when you purchase either the Lenovo Vibe X3 or the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note at selected stores while stocks last.If you did notice, Lenovo has already started selling the Vibe X3 at authorised retailers, but this is the first time the K4 Note will be appearing on our shores. I think that being good value as standalone devices is a big plus for these devices as the “VR-enabled” part of Lenovo’s marketing can be treated as a nice little add-on that won’t make the device worse. In a way, it’s kind of like the LG G5 and its optional modules — the device’s success doesn’t necessarily hinge on a single gimmicky feature.What do you guys think of these devices?"
Rory Lee,"OPPO teases a new smartphone, but it’s not the one you’re expecting",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/29/oppo-find-9-r9-sirim-teaser/,"android,oppo,oppo f1,oppo find 7,oppo find 9,oppo r7,oppo r9,oppo smartphone,oppo teaser,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os,rumour mill","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo,Rumour Mill",2016-02-29,"OPPO has posted a new teaser for their upcoming camera-centric device on the company’s official Weibo account, the OPPO R9. Wait, so it isn’t going to be a new OPPO flagship?It is said that the device will sport a flagship Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor mated to either 3GB or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable (up to 128GB via microSD) internal storage. Those are mighty high-end specs for a device that is supposed to be in the midrange category. What’s more, it is purported to sport a massive 6-inch Quad HD display (2560×1440 pixels) plus a fingerprint scanner.For optics, the device is supposed to pack a 21-megapixel sensor at the back with a 13-megapixel front-facing selfie snapper. Keeping everything running will be a large 3,700 mAh battery. Being a new device, the R9 is rumoured to come with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box though there have been rumours that the device could come with Android Lollipop instead.OPPO had a fairly quiet showing at the recent Mobile World Congress 2016 in Barcelona, not opting to reveal any devices. Instead, they showcased two technological innovations, the first one was Super VOOC — which can fully charge a smartphone in 15 minutes — and a new SmartSensor with 3-axis image stabilisation.With such a tame MWC, one would think that they would want to come out swinging with a brand new flagship device, not an R series smartphone. An incredibly powerful R device, but an R line smartphone nonetheless. To make matters worse, an R line smartphone would likely mean the same design cues (which have even spread to the F1) — a design which we think everyone has had more than enough of.However, a curious entry on our SIRIM database reveals something rather interesting. The entry, bearing the model number X9009, hit the certification centre awhile back and if we’re looking at the previous Find 7’s model number (X9007) this entry would indicate that this phone is the Find 9, not the R9.This could mean one of two things. First, that OPPO are tightening their product line, cutting off the Find series smartphones and bundling them together with the R series, or OPPO are planning to launch two phones in close succession and only one of those devices will be coming to Malaysia at a time.The former seems to be the more reasonable of the two as the rumoured specifications on the R9 are definitely high end enough to be called a flagship device. But, that also seems unlikely as smartphone manufacturers rarely kill off their flagship line. It would be as if Samsung axed the Galaxy S series in favour of their Galaxy A line.Then again, Sony did just axe their Xperia Z line, so I guess anything is possible? Either way, this is all still speculation so take it with the appropriate amount of salt.Thanks to @KevinNgTK for the tip![SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

The first is the ability to add stops to your existing journey, for example, if you need to top up on some fuel or head to a shop for a spot of grocery shopping on your way home from work.To do so simply hit the search icon (magnifying glass) during your navigation and it will bring up several suggestions like gas stations, restaurants, coffee shops, among others, as well as an option to search for more places. If you select one of the categories, let’s say gas stations, Maps will look for petrol stations along or close to your route and bring them up for you to choose from. They’ve even indicated how much time the detour would add to your total journey.Once you’ve decided, tap the location and hit “Add stop” and Maps will navigate you accordingly. Pretty nifty if that fuel warning light suddenly pops on.Next, Google incorporated some handy 3D Touch shortcuts to the Maps app as well. By hard-pressing on the Maps icon, it will let you either navigate to “Home” or navigate to “Work”. Not nearly as extensive as the 3D Touch features on the Apple Maps app, but useful nonetheless.If you’d like to get your hands on these features, simply update your Google Maps app to Version 4.16.0 in the App Store and you’re good to go.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Josh and Peter from YouTube’s FliteTest have built a remote-controlled version of that very flying balloon house.Okay, granted, you won’t be able to fit anyone into that tiny lighter-than-air remote-controlled balloon house, but it is a working, flying, miniature replica of that very house from Up.In fact, they printed the paper cutout from Disney’s website and strapped some salvaged propellers from a previous X-Wing flying toy to allow it to be controlled. Then, they hooked everything up to a set of helium balloons and voila a house big enough to carry the little kid inside you to an imaginary Paradise Falls.Although this RC house is pretty cool, unless you’ve got some spare RC propellers lying around, it’s going to be rather hard for the average person to build this themselves. So, someone please come up with a pre-made kit?Besides the flying balloon house, FliteTest also featured a pair of remote-controlled gliders carved out of balsa wood and controlled by some salvaged RC parts from other planes.The gliders fly remarkably well, even getting up to a pretty decent speed while maintaining a stable glide. Very impressive considering both the planes were constructed  by a 15-year-old out of leftover parts from old toys.Pretty cool that what some people consider broken toys, others can reuse to build their own flying machines.

Following its time limited SmartPlan 75 promo, Digi has announced its new postpaid plan that’s now simply called Digi postpaid. You still get the choice between more internet or more calls and text, but they have enhanced their plans with more internet up to 20GB per month. On top of that, they have also introduced internet rollover, which allows you to carry forward unused internet quota to the following month. Digi Postpaid – More Internet
For internet-centric users, you have a choice of 6 plans ranging from 1GB per month and all the way up to 20GB a month. For its entry RM28/month plan, it is slightly more expensive than the current SmartPlan 25 that comes with 1GB of internet, but you get 50mins of calls and 50 SMS bundled in, plus the ability to carry forward 500MB of data. Hitting the middle sweet spot is the RM68/month plan that comes with 6GB of data, 150 mins calls, 150 SMS and you’re allowed to carry forward up to 2GB of internet per month. For the ultimate data quota, the highest plan at RM238/month offers 20GB of internet, 1000 minutes of calls and 1000 SMS per month. It also allows you to carry forward up to 9GB per month. At the same price, the current SmartPlan 238 offers 12GB of internet (inclusive of 2GB promo) but it comes with unlimited phone calls and SMS. Digi Postpaid – More Calls & SMS
For those who love to talk and text a lot, the “more calls” option is skewed towards unlimited phone calls for its RM68/month plan and above. Similar to its current SmartPlan 75 offering, the RM78/month new Postpaid option also gives you 7GB of data per month (rollover up to 2GB) and unlimited phone calls. For free flow of calls and the most internet, the most expensive RM218/month option gives you unlimited calls, unlimited SMS and 13GB of data. Like most good things, the highest 3 options are only available for a limited time only. So if you’re interested, you would need to sign up before 30th June 2016. Internet Roaming
For international travellers, you now have a cheaper option to stay connected. For the “budget traveller”, you can enjoy unlimited instant messaging at RM10/day via selected operators. If you need unrestricted internet access, the “frequent traveller” option at RM36/day gives you unlimited internet usage for a fixed price. Similar to Maxis, you can enable roaming without manual operator selection and you don’t have to worry about bill shocks for connecting to the wrong network partner. It is funny that they are calling it budget and frequent traveller respectively as your travel habits don’t necessary reflect your data consumption. Note that these new offering are only available for Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, China, Hongkong, Taiwan, South Korea and Australia. Digi’s 4G LTE update
In terms of network, Digi is still claiming the widest 4G LTE network at 72% populated areas covered with availability across 150 towns and cities in Malaysia. This is a significant coverage increase from 60% as reported in mid-November last year. At the moment, their LTE-A coverage stands at 31% which are primarily focused at key market centres. They have also iterated that Digi has commenced VoLTE (Voice over LTE) tests and they are expected to roll it out commercially by end of this year."

It’s six cores that are 64-bit enabled run at 1.8GHz while it matches up with an Adreno 510 GPU. The latter allows the Redmi Note 3 to support VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and its functionality is to improve call quality to unprecedented levels.Brimming gloriously while being surrounded by its metal back, a 16-megapixel rear sensor sits on top. On paper, it has an aperture of f/2.0 and PDAF (Phase Detection Autofocus). Just below the dual-LED flash module, you’ll locate a rounded fingerprint sensor that handles any biometric security requests. Meanwhile, the front gets a decent 5-megapixel shutter.In its homeland China, the Redmi Note 3 comes in two versions: a 2GB/16GB model and a 3GB/32GB model. The differences only lie in the smartphone’s RAM and internal storage, otherwise, you’ll find a 4,050mAh battery and MIUI 7 running the show as well.Folks in mainland China pay 999 Yuan (RM 641.50) for the 2GB/16GB variant while the main branch has yet to announce pricing on the top end model.

Then insert the included VR lens and your smartphone.It was only recently that smartphones manufacturers decided to use the boxes their devices ship in as VR goggles, but it looks like McDonald’s has already caught on to the trend. It is worth noting that this is only a trial run for the Happy Goggles, but there is a chance that these boxes find their ways into more McDonald’s outlets in the future.Although designed to tie in with the Swedish “Sportlov” holiday when many families go skiing, these goggles will also work for any other VR content.It’s nowhere near as technologically advanced as the Rift or the Vive, but if it’s as functional and basic as Google Cardboard, I could totally see it working as a distraction for kids.

In the past, if you wanted to send a document, a simple “hack” many employed was to change the extension of the file to a supported file type, send it over via WhatsApp and have the other person change the extension back.Now, a simple tap on the paperclip icon would bring up a the option to send docs. But, WhatsApp didn’t just add the option to the existing 6 types of shareable media, instead, they removed the “Video” option to make way for “Document”.This is a great addition as it brings WhatsApp in line with other apps like Telegram that support sending and receiving documents via chat. However, the biggest difference in WhatsApp’s implementation is that you can only send PDF files. Yep, no .docx for you yet, unfortunately.Another little ding in WhatsApp’s new addition is the fact that iOS devices don’t seem to be supported yet. Our iPhone 6S Plus can receive PDF files sent from Android devices, but it can’t send PDF files of its own. The same is also true for our BlackBerry Classic running BlackBerry 10, but that’s less surprising since WhatsApp already announced that support for BB10 would stop at the end of 2016.You will still be able to send video via the “Gallery” option as usual, so the only thing you’re missing is the option to record a video directly from the app and share it.WhatsApp didn’t include this particular update in their changelog but this isn’t the first time they’ve “ninja-released” a new feature either. Backup to Google Drive was also a feature that was quietly rolled out before finally being included in the app’s latest changelog as a feature.Then again, seeing how limited and incomplete the feature still seems to be so far, it isn’t too surprising then that WhatsApp decided to keep it off their changelog in the meantime. That said, at least this is a step in the right direction. Kudos!It is possible that not everyone will have this option to share documents just yet, like how I never got the option to backup to Google Drive until recently, so just keep your WhatsApp application up to date from your app store (Android, iOS) and hope for the best in the meantime."

TM has reported a network performance issue with international links to the US and North Asia. As a result, accessing websites and online services hosted in the US will be much slower than usual.The fixed broadband ISP has yet to release an official announcement but it is likely caused by a fault with a submarine cable. This isn’t the first time it happened and the last one reported was sometime in February last year. Depending how extensive the damage is and subject to weather conditions, restoring international links could take weeks to a month. TM and various broadband providers rely on submarine cables for international connectivity and they are managed by a consortium.

There were even rumours of a dual camera setup adorning the back of the device.Thanks to serial leakster @evleaks, who shared several hands-on pictures of the upcoming device on VentureBeat, we have confirmation of at least one of those rumours. Care to guess which one?According to the VentureBeat post, the images are that of the standard P9 variant and are courtesy of an unnamed individual who was given some hands-on time with the smartphone. Although the individual refused to be named, @evleaks has been rather accurate in the past with his leaks obtained from anonymous sources.Either way, if the images are really that of the P9, they confirm that the upcoming flagship device will indeed sport a dual-camera setup at the back of the device. From the looks of things, both cameras seem to be sporting the same sensor, which lends credence to an earlier leak stating that it would have two 12-megapixel shooters. The overall look and placement of flash plus laser autofocus also lines up with earlier leaked renders of the device, though the smartphone’s design, in general, looks a lot more polished than in the renders.Huawei first debuted their dual-camera setup on the honor 6 Plus — of which the dual-sensors offered useful features like post-capture refocus and simulated aperture adjustment — and are looking to refine that with the P9. Dubbed the second-generation of the honor 6 Plus’ dual camera setup, the P9’s snappers are two 12-megapixel sensors paired with Leica lenses that should enable even more unique capabilities.It is rather curious, that if those lenses are indeed Leica-made, why the P9 doesn’t feature any Leica branding at all. You’d think that Huawei would want to highlight that as a big feature considering their high profile collaboration with the camera-maker.That said, this may not be the final product as it is completely devoid of any branding, not even Huawei’s own, or markings at all.Worth noting is that these images do line up with a previous leak on Weibo where the P9 was also caught on camera, only that time there was a case over it to mask any design features. They did reveal the placement of key features such as the camera module and fingerprint scanner.As they line up rather perfectly, it is very likely that this leak by VentureBeat is the real deal.Besides images, the source also revealed some specifications of the device. Apparently, the smartphone will feature a 5.2-inch full HD display on the front and be powered by Huawei’s Kirin 950 processor mated with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Giving the smartphone juice is a large 3,900 mAh battery — a rare sight especially in such a thin smartphone with a small screen size.The handset is also said to come with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box, which is unsurprising considering the Mate 8 also comes with Marshmallow with an EMUI 4.0 skin on top. Pictures also reveal that the P9 will be Huawei’s first flagship that isn’t a Nexus to sport a reversible USB Type-C port. Other goodies include a fingerprint sensor mounted on the back, something that has become a staple on Huawei flagships.[SOURCE, 2, VIA, 2]"

The ads have appeared at subway and bus stations in China, teasing everyone to wait a little longer for its reveal. They have not shown any spec or features yet but it is likely to incorporate the latest innovations they have showcased during MWC. One of it is a new Smart camera sensor with 3-axis stabilisation and an insanely quick Super VOOC charger that does 100% charge in just 15 minutes.While the current OPPO R7 series are generally mid-range in hardware, the new R9 could be the flagship that’s overdue since the original Find 7. Word has it that it could be running on the latest Snapdragon 820 processor mated with 4GB of RAM. Recently a new OPPO device was spotted on SIRIM with the model number X9009 which looks like a potential successor of the OPPO Find 7 (X9007).OPPO was at the forefront when it launched the Find 7 as it was the first smartphone with a 2K (Quad HD) display and a faster charger that does 0-75% in just 30 minutes.

Coupled with an easy user interface and simple controls, literally anyone can take a photograph.While this is good news for users, the traditional camera market is taking a big hit and it will take some pretty drastic measures for even the legends like Leica to remain strong.When people move on to something better, it usually means one of two things for the existing players in the dying market — move forward or be left behind. Simple but painful decisions must be made to keep with the times and it looks like Leica have bitten the proverbial bait and taken their first step into the new world.Leica needs no introduction. Anyone who has even a remote interest in photography or cameras would have probably heard of this legendary brand. Some of the most iconic images in the world were shot on the revolutionary 35mm Leica I — the first truly viable 35mm camera in the world. It revolutionised photography, leading it to the most popular film format ever, the same format “full-frame” DSLRs take photos in.One of the old guards, they’re now teaming up with the third largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, Huawei, to bring their expertise to the mobile market.What does this partnership mean?Well, we hope, better smartphone cameras. Huawei has proven that they can build premium devices, but I’ve always felt that their cameras leave some to be desired. Now with Leica though, they might have just shored up one of their bigger weaknesses with one of the biggest names in photography.That said, I find it a little much to think that they would be able to “reinvent” something that has almost been perfected by manufacturers like Samsung and Microsoft. But, if anyone was going to do it, I think Leica has a pretty good shot.Either way, I’m excited to see some red dot branded smartphone cameras in the near future. Are you?

A report by GHacks.net also confirms that they’re experiencing the same problem when accessing Netflix via a VPN, though curiously their error code begins with an H, not the letter M described by u/eduazy, as can be seen in this screenshot.In a world of strict licensing rules and regulations, this move by Netflix stems from their desire to keep their content locked based on geographical location. This makes sense from a business standpoint because if you’re a local broadcaster who as the rights to publish a show, you wouldn’t want some foreign streaming service butting in and taking a cut out of your audience.However, this seems to be an outdated notion. As the world becomes more connected, it doesn’t make much sense to force users to maintain multiple subscriptions just so they can watch a particular TV series. By enforcing such strict licensing rules, broadcasters may have just forced users into pirating something many would gladly pay for if it was in a more accessible medium, as user u/Shivadxb says:“I will gladly pay you, but if you refuse then f–k you, I’m downloading that”And that’s just one side of the coin. US citizens are also forced to use a VPN to access their local Netflix content simply because many ISPs there throttle their connection speeds when they access the streaming site. Why? All of this is part of a long discussion about Net Neutrality which you can find out more about from Last Week Tonight’s episode about it here, or this informative comic drawn by TheOatmeal here.In a nutshell, Net Neutrality is the idea that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally by ISPs — something they haven’t been doing in the first place. Instead, some ISPs throttle user’s connection speeds to streaming sites like Netflix to save bandwidth.US netizens who are victims of such throttling use a VPN to disguise their traffic, hiding the fact that it is a video stream from the ISP’s filters, or as u/PaulTheMerc puts it:“When you have a VPN on, it is like everything is packaged in nondescript white boxes, they don’t know what it is, and therefore are very unlikely to intentionally slow it down”That way, they can actually use the speed they paid for to view the content that they also paid for — something they can’t do now, thank’s to Netflix’s VPN ban hammer.Granted, it isn’t Netflix’s fault that ISPs are intentionally throttling connection speeds, plus Netflix is only doing what is required in the licensing laws. That said, it is through their actions that many paying customers who have legally (almost) been enjoying the content they paid for may now have to resort to piracy to get their entertainment fix.UPDATE: After some testing, it looks like Netflix didn’t get all of the VPNs.[SOURCE, 2]"
Alexander Wong,Is Samsung bringing only the Galaxy S7 edge to Malaysia?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/26/is-samsung-bringing-only-the-galaxy-s7-edge-to-malaysia/,"samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy s7 edge,samsung galaxy s7 edge malaysia,samsung galaxy s7 malaysia,samsung galaxy s7 malaysia launch,samsung malaysia,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-26,"The latest Samsung Galaxy S7 flagship is now official and it is coming to Malaysia on 18th March. While good things usually come in pairs, it looks like Samsung Malaysia is just bringing one smartphone model for our local market.Following its global launch at MWC 2016, Samsung had an exclusie preview session in Malaysia that showed only the Galaxy S7 edge. The lack of a 5.1″ Galaxy S7 is rather surprising. If you check out the website for Samsung Malaysia, only the Galaxy S7 edge is shown. Meanwhile, both the S7 and S7 edge are shown on the official sites of Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.From the looks of it, Samsung might be sticking to a single model approach by bringing only the Galaxy S7 edge to Malaysia. It is the higher spec of the two as it comes with a larger 5.5″ Quad HD double curved display and has a bigger 3,600mAh battery. We are surprised that Samsung is dropping the standard Galaxy S7 for Malaysia but it isn’t the first time the Korean electronics giant has done this. For example, the Galaxy Note5 isn’t available in Europe and the UK, leaving them with just the Galaxy S6 edge+. Who knows, they might release the standard S7 in Malaysia at a later phase. So what could this mean for us? If you want the latest Samsung flagship, you probably need to fork out a bit more since the Galaxy S7 edge is the more premium sibling of the two. To refresh your memory, the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge was launched in Malaysia at RM2,599 and RM3,099 respectively. We reckon the S7 edge is likely to be priced lower than the S6 edge previously, but it will be definitely above the RM2,500 mark. Which S7 would you choose? Leave your comments down below."

ASUS will be rolling out Android 6.0 Marshmallow update in Q2 2016 and they have just published a list of devices that will be receiving it. As posted in their ASUS ZenTalk forum, the following devices will be updated very soon:
PadFone S (PF500KL)
ZenFone 2 (ZE550ML, ZE551ML)
ZenFone 2 Deluxe (ZE551ML)

ZenFone Selfie (ZD551KL)
ZenFone Max (ZC550KL)
ZenFone Zoom (ZX551ML)
Generally, if you’re using the higher end ZenFone 2 (ZE550ML/ZE551ML) or newer, you should be eligible to upgrade. Strangely the entry-level 5″ ZenFone 2 (ZE500CL) isn’t listed while the older Snapdragon 801 powered Padfone S (PF500KL) is in line to receive the software update. Once you’ve made the switch to Marshmallow, the OS will make Google Messenger, Calendar and Gmail as the default application. If you perform a factory reset, the previous ASUS Messenger, ASUS Mail and ASUS Calendar is still available from the Google Play store. Hopefully, ASUS will take the opportunity to trim down on the amount of bloatware with this major update. For those using the first generation of ZenFones (ZenFone 4, ZenFone 5, ZenFone 6), there’s still no visibility at the moment. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Despite the decline in tablet sales, Samsung is still continuing to push more tablets with a 2016 refresh of its Galaxy Tab A and Galaxy Tab E series. The Galaxy Tab A is their productivity tablet with an S-Pen while the Galaxy Tab E is their affordable tablet offering.Galaxy Tab A
From the pictures leaked by @evleaks, the design is pretty much the same slab like any other Galaxy Tablets. The only noticable change is the texture of the back which appears to be having a fine dotted grain for the Tab A while the Tab E goes for a faux leather look. Spec-wise, Sammobile mentions that it will likely get a modest 7″ display with a quad-core 1.3GHz processor with just 1.5GB RAM to go. We hope this time Samsung will give the display a bump as the current Galaxy Tab A is doing a very low 1024×768 pixels resolution. It will also get an S Pen, at least 8GB of storage with microSD expansion, 5MP + 2MP camera combos and a 4,000mAh battery.  Galaxy Tab E
For the affordable Galaxy Tab E, there’s no details of its specs yet but don’t expect anything spectular from this entry-level tablet. At the moment, Samsung is taking 13.7% market share in the tablet segment at No. 2, right behind Apple with 24.5% market share. As smartphones are getting bigger, the next growth of tablets are convertibles like the iPad Pro, Microsoft Surface Pro and most recently the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S. Even with its crazy expensive price tag, the iPad Pro is the best selling convertible, and it outsold Microsoft’s entire Surface lineup. Are tablets still relevant in this day and age? Or is the decline of sales is attributed to longer lifespan since tablets are mostly media consumption devices. Let us know in the comments below.[ SOURCE 2 ]"

Well, two and a half, if we’re being real here.If it wasn’t clear before it will be now as popular messaging application WhatsApp is stopping support for several older operating systems, including one that had its latest phone launch in Malaysia less than a year ago.WhatsApp’s official blog reveals that as part of keeping with the times and to give them an easier time to implement more features, the Facebook-owned messaging application will be sticking to Android, iOS and Windows Phone operating systems moving forward.That means that they will be stopping support for Nokia’s S40 and S60 Symbian platforms, old Android 2.1 (Eclair) and Android 2.2 (Froyo), Windows Phone 7.1, and finally BlackBerry — including BlackBerry 10 — by the end of this year (2016).This must be disheartening for BlackBerry fans to hear, especially those who decided to pick up the BlackBerry Leap that was launched in Malaysia May of last year. If you couple that with the fact that even BlackBerry themselves seem to be abandoning their proprietary OS with a shift towards Android, things aren’t looking up for BB fans.WhatsApp is one of the most used applications — and the most used instant messaging application based on a recent study — in Malaysia, so terminating support for relatively new devices that run on BlackBerry 10 must be painful for those on the OS.Nevertheless, this is potentially good news for the rest of us who use Android, iOS or Windows Phone devices because since WhatsApp are streamlining their support, we can expect a more focused approach to development. Without the worry of compatibility or limitation across too many platforms, more features can be added to the messaging system.This move by WhatsApp is definitely understandable, as they explain that 99.5% of mobile sales are of devices that run either Google, Apple or Microsoft’s operating systems. It wouldn’t make sense to keep supporting operating systems that almost nobody buys anymore, but couldn’t they held off on the BlackBerry 10 cut at least for awhile longer?[SOURCE, VIA]"

At 12.9 inches, it can be a little tricky to hold and use in one hand which may have turned some off it.Still, that didn’t stop it from outselling Microsoft’s entire Surface lineup in Q4 of 2015. If the only thing stopping you from picking one up yourself is the size, we have good news for you because it looks like Apple has plans to launch a 9.7-inch iPad Pro.What everyone thought was going to be the iPad Air 3, may actually turn out to be a smaller iPad Pro as 9to5Mac reports. It is said to come with the same monstrous A9X processor, quad speakers and compatibility with the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard which should translate to pretty stellar performance figures.Despite what seems like a bump up the iPad hierarchy, 9to5Mac says that the smaller iPad Pro will be priced closer to the iPad Air‘s line of products. If this turns out to be true, it looks like Apple could be replacing the iPad Air line with this tablet, thus tightening and streamlining its iPad lineup.We like this move as it only brings less confusion to buyers, it also usually means that each product would be more focused and precise, allowing it to be clearly differentiated from others in the line.It is also said that Apple could discontinue the first-generation iPad Air and iPad mini 2 when this new mini iPad Pro supposedly launches in Apple’s March event. Other things to look out for during that event is the unveiling of the purported smaller 4-inch iPhone 5se plus new Apple Watch band options.As mentioned earlier, performance should be unaffected, and since they’re bringing over the iPad Pro’s excellent quad speakers and display, media consumption and gaming should be better than ever now that it’s in a more portable form factor.That said, shrinking the size down to 9.7 inches seems like it would go against the design philosophy Apple had for their iPad Pro line where Tim Cook himself said would be a laptop replacement 2-in-1 device. A smaller screen means less real estate for multitasking and productivity tasks, thus hampering its capability as a workhorse.It seems to be an interesting turn of events then, but keep in mind that these aren’t officially confirmed specifications though 9to5Mac has a reputation for being fairly reliable with such information. Nevertheless, do take this with a pinch of salt.What do you think about this move from Apple? Were you anxiously waiting for the iPad Air 3? Drop us a comment down below.[SOURCE]"

Many well-known apps are missing and that’s just one of the reasons why people don’t even start to consider the operating system. For the year 2015, Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store have at least 1.2 million apps each – Windows? Only 300,000.Redmond wanted to solve this, by introducing a Windows Bridge platform aka Project Astoria. Through the project, app developers could easily just port over the same Android code that they used to make apps for the Google Play Store for Windows Phone devices.Then, last year rumours flared up that Project Astoria was going bust and now Microsoft has confirmed it themselves.Their statement follows:“[Microsoft] announced the Windows Bridge for Android (project “Astoria”) at Build last year, and some of you have asked about its status. We received a lot of feedback that having two Bridge technologies to bring code from mobile operating systems to Windows was unnecessary, and the choice between them could be confusing. We have carefully considered this feedback and decided that we would focus our efforts on the Windows Bridge for iOS and make it the single Bridge option for bringing mobile code to all Windows 10 devices, including Xbox and PCs. For those developers who spent time investigating the Android Bridge, we strongly encourage you to take a look at the iOS Bridge and Xamarin as great solutions.”Acquiring Xamarin is a shortcut but a painful one, considering all the hours spent trying to make Astoria come to life. Microsoft acquisition by default makes Astoria an overkill, as Xamarin does the same thing across not one but three platforms.That kills coding problems associated with porting from Android and iOS in one shot. So sharing the same common code makes a cross-platform app release be a much easier task.So Windows Phone is on its last run but will it make a comeback that’s worth talking about?

Instead of integrating it as a swipe menu like the Mac’s Notification Center, it will live in the Mac’s Menu Bar. According to 9to5Mac, like the Spotlight icon, a Siri icon in the top right corner of the menu bar will activate the voice control feature.When the Siri button is clicked, a dark, transparent Siri interface will appear at the top right corner. The colourful sound waves like those on the iPhone, indicating speech input, will also appear on the interface.Another interesting feature is that the “Hey Siri” command will also be available on OS X.

In addition to the unlimited calls and SMS, Maxis are also throwing in 500MB of roaming data per day on top of your existing data quota. If this isn’t enough or if you run out of quota, you can purchase additional data at the same rate as it would be in Malaysia. Keep in mind that this plan automatically activates once you have international roaming charges that exceed RM10. Otherwise, you will be charged accordingly.From the looks of it, this is a one-of-a-kind plan by Maxis, bundling unlimited calls and SMS when roaming plus the ability to use your existing local data quota overseas. Comparatively, the other telcos are only offering unlimited daily data roaming for about the same price.Perhaps the best part is that all of this is done automatically, even the selection of roaming networks. Simply turn on data roaming and Maxis will connect to their preferred roaming partners saving you the headache of manually choosing the operators and accidental exorbitant charges when you connect to the wrong network. This definitely eliminates a lot of potential headaches, something you don’t need more of when travelling.The only drawback is that this is exclusive to MaxisONE postpaid plan subscribers, so others on the Maxis network, even MaxisONE Business (but more roaming offers are coming soon), who are not under the MaxisONE postpaid plan banner aren’t eligible for this.As icing on the cake, Maxis are also providing a travel insurance plan to all subscribers of the MaxisONE World plan. Once your plan has been activated, you will be eligible for the Travel Protection Plan which covers benefits like medical and accidental plus travel inconveniences like loss of travel documents, baggage and even baggage delay. For more information on this, you can head on over to their website.As part of the first phase of the MaxisONE World rollout, it is now available in 8 ASEAN countries — Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Brunei, Philippines, Cambodia and Laos. Maxis is pushing for the next phase to happen in Q3 later this year which will widen its availability to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.If you’d like to find out more, you can head on over to the plan’s main page and browse through their FAQ located at the bottom of the page."

It’s simple and straight to the point while also giving potential job applicants a glimpse into the working environment and culture at the Maxis office.Based on the video, we learn that Maxis operates on a free-seating and open office layout — so no tiny cubicles that make you feel cut off from the world — with plenty of large open windows that let in a lot of natural light. With this free-seating arrangement, Marcus the app guy says you can sit next to a different person (or we’re guessing the same person as well) every single day if you wanted “even next to the CEO”.The video also demonstrates the potential learning opportunities a job at Maxis would entail, via professional courses and online learning tools. You’re also encouraged to keep healthy with Maxis’ own fitness trainers and activities including…Mixed Martial Arts? Talk about the best way to relieve stress.But, perhaps best of all is that Maxis encourages people to step up and find innovations that rewrite the rules. Well, that and the fact that you can come to work in casual Friday attire every single day — as long as you reign it in a little.Now, I can’t attest to how accurately it reflects the actual company’s workplace culture or the environment, but from the brief video, they’ve piqued my interest enough to make me want to find out. It’s refreshing, to say the least, and it also means we might not have to rely on services like Glassdoor as much."
Alexander Wong,TuneTalk claims to have 8G.

Malaysian MVNO TuneTalk has sprung out of nowhere to announce “TuneTalk 8G” at MWC 2016. So what is this 8G TuneTalk is shouting about? Is it a network breakthrough or just a marketing gimmick? The enabler of Tune Talk 8G is based on a technology by Malaysian-based company called SWAG. That’s short for Super WiFi Anywhere you Go. Their solution is to provide the best and fastest internet connectivity possible from the current 4G LTE networks around you. This sounds similar to carrier aggregation on 4G LTE-Advance but it cuts across different telcos. Imagine surfing mobile internet utilising bandwidth from several 4G connections at the same time. Obviously, you’ll need a special MiFi-like device and the website showed a compact device that has 2 LAN ports at the back. It looks better than the “Tune Talk 8G” device at the top, which looks like a bulky tumbler. In terms of speed, Tune Talk claims it could deliver up to 160Mbps and an average of 66Mbps during congested peak-hour situations. This was tested around KL Sentral in Malaysia. To prove its capability, they have uploaded a video speedtest with four 4G LTE connections on Digi, Tune Talk (Celcom), Maxis and U Mobile. We suggest viewing it at full screen at Full HD.While the idea is great, this is far from “8G speeds”, if there’s one defined in the first place. At 160Mbps, that’s faster than what we could get on LTE-A in Malaysia but it still falls under 4G speeds. Even Qualcomm is making 1Gbps on 4G possible with its latest LTE modem.For TuneTalk to claim 8G is just a marketing gimmick and it is quite misleading since there’s no explanation of what 8G stands for? 4G + 4G = 8G perhaps? Another question mark would be the cost of utilising 4 different telcos. Tune Talk might be able to strike a deal for bulk data access but we doubt Maxis, Digi and U Mobile would let their competitor utilise their LTE bandwidth for cheap.According to TuneTalk, the “8G” device will be launched in Malaysia by Q3 this year. So let’s see in 6 months time. What do you think? Leave your thoughts down below in the comments."

On the front, it is a downgrade from the Mi 4 as it only sports a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. That said, keeping the lights on is a larger 3,260 mAh battery which should do pretty well especially since it is only powering a 1080p display.It will also have a fingerprint sensor at the back of the smartphone, like that on the Redmi Note 3. What’s good is that this device will be sporting a glass front and back plus rounded metal rails much like those on the newly announced Sony Xperia X series.The device will also feature dual-SIM support plus 4G with VoLTE support. Xiaomi’s new Mi 4S will come in four colours — White, Gold, Black, and Lavender — and will go on sale in China from 1st March at a price of RMB1,699 (around RM1,100).That’s a pretty good deal considering the specs and if you factor in the fact that it has a premium metal and glass build, this phone is a steal. Unfortunately, this smartphone is currently only available in China with no word on outside availability yet.[SOURCE, VIA]"
Rory Lee,Xiaomi’s latest flagship smartphone is a stunning piece of kit,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/24/xiaomi-mi-5-official-launch-mwc-2016/,"mi 5 mwc 2016,mobile world congress 2016,mwc 2016,xiaomi,xiaomi launch,xiaomi launch mwc 2016,xiaomi mi 5,xiaomi mi 5 launch,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2016-02-24,"The final flagship from MWC 2016 has dropped and it is from Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi with their brand new Mi 5 — and it’s a beautiful beast.Several days before the official announcement, Xiaomi has been teasing the capabilities of the Mi 5, starting with the camera where they posted pictures that their president Bin Lin had taken with the Mi 5 on his Lunar New Year holiday. They also launched a series of videos featuring record holders blitzing through tasks like jumping rope and solving a Rubik’s cube, emphasising the Mi 5’s speed.We also have the failed attempts from Hugo Barra, but I don’t think that has anything to do with the smartphone’s speed — at least I hope not. But now, we finally get to see if the Mi 5 really lives up to the expectations Xiaomi has set for it.For starters, the Mi 5 will sport a 5.15-inch full-HD near-bezel less Sunlight display on the front which Xiaomi seems to think makes a big difference over the 5.1-inch and 4.7-inch displays on both the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6S.On the inside, it will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest next-gen Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor paired with either 3GB or 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and a choice of 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of internal UFS 2.0 flash storage which Xiaomi says posts a blistering AnTuTu score of 142,084. The key point here is it doesn’t sport a microSD expansion slot, but with a 128GB option, things aren’t so bad.For optics, the device gets a 16MP rear-facing f/2.0 Sony IMX298 camera that sits flush at the back with PDAF, while a 4-megapixel 2 micron large pixel selfie shooter graces the front. The primary camera features a 4-axis OIS, which you can check out in this video:Other features include a front fingerprint scanner, dual-SIM, LTE-Advanced and VoLTE support, Bluetooth 4.0 and support for NFC with MIUI 7 running on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow preinstalled. Keeping everything running is a moderate 3,000 mAh battery with Quick-Charge 3.0 via USB Type-C.
One unique thing about the Xiaomi Mi 5 is the fact that it sports what Xiaomi calls “3D ceramic glass” which forms the back of the phone. At the front it’s glass as usual with a metal frame holding both panels together. It also has a slight curve on the back much like the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy Note 5 including Xiaomi’s own Mi Note.The device will come in three colours — Black, White and Gold (which has an exclusive back etched design) — and prices are as follows:Xiaomi Mi 5, Snapdragon 820 SoC clocked at 1.8GHz, 3GB RAM, 32GB of storage with 3D glass back – RMB1,999 (around RM1,295)Xiaomi Mi 5, Snapdragon 820 SoC clocked at 2.15GHz, 3GB RAM, 64GB of storage with 3D glass back – RMB2,299 (around RM1,490)Xiaomi Mi 5 Pro, Snapdragon 820 SoC clocked at 2.15GHz, 4GB RAM, 128GB of storage with 3D ceramic back – RMB2,699 (around RM1,750)These devices will be available in China starting 1st March with global availability coming soon."

Yeah, the times where you’ve just announced you’re jobless or gone through a bad break up. I received it too on other posts that would never be socially acceptable to “Like” but now my friends will be able to react with five other ways.Apparently folks in seven countries have been Facebook’s lab rats, testing the extended “reactions” with positive feedback going all around.  It took Facebook a good year but at least, there will be less misplaced positive vibes and more emotionally appropriate reactions as it launches across Android, iOS and browsers.How will you get to see these new reactions? Just hover over the “Like” button and it’ll expand to show the other reactions, that includes: Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry. Notifications coming in too will change, with it stating someone has “reacted” to a post rather than just “liked” a post.The research that went into fundamentally deciding which reactions would make the cut went as far as looking at people’s one-word reactions on posts (yes, Facebook was spying on us). They also looked at the feelings most displays through their sticker options.Launching a feature across all 1.44 billion active users will take more than a couple of days but be on the lookout for a new update for those on Android and iOS. Users on browsers will just have to patiently wait, as the desktop updates usually just happen gradually.When Engadget asked why “dislike” wasn’t on the list Facebook’s Product Manager had this to say “It would have been too binary”. He adds that the whole point of adding reactions was to make expressions multi-dimensional.We all would appreciate a “dislike” button would we not?Here’s one just for the sake of it![ SOURCE, VIA ]"

It comes with a whole host of new features that are easy to drown in if you’re not a big techie. To help you out, we thought we’d pick out some of the device’s most significant features.Here are the seven things you need to know about the Xiaomi Mi 5.Since its a flagship, it isn’t surprising that Xiaomi has loaded the new Mi 5 with as much of the cutting edge tech that they could and their efforts have yielded what looks like the most powerful Xiaomi device ever.This 5.15-inch full HD device packs the new Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with up to 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 128 GB of UFS 2.0 flash storage. Xiaomi claims that the Mi 5 posted a blistering AnTuTu benchmark of 142,084 which completely trumps anything produced by last year’s flagships. It looks like a seriously fast phone, however, it is worth noting that the base model Mi 5’s processor is clocked at a lower 1.8GHz as opposed to the other two’s 2.15GHz.With their premium flagship, Xiaomi have also introduced an advanced 4-axis optical image stabiliser (OIS) to help the Mi 5’s 16MP f/2.0 primary camera eliminate handshake blur. In their demo video above, they compared it to the unstabilised iPhone 6S and the OIS-enabled iPhone 6S Plus, revealing stunning results. This may well be the best smartphone camera Xiaomi have ever produced.Despite the Mi Note, Redmi Note 3 and Redmi 3‘s excellent build quality, when people think of Xiaomi, they still associate its phones with the kind of cheap plasticky finish that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  Well, Xiaomi is hoping to completely shed that belief with the Mi 5 because it sports a truly impressive build quality.Reminiscent of the Mi Note’s construction, the Mi 5 sports two panels of glass on the front and back, held together by a metallic frame. The back panel is curved to help fit in your hand better, and the highest Mi 5 Pro variant sports what Xiaomi calls a 3D ceramic back plate that comes with an etched holographic pattern. This ceramic back plate is water resistant and durable up to 8H on the Mohs hardness scale."

Both showed off their flagship smartphones vying for your attention and, of course, your hard earned cash. But between the two devices, I think the LG G5 is a bigger deal than the Galaxy S7, and here’s why.LG’s G5 showcases a seriously attractive alternative to current smartphone conventions. It is the most innovative product I’ve seen at this year’s Mobile World Congress. The G5 is, essentially, the pioneer in a new breed of smartphones — one that could very well change the way manufacturers make phones and change the expectations we, the consumers, have for smartphones.It blew my mind because of one simple reason: It is, in essence, a modular smartphone and it is because of this that I think the G5 has the edge over the Galaxy S7.I won’t deny that the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are absolutely fantastic smartphones — almost perfect, even — but, in building the Galaxy S7, Samsung went down a familiar path. Samsung took a successful formula — the Galaxy S6 — and improved virtually every aspect of it. As a result, you get a phone that’s immensely capable but one that does very little to change the game.LG, on the other hand, went all out with their brand new G5. They went with a completely redesigned form from the older G4, while at the same time, rewriting the smartphone playbook with its modular design.The modular smartphone, a concept introduced by Project Ara in 2013, is still some time away and while the actual vision of a smartphone that you build, customise and upgrade like a Lego set is far from the G5’s modular capabilities, this is a starting point. LG can only improve on this modular idea in future releases.While the LG G5 isn’t completely modular, thanks to its removable bottom panel, you can change the capabilities of the device. On launch day, LG showed two modules — a dedicated camera control module and a Hi-Fi DAC (Digital-to-Analog Controller) plus amp — which demonstrate some of the features you can add to your smartphone.These two modules merely skim the surface and with help from third-party developers, LG is opening the doors for more useful and practical add-ons in the future. And if this modular concept catches on, the possibilities are potentially limitless. Kudos to LG for taking the bold step, let’s hope this goes far."

Smartphone cameras are getting good with the Microsoft Lumia 950 (XL), Nexus 6P, and Samsung Galaxy flagships leading the charge.So what does LG have to bring to the table?At MWC 2016, LG decided to be bold and the response has been well-received. The whole modular concept will be table talk around the world for most but people might forget about that dual camera module on the LG G5.Maybe it’s because HTC, honor, ZTE and the likes have done so with little success. Out of the three, HTC’s Ultrapixel on the One M8 would probably be the most (in)famous. People didn’t like it, period. The next two years are supposed to strike a dual-camera trend – Sony thinks so anyway – but has LG managed to outdo the rest?Let’s see what the LG G5 is made of."
Rory Lee,"I’m sorry, this smartphone has how much RAM?",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/23/vivo-xplay-5-6gb-ram/,"android,vivo,vivo 6gb ram,vivo smartphone,vivo xplay 5,xplay 5,xplay 5 6gb ram,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,vivo",2016-02-23,"Faster, bigger, lighter, stronger…as technology gets better and better at a faster and faster rate, we expect faster processors in our mobile devices, more memory, a bigger battery, a better camera, more of everything but surely we’ll come to a point where you start to wonder when is enough, enough.It seems Chinese company Vivo believes that there shouldn’t be a limit. The company has announced the Vivo Xplay 5 — a smartphone that will be packing a whopping 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM! That’s the biggest RAM ever integrated into a smartphone. The Xplay 5, running Qualcomm’s next-gen Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor, will be packing more RAM than most computers.But, do you need 6GB of RAM?RAM, (Random Access Memory), can be thought of as a computer/device’s short term memory. It’s called random-access because this memory is volatile and will not stay saved in a system — it “forgets” as soon as you switch off the power. In a traditional computer, RAM helps with multitasking and the more RAM there is, the more (and more complex) processes a computer can handle.On a desktop/laptop system, a lot of RAM is needed to keep everything running smoothly because we usually use our PCs like workhorses — having multiple applications and browser tabs open at the same time uses RAM. The more RAM you use, your PC will start to slow down and the easiest way to speed things back up again is to either close some tasks to free up memory or completely reboot the computer.This is very much the same case with your smartphone (which is basically a computer that can fit in your palm) so the more RAM your device has, the more processes it can do at one time making it faster and smoother. It will also be able to handle more apps running simultaneously, whether it be in the foreground or the background.By that logic, more RAM is always better and this is true…to a certain extent. You see, to run the current applications that are available for smartphones — even the most intensive games and apps — 3GB of RAM will, in most cases, be more than enough. Even the highest of high-end smartphones today come with 4GB of RAM because that is more than enough to run anything you can throw at it in most cases.6GB in a smartphone though is bordering on the excess. Would your smartphone be better with 6GB of RAM? Sure! Do you really need 6GB of RAM to keep your phone running smoothly? Maybe not.If anything, I think Vivo are cramming 6GB of RAM into their smartphone for nothing more than bragging rights — after all, when the Xplay 5 launches, it will likely be the first smartphone ever to sport 6GB of RAM. And who doesn’t like to be first?That said, having the most RAM does not necessarily equate having the best performance. The key is optimisation. A good example would be Apple‘s iPhone 6S Plus which, we found out recently, beats down pretty much every high-powered smartphone out there on AnTuTu.And the iPhone 6S Plus did so with only 2GB of RAM.In fact, too much RAM could potentially be worse for you as a customer because more RAM usually equates a higher price. That means you will likely have to pay waaay more than necessary just so you can tell your drinking buddies that you have a phone with 6GB of RAM.Also, more RAM means your phone will using more battery. In fact, battery drain has been a limiting factor to why phones don’t come with bigger RAM already. That means you’ll need a bigger battery to run bigger RAM, which also means additional cost and bulk.So, do you need 6GB of RAM? Let us know in the comments.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Most of us are blessed with the tools that we rely on to connect ourselves with the world. An idealistic view would be equal opportunity for everyone in the world.Who knows the unlocked potential and opportunities of these individuals that stand outside these privileged circles.The Android One program wants to realise a dream that people all over the world will have access to a smartphone and this is the highest specced smartphone yet to come out of the program. This is the GM Plus 5 and with it, people are going to be ready to take on the technological world.That’s just one reason why we’re looking at the General Mobile 5 Plus. The other is because it’s actually a smartphone that I’d consider getting for myself – anything that runs pure vanilla would warrant a second glance. Coming out of Turkey, this device pushes a Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution on its 5.5-inch screen.You’d be surprised that despite being a part of the Android One program; the manufacturer paid attention to the details. Off the bat, you’ll notice that the glass up front has a 2.5D taper all around while protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. All its internals sit in a metal chassis and the rear is encased by a textured back cover that comes in four colours.Multitasking shouldn’t be a bother with Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 Octa-core chipset mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. If you’re a memory hog, you’ll rest easy knowing that there’s a microSD slot for expandable storage.For all things photography, the primary and secondary shutters are both 13-megapixels. They’re also both equip with autofocus and flash for those low light shots: dual-flash on the rear and a single-flash on the front. General Mobile quotes that the camera sensors were tuned by the folks at DxOMark which mean they took imaging seriously.Juicing all its internals is a 3100mAh lithium ion battery which charges via a USB Type-C port. And did we mention it supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0? Some OEMs should be embarrassed by now.Being an Android One device automatically allows the GM 5 Plus to run the latest version of Android, so you can expect Marshmallow 6.0.1 on this feature pack device. The GM 5 Plus will also be guaranteed Android updates for 18 months from the time of release. Adding to its spec sheet is support for 4G LTE connectivity up to Cat7.The device will go on sale in Turkey and 15 other countries, costing roughly US$ 300 (RM 1256.71).[ SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

Leaps and bounds have been made in almost all other parts of tech but when it comes to batteries and charging, it moves on at a slower pace.They don’t happen often but when they do, they make a big difference.OPPO just dropped their new charging Super VOOC technology at MWC 2016. Here’s what you need to know about it.It’s taken just three years for OPPO to announce Super VOOC that charges a smartphone from 5% to full in 15 minutes. Yup, during the presentation they plugged in a smartphone with a 2500mAh battery and by the end of it, it was all topped up.In the past their fast charging technology was capable of charging a device for five minutes and have it last for 2 hours of talk time to now, charging for five minutes will have it lasting 5 times longer.Low voltage makes all the difference for OPPO’s Super VOOC fast charging, doing away with the need for a voltage converter.They claim that their 5V charge is delivered at a lower rate than Qualcomm and MediaTek’s alternatives with big advantages being that your phone stays cooler, improves efficiency and prevents any sort of battery damage.Seemingly, when you keep the charging temperatures at a minimum, your battery’s longevity will last a lot longer, so fewer worries about old worn out batteries.Faster, safer and cooler. Sounds good to us.It isn’t just all about the charger as the battery has to be a “Super Battery”, utilising some sort of military grade material and there’s some software involved as well. OPPO has said that there will be no limitation as to what port is utilised on a device, so it’ll work on future ports without any issues.Since we’re comparing apples to apples, Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 does 0 to 80% charge in 35 minutes. They were formerly the fastest but now that’s considered child’s play.We want this now! On non-OPPO phones too, of course. Will they be kind with their patents? Nah, probably not but let’s hope others start coming up with amazing battery charging technology too.We’ll bring you more info regarding Super VOOC when we know more. Drop us a comment below to tell us what you think, will you now consider an OPPO device?"

Our photos live in many ways across many illustrations and the way we capture them have now moved to the little sensors that occasionally give our smartphones a camera hump and visors.Now that our cameras are handheld and no longer require tripods, the image stabilisers that live within these lenses are all we require. They’re very important these stabilisers, without them our photos would be a blurry mess.The SmartSensor that OPPO just announced is the first of its kind. Collaborating with MEMS Drive, the duo now has upped the smartphone camera game.Putting all three-axes of stabilisation with their new image stabiliser could mean that OPPO smartphones could be as steady as an SLR camera. In the past, this wasn’t possible as smartphone cameras were usually too small to have a lens-based image stabiliser.Using a lens-based sensor has limitations – only two axes of motion instead of three. Sensor-based stabilisation goes for the full three and is possible with advancements in MEMS tech. The sensor itself is as thin as a couple of sheets of paper and makes quick adjustments with monocrystalline silicon.Image stabilisation in just 15 milliseconds.Lens-based on the left, SmartSensor on the rightAnother plus point is that the SmartSensor doesn’t suck up much power and the lens doesn’t heat up as much. Sony could probably make use of this since their smartphones heat up like a hotcake when taking photos but their amazing SteadyShot stabilisation makes up for that – you can see it in action here. Lens-based stabilisation is also 10 times more pinpoint when compared to its alternative.Why does this all matter? Simple – OPPO smartphones will now produce less jittery images on their cameras.As an afternote, Malaysia made its way onto the projector at Barcelona when OPPO looked at some market research. The study by Nielsen aimed to prove that we Malaysians prioritised camera functions the most in OPPO smartphones.Regarding the new image stabiliser, we’ll test this out in person before saying anything but if it works as advertised it’ll be a God sent for people with tremoring hands."
Rory Lee,Does X mark the end for the Xperia Z series?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/23/does-x-mark-the-end-for-the-xperia-z-series/,"mobile world congress,mwc 2016,no more xperia z,smartphone,sony,sony mwc 2016,sony xperia x,sony xperia x performance,sony xperia xa,sony xperia z,sony xperia z dead,sony xperia z5,android,mobile devices,mobile os,rumour mill","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Sony",2016-02-23,"If you’ve been following our coverage of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, you would have undoubtedly caught Sony‘s launch of their brand new Xperia X lineup. A curious launch because the Xperia X Performance featured a set of killer specs that many felt should have found their way into the Xperia Z6 instead.This led to wild speculation that Sony could be replacing their Xperia Z series, speculation, that if this recent post by Sony Mobile DACH is to be believed, could prove true.Can’t read German? Well, neither can I but thankfully someone on Reddit does and according to user u/laxor09, the message translates to:“Hi Sarah, there will be no Z6. The new X series is under a modified concept that meets the needs of our users even more. You can of course still rely on the latest technology in our smartphones – which has nothing to do with the name. Best regards, your Sony team.”“There will be no Z6”. The plot thickens. Can we believe this piece of information?Well, before deciding, it is worth pointing out several key factors in said comment. The first is the fact that when they said that there would be no Z6, they did not specify a time frame. For example, they didn’t say that there would be no Z6 ever. Without the time quantifier, it becomes hard to take what they say with absolute certainty because for all we know, they could have simply meant to say that there would be no Z6 launched here at the Mobile World Congress — which opens up the possibility of a Z6 further down the road.Secondly, they mentioned that the new X series is a “modified concept that meets the needs of our users more”. Note the keyword “modified” and the absence of any indication that Sony was “replacing” the Xperia Z series.Finally, when we spoke to a Sony Mobile representative during the launch of the Xperia X series yesterday, he said that it wasn’t a replacement, but a product that focuses on different consumers. Possibly a regurgitated scripted answer, but we thought was worth mentioning anyway.But, for the sake of covering our bases, let’s assume that yes, Sony did replace the Xperia Z with the Xperia X series, would that be such a bad thing?Well, from our hands-on, we don’t think so. The Xperia X is a series of handsome looking devices — all of which feature a robust and curvier design language, departing from the sharp and prickly edges of the Xperia Z5. The Xperia X Performance felt exceptionally good with its premium brushed metal finish which is refreshing compared to the tired glass backs on the Xperia Zs of old.If performance is what you’re worried about, we’ve got nothing to complain as the top end Xperia X Performance packs a wallop with the all new Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with 3GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of expandable storage.It’s got a whole bunch of other flagship-worthy goodies too including a reasonable 5-inch full HD display (no 4K, sorry). It’s also got a top-of-the-line 23-megapixel primary snapper packing the 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS mobile sensor, 5x- Clear Image Zoom and a Sony f/2.0 G Lens that runs up to a mind-boggling 12,800 ISO. What’s more, you get a 13-megapixel selfie camera with a wide 22mm lens on the front.Not a slouch at all then. In fact, we think it’s a pretty worthy successor to the old Xperia Z5 that we weren’t terribly impressed with.That said, do keep in mind that this can’t really count as an official statement as there is the off chance that the person who replied to the comment is a rogue social media handler, so take it with a pinch of salt until we get a proper word from someone more credible.What do you guys think of this? Will you miss the Xperia Z series if the Xperia X does end up replacing it? Do you think the Xperia X is a worthy successor? Drop us a comment down below.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Apart from the glam devices launched at MWC 2016, the big yellow company has also released the world’s first thermal imaging smartphone with the CAT S60.Not only it gives you cool predator vision, it is built to last exceeding military spec.The main highlight of course is its FLIR Thermal Camera. With a live thermal imaging, it can show heat sources as indicated in red on the screen. You’ll also get real-time temperature reading in real time. The camera is so sensitive that it could pick up heat marks left behind by my palms on a flat surface.Some of the real life application include checking for leaks in the house, finding heat sources and spotting for people in life rescue situations. For security guards, they could use it to see intruders in the dark even through thick smoke. The possibility is endless and it works effectively with a range up to 100 feet (30 metres).The CAT S60 just screams rugged all over with a strengthened die cast frame and it gets a carbon-fibre look back. Designed like a power tool, it feels chunky in the hands and it is built to withstand drops onto concrete surfaces from up to 1.8 metre high. I wanted to put their claims to the test but was told to try that on production units since the one I’m holding is one of the 6 working prototypes in the world. Over at the front, it gets extra protection with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and the display also supports glove and wet finger tracking.Looking for the best waterproof smartphone? It can’t get better than this. While the CAT S60 has the same ingress protection rating of IP68, it is able to submerge under water up to 5 metres deep for a full hour. Move aside Sony, this is the world’s most waterproof smartphone.CAT isn’t holding back on its waterproofing capability, so you can confidently take this to take photos and videos underwater. The underwater camera (yes, that’s how they are calling it) is a 13MP shooter with dual-LED flash, while the front gets a 5MP camera. If you plan on taking this beyond 2 metres deep, just remember to shut off its speaker and microphone grill by flipping the tiny switches with your fingernail.As a smartphone, the CAT S60 is no slouch. While the front gets a modest 4.7” HD 720p display, it is powered by a decent Snapdragon 617 Octa-Core processor with 3GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage.Keeping the lights on is a huge 3,800mAh capacity battery, which should be more than enough to last overtime shifts. Being a 2016 device, it runs on Android Marshmallow out of the box. The CAT S60 will be available later in the year and it will be priced at US$599, which is around RM2,524. Come hell or high water, this phone is built to survive anything. This is no doubt the Chuck Norris of phones."

Humans develop computers and systems so advanced, we lose control over them…which eventually leads to them rising up against us, ending humanity as we know it.Why? Well, it’s probably because of these tests Boston Dynamics carries out on their robots, where it seems like the only requirement is to be a jerk to this poor bot.What a douche!While it does look like they’re just being complete jerks to these robots, all of this is done with a purpose because machines have historically been terrible at adapting to changing circumstances. Give them a set task to carry out and they’ll do fine, but if you alter one of the variables in the task, the machine will often not be able to figure out what happened.So, while on the surface it seems like the guy is simply bullying the robot, this form of exercise is vital to teach the robot how to adapt to extenuating circumstances, which will help develop more reliable bots in the future. Bots that won’t fail just because they fell over or got stuck in a corner.In this particular case, Boston Dynamics sets the new version of their Atlas robot through multiple scenarios, interrupting it as many times as possible to find out how well it copes with changing variables. What is equal parts cool and scary is that in the demonstration, the robot does extremely well in recovering, which really speaks to the effectiveness of these tests.That said, did he really have to do this to the poor guy?[SOURCE]"
Rory Lee,It turns out Bill Gates isn’t exactly #TeamFBI in the Apple vs FBI security debacle after all,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/23/it-turns-out-bill-gates-isnt-exactly-teamfbi-in-the-apple-vs-fbi-security-debacle-after-all/,"apple,apple backdoor,apple encryption,apple iphone,apple san bernardino,apple vs fbi,apple vs fbi san bernardino,bill gates,facebook,iphone backdoor,jack dorsey,john mcafee,mark zuckerberg,microsoft,privacy,safety,smartphone privacy,terror attacks,twitter,industry in general,ios,mobile devices,mobile os","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-23,"The case of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) forcing Apple to install a backdoor into their iPhones has been raging on for some time. While Apple is adamant that they don’t want to do so — based on this letter from Tim Cook to their customers — the FBI are pretty persistent in trying to get them to comply.With two opposing views, people will start to take sides and the most recent high-profile tech person to choose a side is Bill Gates and while it seemed like he was with the FBI in this case, recent reports indicate a more moderate stance.Privacy and security matters to us because there are plenty of things we want to be kept to ourselves. That much is reasonable, but when an act of terror like the San Bernardino attack, that cost the lives of 14 people, happens and the data vital to the investigation is encrypted in the terrorist’s smartphone, we have to wonder at what cost does privacy come?The court ruling was simple: Apple was to provide the FBI with a system to overcome the iPhone’s built-in security features — specifically the one that erases all the data on the iPhone after a certain number of failed login attempts. By doing so, the FBI could then brute force their way in (inputting all the possible variations of the password with a computer) and crack the encryption.Apple’s stand was that by doing so, it would risk every iPhone out there as they would have to install a “backdoor” into the system, a backdoor which Apple says could be abused and used to open other iPhones as well. This was a risk Cupertino was not willing to make.The feds assured everyone that this “backdoor” was not going to be abused but many have pointed out that all it takes is one rotten apple to leak it into the world and suddenly every iPhone becomes vulnerable. Clearly something Apple wants to avoid.Here is where Bill comes in. The founder of Microsoft said that all the FBI wants is access into ONE smartphone, which is something Apple should be able to do without undermining all their encryption. He also says that there should be safeguards in place (by Apple) when the government accesses such information.While many reported that due to his earlier statement, it meant Bill was siding with the FBI on this matter, but he has since come out and taken a more…moderate stance. Reports indicate that he isn’t fully backing the FBI, calling instead, for a broader discussion as he believes that a balance is important.When asked specifically on his stance, he said that the “courts are going to decide” and also that these “issues will be decided in Congress”. Am I the only one sensing a cop out here?That said, Bill did raise some valid concerns earlier. But if you look at Tim Cook’s open letter, he claims that Apple has put so much effort into their encryption that they’ve put access into their phones out of even Apple’s own hands. That’s why even they can’t crack the terrorists’ iPhone.Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but what is also interesting is the fact that Apple decided to make their resistance to this court order so public. It does make us wonder whether Apple is using this wave of controversy as a publicity stunt. In fact, the only way Tim could have made his open letter more patriotic is by replacing his periods with bald eagles. Either way, it’s working because this case is on everyone’s lips.Several high profile opinion leaders in the tech industry have spoken up about this issue, among which are Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey. While Mark sympathised with Apple‘s predicament, Jack openly declared his allegiance to #TeamApple.Even eccentric millionaire John McAfee (no points for guessing what he is the founder of) has offered to decrypt the problematic iPhone himself. In fact, John says that he can do so in just three weeks because his crack team is made up of “prodigies” that he believes the FBI simply “would not hire” because they have “mohawk haircuts, ear piercings, tattooed faces and a person who has to smoke weed while working and won’t work for less than a half-million dollars a year”.He’s so confident that not only will he do this for free, he also said that he would eat his shoe on the Neil Cavuto (an American television anchor) show if he fails. Seems like a tempting offer?So how important is privacy? The FBI seems to be arguing that it is important up until the point it stops them from saving lives, whereas Apple is sticking to their guns in keeping their customers’ information private.That said, it doesn’t seem like the FBI is asking for that much, after all, it’s just one smartphone right? Well, according to recent developments reported by the Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is now asking Apple to extract data from another 12 iPhones throughout the US. Are Apple’s concerns validated now?The space between privacy and safety is a tricky line to tread on. On one hand, without privacy, we won’t be able to rest properly with the knowledge that someone could be sifting through all our private information right now. But on the other hand, what if this potentially harmless backdoor into the encryption of our smartphones could save lives?Let us know what you think in the comments section below.[SOURCE, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"

The two excel at different things and are naturally used to things being a certain way. So when you design a smartphone’s software, you tend to gear your UI to certain elements that typically reflect the wants and needs of your consumer.LG says they’ve decided to change a key UI feature because they’ve done the necessary market research. After looking at the changes they’ve made in person, we can only say one thing:We want to see see those findings for ourselves – cause we’re not sure what they did was a good idea.A trend that they began with the LG V10 was a secondary ticker that gave the phablet an “Always On display” – it was small – unlike the LG G5 that uses its main display to show the “Always On” feature. Fortunately, if you’re not a fan you can turn it off in the settings on the LG G5 but a 0.8% per hour battery decrease shouldn’t hurt much.If you looked hard enough at the main photo of this post, you’d have probably picked it up. LG’s Marshmallow skin illustrates that they’re not playing small anymore and it shows with the omission of an app drawer.Say whatttttttt?LG G5 on the left; LG G4 on the rightYeah, they’ve joined the ranks of other Chinese OEMs that opt to go drawer-less. It makes things simple but it’ll be unfamiliar waters for most people that love how Android typically works. That all might change with reports that Android N going drawer-less itself but we’ll see how people adapt to the LG first before passing off conclusions.LG G5 on the left; LG G4 on the rightLG G5 on the left; LG G4 on the rightQ slide is nowhere to be seen too, so your notification pulldown menu is going to much cleaner. There’s also no more multi-window. The menus are also a lot whiter, moving away from the darker themes.Removing all that allows LG’s UI to be much less bloatware-ish but if you’re getting personal, I, myself prefer to have an app drawer to keep things neat. Something that’s supposedly the aim of slimming down the UI, making it the “simplest kind of interface, and make it as intuitive as possible”.The reasoning for choosing an Android device is usually when you want an open play box but when you start changing a system and it starts “looking” a lot like iOS – by coincidence or otherwise – people are likely to flip.If you don’t know much about the LG G5, you can check out our announcement post here.One thing is for sure, LG is going big but will they going home because of it?[ SOURCE, 2 ]"

The Malaysian launch for the flagship duo is confirmed for 18th March 2016, a week after its global debut. Nevertheless, the roll out is quite quick with just 25 days to go. Pre-orders for both devices will be available from 7 to 11 March but they have yet to confirm if Malaysia will be getting the Gear VR bundle promo. The official price for both Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will be revealed on the pre-order day as well. This latest update was confirmed during an interview with Mr. Lee Jui Siang, the VP of Samsung Malaysia. To recap, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are now released with 5.1″ and 5.5″ displays respectively pushing Quad HD resolution. Similar to the S6, it features both glass and metal construction with added refinement around the corners. Powering the device for Malaysia is likely to be their latest Exynos 8890 Octa-Core unit that’s mated with 4GB of RAM. On-board we are likely to get 32GB of on-board storage and this time, it is expandable with microSD up to 200GB with its hybrid dual-SIM tray design. For imaging, Samsung is taking it a notch higher with its dual-Pixel 12MP f/1.7 camera that boasts 95% brighter photos than the Galaxy S6. This also allows quicker focus in demanding low light situation. The front remains a 5MP shooter but it also gets a faster f/1.7 aperture lens.

This time around they’ve unveiled the Desire 530, 630 and 825, with what they call a “micro splash effect” which peppers the phones with sprinkles of colour. Whether or not you actually like them, is pretty much a matter of taste.However, its what’s ticking inside that makes the phones pretty basic. The Desire 530 to start has a quad-core 1.1Ghz Snapdragon 210 processor mated to 1.5GB RAM and 16GB storage expandable via MicroSD. It also has a 8 megapixel front and 5 megapixel rear camera combo, 2,200mAh battery and a 5 inch 720p display.Next up is the Desire 630, which is about the same as the 530 but has a more punchy quad-core Snapdragon 400 mated to 2GB RAM, a 13 megapixel rear shooter and sports a dual SIM (nano) capabilities where the Desire 530 only has one SIM slot.Last but not least is the Desire 825. Again, its roughly similar as the Desire 630, but has a bigger 5.5 inch 720p display, 2,700 mah battery and BoomSound stereo speakers. You also get a choice between single and dual-SIM variants, if you truly need more than one SIM.All three devices will be running Android 6.0 Marshmallow with HTC Sense. No word exactly when it will be hitting the Malaysian market but they will be hitting the shelves starting March.So what do you think of HTC’s new Desires? let us know in the comments.[SOURCE]"

Not just your regular flagship, this new Acer smartphone features a new feature up its sleeve — over 1TB of storage.The Liquid Jade 2 sports something called a hybrid storage functionality which makes use of cloud storage to keep your phone clutter free. Ring any bells? Yep, this implementation isn’t exactly new especially if you’re familiar with the Kickstarter phone the Nextbit Robin.Much like the Robin, it seems that the Liquid Jade 2 will utilise this same functionality to upload unused apps to the cloud for archiving and mass storage, but while the Robin gives you 100GB of cloud storage, Acer is throwing out a whopping 1TB of storage.What remains to be seen is if Acer’s implementation will be as effective and practical as that on the Robin — which has received a lot of praise for their particular innovation.Besides that, the Liquid Jade 2 features decidedly average specifications for a flagship as the 5.5-inch device sports a full-HD AMOLED panel with 100% NTSC colour gamut on the front. Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 808 processor mated with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of local storage.For optics, the Liquid Jade 2 packs a 21-megapixel PDAF sensor with dual-LED flash and support for 4K video recording. Selfies are taken care of by a front facing 8-megapixel snapper.The Liquid Jade 2 will feature a new Headphone:X technology for better sound quality over headphones — tech that Acer developed with their long time partner Dolby. What’s more, the Acer Liquid Jade 2 will feature a USB Type-C port.The device will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the boxAlongside this flagship device, Acer also launched two budget smartphones — the Liquid Zest and Liquid Zest 4G. Besides from the fact that one has 4G connectivity and a slightly more powerful processor, these two devices are nearly identical.The Liquid Zest is powered by a 1.0GHz quad-core processor while the Liquid Zest 4G is packing a 1.3GHz quad-core processor and support for 4G LTE connectivity.

Today, the brand struggles to produce phones than are on par with its competitors.Sony needs to do something drastic and start making devices that consumers can look forward to if they want to stay relevant. Their Marshmallow concept is the first step in the right direction but the devices that Sony come up with have to be really special. However, if the three new Xperia phones Sony revealed at MWC16 is anything to go by, the brand still has a long way to go.Let’s see what the new-for-2016 Xperia X range has to offer and you tell us if these three devices are capable contenders against the competitors.
At the top of the range, we have the Xperia X performance. The device features a 5-inch TRILUMINOS Full HD (1920 x 1080) display complete with Sony’s propriety, and very good, X-Reality and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement image enhancement technology on board. The Xperia Performance boasts a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 3GB RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage that’s expandable with microSD up to 200GB. Interesting to note here is that the 64GB option will be a dual-SIM variant while the 32GB unit will have a single SIM slot.The Xperia Performance also includes a fingerprint scanner that’s integrated with the side mounted power button and support for high-res front facing stereo speakers with a dedicated dedicated DAC (Digital Audio Converter).For taking pictures, there’s a 23-megapixel camera with an 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS for mobile sensor, 5x Clear Image Zoom, Sony F2.0 G Lens and a mind-numbing 12800 ISO. On the front, you get a 13-megapixel camera with a 22mm wide-angle lens.Powering the Xperia X Performance is a 2,700mAh battery with a claimed two-day run time. The Xperia X Performance also gets Sony’s trademark water and dust resistant capabilities with an IP68 rating.The Xperia X shares many of the specs of the Xperia Performance including the same screen size and resolution, the same front and rear cameras, as well as the same 3GB RAM and 32GB and 64GB storage options. The major difference is in the processor and the battery. The Xperia X comes with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 650 processor and a slightly smaller 2,620mAh battery.Unlike the Xperia X Performance, the Xperia X does away with Sony’s legendary water and dust-resistance capabilities and front-facing stereo speakers.The Xperia XA is Sony’s entry level X-series smartphone. It has a 5-inch HD (1280 x 720) display and a budget 64-bit MediaTek MT6755 processor with 2GB of RAM and only 16GB of internal storage. Fortunately, the memory is expandable with microSD up tp 200GB.In the camera department, the Xperia XA gets a 1/3-inch 13-megapixel rear camera while at the front, you get an 8-megapixel wide-angle shooter.The battery is the smallest of the range as well, at only 2,300mAh but Sony still claims a 2-day run time thanks to smart power management.Sony Xperia XA – €299 (RM 1,385.32)
Sony Xperia X – €599 (RM 2,775.27)
Sony Xperia X Performance – €699 (RM 3,238.59)Let this prices serve as a mere indication as Europe pricing has always been higher when compared to local pricing in Malaysia. Even so, what do you guys think would be an appropriate price range for these three devices?Also, pleases share with us any other thoughts on Sony’s new range.

Rory Lee,Test footage from Samsung’s new Gear 360 is pretty impressive,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/test-footage-from-samsungs-new-gear-360-is-pretty-impressive/,"360 degree camera,360-degree video,mwc 2016,samsung,samsung 360 video,samsung gear 360,samsung gear vr,samsung mwc 2016,samsung vr,cool stuff,mobile accessories,others","Cool stuff,Mobile Accessories,Others,Samsung",2016-02-22,"Remember this little golf ball from Samsung? It’s tiny and one of the most consumer friendly 360-cameras on the market — it even has its own tripod!Looking sweet is one thing, but what most of  you are concerned with is how it performs when shooting 360-degree video. Wonder no more as Samsung have uploaded several videos demonstrating the shooting and stitching capabilities of their tiny Gear 360.It’s pretty impressive. The quality isn’t too bad for a device that small and what really shines is how well everything is stitched together — probably due to that overlapping FOV (each lens shoots in 195-degrees). It’s not perfect, as is evident from the little distortion near the skier’s arms but overall its a pretty good effort.Looking at this second video showing a bunch of ballerinas, the stitching is even better, almost eliminating distortion. The same can be said for the freestyle soccer too, but if you pay attention you can see a dark ring (almost like a black rainbow) around the area where the video overlaps.To recap, the Gear 360 utilises two 15-megapixel cameras strapped back-to-back. It has the ability to shoot just under UHD quality which is pretty high, plus it takes 30-megapixel still photos. Each lens has an f/2.0 aperture so that should help out with low-light photography.It is designed to work best with Samsung’s new Galaxy S7 flagships (which you can check out here and here) where the footage would be shot on the Gear 360 then transferred to the smartphone wirelessly to be stitched. No computer necessary."
Arif Lee,Sony’s smart product concepts are mighty intelligent,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/sonys-smart-product-concepts-are-mighty-intelligent/,"mobile world congress 2016,mwc 2016,smart assistant,smart products,sony,sony concept,sony concepts,technology,xperia,xperia agent,xperia ear,xperia eye,xperia projector,cool stuff,industry in general","Cool stuff,Industry in General,Sony",2016-02-22,"Interactions happen every day on every level. We use our senses to navigate the world around us but are often too preoccupied and stuck on our screens to experience life. Our reliance on these screens at all times of day are disruptive (not in a business sense) – they destroy some relationships and friendships; they sometimes are a matter of life and death and overall is just a nasty habit.The disruption stops here with Sony Mobile’s Xperia smart products that’ll help you be more hands-free, eyes-free and voice smart when interacting with these devices. Smart assistants if you will.Sony’s first device will live in your ear and boss you around to get your life together. Going as the Xperia Ear, this Bluetooth earbud will converse with you via verbal commands; making it easier to navigate through your schedule, and go fully hands-free while checking through some of your smartphone’s typical features – weather and news.Since it’s your personal assistant, it’ll help you make calls, search the internet, put speech to text and even guide you to locations through GPS. All without looking at that darn screen of yours.The Xperia Ear is compatible with Android devices and will be controlled via a host app where you’ll be able to tweak settings based on your personal preference, it’ll also run you through a how-to the first time you use it.Made out of silicone, Sony wants you to have this in your ear throughout the day. It’s handy that it’s rated IPX2 and has a (claimed) all-day battery life. The earbud will arrive in a Graphite Black colour while you’ll charge the earpiece in its included case that doubles as a charger.Expect it to hit markets in Summer of this year.Still in an early concept stage, the Xperia Eye is a handy ultra-portable camera that’ll follow you wherever you want it to. Its size resembles an inhaler and attaches via a clip mechanism – usually to a piece of clothing. You can wear it as a necklace too.This is a deliberate showcase of Sony’s imaging technology in a small 360-degree spherical camera. Commands are conducted through voice or facial recognition – which is a bit freaky but its main purpose is to be always ready to take photos of the moments and people around you.A projector isn’t all that new but a projector that responds to touch is something that will blow many people’s minds. Not only that, it also reacts to voice and gestures – much like a smartphone. No, this isn’t Sony’s first rodeo when it comes to portable projectors as we talked about the Portable Ultra Short Throw Projector before.But this takes the cookie.More projection here but it’s more about the personal assistant side of things with the Xperia Agent. The device is essentially your personal EVE (see WALL-E), providing you with necessary info and controls to your smart home appliances.You’ll talk to it as it uses the same Sony voice technology and it takes off from there. Equip with a built-in camera and projector for screen gestures, we foresee the Xperia Agent making its way to homes around the world."
Rory Lee,Lenovo hits the low-end market with good vibes,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/lenovo-launch-budget-vibe-k5-vibe-k5-plus-mwc-2016/,"budget smartphone,lenovo,lenovo mwc 2016,lenovo vibe k5,lenovo vibe k5 plus,mobile world congress,mwc 2016,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-22,"Budget is where it’s at with smartphones these days as only a limited number of people have the money to fork out tonnes of cash to pick up a premium flagship smartphone. Lenovo isn’t a stranger to this market and they’ve recently released two more additions into the budget smartphone spectrum — the Vibe K5 and Vibe K5 Plus.Packing a not-at-all unreasonable spec sheet, the Lenovo Vibe K5 and K5 Plus are pretty decent options in the low-end of the market. The better spec-ed Vibe K5 Plus gets a 5-inch 1080p full HD display at the front while being powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor on the inside mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage (microSD up to 32GB).Keeping everything running is a 2,750 mAh removable battery, which should delight power users. For optics, it gets a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. It will support dual SIM and be LTE enabled.On the Software side, Lenovo is streamlining their skin of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop to remove the excess and keep everything running smoothly — important when you consider they have to rely on a Snapdragon 616. It is unfortunate that it doesn’t come with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, though, but we hope that it will receive an update somewhere down the line.Other goodies include a Dolby Atmos sound software plus two rear-facing speakers and a relatively nice build with good use of metal — something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market. The lower-end K5 simply drops the processor down to an octa-core Snapdragon 415 and the full HD display goes down to an HD display.Based on its asking price of USD149 (USD129 for the regular K5), which translates to around RM625, these smartphones’ biggest competitors look to be the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 — which has prices starting from RM699 in DirectD.What do you guys think about these entry level devices?

There’s a total of three relatively affordable devices, all running off Android 6.0 and there’s even one for business users.The TAB3 basically comes in three different flavours, 7 and 8 inch variants as well as a 10 inch “business model” for those who need a mobile work horse. All the devices come in under $200 so pricewise, they’re fairly competitive for what they’re offering.The smallest of the bunch, the TAB3 7 is a 7 inch tablet (if the names weren’t a dead giveaway) with a 1024 x 600 IPS display, 1GHz quad-core MediaTek processor under the hood mated to 1GB RAM and 16GB storage expandable via MicroSD. You also get a 5 megapixel rear and 2 megapixel front camera combo and LTE connectivity but not much else.  The TAB3 7 starts at $129 (about RM 542).The TAB3 8 on the other hand is its larger but cheaper brother, sporting a 1280 x 800 IPS display at 8 inches. Its essentially the same as the TAB3 7 except it doesn’t come with LTE connectivity for the baseline $99 (about RM416) device, but if you do want LTE be prepared to shell out an extra $50 for that model.Last but not least is the TAB3 10 Business. Its understandably got a bump up compared to its siblings because if you’re picking up this one, we’d expect you would want to get work done on it. Here you will get a 10 inch 1080p IPS display with a 1.3Ghz quad-core MediaTek processor under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM and 32GB expandable storage via MicroSD. You also get a 8 megapixel rear camera and 5 megapixel front snapper.The device will be running Android 6.0 with Android for Work, dual-band AC WiFi but no LTE, Like the Tab3 8, you’ll need to tack on an extra $50 for the LTE model, but there’s also the option for more RAM and storage (3GB RAM/64GB storage) with the $299 variant.  The TAB3 10 Business is also splashproof, so does that technically make it coffee resistant?The TAB 7 and 8 will hit the shelves this June, while the TAB3 10 Business will be available starting this July.[SOURCE]"

Well, you would definitely have heard it because malls, stores, and even some restaurants have been playing festive songs all month long.Lively music wasn’t the only thing that came with the Year of the Monkey, red/gold decorations have also adorned every nook and cranny of nearly every building. To commemorate the new year, you will also undoubtedly want to deck yourself out in red coloured gear. But, where do you start?Well, if you’re interested in tech, here’s a list of 8 different gadgets that will surely give you that ong glow.[IMAGE SOURCE]Apple’s iPod is a classic. One of the most iconic music players of our generation. Sure their popularity has dropped somewhat with the fact that smartphones can do almost everything, but if you’re taking that into account, every piece of tech has been somewhat affected. The iPod remains an icon though, and if you pick up the touch variant you get access to Apple’s App Store too.What’s more, this red variant of the iPod is under (PRODUCT)RED, where every piece of merchandise sold under this banner will contribute to the global fight against AIDS.[IMAGE SOURCE]If you want something affordable and red for the new year, look no further than Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi. Their popular 10,000 mAh Mi Power Bank also comes in a shade of red that will make anyone blush…if you reflect light off it onto someone’s face. It’s a capable little power bank and that has a wide capacity and a wide compatibility for large range of devices.[IMAGE SOURCE]Mice are great. Unless they’re of the pest variant, of course. The Logitech M337 is a capable little pointer that is compatible with Windows, Mac, Chrome OS and even Android. It’s a tiny little mouse that can fit in the palm of any hand (unless you’re baby Groot) and as a result is very easy to carry around. Plus it’s wireless and Bluetooth so all you really need is the mouse and your laptop/device.One of our favourite Bluetooth speakers yet. The UE Boom solidly built and produces a great sound. Plus, it’s water-resistant so you don’t have to worry about accidental spills damaging your precious soda can speaker. It’s so well built in fact that we reckon you could get away with a spot of bowling with it. We don’t recommend that of course, so do so at your own risk.[IMAGE SOURCE]Everyone’s (?) favourite watch finally arrived in Malaysia recently and it comes in a special red colour to usher in the Lunar New Year. But as with all limited/exclusive devices, it is only available for a limited time, so if you want one of these, be sure to snatch one up before 22 February.Ah a red smartphone! The ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser is ASUS’s attempt at slapping a laser autofocus system on a budget/midrange smartphone. While it will get you through daily tasks perfectly fine, don’t expect to be blown away by unbelievable value for money. It’s still a solid device though, and that curved red back plate is pretty nice to hold.[IMAGE SOURCE]Perhaps the other most iconic music player after the iPod is Sony’s Walkman. What started out as a simple cassette player that is almost permanently strapped to anyone’s belt in the era before CDs and digital downloads, has eventually graduated to a full-fledged digital audio player. Here’s one that plays Hi-Res Audio looking pretty slick in red. What’s more, they come with a pair of pink in-ear headphones.What’s the point in having so many red connected devices if you can’t get connected? Well, Yes has the solution for you. Yes, the Yes Huddle XS 4G Mobile Hotspot is a nifty little mobile broadband that lets you share your connection with up to 5 devices/users. What’s more, it’s tiny and discreet so you can carry it around with you with ease. It’s also got a long 6-hour battery life which will help keep you connected for longer. What’s more, Yes has an 85% population coverage nationwide, enabling Malaysians to stay connected anytime and anywhere across the country.Plus, if you sign up for their Super 88 Postpaid Plan with Huddle XS bundle that offers you a whopping 11GB of data for only RM88 a month, you can get the Huddle XS MiFi unit for free. Yup, absolutely free. This promotion is only available from now until 31 March 2016 though, so you’d better hurry up if you wanna capitalise on the deal.

Arif Lee,The LG G5 is now a real thing with modular parts playing a big part,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/21/the-lg-g5-is-now-a-real-thing-with-modular-parts-playing-a-big-part/,"always on,always on display,android,announcement,g5,htc legend,launch,lg,lg and friends,lg friends,lg g5,lg g5 battery,lg g5 flagship,lg g5 mwc 2016,lg mobile,lg mobile world congress 2016,lg mwc 2016,mobile world congress 2016,modular,modular battery,mwc 2016,removable battery,smartphone,south korea,mobile accessories,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,LG,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-21,"So it looks just how it was rumoured and the majority of reactions that we saw were negative. Are we just jumping the gun and passing our views without knowing the whole picture? That was the case during the Nexus 6P by Huawei with many throwing shade at the Stormtrooper visor. In the end, we warmed up to the idea and design.Will we embrace the same scenario this time? Well, let’s take a look at what the LG G5 has to offer.Let’s first start on paper and where else better to start than the screen it has: a 5.3-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440) display. Handling all its computing is Qualcomm’s crème dela crème Snapdragon 820 processor and it gets some help with plentiful of RAM – 4GB to be exact. There’s only one storage option listed at 32GB of internal memory but that’s when the special Magic slot comes into the picture.The South Korean manufacturer has done away with its plastic removable backs and the G5 is proof that they’re warming up to the metal unibody design language – metal is the new black after all. But when companies go for metal they have to sacrifice some nifty features that had fans of Samsung devices going berserk: a removable battery and microSD card.LG could’ve taken some inspiration from HTC seen on the Legend, they’ve done a much better job here as it looks a lot better. Popping the bottom chin off will allow you to swap out the battery and add some of its LG Friends accessories. They’ve also found a way to keep the microSD slot on board with expandability up to 2TB in theory.Since the pop out is on the chin now the rear has nothing to swap about but the familiar back placed fingerprint sensor is still there, also doubling as a home button. LG did away with their usual volume rockers and power button with only the volume toggles now on the left side.They’ve also decided on a horizontal camera module setup for the main camera(s) that provide a 135-degree wide angle stills. It’s possible thanks to two cameras a main 16-megapixel sensor complete with OIS and 8-megapixel secondary camera. Selfies, on the other hand, is taken care of an 8-megapixel shutter.Powering all this and charging via the port of the future (USB Type-C) is a small-ish 2800mAh lithium ion battery. We’re lucky that the G5 arrives with Quick Charge 3.0 and LG claims it’ll charge from 0% to 80% in only 35 minutes. While, the sole screen on the device has an always on display feature. Despite having the rather small battery, you’ll definitely appreciate that the always on display that only uses 0.8% of battery per hour.On the software front, as we expected it’ll run Android Marshmallow out of the box with LG’s own UI skin laid on top. Sadly the model that they showed off at MWC 2016 was a single-SIM 4G LTE model but we have our fingers crossed that they may be a Dual-SIM variant for other markets.Whenever you buy a smartphone you’re not only buying one device, it’s usually accompanied by accessories that make the experience better. We looked at the awesome add-on modules and peripherals that was called LG Friends here.LG’s latest flagship will come in four colours, Silver, Gold, Titan (Charcoal) and Pink."

LG knows this and wants to metaphorically do the same for its flagship smartphone. Google tried and are still toying around with modular parts through their Project Ara program and there’s even a smartphone case that lets you do the same.LG believes that we’re still yet to reach “peak smartphone” and whilst moving forward, modules and add-on peripherals are the paths to take. The idea is exciting and being the first to take it on is a big deal but if others follow suit and do better, trouble might loom.Leaks showing this modular removable battery threw us off the chairs at first and it was floating in the far-fetched part of the pool but now that the “Magic Slot” system has been realised, our interest levels have peaked.When LG took to the MWC 2016 stage, they talked a lot about life being good when you play more – the key word being play – when in considerations of entertainment and multimedia being the most upfront element in a smartphone."

All of this is supported by a large 4430mAh battery that will apparently give you 10 hours of usage per charge. That’s pretty much your work day right there. The screen on the other hand is a 12 inch IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 2160 x 1440.However, the Core M processor that’s running the show might be the device’s biggest Achilles heel. We’re not fans of the Core M chips and while they do run a lot cooler (and fanless) they trade off performance for the lower temperature and are generally really bad at multitasking.For a lot of devices, the accessories are barely more than afterthoughts, but this isn’t the case with the Matebook. Launching with the device is the MatePen, which surprisingly is a lot better than most pens you’ll find on the market. Not only is it balanced, it feels like you’re writing on paper as opposed to the feeling of writing on glass and has superb feedback and traction, especially since it supports up to 2048 levels of sensitivity.It comes with Autodesk Sketchbook that runs free for three months so you’ve essentially got a really powerful art tool at your disposal as well. Unfortunately the MatePen doesn’t come with the device and neither can it be stored magnetically like the one the Surface Pro 4, and has no way to be stored on the Matebook itself at all.The optional dock that the Matebook has available with even has a USB type-C adaptor and a microUSB adaptor that’s all magnetised for easy storage. The device does come with a keyboard case though, and that already is a pretty big plus in our book.Processor aside, the pricing for the Matebook is also a bit of an issue. With a basemodel starting at $699 (that’s about  RM2,941 for us) its quite expensive for a 12 inch tablet hybrid PC with an Intel M processor. Sure, there’s plenty of extras but with pricing like that, they might find it hard to persuade people to jump on their ship.Competition is expected to be pretty stiff considering how late Huawei is coming to the laptop/tablet game. The brand does want us to view the Matebook as a productivity option but it might be a bit tough for it to stand up against the likes of the Surface and other similar devices but it might be able to considering it really has a lot going for it.Stay tuned for more MWC 2016 coverage as it comes.More Huawei Matebook images:"

In terms of storage you’re getting a generous 64GB that’s extendable via microSD. As an added bonus, the phone uses a hybrid SIM slot, so it can support a dual-SIM setup if you need it.While the Elite x3 isn’t much to look at, its accessories really make it shine. The Desk Dock allows you to connect an external monitor via DisplayPort, the HP Mobile Extender allows the phone to transform into a 12.5-inch HD laptop powered by Windows just by slotting it in.

Rory Lee,Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge: The perfect smartphone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/samsung-galaxy-s7-and-s7-edge-official-launch-mwc-2016-the-perfect-smartphone/,"galaxy s7 official announcement,galaxy s7 official launch,mobile world congress 2016,mwc 2016,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy s7 edge,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-22,"Technology has made leaps and bounds in terms of improvements over the years with the ultimate goal of creating the perfect piece of tech. While the development of the smartphone has somewhat slowed especially in terms of hardware specifications and features, the challenge is now in refinement. In making something good, even better, in making something great…perfect.But is perfection what we really want?There is no denying that the Samsung Galaxy S6/S6 edge is a beast of a smartphone with the best of everything, a great build and a fantastic camera. How do you improve on something that’s already so good? You refine it.That’s exactly what Samsung did with the S6’s successor, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge.The Galaxy S7 has a gorgeous 5.1-inch Quad HD (2560×1440 pixels) SuperAMOLED display panel (577ppi). The Galaxy S7 edge has the same screen resolution but on a larger 5.5-inch display. On the inside, both variants will get either the next generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor, clocked at 2.15GHz, or Samsung’s own next-gen Exynos 8890 octa-core processor, clocked at 2.3GHz, depending on the market (Malaysia will probably get the Exynos version). Both these chips will be mated to 4GB of RAM and either 32/64GB of internal storage. This translates to a 30% improvement in CPU performance and more than 60% improvement in GPU performance over the previous Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. Keeping everything looking pretty is Samsung’s TouchWiz UI skinned on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Samsung has also reintroduced microSD support in the S7 and S7 edge with a card slot that takes cards up to a whopping 200GB.For optics, both Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will get Samsung’s new Dual Pixel 12-megapixel f/1.7 camera. Dual Pixel sounds like a fancy term, but it is basically an upgrade to the Phase Detection AF found on the Galaxy S6, where thanks to this technology, every pixel is focusing on the image at the same time.Samsung says that this translates to a near instantaneous focusing speed even in low light conditions. What’s more, because this 12MP sensor uses bigger 1.4 micron pixels (up from 1.12 micron) and a faster f/1.7 lens, the Galaxy S7 is supposed to give you 95% brighter photos.The Galaxy S7 gets a 3,000 mAh battery while the Galaxy S7 edge with the larger display gets a 3,600 mAh which is a big increase from the Galaxy S6’s 2,550 mAh and S6 edge’s 2,600 mAh battery. For charging, the S7 and S7 edge supports Samsung’s fast-charging technology as well as wireless charging which also now supports fast charging.Besides that, the Galaxy S7 also has a fingerprint scanner located under its home button with support for Samsung Pay.I’m sure many will be happy about the return of the microSD card slot. This popular feature that was missing from the Galaxy S6/S6 edge is making its return in the Galaxy S7/S7 edge. However, this improvement comes in the form of a hybrid SIM tray — you will have to pick either a single SIM and microSD or dual SIM and no microSD. A bit of a bummer, but at least you have the option of expandable storage now.The Galaxy S7/S7 edge is now water-resistant up to IP68 which means that while you’re not encouraged to take it for a swim, it will survive an accidental drop in the pool. The open ports on the S7 and S7 edge have a special water-repellent coating that negates the need for fiddly flaps and port closures (a major bane for older IP-rated Samsung phones). This is nice and makes the design of the S7 and S7 edge sleek and clean.Also new is the always-on display feature that uses minimal power to show basic useful information and notifications like calendar appointments, the time, among other things.Samsung have also included some dedicated gaming features. One of which is called the “Game Launcher”. What it does is let you control how you want to play your games — better graphics and higher performance, or lower graphics and longer battery life — as well as shuts off background tasks and alerts when you’re gaming so you are not interrupted by notifications.Heat build-up is always a major issue with Samsung devices. To fix the issue, Samsung has build into the S7/S7 edge a water cooling system that consists of copper piping filled with water surrounding the processor to help disperse heat during intense usage or gaming sessions.While the Galaxy S6 edge was a novel concept, we didn’t like the limited functionality and features of the edge screen display on the S6 edge. Samsung has sorted this out and increased the function and features of the edge screen display on the Galaxy S7 edge.Among these are the increased edge screen real estate which translates to the device being able to display more information and more functionality for the edge screen. You have extensive edge features such as an updated People edge, Apps edge and Tasks edge. You also have access to a number of Quick tools like a ruler, a compass and a flashlight all from the edge screen. These improvements look to be identical to the ones bundled with the Galaxy S6 edge’s Marshmallow update so be sure to check that out if you want to know more.Perhaps the most significant refinement is the build. Sure, design-wise, it looks almost exactly the same as the previous Galaxy S6/S6 edge, but they did make a lot of the necessary improvements we yearned for in the old one. Remember the curved back that helped you hang on to your slippery Galaxy Note5? Yeah, that’s now on the Galaxy S7/S7 edge too — a welcomed improvement over the flat-backed Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Did I hear someone say camera hump? Well, thanks to that new Dual Pixel sensor, Samsung have managed to almost entirely shave it off.In many ways, although it pains me to say this because I’m far from being their fan, Samsung knows how to do hardware. A quick look at their unbelievably polished flagships of last year should give you more than enough of a hint as to how good they are at building a phone, yet they’ve managed improved on it even further with the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. We tried to find faults in the S7 and S& edge, but try as we might, we couldn’t find much."
Rory Lee,Samsung’s new Gear 360 is a sweet looking 360-degree camera and I want one,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/samsungs-new-gear-360-is-a-sweet-looking-360-degree-camera-and-i-want-one/,"360 degree camera,mobile world congress 2016,mwc 2016,samsung,samsung 360 camera,samsung gear 360,samsung gear vr,samsung launch,smartphone,the next galaxy,thenextgalaxy,mobile accessories","Mobile Accessories,Samsung",2016-02-22,"Besides the gargantuan launch of Samsung‘s new flagships, they’ve also bundled a sweet little 360 camera called the Gear 360 just to spice things up. And I’m not kidding when I say sweeeeeeeet. It looks like something cute and cuddly out of a children’s novel that you just know is going to be made into a million plush toys and its own movie.The design philosophy is pretty obvious here: It’s clearly a golf ball.Okay, maybe Samsung didn’t have a golf ball in mind when they designed it (or did they?) but you can’t help but draw similarities. It’s white, round and comes perched on its own…tee… ahem, tripod, so that it can stand all by its lonesome. This ball of cuteness comes with two fisheye lenses mounted back to back — both sporting its own dedicated 15-megapixel CMOS sensor — and is designed to let users “become the creator of their own virtual reality content”.These 15MP sensors allow users to capture high-resolution 3840×1920 360-degree video at 30 frames per second and 30MP still images. If you don’t want the full 360-degrees for some reason even though you bought a 360-degree camera, you can also shoot 180-degrees using just one of the two 15MP sensors. The Gear 360 offers Bright Lens F2.0 which creates “high-resolution images even in low-light conditions” so that can be useful if you want to film, say, a sunrise from the top of the Himalayas.Although it comes with its own tripod, it doesn’t mean that you will be limited to it and it alone as the Gear 360 supports the standard tripod thread mount that is also compatible with a wider selection of accessories and mounts. It also has support for a microSD card (up to 128GB) and is IP53 certified dust and water resistant. So not really a tool to film your underwater explorations then. That said, it also has a tiny 0.5-inch 72×72 PMOLED display and a record button at the top. On one side, it has a menu and back button that doubles as a Bluetooth and power button respectively.Keeping everything running is a removable 1,350 mAh li-ion battery which brings the total weight of the entire device to 153g.The thing about Samsung’s launch during the Mobile World Congress is that they’re not only launching a smartphone or a camera, they’re launching an ecosystem. A Galaxy if you wish. They, along with several other tech giants, have realised that diversifying is the key — selling you more stuff that you might not need but you definitely want.I can’t help but want this little Gear 360 because it opens up a whole host of content creation possibilities. Just imagine GoPro cameras. Previously the niche product of extreme sports aficionados, GoPros are now a staple equipment for any creative content creator and the Gear 360 has the potential to be the next GoPro.What do you guys think of this 360-degree camera? Let us know in the comments below."
Alexander Wong,Maxis now offers Zerolution for all iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/19/maxis-now-offers-zerolution-for-all-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-models/,"iphone,iphone 6s,iphone 6s malaysia,iphone 6s plus,maxis,maxis zerolution,zerolution,ios,mobile devices,mobile os,players on the field","iOS,iPhone,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field",2016-02-19,"The Maxis Zerolution program is a different way of owning a smartphone. It offers 0% interest monthly installments, zero upfront payment and the easy option to upgrade to a new model every year. When it was made available for the iPhone, Maxis only offered it for the entry-level 16GB iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. With growing user needs and the arrival of 4K video recording, 16GB isn’t going to cut it and it makes more sense to get a bigger capacity iPhone. Finally, it looks like the folks at Maxis had listened and they are now offering the hassle-free ownership program for more models from the older iPhone 6 to the current largest iPhone 6s Plus 128GB.Like before, the iPhone Zerolution option is only applicable on their more expensive MaxisOne Plan 158 and 188. If you don’t plan on upgrading, you can just pay for its monthly installment price which starts from RM78/month for the iPhone 6 16GB. To sweeten the deal, Maxis is also giving an additional 20GB of data (4GB x 5 months) if you sign up before 31st March 2016. The biggest highlight of the Zerolution program is the option to switch to the latest model (e.g. iPhone 7) after 12 months. To be eligible, you would need to sign on for the upgrade option that costs RM20/month. However do note that you would need to return the device in pristine condition but you can avoid possible penalties with a Device Protection Program. Don’t forget that the Zerolution cost is on top of your monthly subscription plan of either RM158/month or RM188/month. While the whole installment is calculated based on 24 months duration, there’s is no contract tied the plan. If you wish to leave at any time, you would just need to pay the remaining retail price of the device. Halfway through the program, you may switch to a lower commitment MaxisOne Plan but there’s a penalty of RM1,000, contrary to its 0 penalty promise. Doing so will also forfeit your remaining promotional free data. It is worth pointing out that Maxis has increased its Device Protection Fee from RM15/month previously to RM23/month. Compared to its Android offering, the upgrade fee is cheaper at RM20/month instead of the usual RM30/month. For more information, head over to the Maxis iPhone Zerolution page."
Rory Lee,Moto 360 2nd Generation: Second time’s the charm?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/20/moto-360-2nd-generation-moto-360-sport-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"hands on and first impressions,lenovo,malaysia,moto 360,moto 360 2nd gen,moto 360 2nd gen malaysia hands on,moto 360 sport,motorola,android,mobile os,smart watch","Android,Lenovo,Mobile OS,Motorola,Smart Watch",2016-02-20,"I remember my Uber driver asking me what I thought was the next big tech trend. My answer was simple: Modular devices. It seemed obvious to me because in a world of smartphone carbon copies, who doesn’t want to stand out? Imparting personality and specified functions to devices seemed like the best way forward.He was clearly not expecting this answer and it only was after a few moments of awkward silence that he revealed what he was actually thinking of: Smartwatches.Ohhhhh.It never occurred to me that smartwatches are the “next big tech trend” because not only am I exposed to people wearing smartwatches all the time, nearly everyone in the office also has some kind of smartwatch. It’s almost as common as smartphones, so at most — to me, anyway — smartwatches are the tech trend of today.But, if you consider the general public, this is still a novelty/upcoming piece of tech. You don’t really see smartwatches that often so it would make sense that it is still considered a tech trend of tomorrow.When the smartwatch, as we know it today, first started out, many manufacturers and designers were uncertain about what it should look like. Many opted to put an ugly square on your wrist, which if you think about it, sort of makes sense because a smartwatch was essentially a smaller smartphone that fits on your wrist.I think they were, for the most part, wrong as people don’t want to wear smartphones on their wrist because that’s where watches go. One of the companies that got this formula right was Motorola (now just Moto) with the first Moto 360. It simply had a cool factor about it and I’m happy to say that the sequel keeps to this trend.If you’re looking for a classy watch, you can’t really go wrong with the standard Moto 360. It is a thing of beauty. The 316L stainless steel case, which comes in either 42mm or 46mm sizes, is well built and feels really nice in the hand. Unlike some smartwatches, the Moto 360 sits on your wrist like it belongs there, rather than looking like a sore protrusion.It is worth noting that if you pick up the 42mm Women’s edition (which goes for RM1,499) it comes with a tiny 16mm strap and that makes the watch look downright comical. It’s like tying the head of a lollipop to your wrist with a wet noodle. You’re better off with the 20mm strap, but you won’t get Rose Gold because that’s only for the Women’s version. Quite the pickle eh?Much like the original Moto 360, the 2nd Generation watch runs on Android Wear. While Android Wear isn’t where we’d like it to be right now, it has come a long way and is slowly maturing into a well-rounded watch operating system. It’s got a whole bunch of nifty features like Google Now, alarms, calendar reminders, as well as the regular notification pushing. It also lets you reply to WhatsApp messages via speech-to-text.The Sport is the Moto 360 for the fitness enthusiast. Unlike its elegant regular brother, the Sport does not have a sexy stainless steel body. Not one you can feel anyway, as most of the case is covered in the same rubberised material that makes up the smartwatch band. Yup, that means the entire strap piece is proprietary and what I guess you could call a uni-bodied strap. As a result, if your strap cracks or breaks, you’re going to be in some amount of trouble trying to get it fixed. A big thumbs-down there then.While the classic smartwatch comes in two sizes, the Sport only comes in a 45mm case, and while that looks fine on my hairy wrists, it may seem a little bulky on more delicate wrist sizes. The biggest difference — besides the rubber strap — is the fact that it has a new “AnyLight” hybrid display that, in short, improves sunlight visibility. Does it work? Well, the short answer is yes, it does let you view it even under direct sunlight. One other thing that might turn fitness nuts onto this device is the fact that it has GPS connectivity.It’s constructed in true Moto 360 fashion, with a premium build and feel though there are a few annoying niggles. One of which is the fact that the rubber strap picks up all manner of dust.Anything that is small and speck-like just finds its way onto the strap and in your desperate (but futile) effort to get it off, more dust will settle on other parts of the strap. That’s a nightmare. Another is that little cutout for the microphone at the side of the watch. It feels so half-arsed, like they wrapped the device up in that hideous rubber condom before realising “Oops we forgot to make a hole for the mic. Let’s just cut one out”.That aside, the rest of the watch is a class act. Both the Sport and the regular versions of the Moto 360 are fantastic smartwatches to have on your wrist. They just feel right, and that isn’t always easy to find in a smartwatch. Functionality remains to be seen, but with the time I’ve spent on Android Wear, it is quite fun though not entirely practical, though that’s not the Moto 360’s fault. But, that’s a story for another time.In all honesty, I can’t say that this — with prices starting at RM1,399 — is the best smartwatch money can buy. I can’t even say that this is the best round smartwatch money can buy because it technically isn’t even round with that dastardly flat tire that many seem to hate.But, to me, that gives the watch character and for something that you’re going to wear every single day, you’d want it to have character. Let me put it this way: In a world of generic square smartwatches trying to look smart and round smartwatches trying to look like regular watches, what’s the easiest way for someone to tell that you have a Moto 360?That flat tire. And that makes it special, it makes it unique."
Rory Lee,7 reasons to get the Samsung Galaxy S7,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/7-reasons-to-get-the-samsung-galaxy-s7/,"7 reasons to get the galaxy s7,7 reasons to get the s7,galaxy s7 edge launch,galaxy s7 launch,malaysia,mobile world congress 2016,mwc 2016,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy s7 edge,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-22,"Samsung just announced their latest flagship duo, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, two smartphones we think come pretty darn close to being perfect. They have significantly improved performance, features and a whole bunch of other goodies. But the big question is: Would you get one?Well, here are 7 big reasons why you definitely should and why the S7 is a worthwhile upgrade over the S6.The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are smartphone powerhouses. Powered by either a next-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core SoC or Samsung’s very own next-gen Exynos 8890 octa-core chip (Malaysia is likely to get the Exynos version), the S7 and S7 edge surely pack a punch. Paired with 4GB of RAM and 32 or 64GB internal memory (expandable via microSD up to 200GB), the Galaxy S7 duo sees a 30% bump in CPU as well as over 60% bump in GPU performance from the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge.That’s a massive amount especially if you consider how powerful the previous Galaxy already are. What’s more, the S7 and S7 edge is optimised for serious mobile gaming with dedicated features to help you maximise your smartphone gaming experience.The S7 and S7 edge has got a dedicated “Game Launcher” function that lets you decide how you want to game — maximum power and FPS or maximum battery life and lower FPS — on the fly. What’s more, the feature also lets you mute all notifications so you wont be distracted when you’re getting serious mobile game time.The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge has among the best, if not the best cameras you can get on a smartphone. The S7 and S7 edge looks o continue this tradition with a brand new 12-megapixel Dual Pixel sensor mated to a super-fast f/1.7 aperture lens.The new sensor delivers lighting-fast focusing — even in low-light. It also takes 95% brighter pictures thanks to the use of the larger 1.4 micron pixels coupled with a fast f/1.7 lens.Samsung has also increased the battery capacity over last year’s flagship. The S7 has a much larger 3,000 mAh battery for the Galaxy S7 (compared to 2,550 mAh in the S6) and an event bigger 3,600 mAh battery for the Galaxy S7 edge (compared to just 2,600 mah in the S6 edge). In addition, you get fast-charging support not only for wired charging but for wireless charging as well.Ah, the one fans lamented about when they found out the Galaxy S6/S6 edge didn’t come with it. Well, it’s back and I’m sure many of you Samsung fans are already rejoicing. But, before you bust out the confetti, the supported slot that lets you put up to a 200GB microSD card in, is shared. Yup, it’s a hybrid SIM slot which means you will have to choose between either a single SIM plus microSD setup, or a dual SIM without microSD setup.Dang it!Hey, at least you have the choice?Weather hazards are a nightmare that we simply can’t avoid sometimes. Just the other day, I got caught in one of the heaviest rainstorms I’ve ever experienced in Sunway Pyramid and it didn’t matter how big my umbrella was, I was completely drenched which obviously had me worried about my smartphone. But, if you pick up the Galaxy S7/S7 edge you won’t have to worry about such trivial matters like rain damaging your smartphone because it has a water-resistant rating of IP68.Although that doesn’t mean you can go swimming with it, it will survive the accident drop in the pool and/or rainstorm. What’s more, the open ports have been coated with a special water-repellent coating that does away with the need for inconvenient and ugly flaps that you worry could fall off. Take that Galaxy S5!One of the things I liked the most about many Windows Phone devices was their always-on display, or Glance Screen, as the marketing people would call it. Its a convenient feature that makes available basic notifications and information without the need to wake the phone. It’s great that Samsung has caught up with this as well.Samsung’s always-on display lets you choose one of three different screens to display — your calendar, the time and personalised notifications of your choosing. Pretty nifty when all you can do is glance at the screen. Since its running on the Galaxy S7/S7 edge’s SuperAMOLED panel, only the pixels that are required will be lit so this feature has minimal effect on battery life.Much like the new update that the Galaxy S6 edge received with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Galaxy S7 edge which comes with Marshmallow out of the box, also has a bunch of new edge improvements. Among which is the increased screen real estate allowing more information to be displayed on the edge screen. This extra screen space lets you do more with the Apps edge, Task edge and People edge — you won’t only have one row of apps, you will have two rows. Plus, you will get access to several Quick tools like a ruler, a compass as well as a flashlight. For more information, you can head on over here.UPDATE: The Galaxy S7 edge is officially priced at RM3,099. Pre-orders will start on 7th March with extra early bird perks."

That means instead of getting harassed by friends who need help with “likes” on their newly established page or participation in an assignment survey of theirs, you’ll now be getting bombarded by businesses and brands.Well, when you compare the two, it’s essentially the same thing but with “friends” you could easily just get rid of them by “unfriending” them, ads on the opposing end is more or less involuntary.The leaked document had been sent to the folks at TechCrunch who’ve by journalistic virtue have chosen to leave their source anonymous but it’s quoted that businesses will soon be allowed to send ads to users who’ve previously initiated a chat with them via the Messenger app.So in the past when you’ve dropped a private message to brand or service provider complaining about an issue – it’ll haunt you. Remember folks, complaining in public always works better.It seems that the authenticity of the document has some worthy back-up as well as a URL short link that was mentioned seemed to have been quietly launched. Facebook also decided to own up to the existence of the URL short link system, allowing us to believe that this whole Messenger ad thing is the real deal.For limitations and boundaries sake, we’re lucky that Facebook isn’t just going to let any business send you spam-my messages. As mentioned earlier, it’ll only be limited to those who’ve started conversations with the brands themselves. This will be great for businesses, though, as people already engaged with them can receive further updates about products or services.TechCrunch points out that this is a big switch from Mr Zuckerberg’s stance on the subject in 2014 after acquiring WhatsApp. He’s quoted as saying “I don’t personally think ads are the right way to monetise messaging”.From pages, messaging options for businesses and even its 2015 initiative “Businesses On Messenger”, Facebook has gradually increased its efforts to be more helpful to the organisations and brands out there.But what do you make of this?

Rory Lee,The HTC One A9 has been officially launched in Malaysia. Here are 3 reasons you might want one,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/18/the-htc-one-a9-has-been-officially-launched-in-malaysia-here-are-3-reasons-you-might-want-one/,"a9 aero,aero,android,android m,android marshmallow,htc,htc a9,htc blinkfeed,htc malaysia,htc one a9,htc one a9 launch,htc one a9 malaysia,htc one a9 price,htc sense,launch malaysia,m,marshmallow,official malaysian launch,sense,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-18,"HTC are a falling company and it isn’t hard to see why. Disappointing flagships paired with high price tags go a long way in getting people to shy away from them. In an attempt to bounce back, HTC pulled back the covers of their new midrange smartphone, the One A9.While the One A9’s specs are nothing to shout about, there are some reasons why you would want to get your hands on this shiny new device. Since it just got its official launch here in Malaysia, we thought we’d take a look at what some of those reasons are.If you didn’t already know, the HTC One A9 is already on sale here in Malaysia via DirectD and SuperBuy for a whopping RM2,199. That’s a lot to shell out for a mid-range device and there is no denying that this is a device for the middle of the smartphone pack.For starters, it is a 5-inch smartphone with a full HD panel tucked under Corning Gorilla glass. On the inside, it’s powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 617 processor (a notch up over the usual 615/616 mid-range processors) paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable (via microSD) internal storage.Optics are taken care of with a 13-megapixel f/2.0 primary camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) located in the top center at the back of the smartphone while selfies are taken care of with HTC’s UltraPixel “UltraSelfie” front facing camera.That said, the One A9 has a bunch of goodies too, like a fingerprint scanner hiding under its home button on the front, but HTC’s signature BoomSound speakers are not on the list. The speakers do have a DAC that does Dolby Audio with 24-bit Hi-Res Audio. Keeping the lights on is a 2,150 mAh battery. It is a single-SIM smartphone, though, so if you have multiple numbers, you might have to look for another one.The One A9 then is not off to a good start. That said, here are some of the things we do like about HTC’s new baby.HTC is renown for their ability to build quality smartphones. They basically reinvented the “premium” smartphone with the One M7 back in the day, and this exquisite build finish carries on into the One A9.It comes together fantastically. Its rounded edges are awesome and the metal feels exquisite. What’s more, it’s a handsome looking device, a little too close to the Apple iPhone 6/6S for my taste but if you dig that but want an Android OS, this is the device for you.Speaking of the Android OS, this smartphone comes with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, so you don’t have to wait around and hope that it hits your device soon.Marshmallow brings a host of goodies, including the very fun and useful Now on Tap and Doze. Now on Tap is a function where you can simply hold down the home button and allow Google to “read” whatever is on your screen.Then, Google will provide you with the necessary Google Now cards related to specific information on the screen. Doze, on the other hand, puts the smartphone in a state of low power when not in use to conserve battery. Think Apple iPad.According to DxOMark that is. The renown camera testing site tests a whole bunch of smartphone and rates them according to their performance. The higher the number, the better the camera and with a respectable score of 78, the HTC One A9 is the best performing HTC smartphone camera on the list.Are you sold? Do you want to get your hands on the device? Well, in conjunction with the HTC One A9’s official launch, which is going for a recommended retail price of RM2,299, HTC are also having a Chinese New Year promotion.By shopping with HTC, customers can stand a chance to take home gold bars, shopping vouchers and limited edition merchandise. The promotion will last until 29 February and if you’d like to know more you can head on over to their website.Alongside the star of the show, the One A9, HTC are also officially launching the HTC One ME Dual SIM (RM1,599), HTC Desire 728 Dual SIM, HTC Desire 828 Dual SIM, and the HTC Desire 626 Dual SIM."

First and foremost, comes the hostility of getting caught of snapping those photos that’ll probably get you in a lot of trouble. But still companies are finding it harder to prepare for the storm of their devices getting leaked out in the open.Samsung is on top of the ant hill when it concerns their Galaxy S7 duo that’s slated to be released at MWC 2016. LG’s G5 has made a few appearances too but it seems like we’ve forgotten the darling of Taiwan – HTC with their One M10.That’s remotely because there’s no more BoomSound (as far as we can tell) and it’s starting to look a lot more Samsung than anything else. It’s like HTC did an 180-degree spin from their design language on the One M7, M8 and M9 and thought that going Samsung-esque was the best decision – way to go HTC, that’s originality for you.In the rumoured specs department, it is claimed that the One M10 will carry a 5.2-inch AMOLED display and feature a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. It’s likely that 4GB of RAM will be on this smartphone, along with at least 32GB of internal storage.There’s also the greatly welcomed 12-megapixel rear camera that’s also found on the Nexus 6P. The sensors on the rear and front (unknown megapixel) are also said to be equipped with OIS (optical image stabilisation).Our camera comparison showing what it’s capable of can be found here.HTC One A9 pictured aboveTo round off, apparently HTC will make use of the home button and let it double as a fingerprint sensor, as they’ve done before. The flagship will also run a Sense 8.0 skin over Android Marshmallow out of the box.We’ve said it time and time again, HTC has made phones with great builds and designs. This time (if the image holds true) they’ve dropped the ball again. Adding to the shambles is the fact that they’ve done away with BoomSound, something that always kept them ahead in the multimedia consumption side of smartphones.Say it ain’t so, HTC. Say it ain’t so.Do drop us your thoughts on the alleged HTC One M10, will it sell like hotcakes? Or will it be another dud.[ SOURCE, VIA, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

Rory Lee,HTC One A9: Saving a ship with a teacup,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/19/htc-one-a9-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"first impressions,hands-on,htc,htc one a9,htc one a9 hands on and first impressions,htc one a9 malaysia,htc one a9 official launch,htc one a9 overpriced,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-19,"Watching someone try to scoop water out of their leaking boat with a teacup in an attempt to stay afloat is always a lot of fun to watch. They’re trying their best, but you know that in the end, that ship is going down, so it’s funny when you see them finally realise that using a teacup to save a sinking ship was probably a big mistake.Or is that just me?Watching sinking smartphone giants throw a Hail Mary to keep their company from plummeting, but also making one monumental mistake, can be quite amusing too. Just take BlackBerry and the Priv as an example. You can argue that it is a brilliant smartphone and that the specs are fabulous, but what you simply can’t justify is that exorbitant price tag — which in this metaphor represents the teacup.Unfortunately, on the surface, for a company that has made several smartphones I quite liked, HTC seems to be making the same mistake with their One A9 — you just can’t justify that price tag.That’s what I thought going into the launch event anyway. I got to spend some time with the little One that could, and while my time with the device was incredibly limited, it did leave an impression.Let’s start with the build. I sound like a broken record but ever since the first One, HTC have proven that they’re capable of making some truly fantastic smartphone builds. They just know how to do premium metal devices.This One is no exception. The One A9 is awesomely built and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that based purely on feel alone, it will easily give you a premium feel. It’s pretty thin too, which should help it slide in and out of your pocket with minimal effort. Both a good and bad thing.The buttons are excellent and clicky which is great, and I like the fact that the power button has a different texture from the volume rockers letting you differentiate them easily without looking.If you can get over the fact that it looks incredibly similar to an iPhone, the One A9 is even quite handsome. Of course, if you’re into an iPhone clone in terms of looks, you will obviously like the One A9. It even has that same camera hump!Make no mistake, this isn’t a flagship device, despite its look and feel, the One A9 is still a mid-range smartphone at best. On the front, it’s got a 5-inch full HD display, which can get quite bright. Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 617 processor (slightly upscaled from the usual SD 615/616 mid-range processors) paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.On the demo unit, performance was snappy. It had no problems switching between tasks and HTC’s Sense UI was pretty easy on the eyes. While I’m not sure how this device would perform under a heavy load, had I not known that this device was running a mid-range processor, I might have been fooled into thinking that it had flagship level specs.That said, my time with the device was incredibly limited so I won’t pass judgement on it until we get a full review. In fact, my time was so limited that I didn’t have time to play with the 13-megapixel camera, so unfortunately, I won’t be touching on that in this first impressions. Or the front facing touch-sensitive fingerprint sensor cum home button.Need I say more? One of the most painful exclusions of any HTC smartphone is always their brilliant BoomSound front-facing speakers. They’re fantastic to listen to, often outperforming even other front-facing speakers.Instead, on the One A9, we get a downward facing iPhone 6/6S-esque speaker. I guess if you’re going to look like an iPhone 6/6S, might as well go all out right? It does come with a DAC that does Dolby Audio with 24-bit Hi-Res Audio though.There’s no denying that HTC’s ship is sinking hard and sinking fast. People are even assigning situation-appropriate descriptions to replace HTC’s acronym. They need a saviour and unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like the One A9 is going to be it.With a recommended retail price of RM2,299, HTC are falling into the same trap BlackBerry fell into — thinking that their brand alone will be enough to push sales. We know you want to return to your glory days as soon as possible and the easiest way to do so is to overcharge for a smartphone. But, you’re no Apple, which means there won’t nearly be enough people who will blindly buy your product just to have your brand stamped on the back of it.The HTC One A9 then is a teacup, and a teacup — as we’ve established earlier — won’t be enough to save the sinking Taiwanese company.That said, I won’t say for certain that the One A9 isn’t worth your money (though it certainly seems that way) as I want to wait for a full review before deciding, but as of right now, HTC looks to be in dire straits.If you happen to have cash to spare and you simply must get yourself an HTC phone, then this wouldn’t be a bad choice. In fact, here are three good reasons why you might want one."

First in line is the 6-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS-NEO panel that’s protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The majority might argue that having a screen that big should warrant a Quad HD display (2560 x 1440) but for the most part, the Mate 8’s 368ppi will suffice.On the processing side of things, you’re getting an all-star in the form of the Octa-core Kirin 950 chipset that’s clocked to 2.3GHz and accompanied by the Mali-T880 MP4 GPU. For RAM, it’ll come in two options 3GB and 4GB while internal storage will also vary – 32GB and 64GB.The determining factor will be the colour option you choose as they’ll represent different RAM and internal storage capacities. They will come in Champagne Gold, Space Grey, Mocha Brown and Moonlight Silver.Moving to its camera, there’s a 16-megapixel rear shutter complete with OIS, and phase detection autofocus while the front will don an 8-megapixel sensor. There isn’t much to say about the camera yet as we’ve yet to test it but we’re hoping that it’ll perform similarly to the other device made by them: Nexus 6P – you can check out some camera samples here.Taking a look at its rear, you’ll again find a super-quick Huawei fingerprint sensor sitting just under the rear camera module. Biometric security is something that the Chinese manufacturer has locked down to almost perfection.Powering all this is the fairly large 4,000mAh non-removable battery that’s encased in a metal unibody.Although it is still smaller than what was on its predecessor, we’re expecting its battery life to be a lot better thanks to Android Marshmallow and a more efficient processor. Possibly lasting even two days.Despite being a phablet by definition, the smartphone weighs only 185grams which is pretty light in our books. Out of the box, you’ll get Emotion UI or 4.0 that’s overlaid on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow – the skin that always leaves you without an app drawer like other Chinese-based user interfaces. The Mate 8 supports Dual-SIM 4G LTE, NFC and has a micro SD slot as well for additional storage.Unfortunately, there’s no talk yet about how much the Mate 8 go for. Though, in the scenario that our currency exchange rates don’t fluctuate any further, it might be competitively priced against the Galaxy Note5."

The good news is that Google is adding thirteen new languages to their Translate service, bringing the total up to 103 supported languages.According to Google, by adding the extra languages, Translate now covers 99% of the online population. Besides simply listing out the new languages added, Google also paired them with a few fun facts about each language.Amharic (Ethiopia) is the second most widely spoken Semitic language after Arabic.Corsican (Island of Corsica, France) is closely related to Italian and was Napoleon’s first language.Frisian (Netherlands and Germany) is the native language of over half the inhabitants of the Friesland province of the Netherlands.Kyrgyz (Kyrgyzstan) is the language of the Epic of Manas, which is 20x longer than the Iliad and the Odyssey put together.Hawaiian (Hawaii) has lent several words to the English language, such as ukulele and wiki.Kurdish (Kurmanji) (Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria) is written with Latin letters while the others two varieties of Kurdish are written with Arabic script.Luxembourgish (Luxembourg) completes the list of official EU languages Translate covers.Samoan (Samoa and American Samoa) is written using only 14 letters.Scots Gaelic (Scottish highlands, UK) was introduced by Irish settlers in the 4th century AD.Shona (Zimbabwe) is the most widely spoken of the hundreds of languages in the Bantu family.Sindhi (Pakistan and India) was the native language of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the “Father of the Nation” of Pakistan.Pashto (Afghanistan and Pakistan) is written in Perso-Arabic script with an additional 12 letters, for a total of 44.Xhosa (South Africa) is the second most common native language in the country after Afrikaans and features three kinds of clicks, represented by the letters x, q and c.No way, Samoan is only written using 14 letters? Also, how did I not guess that wiki came from the Hawaiian language?Anyway, Google Translate has grown by quite a substantial amount but Google says that they’re not done yet. In fact, they’re encouraging those who want to contribute to the Translate efforts to lend a helping hand on International Mother Language day which is just around the corner on February 21.Those interested can get involved with the Translate Community and to start, just select the languages you speak; then choose to either translate some phrases on your own or validate existing translations. Every contribution helps improve the service.But, I know what’s on everyone’s mind now that we have a whole bunch of new languages to translate into — MORE FUNKY SONGS FROM GOOGLE TRANSLATE SINGS!In any case, contribution from the society matters as at the end of the day we’re the ones using this service so obviously, we want it to be as accurate as possible. With this continual growth, let’s hope that Google will add in-game languages too. DotA language anyone?[SOURCE, VIA]"
Rory Lee,There is nothing we don’t know about the Samsung Galaxy S7 now,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/17/there-is-nothing-we-dont-know-about-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-now/,"android authority,galaxy s7,hands-on video,leak,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung leak,mobile devices,rumour mill","Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill",2016-02-17,"Oh dear, the Samsung Galaxy S7 hasn’t even been unveiled yet and we already have a hands-on video. I guess some secrets simply won’t stay secret as Android Authority’s “gadget ninja” has given the some spec details as well as a couple of images plus a 14-second video of the upcoming Samsung flagship.According to Android Authority, their source claims that the Galaxy S7 is indeed water resistant (IP68/IP67 rating) — as we found out earlier — and it will come preloaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Besides that, the device’s lights will be kept on courtesy of a 2,800 mAh battery.For optics, their source claims that the smartphone has a 12-megapixel shooter, though, despite the smaller megapixel size, it does have larger pixels similar to that on the Nexus 6P and 5X — or if you want to stretch the comparison, HTC‘s UltraPixel unit.The current Galaxy flagships all have fantastic cameras, so we doubt that this one will be the unit to let it down, even if it uses Samsungs new and untested BRITECELL technology. In fact, it is even supposed to improve the smartphone’s low-light capabilities.All that is nice and dandy but we think the spec that Samsung fans will be most excited for is the return of the microSD card slot. As shown in the image above, the tray has clear labels that one section is for the SIM card while the other is reserved for a microSD card slot. However, there is no SIM 2 option so it seems very unlikely that the Galaxy S7 will have support for a dual-SIM configuration.That said, despite the claims that the 12MP BRITECELL snapper can vastly reduce the camera hump, it appears that the S7 still has that square protruding unit that is sticking out from all the current Galaxys. That said, we can’t say for sure whether this will protrude as much as the current ones based on the angle of the shot.Finally, what seals the deal that this is very likely a legit Galaxy S7 is the curved Note5-esque back. We liked the curve as it helped the device fit better in our hand, something that you won’t find on the current Galaxy S6/S6 edge.Other than that, the phone is almost identical to the current Galaxy S6, so much so that from the front they look almost indistinguishable. Software wise, the UI looks very similar to that of the current TouchWiz, though it does look like a lighter skin.The Flipboard is still present on the left side of the screen, though. We didn’t get to take a peek at the notification quick-access, so we can’t tell what that looks like.Keep in mind that this is still not an official video or release so we won’t know exactly how accurate this leak is until the smartphone gets launched on 21st February. Keep it locked to SoyaCincau.com because we will be there covering the event live.What do you guys think of the Galaxy S7? Yay or nay? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE]"
Rory Lee,Moto 360 2nd generation officially lands in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/18/moto-360-2nd-generation-officially-lands-in-malaysia/,"android wear,launch,lenovo,mid valley,moto 360,moto 360 2nd gen,moto 360 2nd gen malaysia official launch,moto 360 sport,smart watch,smartwatch,android,mobile devices,mobile os,motorola,promotions","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Motorola,Promotions,Smart Watch",2016-02-18,"The big daddy of the round smartwatch was always the original Moto 360, with its sexy round looks and edge-to-edge thin bezel display. It looked classy and simply reminded smartwatch makers that the smartwatch doesn’t need to have a massively redesigned look — classic good looks worked just fine, if not better.While the second generation Moto 360 fixed many of the problems that existed with the original smartwatch, there just didn’t seem to be enough to set it apart from its other Android Wear rivals. Matters are made worse in Malaysia as the biggest selling point of the Moto 360 — Moto Maker — isn’t even available here.However, if you’re like me, and have coveted this watch since you first laid eyes on it, good news! It finally got its official release here in Malaysia.I can’t really put into words why I like this watch. Maybe it’s how every little detail of it’s build is just slightly more refined than its competition. Take the Huawei Watch for example, it’s a thing of premium beauty that just oozes elegance, but if you ask me, I think the Moto 360 is just a little more refined and put together just a little better than the Huawei Watch.And when it comes to a premium build and feel, we all know the little details matter.But, I know many of you will be disappointed by the fact that the flat tyre is still here, despite the fact that other round smartwatches have done away with it. I was a little annoyed by it at first, but at the risk of sounding like a terrible cliche, there is no exquisite beauty without some strangeness in the proportion.There are other things to like about the Moto 360 too, like Android Wear. It has come a long way since its inception, bringing it closer than ever to being a well rounded smartwatch OS. However, it would be nice to have a more user-friendly UI so you won’t have to spend an hour or two just trying to work out how to navigate the interface. Plus, just because it doesn’t stand out too much in terms of performance and functionality compared to its rivals, it doesn’t mean that the watch isn’t a good performer. It is still a pretty solid all-rounder.What’s more, if you get the standard version, you have a near endless choice of straps as they use standard 20mm, 22mm and 16mm straps. If you’re a fitness junkie, they’ve even got a Moto 360 Sport variant which comes with a new ‘AnyLight’ display that improves visibility under bright light, plus GPS connectivity. However, this variant comes with a proprietary, non-swappable rubber strap which means that if you tear the strap, you’re going to be in a pretty bad spot.Here’s a recap of the specs. The standard Moto 360 retains the same round look with a durable 316L stainless steel case. The 46mm version gets a 1.56″ 360×300 display, while the smaller 42mm unit gets a 1.37″ 360×325 display. It supports both Android and iOS smartphones and it connects via Bluetooth and WiFi. There’s also a heart rate sensor and IP67 dust and water resistance.I can’t say this is the best Android Wear smartwatch money can buy because it certainly doesn’t blow people away with a kick ass spec sheet, but I can tell you that if I were to get an Android Wear watch, this would be it. It just looks and feels right on the wrist. It’s a smartwatch you buy with the strongest muscle in your chest, not that bowl of grey noodles sitting in our heads. If you are interested, the Moto 360’s pricing is as follows:Moto 360 second generation 42mm Unisex Black — RM1,399
Moto 360 second generation 42mm Women’s Rose Gold — RM1,499
Moto 360 second generation 46mm Men’s Silver — RM1,599
Moto 360 Sport Black — RM1,399All the smartwatches will be on sale at SenQ, Urban Republic and Thunder Match stores nationwide, as well as online at Lazada Malaysia. As a little icing on the cake, if you pick up the Moto 360 at the roadshow, you will be getting a 10% discount on all models on sale. If you purchase two smartwatches, that discount goes up to 20%. There is also a special deal for the first 100 customers, the details of which can be found here. The roadshow is being held at Mid Valley and will run until this Sunday, 21st February.Still torn and can’t decide on a smartwatch to get for yourself? Maybe our updated Smartwatch Buyer’s Guide can lend a hand, so be sure to check that out."

There’s no point in arguing which of the two has a better argument to be secure, one keeps our thoughts in 140 characters while the other depicts the visuals in our lives.Twitter added two-factor authentication since 2013 and Instagram has just decided to do the same. Yeah, it might be a little annoying to get into your account if you’re signing in from a new device but, at least, no random psychopath is going to have access to your precious Instagram account.TechCrunch got in touch with an Instagram rep, confirming that they’ll begin to roll-out this added security layer.Verification will come via text message on your smartphones so bear in mind that a valid phone number is necessary.The typical routine will include an authentication code that is sent to your phone every time someone tries to access your account. Making it a little harder for hackers and stalkers to get inside your account as it’s more than just your email and password.Since Facebook snapped up the online photo/video-sharing app, it seemed like a good idea to further enhance its login system but it’s taken quite a while to finally arrive.For most of us, our Instagram accounts are no more than a photo/video album that we share with the world hoping we pass that 11 likes mark but for some it means a lot more and they’ll be sure to appreciate this news.[ SOURCE ]"

Well, if these recent rendered images hold any credibility, it looks like the rumours are true.From the rendered images, it the most eye-catching feature is obviously the dual camera with the centre flash module and what could be a laser-autofocus unit located right at the top of the smartphone — all of which is housed within a visor that is more obvious on the black, pink and gold models than the silver one.Also present on the back is Huawei‘s fingerprint sensor, which should be pretty snappy, located just below the camera module. The renders make it seem that the upcoming smartphone’s metal back plate has an interesting brushed texture to it, but that could also be due to poor image quality.One interesting thing to note is that Huawei seems to be doing away with the P8‘s Xperia-esque square design, opting instead for a softer edged curve. Very Samsung/Apple-y in fact. Around the front of the device, there aren’t that many significant features besides what looks like a front-facing LED flash.These images come courtesy of a popular Weibo user, and when asked if these images were accurately representing the actual device, someone who has seen the device affirms it. However, a person with knowledge of the design notes that while the images were representative of the flagship device overall, its aspect ratio is slightly off. The source says that the actual device is slimmer and taller than the squat render seems to suggest.Spec-wise, the P9 is said to feature a homegrown Kirin 955 processor paired with 4GB of RAM powering a 5.2-inch full-HD display. Keeping the lights on is an average sized 2,900 mAh battery. It is worth noting that based on our previous report, the rumours say that this device will not be launched during the Mobile World Congress 2016 in Barcelona. Instead, Huawei will be focusing on their upcoming 2-in-1 device — the MateBook — instead.What do you think of the P9?[SOURCE]"

Mainly that’s due to the Japanese company having great technology but bad implementation – awkwardly seen on their flailing flagship smartphones.The just announced sensor has Sony boasting about its 22.5-megapixel lens that comes feature-packed with an on-chip processor for auto-focus and image stabilisation. That isn’t all, as the Sony Exmor RS CMOS sensor will also be 1/0.2-inches smaller than its predecessor, now listed at 1/2.6-inches.It’ll also have a 1.0µm pixel size but Sony claims there’s nothing to worry about because they’ve used a special manufacturing technology that allows them to tweak light utilisation efficiency and improved the design of the circuit to maximise noise elimination.We’ll have to see how well this works in practice but knowing Sony, we’re not sure what to think just yet. In short, using a smaller sensor means that the pixel size will “suffer” to compensate for the form factor.Other add-ons also include a 3-axis video stabilisation that we talked about earlier but since it’s internal, there won’t be a need for accompanying modules like you see on the LG G4; that uses a Sony camera.We’re very familiar with Sony’s SteadyShot feature and we don’t expect them to mess up their image stabilisation feature though they’ve peaked our interest to see how much better they can improve it.Rumours indicate that Samsung will employ Sony for their upcoming flagships as they’ve done in the past and you can bet that other manufacturers are thinking of putting Sony’s IMX318 sensor on their upcoming devices.Repeated many times over, the equipment helps only so much as processing plays a big part too. Will Sony work on their image processing? Fingers crossed.While waiting, do check out our camera comparison and 4K video comparison to see how Sony’s current flagship sensor performs.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

But, before that, electronics giants Samsung and LG will launch their latest flagship smartphones a day before the chaos of MWC begins, which sets up a pretty fascinating clash of titans.If either wants to come out ahead, they’ll have to pull out all the stops to draw the crowd — something Samsung is already on top of for their Galaxy S7/S7 edge…and they’re using a llama.Ayy, llama-o.To try and edge their South Korean rivals, Samsung has launched an interesting ad campaign called the Seven Days of Unboxing, where, as the name suggests, there will be someone unboxing the new flagship device every single day for a week.On the first day, Samsung allowed Tyson — a five-year-old — into an unmarked black box, where the phone is, located in what looks like an empty warehouse. Tyson then had 30 seconds to unbox the device and take a good look at it before he was asked to draw what he saw. The resulting image looks like a bunch of flowers trapped in a box (if you can derive some meaning from this, do let us know in the comments below) which doesn’t give much of the device away.The second day though. Samsung sent a llama — yes, an actual living and breathing llama, not a guy in a llama suit — into the same unmarked black box where it had 30 seconds to “unbox” the S7/S7 edge before it had to paint what it saw. Clearly, without opposable thumbs, the llama isn’t going to be much of a painter, but using its sizable mouth, the animal left the canvas with several swaths of colours — gold, black, blue and silver — which hints at the potential colours available for the S7/S7 edge.Samsung’s new smartphones have been said to come pre-loaded with a bunch of nifty features like waterproofing, a microSD slot and an all new camera technology. The only unfortunate thing is that these devices don’t look particularly special as past renders and leaks have been indicating a nearly identical look and build to that of the Galaxy S6/S6 edge. That said, these are the first real-life “images” of the finished product.While these “images” are rather cryptic and don’t reveal much, if you’re super hyped for the new Galaxy S7/S7 edge the good news is that you will only need to exercise some patience as it will be revealed tidak llama lagi.[SOURCE]"
Rory Lee,This is apparently what the LG G5 will look like and we’re not impressed,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/16/this-is-apparently-what-the-lg-g5-will-look-like-and-were-not-impressed/,"android,dubai,dubizzle,g5,leak,lg,lg g5,mwc 2016,rumour,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os,rumour mill","Android,LG,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-02-16,"Apparently the LG G5 has been spectacularly leaked just a few days before it is due to be officially unveiled on 21st February as someone has put what is allegedly the actual LG G5 smartphone on sale on Dubai e-commerce website Dubizzle.Sketchy name aside, the pictures look pretty legit if you’re asking us. Pretty legit and unfortunately pretty ugly as well.Based on a report by PhoneArena, who believe this phone to be the real deal, someone had allegedly got their hands on an imported LG G5 unit from the USA and has put it up for sale on Dubizzle — which is like the Craigslist of Dubai. The “G5” is on sale for AED2500 (around RM2,840) and apparently comes with a valid IMEI and is still in its original packaging.The device is listed as “brand new” and “perfect inside and out”, which is unsurprising if this device is the real deal. In fact, they should have labeled it “so new, it’s not even launched yet!”.Speaking of the camera unit, there have been rumours floating around that the device will feature a rear dual-camera setup on the back. Although people were on the fence about whether this would actually be the case, if this leaked device is the real deal then we could very well have confirmation that it does indeed run on a dual-camera setup.What’s more, at the bottom there looks to be the “cap” that allows for the G5 to have a removable battery and a full-metal unibody at the same time. But, there is no way of confirming this based on the images we have.While this is all interesting, it is also a little disheartening as the LG G5 looks to be one ugly smartphone. Of course, taste differs based on the individual, but LOOK at it. It looks like someone dropped the electrical components in a Playdough mix and thought “hey, that looks pretty good” then stuck with the design.In any case, we will find out whether this is actually the device come 21st of February when it officially launches. Stay tuned to SoyaCincau.com as we will be there covering the event live.

We’ll find out by the 24th of February. But for those who can’t wait, we’ll just share some rumoured specs just to please the people out there.Adding some tongue and cheek to the whole situation is the way the spec sheet was photographed – looking more like a side dish to the rice grains in the photo. Xiaomi’s Mi 5 internal listing is pretty much all bare, aside from some exceptions.Xiaomi’s 2016 flagship smartphone is supposed to have the following specifications:Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor that’s clocked to 2.15GHz
5.15-inch display
16-megapixel rear camera with OIS and laser focus
4-megapixel (ultra-pixel) front sensor
3,000 mAh battery
USB Type-COther than what’s listed on the paper, people have claimed that it’ll have 3GB or 4GB of RAM and 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The rear of the devices has been seen to come in either glass or an all metal variety, suggesting that the rear backings will dictate the low to high-end spec variants.Based on older leaks, this will the price range of the different versions:Metal Design – 3GB RAM + 32GB Storage – 2,199 (RM1,435)
Metal Design – 4GB RAM + 64GB Storage – 2,599 (RM1,695)
Glass Design – 2K Display + 4GB RAM + 32GB Storage – 2,799 (RM1,826)
Glass Design – 2K Display + 4GB RAM + 64GB Storage – 3,099 (RM2,022)Meanwhile, what we can confirm would be the Mi 5 arriving with Dual-SIM 4G LTE and NFC – shown in an official teaser by their co-founder Lei Jun.From the sound of things, we’d like to hope that everything holds true and the device becomes Xiaomi’s best yet. ‘Cause in all honestly, we love it when Chinese manufacturers chip away at the large pieces of the pie that are dominated by Samsung and Apple.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

In light of the 1970s hitting Cupertino’s darling in timely fashion, it looks like Android hackers have been busy too.This time, it does a lot more damage than its Unix-based brethren. Like wiping all data on your smartphone and spreading the exploit further through random calls and texts.The malware known as “Mazar” was first discovered by Heimdal, a security firm based out of Denmark.Mazar begins its infiltration by sending a multimedia-based link in the form of a text message to unwitting users. Upon clicking the link, users will notice that their devices will begin downloading “Tor”, which then will allow Mazar to hide within the source code.You won’t have to worry if you’ve been sent the message and didn’t bother clicking on it, nothing will happen. Heimdal has only tested devices running on Android KitKat (4.4) but notes that the flaw could probably be on past versions.At the same time, it’ll be hard to know if newer versions also have this security hole as no testing was conducted on Lollipop and Marshmallow devices.Firstly, there’s one single line of defence by default on Android smartphones. That’s the ominous “Unknown sources” toggle in your security settings; an option that allows you to allow installations for apps of unknown origins. Believe us, the first thing we did was uncheck that bugger.Russians or Russian-speaking folks will also have another added wall since it apparently doesn’t affect devices with Russian as the default language.

As far as we can tell, out of the box, you’ll be getting the typical wall plug, a micro USB cable, an odd looking OTG-like adapter and a mysterious box – which we’re assuming houses the earphones.It’ll be tough to ascertain if this sale is legitimate but if you’re in Dubai or are willing to fly in just to pick up the unreleased smartphones, then why not?From the images, it looks exactly as depicted in other leaks and rumoured photos. Considering a more official source – ala Samsung Indonesia – the latest South Korean flagships were teased with four images that vaguely highlighted its features.The four photos talked about privacy, possibly an iris scanner or biometric scanning; its irresistible looks, possibly marketing its curves and edges; “worry-less” experience, definitely some sort of water resistance with those bubbles on the screen; and hype about its latest BRITECELL camera technology.Could this be the new Samsung flagships?

Samsung has also said that they will make separate announcements on details of OS updates scheduled for each market accordingly.If we refer to the earlier leaked rollout table, all Marshmallow supported Galaxy devices should receive their update latest by April of this year. That said, the ETA revealed in this table may not be entirely accurate so take it with a pinch of salt.Nevertheless, if we’re sticking to the leaked schedule, we can expect the next Samsung devices to receive the Marshmallow updates to be the Galaxy Note5 and the Galaxy S6 edge+ as those are the two remaining devices with an ETA of February 2016. Exactly when this will happen remains unclear.Android 6.0 brings a host of new features to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge devices, though the edge variant does get the better end of the deal. This is because there are specific improvements coming to the edge screen with this update.Most notable of which is that the panel is no longer limited to the 260-pixel width of the curved part of the display. In fact, it can now be expanded to 550 pixels wide, allowing even more content to be displayed. Now, users can customise up to nine Edge panels including both the People edge and Apps edge.Additionally, most of the Edge panels have also gotten a facelift — the People edge, for example, adds names under contact photos and a useful settings shortcut. Samsung are also introducing the Tasks edge where you can create action shortcuts (like create a contact, add a new note, add an alarm, etc), plus a Quick tools edge which will give you access to stuff like a ruler, flashlight or compass via handy dandy shortcuts.The Edge handle is also customisable, allowing users to control visual features like where it is, the lenght, transparency or get rid of it all together.There is no information on when this update will hit Malaysian Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge devices yet though, so do let us know if you’ve gotten your update already.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

What’s more, it comes with a video!Do we actually have the Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 edge on video for the first time ever? Well, yes and we think a little bit of no.If you’ve been paying attention to our trickle of information sourced from reputable leaksters and renders, you would have known some of (if not most of) the purported specs that are said to adorn Samsung’s upcoming flagship. If you haven’t, what are you waiting for, go get caught up!While the microsite does reveal some features, what is more interesting is the video that they’ve included in the microsite.So, is that an S7/S7 edge or is that a Galaxy S6 edge+ in disguise? There’s no denying that the upcoming S7 looks almost identical to that of the existing Galaxy S6 series (thanks to leaks and renders), but the phone in this ad looks too identical, right down to the camera hump that the S7 is not supposed to have.But, we can’t completely dismiss the fact that this could be an S7 either because of that one scene in the rain. Sure, if you’ve ever spilt some water on a Galaxy S6 edge+, you would have noticed that it doesn’t die immediately (do not try this at home), but we doubt it’s something Sammy would advertise so openly.So, actual S7 hype? Let us know what you think in the comments below.Anyway, if you head on over to the microsite, you’ll be greeted with four separate images, each of which looks like it’s showing off one of the S7’s key features.The first of which looks like an emphasis on security and privacy. What we can deduce from this is that the upcoming S7 will have an improved form of biometric security — most likely a better fingerprint scanner. Though, there have been rumours floating around that the S7 could have an iris scanner.An improved fingerprint sensor seems like a safer bet though as even the new Galaxy A 2016 series is supposed to have an improved fingerprint scanner over the existing Galaxy S6.This one, we’re not too sure. Maybe it’s something about the design or curves or build. It’s a toss up at this point, so go ahead and let us know what you think this slide is trying to say.Couldn’t they have come up with a better word than “worry-less”? In any case, with the huge water droplets being the big hint, it looks like the they’re boasting some kind of water resistance that should be able to resist splash and rain.Finally, we have this, a sexy little macro shot of what looks like the S7’s 12-megapixel camera. This unit is supposed to come with Samsung’s latest BRITECELL camera tech that not only boasts a better low light performance (as is hinted in this picture) but also that it would significantly reduce the smartphone’s camera hump.[SOURCE]"

This little guy for example. Today, we’ve got another handy piece of accessory for your smartphone that lets you hold your phone with your wrist.It’s called the TUSK, or Telephone Utility Support Kit, and is basically a support hinge that you can attach to your wrist to help hold your smartphone in place, acting as a little hands-free kit…that still requires your hands.Although it looks simple, from the demo video that its creator Derek Rieger put together, the little contraption seems to work like a charm. Not only does it strap your phone to your wrist like an Altair attaches his hidden blades, it also brings your smartphone up to you with a simple flick.What’s more, you can rotate your device on the hinge and even extend the support beam so that it holds your phone out in front of your hand for easy access and use.As demonstrated, Derek shows just some of the ways in which the wrist-mounted smartphone mount can help with daily activities — like holding your phone up as a flashlight when you need both hands to work, plus attaching your device face-up on your wrist so you can look at it like people do in sci-fi games and movies.Fallout 4 anyone? It certainly looks a lot more flexible and functional than the plastic wrist mount that comes with the Pip-Boy edition of the game.That said, there are some preliminary potential problems that the creator should probably address, like the ease of which you can attach and detach a smartphone. According to the Kickstarter page, it looks like you will have to stick your smartphone onto the base for it to be held in place.While he claims that it will not leave any residue on your smartphone, we don’t imagine it will be terribly easy to remove and replace your smartphone on the TUSK considering the strength of the adhesive. That said, this can be easily rectified with perhaps a twist lock plate that could be mounted on the back of your smartphone or a dedicated case.Regardless of its faults, this does seem like a pretty cool idea, but do keep in mind that this is still a crowdfunding project, and we’ve all heard the crowd-funding horror stories. If you’re interested in checking this device out, head on over to its Kickstarter page or Derek’s website. You can also pick one up for yourself by pledging a minimum of USD39 (around RM161).What are some of the ways that you could potentially see yourself using this for?

That’s what we told our teachers anyway.Now you’ll have a little more initiative to keep your one and only writing notebook, its reusability. This won’t come to much use in secondary school though it’ll be mighty useful if it was your personal notebook that you lug around to jot down ideas or personal notes since you can instantly upload it to the cloud through an app and your smartphone camera. Erasing comes your way when you use the Rocketbook Wave with Pilot’s Frixion pens and throw it into the microwave for a couple of minutes. The Rocketbook System utilises a special patent-pending image capture tech and 80 pages of its carefully dotted Grid+ system.Other than that, each page will also be accompanied by a particular QR code that organises pages accordingly in order.There are also seven symbols that will correspond to different apps and folders within apps like Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs and OneNote. Labelled the particular symbol on a page with a mark will instantly save that page in the applied app and folder that you’ve chosen. When you save these pages it’ll also be stored in the colour you’ve written in.The paper on Rocketbook’s Wave notebook isn’t all that special. It’s mainly the “thermochromic” ink in Pilot’s Frixion pens that react to heat and cold. However, the people behind notebook made it “microwave safe” and if you take a hairdryer to it, it’ll erase just as well just as long as it reaches 60-degrees Celsius.If you need an indicator, the notebook’s logo is thermally designed to turn white from blue when heated correctly. Rocketbook claims that the Frixion ink won’t fully evaporate when heated but these faint images won’t disturb the cloud-storage of overlaid notes. They’ve also stated to get the best out of the notebook, users can typically use them 10 times after which it might not perform to usual standards.Pledges begin at US$ 37 (RM 154.25) with shipping to Malaysia for one Rocketbook Wave and one black-coloured Pilot Frixion pen while you can pay US$ 141 (RM 587.16) for five notebooks that are each accompanied by a black pen. Adding an additional US$ 7 (RM 29.18) to your pledge will entitle you to a 3-pack of pens (black, red and blue).Delivery is expected to take place in August 2016 and it’ll come in two sizes: Standard, 8.5-inch by 9.5-inch and Executive, 5.8-inch by 8.9-inch.[ SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE ]"
Rory Lee,"Bad news, the iPhone may not be the best phone to time travel with",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/15/apple-iphone-bug-brick-set-date-1-january-1970/,"apple,apple iphone,brick,bug,how to fix iphone brick,ios,ios date brick,ios date bug,iphone,unix,unix time,mobile devices,mobile os","Apple,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-15,"Oh dear, we have another iPhone bug on our hands. If you haven’t been too busy with the Lunar New Year, you probably would have noticed that there is a new iPhone exploit going around that people can abuse to brick your iPhone by simply setting the date to 1st January 1970.Yup, you can brick an iPhone by changing its date.Apparently, the discovery of this bug was thanks to YouTuber Zach Straley, who demonstrates in his video linked above what he thinks is the “fastest” way to brick an iPhone.All you need to do is head into your iPhone’s general settings and switch the date manually to 1st January 1970. It will take a lot of scrolling thanks to Apple’s brilliant manual date setting implementation but you’ll get there eventually.Once that’s done simply restart the device and it will be stuck in a bootloop.While some have suggested that the only way to fix this particular problem is to send your phone in for repairs/a swap, JerryRigEverything has a simpler, more DIY solution.What he did was simply unscrew the back plate of the iPhone, lift it up and disconnect the battery powering the device. After a short 30 second wait, simply reconnect the battery and power on your phone. Disconnecting the battery resets the time and date so your iPhone should be good as new.Why does this happen? Well, the explanation is rather simple actually: Midnight on 1st January 1970 marks the start of what is known as the Unix time system — a simple system that programmers use to represent date and time based on how many seconds had elapsed since that January 1st, 1970.Here’s a video by Tom Scott detailing why this problem happens and how it is related to the Unix time code.In a nutshell, setting the date to 1st January 1970 basically resets the Unix timestamp to zero, and because the phone (or somewhere in the programming code) will do a simple check upon startup (like a battery time calculation), setting the date before January 1st, 1970 (or the Unix epoch) causing an integer underflow.Since you can’t store negative numbers in this format, the number in the 64-bit processor wraps around to its maximum value — a date that is 20 times longer than the expected lifespan of the universe.

A crash.It goes without saying that we do not encourage you to try this out on your iPhone and will not be responsible for any bricking of any iPhones. Do so at your own risk. We also do not encourage you to mess with your buddy’s iPhone otherwise, his/her iPhone may not be the only thing breaking.That said, it does seem rather silly that Apple allowed a bug like this to go through though it is worth mentioning that it only affects 64-bit iOS devices that are running iOS 8 and above.

According to Logitech, the keyboard is also spill-resistant, meaning it is well suited for those of you who have trouble keeping your drink in its cup/bottle.What’s more, the keyboard also features full-sized arrow keys as well as access (via a fn button) to fifteen different function keys ranging from calculator shortcuts to media controls. Logitech also claim that the keyboard comes with an “anti-fading” treatment which — according to them — means that you will “never have to worry about losing the letter from your keys”.These peripherals are fairly discreet in their stealthy black attire though the keys don’t look like they have much of a travel distance.Priced at RM99 for a wireless keyboard and mouse combo, we doubt you will find too much to complain about this setup. It’s a fairly good bargain especially when it comes to wireless peripherals though it is worth noting that they require a USB receiver instead of relying on Bluetooth. Logitech claims that the keyboard and mouse can work up to 10 meters away and that the connection is very stable.Logitech rates the battery life of the keyboard at 36 months while the mouse is expected to last 12 months per charge. They MK235 is also compatible with systems running Windows 7 or later, Mac, Chrome OS, or a Linux kernel 2.6+. For more information, head on over to the MK235’s product page."

This is yet a budget smartphone that’s a notch higher than its current entry-level Lumia 550. Based on earlier speculation, this might be the very last Lumia smartphone for the year. While being an affordable device, the Lumia 650 could be the better built smartphone from Microsoft in a while. Instead of a plasticky body that wraps around its current Lumia 950/950XL flagships, the Lumia 650 features a highly polished, diamond cut and anodized aluminum frame for a premium feel. On top of that, it is currently the thinnest Windows 10 smartphone at only 6.9mm, the same thickness as an iPhone 6.At the front, it gets a modest 5″ AMOLED display that pushes HD 720p resolution and it is toughen with Gorilla Glass 3. Under the hood, it gets a Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 Quad-Core processor that’s clocked at 1.3GHz. There’s also 1GB of RAM and 16GB of on-board storage that’s also expandable up to 200GB extra via microSD. For taking pictures, it gets a more decent 8MP f/2.2 main camera with LED flash, while the front gets a wide-angle 5MP shooter. Despite being a step above the Lumia 550, the battery on the Lumia 650 is slightly smaller at 2,000mAh. For this price range and processor, don’t expect this to support Continuum and it still charges up with a traditional microUSB cable. 
The Lumia 650 supports 4G LTE and it is also available in a dual-SIM variant. Available in either matte black or matte white, it will be first available in Europe starting on 18th February at US$199 (about RM822). As comparison, the Lumia 550 is currently priced at RM559 in Malaysia.For more information, visit Microsoft’s Lumia 650 product page.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Jony Ive’s critics must be having a field day with this news as the brand makes back-to-back “design” mistakes – remember that Smart Battery Case?Anyway, if you dropped your dough on the MacBook, here’s how to get your USB Type-C cable replaced in Malaysia:Check if you’re eligible by looking at your cable to see if they match the affected one below.The ones WITHOUT a serial number after the “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China” are cables that’ll need to be replaced.Once you’ve established that your included cable is eligible, head on over to participating Apple Authorised Service Providers and get your new USB Type-C cable replaced free of charge. Do ensure you bring along your MacBook serial number – preferably with the MacBook and its box in tow – for additional verification of eligibility.To check your serial number, you can do so by checking in OS X by clicking the Apple menu, followed by “About This Mac”. Otherwise, you can physically check on your MacBook underneath the bottom of the laptop and also on the original product packaging.You’ll have until June 8th, 2018 to get your charging cable replaced.Those who have picked up USB Type-C port have felt the pressure with OnePlus being the first one to feel the heat.

The One M9 is very well built but it isn’t up to mark when compared with its flagship rivals.After the release of the One A9, HTC is still sticking to its polished metal unibody looks and the next flagship may not be surprisingly different. The folks at the Taiwanese smartphone brand are working on a new flagship dubbed as the “HTC Perfume” and it is likely to be the One M10 flagship when it launches.Serial leakster @evleaks has gotten a couple of juicy details of what the next HTC flagship might be. According to his source that’s close to the project, the device will get a 5.1″ Quad HD AMOLED display and it will run with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 820 processor. He is also told that it will be equipped with 4GB of RAM and a minimum of 32GB of on-board storage. Like all HTC flagships so far, the storage is still expandable via microSD. HTC isn’t going to kill off its UltraPixel camera feature anytime soon. The main camera at the rear is said to be having a 12MP UltraPixel shooter that’s assisted with Laser AutoFocus while the front gets a 5MP shooter. What’s interesting is that both front and rear cameras are said to be assisted with Optical Image Stabilisation. Like the One A9, the biggest letdown would be the lack of HTC’s famed Boom Sound stereo speakers. It will also get a fingerprint scanner in front that doubles up as a home button. In terms of appearance, @evleaks had shared a front shot of the device as shown below and it somewhat looks like a Meizu smartphone. According to another source, the One M10 will not feature HTC branding at the front and the device will be more heavily packed with camera features. He has even shared a mock-up of what it might look like as shown above. From the design, it looks like a tweaked version of its HTC One A9 which many have mocked for resembling too much like an iPhone. In terms of availability, it could be launched towards the end of April or early May, which by that time, the Galaxy S7 would be widely available worldwide. What do you think?

Recently, two devices have stuck out that are not only roughly the same price, but they also feature roughly the same build and roughly the same specs.Yep, you know what devices we’re talking about — the honor 5X and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3.Both of these devices are metal-clad premium budget devices that are targetted at those who don’t want to spend a whole lot of dough on a phone, but at the same time don’t want their devices to feel like they didn’t spend a whole lot of dough. Fickle right? But I digress.While the two devices share about as many similarities as a pair of identical twins, there are a few things each device does differently so the biggest question is which one should you get? Well, here’s a short comparison that will hopefully give you a little clue.Both of these devices sport a 5.5-inch full-HD display, which as we know is pretty much as good of a compromise as it gets when it comes to crispiness versus battery-saving. However, these two metallic smartphones do not share the same battery size as the honor 5X gets the shorter end of that stick. While the honor 5X does have a pretty substantial 3,000 mAh battery, it simply can’t compare with the Redmi Note 3’s 4,000 mAh battery. Simple math will tell you who is the winner, so if you’re a power user that doesn’t like to carry around a powerbank, the Redmi Note 3 is the better option.Though the first round went to the Redmi Note 3, this is where the honor 5X comes back swinging. The Redmi Note 3 is limited to either 16GB or 32GB of storage as it does not feature a microSD card slot for additional expansion. On the other hand, the 16GB honor 5X does have a microSD card slot, and a dedicated one to boot! That means you can use two SIM cards and a microSD memory card at the same time."

Their new X16 LTE is the first commercially announced modem that’s designed to deliver up to fibre optic 1Gbps speeds over today’s 4G LTE networks. That’s LTE Category 16 speeds, versus the current Cat 9 (600Mbps) and Cat 6 (300Mbps) standards that are supported on current flagship smartphones. Making 1Gbps possible is the use of multiple antennas and advanced signal processing. Through carrier aggregation, the X16 modem can receive 10 streams of LTE data simultaneously through 4 antennas. With an average throughput of 100Mbps per stream, you can get 1000Mbps download speeds combined.  Since late 2014, Qualcomm is capable of hitting 450Mbps via carrier aggregation (3x 20Hz) with up to 64-QAM on the Snapdragon 808 and 810 chipsets. Now with support for 256-QAM, the X16 modem is able to deliver more than double the speeds from the same amount of spectrum. To maximise its potential, it can also tap into LTE unlicensed spectrum such as 5GHz, that’s being used by 802.11ac WiFi.Before you get excited, the X16 modem isn’t available on their current Snapdragon lineup. Their current top-end Snapdragon 820 uses the X12 modem which goes up to 600Mbps. Even if it is available, the real life capabilities depend on the telcos themselves. Both Digi and Maxis have deployed LTE-A at selected locations but the reality is that we only managed to get slightly above 100Mbps versus its theoretical 300Mbps download speeds. So is this 5G? Not really considering trial runs by Huawei and NTT Docomo have already hit 3.6Gbps, with an average speed of 1.34Gbps. What can you do with it? How about watching live stream 360 VR videos at 4K resolution. We probably need to wait a year for devices to support them and a couple years extra for our telcos to catch up. [ SOURCE ]"

Or is there a clip that you would want to save for faster playback? Here’s some good news. Google has quietly rolled out YouTube offline playback in Malaysia and it is available for both iOS and Android users. To download a clip, just open up any video on the official YouTube app on your smartphone. If this is your first time, you should see a pop-up showing you the new “Watch Offline” button on the bottom right of the video. Once you’ve tapped that, you have a choice to download in the quality of your choice up to HD 720p resolution. To save on data, we suggest doing this over WiFi and you can set to download only on WiFi under YouTube settings. To view your offline videos, just head over to your Account Tab (usually on the far right on the YouTube home screen) and click on Saved videos. It doesn’t seem to be a limit on how many videos you can save, so it depends on the amount of free space that’s available on your phone or tablet. According to the FAQ, each video is playable offline up to 48 hours. After that, you would need to reconnect your device to the internet to check for any changes. If the video is still available, the saved video is extended for another 48 hours. Note that not all videos are supported and that includes popular music videos. Interestingly, Google has officially listed 13 countries including Thailand, Indonesia and Philippines to support this feature and initially we thought this would be available only for its upcoming paid YouTube Red service. So if you’re travelling somewhere with poor or no connection at all, you can play your favourite YouTube videos anywhere. Just make sure you “check-in” online every 48 hours. Enjoy!"
Alexander Wong,Here’s what to expect from the Samsung Galaxy S7,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/15/heres-what-to-expect-from-the-samsung-galaxy-s7/,"android,evleaks,mwc 2016,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy s7 edge,samsung galaxy s7 photos,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-15,"In just a week’s time, Samsung will be unveiling its latest flagship, the Galaxy S7 at MWC 2016 in Barcelona. Serial leakster @evleaks have been dropping lots of leaks on their next big thing and this time we get to see its colour options. Find out what to expect from the big day after the break.Models

Like a year ago, Samsung will be announcing two models – a Galaxy S7 and a Galaxy S7 edge that comes with a double curved display. To better differentiate the two, the Galaxy S7 edge will be a larger device (likely a 5.5″) while the “flat” Galaxy S7 will retain a more compact 5.1″ display. Both are still pushing Quad HD resolutions with its brilliant AMOLED displays. Colours & Design
Based on Evan’s latest leak, the Galaxy S7 edge will come with at least 3 colours – Gold, Black and Silver, while the standard S7 comes in Black and Silver. There are probably more to come since Samsung had introduced 4 colours for the S6/S6 edge, inclusive of one exclusive colour for each respective model. With the use of metal and glass, expect the Galaxy S7/S7 edge to have the same “liquid metal” appearance. While it looks quite similar to the previous model, the S7/S7 edge should fit better in the hands with its more rounded corners. Performance
The Exynos 7420 was epic on the previous Galaxy S6/S6 edge and they had even carried it forward onto their latest Galaxy Note5 / S6 edge+ series. For 2016, Samsung will using their newest Exynos processor (Exynos 8890) which will be mated to 4GB of RAM. Samsung is also likely to have Snapdragon 820 powered variants for selected markets. In terms of performance, an earlier leaked photo of a Galaxy S7 edge was spotted scoring over 130,000 on Antutu, making it one of the fastest smartphones to date. Expandability
When the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5 were launched, many were disappointed with the lack of expandable storage and the option to go bigger is either costly or non-available (in certain markets including Malaysia). To cater for power users, the microSD slot is likely to make a return on the S7 and S7 edge. For a greater peace of mind, the flagship duo might get dust and water resistance as well, which is a feature that’s nice to have.Cameras
The cameras on the Galaxy S6/Note 5 were awesome and it was a point and shoot tool that you can rely on. Instead of a 16MP sensor, Samsung will be downsizing on pixel count for larger pixel size. Similar to the Nexus 6P, the new S7/S7 edge will be rocking a lower 12MP BRITECELL camera that should perform better in low light condition. The camera bump apparently will be reduced significantly, making it flush with its back. Availability
Samsung traditionally has been reasonably fast in rolling out its flagship smartphones to its international markets. With the announcement happening end of this month, we could be seeing it on our shores by end-March or early April. Looking at our current ringgit situation, don’t expect it to be any cheaper than its RM2,599 launch price for the Galaxy S6 in Malaysia. VR seems to be a big deal for Samsung this year and there could be a special Gear VR bundle available on the launch day itself. Word has it that the Netherlands will open pre-orders as early as next Monday with a free Gear VR headset bundle thrown in.To catch the launch live, mark your calendars for Monday, 22nd February at 2:00AM. We’ll be there on location, so stay tuned for the latest updates on our Facebook and Twitter channels.[ SOURCE 2 ]"

Now, we have a price and availability.The best part? It’s cheaper than expected.Both these variants were designed to be premium alternatives to the existing Gear S2 Classic, and to be honest, they did look pretty good.Spec-wise, it’s exactly the same as the existing Gear S2 Classic with a 1.2″ circular Super AMOLED (360×360) panel that results in a 302ppi pixel density. It’s powered by a dual-core 1.0GHz processor and runs Samsung’s proprietary Tizen OS. It has 4GB of internal memory and half a GB of RAM.It’s also got other goodies like WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and a heartrate sensor.So, how much does an 18K Rose Gold or Platinum Gear S2 cost? Well, the cheapest Apple Watch Edition 18K Rose Gold costs RM47,000, so that should give you a rough estimate of how much the Gear S2 Classic would cost right?Nope.The Gear S2 Classic 18K Rose Gold and Platinum costs RM1,899, only RM300 more than the original Gear S2 Classic. Plus if you purchase it during the Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day festivities, Samsung will throw in two watch bands worth RM398 — brown and grey — for free. This deal is on a first come first served basis though.If you’re interested, these watches will be available now in all 13 participating Samsung Brand Stores nationwide.

Alexander Wong,TMgo now offers Unlimited 4G LTE Broadband on postpaid?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/10/tmgo-postpaid-unlimited-4g-lte-broadband/,"4g lte,4g lte broadband,broadband,postpaid,tm 4g lte,tm lte,tmgo,tmgo postpaid,tmgo unlimited,unlimited broadband,lte,players on the field,tm","LTE,Players on the Field,TM",2016-02-10,"UPDATE: TMgo Unlimited Postpaid Plan is available at limited areas. More details after the break.TM is going big on 4G LTE this year. Before they launch their all-new mobile service via P1, TM is currently offering 4G LTE broadband through TMgo. Prior to this, TMgo is available only as a prepaid service and you can sign up for it with a USB dongle or a 4G MiFi hotspot device.If you’re looking for something more permanent for the home, it appears that TM is now offering a postpaid plan that comes with unlimited quota. Sounds like the perfect plan if you can’t get streamyx or Unifi at home.According to a forum post, TMgo postpaid is offered at RM99/month with a 24 months contract. While TMgo’s 4G LTE network is capable of going up to 20Mbps, the plan only offers 1Mbps download speeds. Interestingly, the user has shared that he managed to get 2Mbps download.As this is meant for home use, TM is bundling the Huawei B593 Fixed Wireless Terminal worth RM350 for free. Since TMgo is a broadband only service, you can’t make or receive voice calls. Overall, the pricing is quite similar to P1’s unlimited home broadband offering but TMgo operates on LTE at 850MHz band instead of 2.3GHz WiMAX. In terms of coverage, TMgo is available in Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Sabah, Sarawak and Selangor. You can check if you’re place is covered over here.Thanks @9VSQA for the tip!

Alexander Wong,HTC One A9 is now on sale in Malaysia with a premium price,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/09/htc-one-a9-is-now-on-sale-in-malaysia-with-a-premium-price/,"android,htc,htc malaysia,htc one a9,htc one a9 malaysia,htc one a9 price,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-09,"Mobile World Congress 2016 is kicking off very soon and we expect a couple of new flagship smartphones to be announced in Barcelona. Right after the Chinese New Year festivities, HTC Malaysia will be introducing the HTC One A9 in Malaysia. The official launch is happening next week, 18th February but a couple of dealers have already started selling the device. The One A9 isn’t exactly HTC’s new flagship but it is their premium mid-range smartphone that comes with a metal unibody design. At first glance, the back does look like an iPhone 6 especially with its flat surface and distinct antenna band lines. According to their CEO, Cher Wang, the One A9 is a good alternative to Cupertino’s popular smartphone.In terms of specs, it gets a 5″ Full HD display with Corning Gorilla glass and underneath it is a home key that doubles up as a fingerprint scanner.  Powering the device is an Octa-Core 64-bit Snapdragon 617 processor, which is a notch above the popular mid-range Snapdragon 615/616 processor. For Malaysia, we are getting 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage which can be expanded via microSD. For optics, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 main camera with Optical Image Stabilisation, while selfies are handled by its 4MP Ultra-pixel front camera. Despite being a HTC, the One A9 sadly does not come with its famed BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers. Instead, they have included a DAC that does Dolby Audio with 24-bit Hi-Res Audio. The HTC One A9 is their first smartphone with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, and it supports 4G LTE on a single SIM. Keeping the lights on is a 2,150mAh battery that’s tiny for a device of this class. Most retailers in Malaysia including DirectD and SuperBuy are selling the HTC One A9 at RM2,199, which is quite pricey for its segment. Samsung’s Galaxy A series priced between RM1,299 to RM1,899 is already quite costly and the HTC One A9 just sets the bar higher as probably the most expensive mid-range Android smartphone at the moment. For the price, you would be better off with a Samsung Galaxy S6 or a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. [ SOURCE 2 Image Source ]"

With Marshmallow, the G4 will get to reap all the benefits of the new version of Android including stuff like Doze and Now on Tap.Doze is definitely a much-needed addition to the G4’s repertoire of features because this device has, at best, had a very mediocre battery life from its 3,000 mAh unit. It is a replaceable battery though so things aren’t too bad if you’ve got one on hand.If you don’t know what Doze does, it basically puts the device into a low power state when it is not being used. Think iPad, and you will sort of get the general idea. In our experience, when we unplugged our Nexus 6P at 100% before heading to bed, once the next morning comes around, the device still has about 98-99% of its battery life left, even with WiFi on.Now on Tap is another great feature which lets you hold down the home key to let the OS scan what’s on your screen and pick out important highlights such as names, dates, and locations among other things.You also get access to App Permissions, which lets you individually change each app’s permission settings in the Settings menu. We got our update with a simple notification from our device, but if you haven’t gotten the notification, you can manually check if it has rolled out to your device yet.Simply head to Settings>General>About phone>Update Center>Software Update. If there is a pending update there will usually be a “1” in a red circle next to the Software Update button. Otherwise, just hit Software Update and hit the “Check now for update” button. If it isn’t there yet, simply wait a few days for it to roll out to you. For reference, the file size for the update is about 880MB.If you’d like to find out more about this update, head on over here. Or simply pull down your notifications after your G4 has been updated and hit the learn more about Marshmallow notification."

Previously, its purported official press pics have suggested a similar appearance with its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge flagship, but it gets some refinements to make it smoother around the edges. If these images are the real deal, this is the best look at what Samsung has to reveal at Barcelona on 21st February.The first picture above is said to be the Galaxy S7. The back gets a curve treatment like the Galaxy Note5 but it gets more contoured edges not only at the sides but at the top and bottom portions as well. It still uses both metal and glass, but the frames appear to be thinner for a flush look. Instead of aluminium, Samsung is said to be using magnesium frame this time for the Galaxy S7 series. As we’ve heard previously, the camera bump is now minimised with a subtle ring around the lens.  In terms of performance, the new Exynos processor will be pushing the bar higher. Pictured above is a Galaxy S7 edge (SM-G9350) that apparently scored an impressive 134,704 on Antutu. That’s higher than the iPhone 6s Plus which destroyed every Android flagship smartphone for 2015. Appearance wise, the Galaxy S7 edge looks more rounded and it kinda reminds us of the Pebble-ly shaped Galaxy S III.To recap, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge is expected to come in a 5.1″ and 5.5″ display respectively, both of which are pushing Quad HD display. This time, Samsung is likely to make both devices dust and water-resistant like its former Galaxy S5 and expandable storage via microSD is expected to make a comeback as well. Since the Galaxy S6 was a stellar camera performer, the new Galaxy is expected to improve further with a 12MP shooter that has bigger pixels and larger aperture for better low light images. What do you think of the design? Let us know in the comments below. [ SOURCE 2, VIA ]"

Now LG has teased a new feature that will help make time telling easier than ever. The new LG G5 flagship will be having an always-on display that will show the clock plus your notifications even when the phone is asleep.  From the official teaser, the always-on display is shown as a tiny square box, which is similar to what you see on a typical MiFi display. Instead of a dedicated secondary ticker display like the LG V10, LG will be showing everything on a single screen. Having an always-on display isn’t entirely new as Nokia have done with its with AMOLED equipped Lumia smartphones using Glance. What’s fascinating is if LG can pull it off on a standard IPS display. Using an AMOLED would make more sense as each individual pixels can be turned off completely to save on power. On the other end, Samsung is said to be introducing a similar feature of their own with the Galaxy S7. The LG G5 and Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 edge will be announced on 21st February, a day before MWC 2016 officially opens. Which flagship smartphone are you more excited about?

We are seeing more action cams with 360 capabilities and more smartphone players are jumping on the VR experience. Instead of forking money on fancy Oculus or Samsung Gear VR headset, the next Alcatel OneTouch smartphone will give you a VR experience out of the box, quite literally. Meet the Alcatel’s new OneTouch Idol 4S. Before we talk about the device, check out its clever packaging. Instead of a recyclable paper box, the Idols 4S is packaged in a hard case that doubles as a VR Headset. No worries about support as the headset is Google Cardboard compliant. It’s a pretty clever use of packaging and we wonder why nobody has thought of this earlier. In terms of specs, the Idol 4S is a step above Alcatel’s usual low to mid-range offering. The front 5.5″ display pushes a high-resolution Quad HD AMOLED display and it is powered by an Octa-Core Snapdragon 652 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board it gets 16GB of storage that’s expandable via microSD. The main camera is said to be a 16MP f/2.0 shooter while the front comes with an 8MP selfie cam that’s assisted by a flash light. From the photo above, it does look like a cross-mix between a Galaxy S6 and a Sony Xperia Z3 series. It appears to be using glass and metal for its body, and there’s a protruding power button on the right side. Combining a VR capable headset box, the overall Alcatel OneTouch Idol 4S package is expected to be priced at US$400 (about RM1658), which is able to give the HTC One A9 a run for its money. Also to be announced is a lower spec Idol 4 that comes with a smaller 5.2″ display with a Snapdragon 617 processor and 2GB RAM.[ SOURCE ]"

Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S7 still has a camera bump but it should be negligible,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/04/samsung-galaxy-s7-still-has-a-camera-bump-but-it-should-be-negligible/,"android,camera bump,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy s7 camera,samsung galaxy s7 specs,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-04,"When the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5 came out, you can’t miss the protruding camera lens on the back. Fortunately, the cameras performed remarkably well but some would prefer if they could eliminate the bump for better aesthetics. If you prefer for something more flush, the upcoming Galaxy S7/S7 edge might be close to achieving that according to serial leakster @OnLeaks. Based on his intel, the Galaxy S7/S7 edge will still get a camera bump but it should be negligible. The current Galaxy S6 bump pops out by 1.7mm, while the new Galaxy S7 is said to be 0.8mm, which is more than 50% reduction. This is made possible with Samsung’s own BRITECELL camera technology that’s designed for slimmer smartphone design. The new cameras are said to be lower in pixel count at 12MP but it would be compensated with larger pixels for greater light sensitivity. Camera bumps or not, we are more concerned about its picture quality and we definitely expect more from Samsung after seeing the performance of its current 16MP shooters.When the Galaxy S7 press renders went public, it looks very identical to its current S6 flagship but there are some minor design details that add more refinement. The double curve back design from the Galaxy Note5 is carried forward onto the Galaxy S7, while the section of the glass where it meets the edge is contoured slightly as shown above. With a larger battery, purported to be a 3,000mAh unit, the Galaxy S7 will be thicker at 7.9mm (Galaxy S6: 6.8mm) but the overall width and height will be smaller thanks to its thinner bezels. So overall, you should be expecting a more compact design that’s smoother to hold in the hand. This kinda reminds us of the Galaxy S III with its Pebble like appearance. In terms of materials, Samsung will continue to use metal and glass for a premium look and feel. The Galaxy S7 will be unveiled during Samsung Unpacked 2016 in Barcelona, a day before MWC 2016 starts. You can catch it live on 22nd February at 2AM Malaysian time. We will be there on location, so stay tuned for the latest updates as it happens."

First off, the Pebble Health app gets support for Health-enabled watch faces, set to arrive on the Pebble app store. Besides that, the app’s makers say that it is now “more accurate overall” and supports the option to show step distance in kilometers.This update also brings an improvement to MMS messages — they now show descriptive icons and any text included. To keep the older Pebble Time and Time Steel up to speed, they’ve gotten some speed improvements which should mean smoother and quicker overall performance. “Under the hood fixes and stability improvements” have also been released with this update.Watch-Only mode also gets a nice bump in power optimisation. This improved version should keep Pebble’s smartwatches working for longer when the battery is running the low.Finally, the Pebble Time app for Android sports a new Reply to call with SMS feature.

Me neither. As a consumer, I couldn’t be bothered about how well a company did in the last quarter, only that I can keep receiving the excellent service I chose. Numbers were never my thing — which explains my profession — so when people start droning on about how much they grew over the last quarter…I fall asleep.Imagine my surprise then when I sat through an entire financial report without dozing off once. All two and a half minutes of it!How do you turn one of the most boring things ever into something digestible by everyone? Make a viral video.Well, it isn’t quite viral yet, but it certainly checks a lot of the right boxes. All they need is for someone to fall down in it.We like to think that Maxis has a couple of good ideas up their sleeves. A quick look at how they treat their employees is a good indication. They’re certainly not afraid to try new stuff out. Innovation is key, and this time, I think Maxis knocked it out of the park.They made use of modern video making tools like clever graphics and an attractive colour scheme (plus that popular off-camera-side-profile-shot) to deliver something that is usually meant for boring people in equally boring suits.No offence, but you probably see us as hippies sitting around a bonfire so that description is fair I think.What makes this video unique is that it makes the viewer feel smart. We like it when we can actually understand what a financial report is actually talking about, something that has always eluded me when it is presented in the form of a stack of dead processed trees.But, the key ingredient is that they’re building a personality. A relatable face for the company (notice he wasn’t wearing a fancy suit, only a simple shirt). Think of your favourite YouTubers, you remember them for who they are as people, right?

When we pay for a service we can get really demanding and it’s fair to act accordingly because we’re paying.In the telco segment, things have heated up ever since the whole widest 4G LTE population coverage issue stroked the flame. A ping pong match developed and there was even an invitation to hold a forum on the State of LTE in Malaysia – which didn’t catch on.Most recently, we’re seeing a price war between Celcom, Digi and U Mobile with all three throwing the lowest they can to rake in customers before the first quarter comes to a close. The green colour telco opted not to partake as they believe it’s quality that counts.But now data is King and everyone who uses a smartphone needs their 4G LTE. And we saw that Maxis didn’t take data lightly with revenue coming from a fair amount of data. They’ve also put back RM 1.3 billion to their network and IT infrastructure.CEO Morten Lundal talks about some highlights including:Revenue, profit and market share are all in the green
4G LTE population coverage now at 71%

The amount of knowledge on the Internet is endless and sometimes that’s a bad thing. Individuals motivated in desecrating others that have opposing views can use it to make homemade weapons and spread their ideology to the world.Exploitation of information is rife in our current age and the misuse of it can have devastating effects. Yes, the Internet is our friend – in most cases – and Google wants to keep it that way.Hence, when you search keywords that are related to extremism, Google will start showing you anti-radicalisation links.The initiative is a part of Google’s new pilot program that will directly counter the web presence of radical groups. In conjunction with the link-side of things, searching for extremist videos will also be accompanied by anti-radicalisation videos.But here’s the thing, Google won’t remove the search queries that related to extremism. They’ll just provide NGOs a platform to counter terrorist group’s efforts.Of course, it won’t be just to counter terrorist efforts. The program that the search engine has put out is called “Google Adwords Grant”. A place where eligible organisations can put themselves out there for the world to see by harnessing search ads.This allows NGOs and other parties to use text-based ads that’ll appear on Google search result pages. Users will need to target specific keywords and be billed up to a maximum of US$ 2.00 per click. As it is a grant, Google will hand US$ 10,000 (up to US$ 40,000 for Pro participants) worth of AdWords advertising per month.Social media has been a place that extremist can use to recruit new supporters, radicalise the masses and fundraise their “religious” campaign. These aren’t the same people who put their bearded leaders in front of a flag shot with some low-quality camera anymoreISIS/Daesh have now proven their proficiency in engaging people through YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and even internet memes. They’ve modernised and utilised the tools available to them with Google probably being one of those tools.Our efforts to curb radicalisation of the world (regardless of faith and race) has to be stern. The methods have to come quickly and start in every country. The folks at Silicon Valley need to do the same. As we know, the Internet is everything these days.[ SOURCE, 2, 3, VIA ]"
Alexander Wong,"Which telco in Malaysia offers the best value for calls, SMS and data all in?",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/05/malaysia-high-quota-postpaid-plan-comparison-celcom-digi-maxis-umobile/,"celcom,celcom first gold,celcom first postpaid,celcom postpaid,digi,digi postpaid,digi smartplan 75,malaysia postpaid comparison,malaysia postpaid plan,maxis,maxis postpaid,maxisone plan,postpaid,postpaid plan,postpaid plan comparison,u mobile,u mobile hero p70 postpaid,u mobile hero postpaid,u mobile postpaid,players on the field","Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-02-05,"UPDATE: Check out our updated comparison which includes supplementary lines.Malaysians are really getting spoilt for choice as the major telcos have gotten into a postpaid price war by delivering more data for less. After U Mobile introduced its Hero Postpaid plan that offered 7GB of data and unlimited calls to all networks for RM70/month, the competition is seriously heating up.Digi has thrown the gauntlet by introducing its SmartPlan 75 that comes with similar offering at RM75/month for a limited time only. Just earlier this week, Celcom has responded by revamping its FIRST Gold Postpaid plan with 10GB of data for only RM80/month. So which is the best “Pau ka liau” (do everything) plan in town? Read on to find out. Celcom
On the surface, Celcom offers the best value with 10GB for RM80/month. That’s equivalent to just RM8 per GB, and you also get unlimited free calls and SMS for greater peace of mind. However the only gripe is probably the way they split the data. 5GB is given for all day use and the other 5GB is only for the weekends (split at 1.25GB per weekend). If you need more data, you can top up RM20 per GB and it is valid according to your billing cycle. Another plus for Celcom is that you can carry forward unused data up to 5GB but this is only from the all-day data bucket. On top of that, they are giving out 5GB of WiFi for free, but that’s only usable if you can find a Celcom WiFi hotspot in the first place. Digi/U Mobile
For Digi and U Mobile, both are very similar with 7GB of data and unlimited free calls. Unlike Celcom and Maxis, you would need to pay for SMS. For Digi, you can enjoy unlimited SMS but that’s only applicable to 3 numbers on their network. If you use more than 7GB, you can top up data but both only offers a single short term option. 1GB on Digi costs RM8 and it is only valid for 2 days while U Mobile offers a booster pack of 1.5GB at RM10 that’s valid for 3 days. UPDATE: Maxis and Digi have upgraded their plans with more data. More details here.Maxis
Meanwhile for Maxis, they are the most expensive of the lot offering just 1GB at RM98/month. While they promise a worry-free proposition with unlimited calls and SMS, it is way costly if you compare this with Celcom’s FIRST Gold plan side by side. Even if you plan to add more data, it will cost you a hefty RM30 per GB. What’s more mind boggling is that Maxis is offering 4GB of data for only RM48/month for its Hotlink prepaid users. Of course, pricing is just one factor to consider. There are other things to take into account such as 4G LTE coverage, quality of calls, customer service, and other value added services that you may use in the future. For Celcom, they are offering unlimited music service via Yonder, while Digi offers unlimited music streaming for 120 days and free iflix for a year. On U Mobile, you get to enjoy free YouTube and Tonton streaming between 2AM and 10AM, plus free music streaming for radio and KKBox all day. If you travel a lot, U Mobile is also offering free 50MB data roaming daily for selected countries. As for Maxis, they do offer free Spotify with free streaming quota for its MaxisOne Plan but that’s only applicable if you opt for its higher MaxisONE 128 plan and above. Which plan would you choose?

This time, they’re going after a bunch of people who have a half eaten fruit plastered on their device. In this latest scam, Apple users are being warned not to open a text message sent by “iTunes” requesting for their personal account information.The scammers are disguising themselves as the Cupertino company’s popular entertainment hub, iTunes, attempting to extract sensitive personal information of the user’s accounts.When users receive the text message, it seems based on this report, that the sender’s ID will show up as iTunes on their iPhones. The message informs the users that their iTunes account has been frozen because “iTunes” were unable to validate their information.After that, there is a short link the scammers have so helpfully provided which will allow users to “validate” their account information. According to Express.co.uk, the link contains a major malicious virus — which is unsurprising since we now know it’s a scam.Either way, Apple users are encouraged not to click on that link should they receive the text message, instead delete it immediately. Apple warns:The iTunes Store will never ask you to provide personal information or sensitive account information (such as passwords or credit card numbers) via email. Email messages that contain attachments or links to non-Apple websites are from sources other than Apple, although they may appear to be from the iTunes Store. Most often, these attachments are malicious and should not be opened. You should never enter your Apple account information on any non-Apple website.It is unclear if this scam affects Malaysians, so do let us know in the comments below if you’ve received this text message so that it will serve as a warning to local Apple users.This has clearly not been the first time scammers have tried to prey on the unsuspecting public, so we do encourage you to give every message you receive some thought before blindly following what the scammers tell you to do.[SOURCE, 2]"

Taking his time in between companies to envision Mars with human settlements through SpaceX; making efficient zero emission cars through Tesla Motors; and conceptualising a transportation system that’ll change the way we commute altogether through Hyperloop, the South African-born 44-year-old has a lot on his plate.But today, we’re going to be talking about the Tesla Model S and its autopilot app called Remote S. Basically, the app lets you check up on your electric car and even get it to drive without anyone in the car.Tesla released the new feature in their latest “Autopilot” update (version 7.1) that includes the “Summon” feature, allowing you to remotely control your car. Now it’s limited to only “summon forward” and “summon reverse” within 39 feet but CEO, Elon Musk says “eventually, your Tesla will be able to drive anywhere across the country to meet you”. He predicts the fiction will turn into fact in two years.For myself, the thrill of owning a car would be to drive it but having an option just to sit back and let your vehicle do the work for you during long cross-state drives would be a great addition.Musk also touched on that snake-like charging plug. Yeah, the one below that’ll blow your mind.He says that it’s still under wraps, being developed in the confines of Tesla HQ with plans to bring it to market only after they’ve made it look sexier.

Okay, maybe not in those exact words, but you get the point.The Chinese SoC manufacturer has insisted on Weibo that the Helio X20 is already in mass production and there have been no instances of chip overheating observed. GSM Arena notes that while this is not too surprising, what is surprising is the way the chip stays cool.Apparently, when the higher end pair of 2.5GHz Cortex-A72 cores gets hot, they shut off, turning the chip into an octa-core Cortex-A53 processor. Basically, that means that for the most part, the fancy deca-core Helio X20 is only running on eight cores.That’s like buying a V10 car but only using all the cylinders some of the time. Actually, it’s worse because the two highest performing cores are the ones that aren’t working. That’s actually more like telling the only two grade-A scholars in your 10-man group assignment to take a break while the other average joes work on the assignment.Okay, maybe that isn’t a fair comparison, but on the surface, it sure looks like it. We’ll have to see how this chip actually pans out in daily usage because that’s the most important aspect.

This feature will extend to apps like Hangouts, Telegram, Viber, WeChat and WhatsApp.Users will do so when utilising the “Okay Google, Send a *insert app name* message to *name of person*” command followed by their message.

Not one that was on par with the big boys at Android. Much like Apple, it always banked on its “OS optimisations” to keep things running smooth despite the less than stellar specifications. This time, though, it seems Microsoft have come out swinging, pulling out all the stops for their latest device, the Lumia 950 XL.Is it any good though?Well, yes and no. It does have a fantastic camera that can definitely replace your average portable camera. I guess a proper PureView unit will be able to do that. Plus, it has a bunch of cool concepts like Continuum and Windows Hello. Unfortunately, that’s where the good news stops.The one or two things that Microsoft gets right with this smartphone simply gets overwhelmed by everything they did wrong. It is almost painful to watch something that could have been a true contender for the best smartphone of 2015, fall so hard so fast.If you’re looking for the next best smartphone, you won’t find it here. If you’re just looking for a decent smartphone, you might not find it here either. I simply can’t justify recommending this smartphone to any but the most stalwart of Windows fans.Why?"

For now the mirror has a Forecast weather widget and an Associated Press RSS feed plus a clock. Braun says it’s incomplete though and is currently playing with concepts like traffic, reminders and basically anything that has a Google Now card.He says that the idea is users don’t have to interact with this UI, and it updates automatically. For anything else, it’s got an open-ended voice search interface.Super cool. If you’d like to find out more about how he did it or build one for yourself, you can head on over to his post on Medium.For everyone else who lacks the technical skill to build one of these themselves, join me in a plea to get Google to put this or something like this, into production.

After a slew of midrange to budget smartphones in the Xiaomi Redmi 3 and Redmi Note 3, the Chinese company eventually revealed that the next phone will be a flagship Mi 5.The best part? It’s said to be unveiled on 24 February. Rumours and leaks obviously exploded and many of them pointed at Xiaomi releasing two different Mi 5s — one with a glass and metal construction and one that is all metal. Now it looks like we have a leaked photo of one of the backs.What you’re looking at is supposedly the back plate of the glass + metal variant of the but, what’s interesting is that they don’t match up with the renders of the device we revealed earlier.First off, the flash is on the wrong side of the camera module — opposite of that on the Mi Note as well — but the shape is pretty much the same. Secondly, this back panel isn’t curved either as suggested by earlier leaked renders.It does look good though, there’s no doubt about that, especially with that fascinating pattern. Not quite the Redmi 3’s diamond etched but a more polished refined brush. Not sure how it would feel in the hand though.As a recap of the Mi 5’s specs, it is said to run a Snapdragon 820 processor with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM as well as either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Unfortunately, not all Mi 5s will be made the same as the all-metal variants are said to be the lower specd version.That means, the all-metal devices will feature a full HD 1080p resolution screen whereas the glass and metal ones will pack a QHD 2K display. Sizes for the screen has been said to range from either 5-5.2″.For camera specs, it is said to feature a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a 3,600 mAh battery to give it juice.

Tons of new phones, tons of new devices and a whole lot of people. But smartphone manufacturers have begun to hijack the crowd that will be going to MWC and have their own launch event just before it.Two tech giants have done exactly that — LG and Samsung — but while it was very likely the LG G5 would be revealed on 21 February, we never had any confirmation…until now. LG USA has released three teaser images featuring the number 5 plus a caption reading #LGG5, February 21st. #MWC2016″. #Hype?Worth noting that LG USA has since removed the tweet. Was it a blunder or an intentional tease?This means the G5 and Samsung’s dynamic Galaxy S7 duo will go head to head on the same day. While we’ve heard a lot of exciting specs about these two devices, we want to know is, which would you get?On paper, these 2016 flagships clearly have not skimmed on power. The LG G5, for example, is said to sport the latest next-gen processor from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 820 — a quad-core chip with their latest Kryo CPU architecture — plus 3GB (some say 4GB) of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.Samsung’s latest flagships will allegedly feature similar specs to the LG G5. According to popular leakster @evleaks, the upcoming Samsung devices will feature either a Snapdragon 820 or an Exynos 8890 processor (depending on the region) coupled with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage.However, while the S7 and S7 edge are supposed to have a larger 3,000 mAh and 3,600 mAh battery respectively compared to the LG G5’s small 2,800 mAh unit, the LG G5’s battery is removable.Here is where Samsung has the slight edge though as their S7 will likely come in two variants — the 5.1-inch regular version and the 5.5-inch edge version. They will also be Quad HD Super AMOLED displays and we know just how fantastic Samsung’s panels are. Plus, the edge variant will probably have all of Samsung’s nifty edge features to boot.The LG G5, though, allegedly has a smaller 5.3-inch screen (down from the G4’s 5.5-inch panel. Why did LG decide to go with a smaller display? Well its allegedly because they want to make room for a secondary ticker display (think LG V10) which can house notifications, updates, quick settings among other things. The good thing about cramming a Quad HD panel on a 5.3-inch screen though is that the dots per inch (dpi) value will be off the charts. 640 dpi actually.Details on the LG G5’s camera are a little all over the place at the moment. Some say that the device will come with a 21-megapixel Sony sensor while others place a 16-megapixel shooter with a secondary camera on the back of the G5 which will help it achieve a wide 135-degree field of view. Either way, with how good the G4 and V10’s cameras are, we don’t think LG will let us down with the G5.Samsung, on the other hand, has pulled out all the stops, introducing their new BRITECELL camera technology that will not only reduce the size of the camera hump but also improve low light performance. Pair that with a 12-megapixel sensor with an f/1.7 aperture lens and we’ve got what looks like a very capable camera.Both devices will obviously feature a front-facing selfie shooter, with the LG G5’s one suspected to be an 8MP unit while the S7 gets a 5MP snapper.Samsung’s new flagships have a host of extra features that were missing on the Galaxy S6. Waterproofing is supposed to be one of them. A microSD card slot is also supposed to be another, which will undoubtedly put a smile on Sammy’s fans.LG though, seem to have baked something rather interesting into their G5. While rumours of an iris scanner have been floating around, there has been no solid confirmation on whether or not this is true. What does seem to keep popping up is something called the “Magic Slot” which is supposed to allow for modular hardware upgrade — some examples include different types of cameras.While there is no word on how this will be implemented exactly, it is something to look out for. However, there is no hard confirmation on whether the smartphone will come with a microSD card slot.While these devices do look fairly good on paper, keep in mind that these are only rumours and nothing has been officially confirmed yet so we’ll have to wait until the 21st of February to see. Still, this is shaping up to be a pretty interesting fight.What do you guys think? Which is the worthier flagship? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE, VIA]"

And it doesn’t hurt if it can help track your day’s worth of fitness and activity.Fitbit has finally realised that their fitness trackers aren’t the greatest looking wearables in the market, so at CES 2016 they released the chunky Blaze. And they’ve just added another device to their fashion-forward fitness trackers: the Fitbit Alta.As we talked about the Blaze before, the market now prefers to have an all-in-one device. A device that can do all the amazing things a fitness tracker can but still look amazing dangling on your wrist.The Fitbit Alta includes the brand’s all-day activity tracking system, auto-sleep tracking and also has a “move reminder” to get you off your bum from sitting too long. Alta will arrive with FitBit’s latest feature that allows SmartTack-ing: that will switch to exercise tracking when it has noticed your steps suddenly increasing rapidly for a certain period.You’ll interact with the display by tapping on the OLED display, rather than swiping left and right. Alta doubles as a watch too, unlike the Fitbit Flex. If you’re into notifications on your wrist, you’ll have that too, thanks to the band’s smart notifications that’ll relay after pairing with your smartphone through Bluetooth 4.0.Fitbit quotes 5-days of battery life on the Alta, that’s also water/sweat resistant (no IP rating mentioned). It would’ve been nice if they managed to cram an altimeter to track floors climbed and an optical heart sensor but you can’t have it all.It plays nice with iOS, Android and Windows devices while syncing will be done through Fitbit’s amazing app and platform. The UI is intuitive, the way data is presented is easy on the eyes and it has a social aspect of it too.In the States, you can now pre-order the device with the Classic elastomer band for US$ 129.95 (RM 539.40). It’ll come in four colours: Black, Blue, Plum and Teal. The add-on leather band goes for US$ 59.95 (RM 248.84) while the metal bracelet goes for US$99.95 (RM 414.87). Alta is slated to arrive in March.When it arrives in Malaysia in March, the Fitbit Alta will cost RM 600. Slightly more expensive than USA pricing. The add-on bands will go for RM 130, elastomer; RM 250, leather and; RM 420, stainless steel.When it goes on sale in March, you can purchase the Fitbit Alta at the retailers listed below:A One Plus

Rory Lee,VAIO made a really sexy smartphone…that runs Windows,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/04/vaio-made-a-really-sexy-smartphone-that-runs-windows/,"japan,microsoft,smartphone,vaio,vaio phone,vaio windows phone,windows 10,windows phone,mobile devices,mobile os","Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows 10,Windows Phone",2016-02-04,"Microsoft‘s return to the mobile industry has so far been a disaster. Their recent sales figures are abysmal. Plus their latest flagship is far from stellar. Yet it seems the folks in Japan haven’t gotten the memo because here’s VAIO‘s latest smartphone — the Phone Biz — and it runs Windows 10.
Here we go, another Windows Phone that will probably be let down by the buggy software. Why should you care about this phone? Well, the design for one is magnificent.If you’re unhappy with the fantastic-in-plastic Lumia 950 series then this VAIO Phone Biz may be the device you’ve been waiting for. It looks muy good with that metallic finish and aluminium build.  The rails look really well done too, with the slight rounding just before it touches the screen to help with grip.The front is sleek and clean looking (which you would expect if it is supposed to be a business-centric phone) but I’m a little worried about that massive bottom chin. It’s not like it has a great big speaker at the back/front or anything so why is the bezel so big?Still, that subtle curve at the back is definitely attractive if you can ignore the tiny speaker grille and the two panels at the top and bottom.However, on the inside things aren’t as good. It’s got a 5.5-inch 1080p LCD panel with a Snapdragon 617 processor and 3GB of RAM. For camera optics, you get a 13MP rear shooter with a single LED flash. Decidedly midrange then, though it is worth mentioning that this device supports Continuum — a function that lets you use your phone like a desktop.Here’s the weird part: That power button placement. This is a 5.5-inch device with a massive chin and forehead bezel but the power button looks like it’s located right at the top. Pick up your 5.5-inch phone and try to reach the top without changing your grip on the phone. Any luck?Either way, this sleek metal thing will go for JPY50,000 (around RM 1760), but there is no news on whether it will be available locally. All that’s dandy but why Windows 10? Surely there has to be a better mobile OS.VAIO spun off from Sony when Sony decided to sell off its computer division due to declining PC sales. This would be their second phone after the first rebranding of the Panasonic Eluga U2.[SOURCE]"

Whenever this happens, we’re left dreading the moment we take the first glance at it. Is the screen cracked? Can it function normally? Has it died forever?When you have something on your wrist, the circumstances are slightly different. You won’t drop it since it’s attached to your hand but you’ll probably have it bump around when rushing through doors and corridors. I once had a stainless steel strap “break” as it got caught on an edge. It was a knock off Seiko.But for Gareth Cross, it was his Apple Watch’s cracked display.Putting claims in your description of a product can apparently get you in hot water – even if it only costs your company £ 429 (RM 2599.30).Mr Cross’ interpretation of Apple’s “impact resistant” smartwatch lead him to rough it up a bit. He’s usually quite harsh with his stuff so the claim allowed him to be his usual self. The man from Aberystwyth noticed a crack in the OLED Apple Watch display after just 10 days and when he contacted an Apple rep, they told him the regular warranty wouldn’t cover it.Deciding to take matters in his own hand, he took Apple to a small claims court for the breach of the Sale of Goods Act and surprisingly won the case after being tied up in court for six months. Cupertino ended up coughing up the sum mentioned earlier and has since changed their description of their smartwatch, removing the “impact resistant” claim.After the incident, Cross still plans to buy another Apple Watch – with the money he received from the manufacturer.Looks like the small man won this time and made a big corporation bow down and be caught in a “lie”. Maybe the average Joe/Jane should start doing the same thing. Put the hammer down and make these companies accountable for what they say about their devices.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

It seems that word has gotten out that the Helio X20 chipset is facing some issues and that’ll cause manufacturers to write them off and opt for a more reliable SoCs.This news isn’t going to be well-received as the MediaTek processor were one of the three anticipated flagship chipsets that are slated to make their way in devices this year.News coming out of China have alleged that initially the X20 processor was battling Wi-Fi issues – that apparently was solved – but now people are saying that the processor is having overheating issues. That’s another flagship processor that has been (supposedly) hit by the thermal bug, as last year we saw it on the Snapdragon 810.A timeline leaked yesterday that state that this processor will be on rolling out at the end of March but with this overheating issue, that’ll be a problem for sure to stick to the schedule.Posted in Weibo, a user stated that Xiaomi, HTC and Lenovo will scrap the Helio X20 processor on their upcoming devices due to the processor’s heat issues. A debacle that some smartphone manufacturers faced when using the Snapdragon 810 chipset a year ago.You can only trust a rumour as far as you can throw it so don’t take everything at face value. But once MWC 2016 rolls around you’ll see how two smartphone makers – Zopo and Doogee – manage to handle this overheating, if any at all.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

Yes, a case that adds functionality to your Pebble. The TYLT VU Pulse is being kickstarted and the pledge for a single unit begins at US$ 39 (RM 164.60). Not too painful, and that’s definitely cheaper than buying a whole new watch with an HRM. When used together, your Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel will be able to charge wirelessly too, through a Qi wireless charging pad. Charging times won’t be spectacular when wireless – two hours to full.As it’s a “case”, it’ll add 3mm to the wearable height and an overall thickness of 4.4mm. As far as straps go, it’ll be compatible with both Pebble straps as well as other 22mm watch bands.When attached, the Pebble will be able to monitor your heart rate in two modes – passive, tracks your heart’s beats every 30 minutes; while active mode takes your heart rate every 10 seconds for fitness related activities.The people behind the case state that using the heart rate monitor for one-hour in active mode will drain the battery by (roughly) 8%. Using the case won’t require any additional software, as it integrates with Pebble’s own Health app – meaning all your steps, heart rate, calories and timer will be all in one place. Though, HR info can only be accessed in the app for the time being.It’ll also support Google Fit and Apple Health if you’re not into their own system. TYLT is trying to make the case waterproof but maintains that before the actual prototypes are out – sometime in March and April – they can’t say for sure if it’ll withstand water.After they’ve hit 1,000 units, the pricing tiers will increase to US$ 44 (RM 185.69 ) and US$ 49 (RM 206.91) subsequently.

Be warned, this man is revered by tech journalist all over and he’s someone Samsung doesn’t want nosing around their business.At it again, Mr Blass has released press renders of the two Galaxy S7 devices and we’re convinced that they’re real.Taking a closer look at the two smartphones, they don’t really look much different from their predecessors. The Galaxy S7 looks to be a smaller 5.1-inch device while the S7 edge will be a step larger at 5.5-inches. From their profile, the duo appears to be thinner than before and that’ll mean you’ll feel more glass than ever before with the metal frame taking a back seat. Although, Blass was the same individual that claimed that Samsung was going to release not two but four models at MWC 2016 – something Samsung has never done before. Shortly after, he alleged that the manufacturer decided against it and may have been postponed to a later – likely September during their phablet season – date.The two Galaxy S7 devices look more alike than ever and the only difference – other than the size – would be the curvature of the edge tapering over the sides as expected.If we’re continuing to take evleaks word for it, the display on the two devices will be of a Super AMOLED Quad HD (2560 x 1440) resolution and include an always-on-display function (AOD) that allows the “glanceable screen” to consume only a tiny bit of battery per hour.Battery-wise the two devices will get larger lithium-ions cells too: 3000mAh on the Galaxy S7 and 3600mAh on the Galaxy S7 edge. Running its core(s) will either be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor or Exynos 8890 processor which will be region dependent. Both phones will have 4GB RAM on board and come in two internal storage variants: 32GB and 64GB. Blass claims that the microSD will make a return on the upcoming flagships as well.On the camera front, Samsung’s BRITECELL technology is about to make its first showing and it’ll do so on the purported 12-megapixel rear sensor with an aperture of f/1.7 on both S7 smartphones.During the BBC interview that Blass gave, he candidly mentions that sometimes these smartphone makers purposely pass him information to keep the hype high. Is Samsung one of them? Well, that’s up to you to decide.Ultimately, we’ll have to wait for the 21st of February to see if Evan Blass’ leaks are the real thing though we won’t be betting against him.[ SOURCE, 2 ]"
Rory Lee,The iPad Pro outsold Microsoft’s entire Surface lineup in Q4 of 2015,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/02/the-ipad-pro-outsold-microsofts-entire-surface-lineup-in-q4-of-2015/,"android tablet,apple,apple ipad pro,idc,international data corporation,ios tablet,ipad,ipad pro,microsoft,microsoft surface,microsoft surface pro,surface,surface pro,tablet,tablet sales,windows tablet,industry in general,ios,mobile devices,mobile os,windows 10","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-02-02,"Ah, tablets. If a tablet was one of the characters in my sappy rom-com, it’d be the ‘one that got away’. To me, it was a novel idea where you could have your smartphone with you for the serious business stuff while your tablet showed you a good time between working hours — literally, with videos and movies or a good book — but when you actually think about it, the tablet simply isn’t practical.If you take a look at the International Data Corporation’s (IDC) latest report on their preliminary data from the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker, you’ll find the truth in my words as tablet sales are on a downward trajectory. That’s not to say it’s all doom and gloom though as their report also says that detachable tablet sales have reached an all-time high — lead by the sales of none other than the Apple iPad Pro.Spearheading the detachable (or convertible/2-in-1) pack to finish at 8.1 million devices sold in Q4 of 2015 is Apple’s biggest iPad, the Pro, raking in just over 2 million units sold — more than Microsoft’s entire Surface lineup put together. That’s quite surprising if you ask me because we think that the Surface, especially the Pro 4 is a fantastic little 2-in-1 that can easily replace your laptop, at least for productivity anyway.On the other hand, if you look at reviews online, the iPad Pro is nothing more than a ginormous iPad with a flimsy looking rubber keyboard that has the word “Smart” in its name. Uh oh, am I “bashing” Apple again? Oops.I guess I was wrong then if we’re going off sales figures because Microsoft only sold about 1.6 million Surface devices in the same quarter. That’s a gigantic gap especially if you consider how many Surface devices there are on the market versus the lone iPad Pro. Quite a feat then but it’s worth noting that this is only one quarter and we’ll have to see if the iPad Pro can keep this up over the coming quarters.We can definitely see the appeal of a 2-in-1 because it brings the power of the laptop into the form-factor of a tablet. The emphasis is on power though as IDC’s findings reveal that of the Surface devices sold, more of them are of the pricier and more powerful Surface Pro line, as opposed to a more affordable Surface 3.That said, Microsoft wasn’t the biggest loser in the last quarter because that title belongs to Google. According to the IDC, Google’s recent stab at staking a claim in the convertible market was rather lackluster and that it “will require a lot more refinement to achieve any measurable success”.Oh dear. Google better get cracking on that Chrome OS/Android operating system if they want to carve a slice out of this market.Rounding up the report though is the sad news of the “slate” tablet’s slow demise as the entire tablet sales dropped 10.1%, from 230.1 million to 206.8 million devices. The way we see it, the problem with the slate tablet is that they’re neither here nor there.Unless you’re picking up one of Apple’s iPads (they’re leading the sales by the way at 16.1 million units shipped — 7.1 million more than the second-placed Samsung) which do offer some tablet optimisations, you’re usually stuck with either an unoptimised Android tablet or a buggy Windows tablet.Amazon’s USD50 (around RM210) Fire tablet, which runs on their own Fire OS, did come in at a surprising third place — accounting for 7.9% of the market share, beating out the likes of Lenovo and Huawei. Though IDC does note that Amazon’s success is purely based on the price of its tablet.Trying times for the tablet industry it seems, though, there is some hope in the convertible market, it looks like the slate tablet is slowly dying off.[SOURCE, VIA]"

To make phone ownership easier, Celcom has introduced its NewPhone program. On the surface, this is similar to the Maxis Zerolution program as it lets you change phones every year for free.The Celcom NewPhone program is open to current and new Celcom customers and you can own your phone with monthly installments over 24 months. On top of that, you get to change phones for free every 12 months. Unlike Maxis, Celcom gives you the option to change phones earlier. If intend to do this before 12 months, an advance change fee will apply that ranges between RM300 to RM1,000 depending on phone model.Similar to Maxis, you are required to return your existing device in good condition. For greater peace of mind, they are also offering Device Protection which gives you coverage for damages, theft, and even water damage.For new Celcom customers (or those who have only been Celcom customers for less than a year), if you do opt for the NewPhone plan, you will be required to pay 3 months of your NewPhone’s installment upfront, which will be rebated back to you over the coming months. However, for existing customers who have been with Celcom for over a year, you will not be required to make this upfront payment.Also, if you intend to stop at any time, you have the option to keep the device while paying the balance RRP of your installment or to return the phone completely with a one-off penalty charge. When we checked, returning the Galaxy Note5 will attract a penalty charge of RM900.At the moment, Celcom NewPhone only offers Samsung devices which include the Galaxy J7, Galaxy A8, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+. The Galaxy Note5 can be yours at RM125/month or RM145/month if you take up its device protection coverage. As comparison, Maxis Zerolution offers the same model at RM123/month (with Zerolution Upgrade) or RM146 that includes Device Protection.The key difference between this and Maxis’ Zerolution is that you can choose any plan you want to pair with your NewPhone. This means if you’re happy with your current postpaid plan, you can just add-on NewPhone even there’s an on-going device bundle contract. So if the MaxisONE plan isn’t your cup of tea, you can go for Celcom’s more affordable First Gold plan that offers 10GB of mobile data, unlimited calls and SMS for RM80/month.For more information, head over to Celcom’s NewPhone."

There are 2 variants available, with the base model getting 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Meanwhile, the higher spec model offers 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The front gets the same 5.5″ Full HD display and it also runs on a MediaTek Helio X10 processor. For photography, the cameras are carried over from its predecessor with a 13MP main camera and a front-facing 5MP unit. The battery isn’t removable but it gets a generous 4,000mAh capacity built-in. Like most Xiaomi smartphones, this is a dual-SIM device with 4G LTE but unfortunately, it lacks a microSD expansion slot. In China, the Redmi Note 3 is priced from 899 CNY (about RM569) to 1099 CNY (about RM695). For those who can’t wait, a couple of retailers are selling grey import units from RM699. So far we have no visibility of its local launch but we reckon it is likely to be after Chinese New Year.Redmi Note 3 SIRIM Certification

There are 3 options available which vary on reload amount and validity. For most users, a typical RM30 top up would grant you 1.5GB of free high-speed internet that’s valid for 30 days.As comparison, both U Mobile and TuneTalk offer 1GB of free high-speed internet when you top up RM30/month each month. The only cumbersome step, is you would need to redeem it manually from Digi by dialing *888*1# and you have to do it within 3 days upon reload. To squeeze more data from your ringgit, you can get a total of 3.5GB high-speed internet on Digi for only RM30/month.

As Alphabet’s market cap has just breached US$ 570 billion; a good US$ 31 billion higher than Apple’s – for the time being. Stock go up and they come down so it’s too soon to tell if this will last long enough to be remembered.Posting their 2015 Q4 earnings just today, stock trading allowed their shares to balloon to a gargantuan size. Apple posted the same result last week and they’ve shown that their dominance in the smartphone market has begun to stagger.Insights from CNBC highlight that this is the first time that Alphabet (formerly Google) has snatched the title from Apple to be the most valuable company. We heard that the main MVP raking in their earnings was obviously Google, through their crazy ad revenue.For the most part their revenue has been going back into R&D; a good US$ 3.5 billion in 2015 alone. They’ve placed big bets on their moonshot projects and its autonomous cars – that make absolutely no money until they’re proper realised. Yet while being in the red in their ambitious projects, the company still made a decent US$ 23 billion in the same span of time.A reliance on just one particular product will always hurt a company when the market has (in some way) been tapped to oblivion. Of course, Apple being Apple will ride the storm and selling 74.77 million iPhones in Q4 isn’t bad, in fact, that makes some smartphone makers seem tiny in comparison. And do remember that Apple was valued at US$ 774 billion in February last year.Page and Brin both deserve credit, so do other heads of Alphabet’s portfolio but they have to continue to provide solutions to solve the world’s problems – from search engines to self-driving cars.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA, 2, IMAGE SOURCE ]"
Rory Lee,Celcom is one upping Digi and U Mobile with their most competitive postpaid plan yet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/02/celcoms-first-gold-15gb-rm80-postpaid-plan/,"celcom,celcom first gold,celcom first gold promo,celcom postpaid,celcom postpaid plan,celcom wifi,celcom wifi plus,first gold,first gold promo,players on the field,postpaid plan,industry in general,promotions","Celcom,Industry in General,Players on the Field,Promotions",2016-02-02,"As the telco war rages on, Celcom has revised their FIRST Gold plan in a bid to make their plans more competitive. This new FIRST Gold plan offers users 10GB of mobile Internet + 5GB of WiFi and unlimited free calls and SMS for only RM80 a month.This new FIRST Gold plan is a bump up from the existing plan, offering users 10GB of mobile Internet that is split between 5GB of mobile data and 5GB of weekend data (1.25GB for every weekend) + 5GB of WiFi, compared to the existing plan’s 8GB mobile Internet (4GB mobile data + 4GB weekend data) and 4GB of WiFi.Not only that but the entire plan itself has received a price cut of RM20 working out to a theoretical RM5.33/GB of Internet. An emphasis on the theoretical part though because your Internet quota is split between three different types and even in the most ideal of situations it seems unlikely that you will be able to make full use of it all.Nevertheless, this plan also comes with unlimited calls and SMS to all networks which gives it the slight edge over Digi’s recent promotional SmartPlan 75 and the U Mobile Hero P70 which only offers unlimited calls, but as those two plans are cheaper at RM75 and RM70 respectively, it definitely evens things out.Plus, if you’re counting raw 24/7 data alone, both of the plans offer 7GB mobile data, which is 2GB up from Celcom’s 5GB. But, depending on your weekend data usage, you may use more than 2GB over four weekends which would once again place the plans quite evenly with each other. You will get to bring over any unused quota (up to 5GB) to the next month though, which is a nice touch.What’s more, if you exceed RM225 on your monthly usage, Celcom will give you 1GB of bonus data and 2GB of bonus data if you exceed RM500 per month. This means you’re eligible for up to 3GB of bonus data per month if you spend more than RM500 on your monthly usage.Celcom also provides free music streaming from Yonder for 12 months to their FIRST Gold subscribers. Besides that, you can also be in the running for Celcom’s giveaway promotion where they have given out free movie tickets and petrol thus far.Do keep in mind that this plan is only a promotional plan, so it will be available from 2 February to 31 March 2016 only. If you’re interested, head on over to your nearest Blue Cube or Celcom Service Centre. For more information, you can head to their website instead.[SOURCE]"

And the latest reports claims that they are testing internet-delivering drones.The report coming from the Guardian suggests that Google has been testing out these drones in New Mexico. Flight-testing is currently taking place in the Spaceport America hangar that they share with Virgin Galactic. Two aircrafts apparently exist a commercial one that can be optionally piloted named the “Centaur” and the “Solara 50” plane that relies on solar panels. Both were supplied by Titan Aerospace that were acquired in 2014.It is reported that the Google X team is equipping these drones with technology to experiment with the millimeter-wave radio transmitters and will aim to place these drones around the world to deliver 5G internet around the globe.According to the 5G classification by the FCC, 5G speeds range from 1Gbps and 10Gbps – that’s 40 times faster than 4G LTE. For these drones to do so, the engineering team are battling with distance and signal propagation issues that come accompanied in delivering these higher frequencies.Adding this to Project Fi’s ensemble would do wonders to their cellular network but before they manage to place these millimeter-wave transceivers in smartphones, Google is placing the stationary antennas around the test site.This is pretty much a more space-age attempt compared to Google’s Project Loon balloon that hopes to do the same thing. That particular system allows 4G LTE speeds beamed down through a hot-air balloon. If you want to check out this balloon yourself, you’ll have to travel to India, New Zealand or Brazil.You can check out the Project Loon video below:With this technology, Google will provide hard to reach places with internet access. Who knows what possibilities lie beyond the horizon if you could easily get mobile signals in a base camp in Tibet or in the vast Gobi desert. We all want to be connected after all.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

This time, we get an official announcement of the date — February 21 — exactly one day before MWC.And so the stage is set.Pretty darn sexy box if you ask me. Since now we have confirmation that the Unpacked event will be happening on the 21st, that means Samsung will be going head-to-head with its fellow South Korean manufacturer LG who is also holding an event on the same day.Clash of the titans?While we don’t think LG can even hold a candle to Samsung when it comes to sales, the flagship devices that these two giants can produce are pretty close in performance and capabilities. I mean the LG G4 is a great flagship phone and the V10 is basically a better version of the G4.In any case, it will be an interesting day to say the least as these two giants vie for media attention. It is said that the Samsung Galaxy S7 (and its variants) will be revealed on that day itself, which we’re inclined to believe.If you’re unable to attend the event in Barcelona itself, Samsung will be holding a live stream of Unpacked on YouTube at their channel or their Samsung Newsroom. The event will begin at 19:00 CET on 21 February which translates to 2 am local time on 22 February. Plus, if we’re looking at the video it looks like there might be a virtual reality stream. 360-degree video hype?To recap, besides a host of internal upgrades, the Galaxy S7 is said to feature a similar design to the Galaxy S6 but with dust and waterproof capabilities as well as a microSD card slot. If you’d like to know more about what we know about the S7, head on over here.Speaking of Samsung’s anticipated next flagship, new renders from serial leakster @evleaks have appeared on the web that confirms our suspicions about what the device will look like — which is almost exactly like the previous Galaxy S.

Earlier a leaked Marshmallow schedule suggests that older models like the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4 will be updated sometime in March/April. Meanwhile, rival HTC had already rolled out Marshmallow update for its older One M8 and they are continuing to push the same update for the newer One M9.Apart from the usual bug fixes, the new update brings a couple of new features as well. As seen earlier, the Galaxy S6 edge gets a couple of new tricks where you can add more widgets and toolbars that can be displayed on the edge of your screen.

Now, Samsung has brought these two editions of the Gear S2 Classic to the Samsung SEA Forum and we got to take a quick look at them.According to Samsung, these two versions are supposed to offer users more options to “express their style” — as most things that come in multiple designs usually do — and is set to offer a more premium outlook.But looks are all they’re offering as under the hood these smartwatches are very much the same as the current Gear S2 Classic.The Gear S2 Classic in 18K Rose Gold is paired with an Ivory Genuine Leather Band while the Platinum version comes with a Black Genuine Leather Strap.Besides the new variants, Samsung is also expanding its watch strap and watch face collection, partnering with exclusive designers like Colombo, introducing premium watch straps for the Gear S2 as well as new watch faces including Peanuts characters and artworks from Keith Haring, Jean-Michael Basquiat, Jeremyville and Burton Morris.Both are expected to be available globally come February this year, but there is no word on its pricing.  With an 18 Karat case for the Rose Gold edition, though, we don’t expect this smartwatch to come cheap.

Two words that you’re going to hear us say quite a lot during this hands-on. A fully fledged Windows 10 makes its way onto the Galaxy TabPro S. We’ve said it before, that manufacturers are going to start making use of Microsoft’s new operating system and it’s exemplified perfectly here.In the past few months there have been a couple of tablets that were released running Windows instead of Android – yes, that’s a good thing in our books. Google somewhat hindered the Pixel C and learning from their mistake, electronic companies are now embracing the productivity-inducing Windows OS.Tall, dark and handsome. What’s not to love? Well you could also opt for the white (knight) coloured variant but that’s all up to preference. The black drew us in better – just saying. Picking up the tablet you’ll be captivated by how compact it is: 6.3mm thin and 693 grams in weight.Even at that footprint, this sleek device manages a 12-inch Super AMOLED (2160 x 1440) screen. Holding it horizontally, you’ll find it easy on the hands and nice to hold as the sides are rounded.The body is mainly made surrounded by magnesium though the rear will have some plastic elements. Nevertheless, just because it has some plastic, it’s still quite handsome in a business fashion kind of way.On the tablet itself, you’ll find only two ports: USB Type-C and headphone jack. There’s also a single SIM-tray slot and dual-side firing speakers on either horizontal sides. On the top left, you’ll locate the power button and volume rockers that sit side by side. Sitting near the top right of the tablet is a single button that lets you go to “the start menu” when in tablet mode.Many will be shouting that Samsung could easily paste another USB Type-C slot but maybe on the TabPro S 2? Anyway, the rear and front 5-megapixel cameras are basic and will suffice for video conferencing. PLEASE, unless absolutely necessary do not take photos with this tablet.On the bottom, you’ll find a Pogo pin system that bears a resemblance to the Surface’s proprietary connectors that allow you to attach, pair and type on the included keyboard cover.In a pinch, it’ll do but you’ll notice in the picture above that when you adjust to the two different viewing angles the plastic connector strip looks a bit scary when moved. We’re not sure how durable the magnetic keyboard cover will be.Yes, it’s a large customer. When holding something that has a screen that’s 12-inches, you’re definitely holding a large slab. If you love consuming media in front of your face, this is definitely a worthy companion. Its Super AMOLED display doesn’t hurt either, allowing it to get really bright. Black pixels will be as true as can be since it’s an AMOLED panel.A fanless number thanks to the Dual-core Intel Core M processor that’s clocked to 2.2GHz, the tablet will rarely be noisy. To help with multitasking 4GB of RAM and a 128/256GB SSD is onboard as well.This Windows tablet supports a single-SIM slot that’s capable of 4G LTE Cat6 speeds. Samsung made this feature proof by making WiFi 802.11 ac MIMO enabled too. Other connectivity options include NFC and Bluetooth 4.1.Samsung shouts about the 150 minute charging time of the tablet that has a 5200mAh capacity battery but we didn’t spend enough time with it to touch bases on that. Maneuvering around the OS on the tablet was smooth with little hiccups but it didn’t have any heavy-duty apps on it in the first place.When typing on the keyboard cover, we found that it was made fairly well (aside from the plastic connectors we highlighted) but the 6-rows of full sized keys don’t really have much travel and typing won’t be the best experience. You should still tip your hats to Samsung as they included it out of the box, unlike the Surface Pro tablet.There wasn’t a lot of positive takeaways from the trackpad either, it was jumpy and when touching it, we found that it wasn’t as smooth as some of the proprietary 2-in-1 keyboards out there.Well, the South Korean tech giant decided to leave out any availability and pricing details. If you want us to base it on German pricing sets it at €999 (RM 4,506.30). The aforementioned pricing refers to the base WiFi model while the LTE model adds another €100 (RM 451.10).And upgrading to the Windows 10 Pro costs an additional €100 (RM 451.10).That’s a whole lot of dough to burn considering that the tried and true Surface Pro 4 (Intel Core M / 4GB RAM / 128GB Storage) costs RM 3,999 (w/ GST). That’s without the keyboard which fetches an additional RM 529 – totaling to RM 4,528. That’s a slightly more expensive but remember that the Surface Pen comes bundled.If Samsung sets the price lower than Germany’s, as they do with most of their devices sold in Malaysia, consumers will likely to try out the convertible but the thing that could deter them would be pricing.We’ll let everyone know when we manage to review this tablet – hopefully together with the add-on stylus and multi-port adapter."

A mish-mash of live tiles on Windows 8 and the desktop-loving Windows 7.Samsung is no different, trying to captivate the same market that was revitalised and made mainstream through Microsoft’s Surface line. If you wanted something crazily thin (only 6.3mm) that can handle Windows 10, you might want to pay attention to the Galaxy TabPro S. There are many comparisons to be made to the Microsoft Surface Pro series, as the Galaxy TabPro S has (roughly) the same screen size. Utilising a 12-inch sAMOLED (2160 x 1440) display and packing a Skylake (6th-gen) Dual-core Intel Core M processor clocked at 2.2GHz.Often, these fanless Core M chipsets usually get brushed off because they rarely have the computing power that the powerhouse user needs but they’ve gotten a lot better in the past few years. Accompanying that Intel SoC, are 4GB of RAM and a 128GB/256GB SSD.The tablet also supports LTE Cat 6 connectivity, WiFi 802.11 ac MIMO (as well as older bands), NFC and Bluetooth 4.1. It also betters the Surface by embracing the port of the future aka USB Type-C 3.1. However, they only plastered one USB-C port so everything from charging, data transfers and (additional) peripherals will be solely through that one port. Maybe they didn’t learn from Apple’s Macbook that shares the solo port.Housed in a magnesium and plastic body, the 12-inch tablet only weighs 693 grams – the Surface Pro 4 weighs 786 grams. And the kicker is the detachable keyboard comes packaged with the tablet, without any extra Ringgits, making it slightly easier on your wallet.If you’re one of those people who take photos using a tablet and love having conversations via video calls, you’ll be pleased to know that there are two cameras on board: the two front and back cameras both make use of 5-megapixel sensors.Samsung hypes the battery and charging capabilities on the Galaxy TabPro S. They claim that through fast charging technology, you’ll fully charge it in 150 minutes and when full, that translates to 10 hours of battery life on that 5200mAh capacity cell.The included keyboard doubles as a case but when used, you’ll only have two fixed angle viewing – unlike that on an adjustable hinge on the Surface Pro.As a keyboard cover, it’s great to find that they managed to pack 6 rows on the full-sized typing peripheral. Also, it connects to the tablet through the Pogo pin, so that takes care of pairing and charging in one go.To further your Galaxy TabPro S experience, a multi-port adapter that includes an HDMI, USB Type-A and USB Type-C; and a Bluetooth stylus pen will be sold separately.Samsung’s Galaxy TabPro S runs Windows 10 Home or Pro, pricing will be announced later in the day, we’ll keep everyone updated when we find out. It’ll come in two colour options: Black and White.For a rough estimate, Germany sells it for €999 (RM 4,506.30); upgrading to the Windows 10 Pro costs an additional €100 (RM 451.10); while the LTE model adds another €100 (RM 451.10).Check out our hands-on and first impressions of the Galaxy TabPro S here."

As a comparison, its original UniFi VIP plans offered symmetrical speeds (5Mbps download + 5Mbps upload or 10Mbps download + 10Mbps download). Probably after getting a lot of flak, TM has finally doubled its upload speeds on their latest plans. UPDATE: TM has revised back its online pages to reflect 5Mbps and 10Mbps uploads for TM Unifi Advance 30Mbps and 50Mbps plans respectively. However we are setting getting double upload speeds (10Mbps) on our current 30Mbps package. The base UniFi Advance with 30Mbps download now gets 10Mbps for upload (5Mbps previously), while its higher 50Mbps plan gets 20Mbps upload (10Mbps previously). There’s no change in pricing and those who are already on UniFi Advance including BIZ users can enjoy faster speeds immediately. You can try running a speedtest to find out your current upload speeds.The promo price of RM179/month and RM229/month for UniFi Advance 30Mbps and 50Mbps respectively are still applicable for new sign ups today.

Work, play, productivity, browsing and even the occasional phone call or text, can all be carried out in the palm of your hand.

Simply swipe up on your phone to launch the app, pick the card you want to use, secure with your fingerprint and hover your device over the card reader to pay. Hassle free.Of course, it is likely that when this Service comes to SEA, not all banks or carriers will be supported but it is safe to assume that many of the major ones will be.As Samsung have only just announced this at their SEA Forum, there is little information on when this will actually arrive in Malaysia (or if it will at all), though Samsung has said that Singapore and Australia will be the first countries to get this service.

Rory Lee,Samsung’s Galaxy S7 purported to have a ridiculous battery life,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/01/samsungs-galaxy-s7-purported-to-have-a-ridiculous-battery-life/,"galaxy s7,galaxy s7 17 hours,galaxy s7 battery,galaxy s7 battery life,samsung,samsung galaxy s7,samsung galaxy unpacked 2016,samsung unpacked 2016,android,mobile devices,mobile os,rumour mill","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2016-02-01,"More juicy goodies have surfaced about the Samsung Galaxy S7 ahead of the Samsung Unpacked 2016 event set for 21 February this year. This time, we supposedly get a glimpse at how Samsung are addressing one of the biggest weaknesses of their previous Galaxy S6 flagship — the battery life.According to popular leakster Eldar Murtazin, the Galaxy S7 can last 17 hours of continuous video playback “with maximum backlight” — which according to Eldra is a record for this class of devices.Video playback consumes quite a lot of battery power — especially at maximum brightness on what should be a Quad HD display. If this is true, 17 hours of continuous video playback at maximum brightness is borderline bonkers. Even tablets can’t last 17 hours of continuous video playback.We are curious how they achieved this feat, if it’s true. If we compare the Galaxy S7’s purported 3,000 mAh battery to its predecessor Galaxy S6 active’s 3,500 mAh battery you can sort of get a scale of how insane this claim seems as the Galaxy S6 active can only manage about 10-11 hours of video playback with Netflix.What’s more, Murtazin revealed that the Galaxy S7’s battery takes 100 minutes to go from 0-100% charged which is a touch longer than the existing Galaxy S flagships, but we doubt that people will mind that if the battery can truly last as long as Murtazin claims it to be.That said, this is just a rumour with no word on the conditions of the test — for example, was this streamed or played offline — so do take it with a pinch of salt.If we add this to the list of purported specs that the Galaxy S7 is said to feature — a Snapdragon 820 SoC (and likely the Exynos 8890 in different regions), 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, a 12-megapixel BRITECELL primary camera and a 5MP wide-angle selfie camera (f/1.7 aperture for both) — plus waterproofing and a microSD card slot, Samsung’s next flagship looks to be a beast.The S7 is also said to come in two variants, the 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge. I guess we’ll find out if these specifications are true at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2016 event in Barcelona.[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

It screws over some people who rely on ads to generate income so ad blocking is generally frowned upon but let’s face it, we all do it. Pop-up ads are just too annoying to not use an ad block program.While many are religious about using an ad block extension for browsing online, when it comes to mobile browsing, most don’t care anymore. Mostly because the process of installing an ad blocker on your phone is just so complicated.Well, Samsung wants to help you along by adding support for content and ad blocking plugins to their preinstalled web browser.This updated browser is being pushed to all Samsung phones with Android Lollipop or newer starting today. It will allow users to install helper apps that block ads from websites they visit, similar to Apple’s Safari browser in iOS 9.The first content blocker available for Samsung’s Internet app is Adblock Fast — which is supposed to be the “world’s fastest ad blocker”. Whether that claim rings true doesn’t matter because it is said that this plugin can decrease the web page load times on Android by 51 percent — makes sense since you don’t have to load the banner/popup ads on a page. Still 51% isn’t a number to scoff at.A quick search on the Google Play Store, there are several browsers with built-in ad block functions but none of them have been able to really get people to jump over from Google Chrome. Let’s see how well this does.It is available for Samsung Internet 4.0 and users can download it from the Google Play Store but keep in mind that the Internet version 4.0 is only being pushed out, so it may not be available on your device yet. Oh, and your device needs to be on Android Lollipop or newer.What do you guys think of this “new” function? Would you use Samsung’s Internet app over Chrome over this? Or maybe you’re already using Internet. Either way, let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE]"

That said, the OPPO F1 Plus will come with a 5.5-inch Full HD display (1920 x 1080) – upped from the 720p screen found on the original F1.And with a bigger screen, it doesn’t hurt to have more RAM so the F1 Plus adds an additional 1GB found on its sibling – making that a whopping 4GB of RAM on board. During the Mumbai announcement, they felt compelled to also let everyone know that the camera will get a “more sophisticated front camera experience”.Leaving us to believe that the current ¼-inch 8-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/2.0 is going to get better. How? Well, in all honesty, we’ve felt for the longest time that megapixels don’t make up the whole equation – so some image processing and software enhancements could possibly do more for OPPO rather than adding more pixels to the shutter.Otherwise, the smartphone will remain the same in looks and internals. That means you’ll still find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 chipset; 16GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD; hybrid Dual-SIM (Micro and Nano) 4G LTE slot; and its 13-megapixel ISOCELL f/2.2 with Phase Detection Autofocus and a single LED.Upping the screen and resolution, could also mean that the battery might get a bump but no mention of that was brought up during the Mumbai announcement. If they decide to stick to the 2,500 mAh battery the battery life might take a big hit if maintained.When it goes on sale, the OPPO F1 Plus will retail for Rs. 26,990 (RM 1646.56) in India. In Malaysia, the smaller OPPO F1 goes for RM 1,198 and you can pick it up from their online store.If you’re interested to know more about the OPPO F1, you can check out our hands-on and first impressions here.[ SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

This might be a pretty good chance for you to do so as the smartphone manufacturer are putting two of their devices on sale — the R7 Lite and R1x.Both of these midrange smartphones will for RM998 from the OPPO online store. That means an RM300 cut for the R7 Lite and an RM200 cut for the R1x.I don’t know if you would consider that a big price cut, but you if you do the math you could get about 15-25 Snack Plates from KFC during their lunch promo for that amount of money. That’s a lot of chicken.Anyway, this sale is only available while stocks last so if you want to get your hands on these devices be sure to make your way to their online store as soon as you can.Just to recap, the OPPO R7 Lite features a 5-inch HD AMOLED display with a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Camera wise, it gets a 13MP rear 8MP front snapper and is powered by a 2,320 mAh battery.On the other hand, the OPPO R1x sports pretty much the same specifications as the OPPO R7 Lite, except that it has a slightly bigger battery — at 2420 mAh — and I think a nicer design.If you wanna get your hands on the OPPO R7 Lite, you can head to this link while the OPPO R1x can be bought here.[SOURCE]"

Unlike KL, JB and Penang, the UberX service in Ipoh is running for this month only, starting from today until 29th February.In terms of fare, you get to enjoy the same low rates with the base fare starting at RM1, followed by RM0.25/minute and RM0.50/KM. So instead of driving, you can beat the highway jams by taking a KTM train to Ipoh, and get around town using Uber. Uber highlights that since they have just started, availability may be limited at first. They added that they are working hard to get more cars on the road to minimise wait times. In case you missed it, Uber has challenged us to leave our cars at home for a week and only use Uber to get around town.

Releasing the information on VentureBeat, it seems like HTC wants to make up for its lackluster devices of late and the One M10 (codename Perfume) could give it a shot.Their tip comes from someone who apparently spent time with a prototype of the device – we recommend everyone take it with of a heap of salt.It’s reported that the device will be running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow under the Sense 8.0 skin that HTC has adopted. Purportedly, the screen will size in at 5.1-inches and feature a QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display. The leaker also claims that the device will carry a fingerprint scanner, in the typical home button placement as we saw in the M9+.On the inside, Qualcomm’s top of the line Snapdragon 820 chipset will be running the show and it’ll be coupled with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Information from the anonymous source states that after all the OS and bloatware you’ll be left with 23GB of storage but there’s a microSD slot to mediate that.In terms of how it looks the leaker mentions that the design is still being drafted so there was no reason to talk about its aesthetics. Ultrapixels are going to make a comeback and we’re not sure how to react. The rear camera will supposedly carry a 12-UltraPixel lens and have supported laser autofocus to dial in on images quicker. The front and rear lenses will also carry OIS.And the other big disappointment is the (rumoured) drop of BoomSound speakers. Something that we really loved and still think is the best audio listening experience on any smartphone brand. Other than the two features that we didn’t like, it seems like HTC could make a return to the market in a big way. But it won’t come during MWC 2016 since they’ve yet to make any announcements. Meaning it’ll likely be launched at an independent event that’ll happen later.After hearing all this could you see yourself purchasing an HTC smartphone?

What started out as a promising third player in the mobile OS game was quickly shot down.In a recent report by the IDC, it showed that in the recent quarter, about 400 million smartphones were sold and if you compare that to Microsoft’s earnings report, only 4.5 million of them were Lumia devices. That’s 1.1% of the market share. To contrast, Samsung moved around 85 million devices in that same quarter.Things don’t get much better if you compare all time sales between Android + iOS and Windows, where Microsoft and Nokia only shipped 110 million devices total compared to the 4.5 billion Android and iOS devices sold in the same period. That’s only about 2.4% of the market share. And, if you look at this graph, things look like they’re going from bad to worse.Sorry, Windows Phone. 110m lifetime sales – 4.5bn iOS & Android phones sold in the same period pic.twitter.com/CO03XWhYJg— Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) January 28, 2016I loved the Windows Phone. I spent two years of my life committed to my little Lumia 625. I loved the way it looks, the cool animations and most of all I loved the unified idea behind this new operating system. Despite all the qualms, despite all the bugs and despite all the problems, I convinced myself that the OS was new and it could only get better. Right?Well, I can’t say that with certainty anymore.When Windows Phone first came out, many jumped for it. Extensive investment went into the platform and developing devices for it. Dell took a stab with their Venue Pro, HTC went all-in with a pretty stellar lineup of devices (some were tempting from a looks standpoint) and even manufacturers like LG and Samsung had a pretty decent lineup to offer.However, as pointed out by Vlad Savov, these investments proved fruitless. Microsoft wanted to be the leading light in their own OS — understandably — and the apparent favouritism towards Nokia (which they later acquired) was enough to piss the other manufacturers off.Have you seen the new Lumia devices? They’re plastic slabs that are almost indistinguishable from the rest except for that Windows tramp stamp that adorns the back of the device. Gone is the inspired unibody plastic build. Missing are the funky colours that turns the phone into candy. Poof, goes that sexy subtle curve of the screen on Lumia flagships of old. Such a shame really."

It comes preloaded on all new LG G3 devices and displays a variety of notifications and suggestions, including recommendations to stay in touch with favourite contacts.What happened was, the app failed to validate the data presented to users, making it possible for attackers to manipulate the data and lace it with a malicious code that can be executed on affected devices. According to the researchers who found out about this vulnerability, the malicious code could be triggered when events like callback reminders or birthday notifications were displayed.An estimated 10 million LG G3s were said to be affected by this vulnerability. The researchers developed several proof-of-concept payloads including one that harvested data from the SD card, another that opens the browser to any remote site and a third that performs a denial-of-service attack that could make the user’s phone go crazy.Regardless, the are many ways this vulnerability can be exploited and that puts a lot of your personal information at risk.

Yup, that’s the same price as a brand new Galaxy Note 5. To recap on the specs, the Galaxy View gets a wide screen 18.4″ screen pushing Full HD resolution in a 16:9 aspect ratio. Powering the device is a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 2GB RAM and it has 32GB of on-board storage. To load up more content, you can expand more storage with its microSD slot.

The report claims that Apple is in search for the “holy grail” of wireless charging and it might arrive as early as next year.Cutting-edge technology (as quoted from Bloomberg) would put their devices in a whole new playing field. To put it in perspective, other smartphone makers already have developed and released wireless charging mats but that’s what they are – mats. You need to physically place them on these “stations” in order to get them juiced.Apparently they want to allow charging in mid-air (like this company hopes to) and wants to remove the “physicality” associated with wireless charging of today. But they’ll have to deal with the charging efficiency issues that comes with charging a device further way from its charging station.The British news outlet highlights that Apple has registered numerous patents that explore the concept of “true” wireless charging. One of which is making an iMac a wireless charging hub with the device that needs some power needing to be within 1 meter – utilising NFC to do so.If Apple does do this, it’ll allow them to do away with ports altogether, making that rumour of ditching the headphone jack all the more promising. Obviously, that lighting cable has to be there but what if it didn’t?Chances are Jony Ive and Co will maintain the charging port to make way for a lighting cable audio jack but with wireless charging possible, the Verge dutifully points out that you’ll be able to listen to music while wirelessly charging your smartphone.Bloomberg reached out to Apple reps but received no feedback.True or unlikely?

With the Galaxy S6, the South Korean electronics company showed that they could do “premium” incredibly well and I wondered if that aspect would carry over to the Galaxy A lineup, or if it would just be a half-arsed rehash.Well, when I arrived at the launch venue floor, that thought was quickly answered.The one I was waiting to find out about. Was it going to live up to the hype? In short, yeah it did that and more. Like the Galaxy S6, the glass panels of the A series (yes all three of them) came together with the metal frame about as well as glass and metal can possibly come together. The 2.5D contoured edge glass helped with giving the side of the phone a rounded and more natural feel in the hand.Each panel was a massive fingerprint magnet, though — as glass usually is — but at least they’re Corning Gorilla Glass 4, so that should keep scratches at bay. The buttons were fantastically tactile and had a satisfying click, even the home button.The three devices are spec’d accordingly, with the smallest 4.7-inch Galaxy A3 being powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon quad-core processor paired with 1.5GHz on RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. It is also powered by a smaller 2,300 mAh battery.On the other hand, the bigger 5.2-inch Galaxy A5 has the same processor as the Galaxy A7 — a 1.6GHz octa-core Snapdragon SoC — with the only difference being that the 5.5-inch Galaxy A7 has 3GB of RAM over the Galaxy A5’s 2GB of RAM.Performance across the board was relatively smooth, the most buttery of which is the Galaxy A7. If you place the Galaxy A3 next to either the Galaxy A5 or Galaxy A7, you will notice a slight delay when it comes to switching between multiple applications. In terms of connectivity, all 3 models support Dual-SIM and you’ll be pleased to know that the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 has a dedicated microSD slot, so you can pop in two SIM cards with no compromises.For a series separated by price and tiers, buyers would be happy to know that Samsung didn’t skimp on the camera optics. Well, not by much anyway. All three devices share the same 13-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo, except for the fact that the Galaxy A3’s snapper is missing optical image stabilisation.Though, with a large f/1.9 aperture lens I don’t foresee poor low-light performance to take too much of a hit. That said, we will have to put them through a proper camera test before passing judgement.As these are Samsung devices. it isn’t surprising that they come preloaded with some extra features. While some were fairly gimmicky, there are two features that stand out. The first of which is the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7.It’s supposed to be an improved version over the existing Galaxy S6 and from what we can tell, it’s pretty good. Nowhere near as snappy as a Huawei or Apple sensor, but it’s not bad.Another great feature that we were happy came over to the midrange devices was the double tap home button to quick launch the camera. It works as well as on the other flagship devices.In conclusion, these are really pretty good devices. They’re well built and look really premium but they’re expensive. Very expensive. The Galaxy A3 is priced at RM1,299 while the Galaxy A5 is priced at RM1,599. The top of the range Galaxy A7 is going for RM1,899, which is encroaching flagship price territory. To make the Galaxy A series more enticing, all 3 models will come with an extra 32GB microSD card, giving them a total of 48GB of storage out of the box.If you’re looking for something affordable, I can’t honestly recommend any of these devices. But, they do come in pink (EVEN THE CHROME AROUND THE HOME BUTTON IS PINK), so if that tickles your fancy, then these will be the devices for you."

Powered by Android Wear, it has access to a wide variety of apps and it will work for both Android and iPhone smartphones. There are 3 options available for Malaysia. The 42mm version in Black with a matching black leather strap is priced at RM1,399 followed by a Rose Gold 42mm version that comes with Brush Leather at RM1,499. The larger 46mm version is priced at RM1,599 and it gets a silver watch case and a cognac leather strap.

Display wise, the 46mm unit gets a 1.56″ display that does 360×330, while the 42mm model gets a smaller 1.37″ display that pushes 360×325 resolution. Like the first moto 360, it isn’t a full circular display as there’s a “flat-tire” on the bottom of the screen. Apparently this “flaw” was necessary to make the bezels smaller.

Being one of the company’s first moves into the budget-premium market, the original Galaxy A series was fairly well received and Samsung hopes to replicate that success with the 2016 versions.Much like the original Galaxy A smartphones, these 2016 models feature a premium metal body that is reminiscent of the electronics giant’s flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone. The glass panel on the backs of the devices definitely gives them an air of exceptional build quality.Today, they unveiled three phones — the Galaxy A7, Galaxy A5, and Galaxy A3 — which are differentiated by price. As these phones are not created as equals, the more expensive Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 have a fingerprint sensor embedded bellow the home button, a big feature that is missing on the Galaxy A3. However, they do share several key features.The first, and most notable of which, is that all three devices — even the little Galaxy A3 — sports a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture primary shooter plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 front-facing selfie camera. What separates them is that the Galaxy A3’s primary camera unit does not have OIS while the bigger two do.All three devices also have support for dual-SIM plus an expandable microSD storage slot. Except for the Galaxy A3, the devices don’t use a hybrid-SIM set up so you can use two SIM cards and a microSD card simultaneously. On the Galaxy A3 you will have to sacrifice one SIM for storage expansion.The king of the hill among the Galaxy A lineup, the Galaxy A7 sports a large 5.5-inch full HD Super AMOLED display on the front of the phone. Inside, it’s powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). Giving this smartphone juice is a large 3,300 mAh battery.What is basically a shrunken version of the larger Galaxy A7, the Galaxy A5 comes in at only 5.2-inches, but sports the same Super AMOLED full HD panel found on the Galaxy A7. It packs a 1.6GHz octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. For battery, the Galaxy A5 gets a respectable 2,900 mAh unit in the back.Finally, we arrive at the runt of the family, the Galaxy A3. It comes with a small 4.7-inch HD Super AMOLED display and a quad-core 1.5GHz processor on the inside. Helping you with running apps is 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Since it’s the smallest device here, Samsung have fitted it with a small 2.300 mAh battery to keep things going.It is worth noting that none of these devices will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Instead, they will default to the older Android 5.1 Lollipop, though we do expect them to receive the Marshmallow update sometime in the future.If you want to get your hands on these three devices, the Galaxy A7 will go for RM1,899 while the Galaxy A5 retails for RM1,599 and the Galaxy A3 will set you back RM1,299 including GST.

A new image captured shows off specifications on the last three evolutions of the Galaxy S-line – including the upcoming Galaxy S7.Though, it’s nothing that we didn’t already know (from rumours). The slide suggests that the Galaxy S7 will front a 5.1-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display. It also states the two processor variants that has been heard many times: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 and the home-grown Exynos 8890.Also seen on the slide are the smartphone’s camera credentials – the rear only which is listed as a 12-megapixel BRITECELL sensor. They’ve dropped the 16 to 12 but apparently the new sensor takes care of low-light pictures better as it is larger to absorb more light.There will also be a steady increase in RAM with the Galaxy S7 slated to get 4GB. When considering how the device itself looks, it appears to be a placeholder. So maybe this leak could have been intentional? ‘Cause if you think about it, almost every Samsung flagship in recent times have fully leaked even before the actual launch.Sidetracking a bit, @evleaks aka Evan Blass has been busy providing more information on what the Galaxy S7 could offer. And to recap, he has mentioned that the upcoming flagship will be rated IP67 for water resistance and dust proofing, feature a microSD slot and arrive with bigger batteries. A notorious leaker with a great reputation, Blass says that the aforementioned specs are all “confirmed”. But we’ll not jump the gun just yet.MWC is about to hit us really hard in the next three weeks and we’re gearing up for the storm.Let us know what you think of these leaks. Are they substantial?

Or at least, that’s what Microsoft registering the domain name would imply. Give it a go, head to the URL here and see where you end up.This could be good and bad for the Lumia line. It’s either both of them will live like happy neighbours or one will get kicked off the street. There no point in leaning to one side yet since we haven’t seen what the Surface team can do on a smartphone.In retrospect, this could just mean Microsoft wants to pre-book the domain just in case they decide to bring a Surface Phone to live. But since Windows 10 (Mobile) updates have been delayed and lackluster response to the Lumia 950 and 950 XL has bogged them down, a Surface Phone would be a really good idea – just make sure the software is ready before releasing it. Okay, Microsoft?After reviewing the Surface Pro 4 we started to believe what Microsoft could do again and we’re still eagerly waiting for the Surface Book to arrive locally. Lumias have fallen off the truck and maybe the only that will change is through the Surface line.VentureBeat has done some digging through Whoisology and found that the WHOIS database dates the domain acquisition sometime between August and December of 2014 – easily meaning that we’ve gone a year and a half without any substantial proof that the Surface Phone will ever exist – we’re hopeful, though.Others, figure that Panos Panay and his team will start putting out the Surface Phones by the end of this year.

This isn’t just all talk as one of the three smartphones that they outed comes with some glowing credentials – literally.So first, let’s formally introduce the brand first. Wiko Mobile is a Marseille (France) based smartphone maker that does most of their manufacturing out of China – as does everyone – but what makes them different is that there are reports that Shenzhen-based Tinno Mobile Technology has a (big) stake in Wiko.Perception is key and since they’re selling in Europe, showing face has been working well. Most recently, the company claims to be France’s second largest smartphone seller; up one spot from 2013 when they had an 18% French market share.But with appearances, accompanying specs have to be reasonable too. Make no mistake, these smartphones don’t carry amazing flagship specs but they do have a few tricks up their sleeves.Highway Pure SwarovskiThe first model is the most beautiful out of the bunch. As expected, you can find 16 Swarovski Zirconia stones on the device, making its volume rockers and power button extra shiny and textured. Screen-wise there’s a 4.8-inch HD (1280 x 720) AMOLED display while its processor is a Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor clocked to 1.2GHz. As well as 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 64GB through microSD.It’s camera sensors boast an 8-megapixel rear lens and 5-megapixel front lens. Out of the box, it runs Android Lollipop 5.0.2 Android 4.4.4 KitKat which we’re hopeful will run Lollipop in the near future. Its battery is rated at 2000 mAh.Wiko’s single-nano SIM Highway Pure is claimed to be the “slimmest” 4G smartphone as it measures just 5.1mm thick and weighs just 98 grams; we’re not sure what the Vivo X5 Max (4.75mm thin) and OPPO R5 (4.85mm thin) have to say about that.FeverNext we have their glowing number that goes simply as “Fever”. This device comes with a larger 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The screen tapers off at the edges thanks to the 2.5D glass and the sides are made with a metal frame. Fever has an Octa-core MediaTek MT6753 processor at its heart and features 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. If you want to up the storage, there’s a microSD slot handy that can handle up to 64GBs of additional memory.Its rear camera specs are a little better with a 13-megapixel shooter at the helm while the front gets the same 5-megapixel sensor with selfie flash. As talked about earlier, when in dimly lit situations this smartphone will glow thanks to its phosphorescent lines making it easy to locate in the dark and really cool too.The battery that powers this dual-SIM 4G LTE smartphone is a 2900 mAh capacity lithium cell and it runs Android Lollipop 5.0.2 out of the box.Lenny 2The smallest and most affordable of the bunch is the LENNY2 and for the price of RM299, the specs easy out seat any feature phone. It’ll arrive with a 5-inch FWVGA (854 x 480) screen  and a Quad-core MediaTek 6580 processor clocked to 1.3GHz.Together with the screen and chipset specifications, it’ll be coupled with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of expandable internal storage with a microSD slot (up to 64GB).In terms of the camera sensors, you’ll find a 5-megapixel rear shutter with a 2-megapixel sensor up front. Surprisingly, given the price point, the device will be Dual-SIM (non-4G LTE) compatible and run 5.1 Android Lollipop.Wiko’s Fever goes for RM799 while the Highway Pure will cost you a little more at RM999. All three devices will arrive with a free screen protector and back casing."

And funnily what gave it away was just a screenshot of the device’s home screen.Looks like NFC is coming back to their Mi series, as the “N” symbol can clearly be seen above. That and the fact that you can see two signal strengths pretty much confirms a Dual-SIM Mi 5 with 4G LTE.In another post, the co-founder states that this device will bring “a lot of surprises”. He should know best since he’s been using the device for a good month. Rumours claim that these surprised are a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM.Others talk about a 5-inch Full HD display (1920 x 1080); 16-megapixel rear and 8-megapixel front sensors; Android Marshmallow 6.0 in the form of MIUI; and a 4000 mAh battery. Hugo Barra (Global VP of Xiaomi) had earlier announced that the brand will be making its first international showing at MWC 2016 and we’re expecting fireworks at their first global exhibition.Adding on to the teaser, a leak has come out showing the retail box of the Mi 5. Showing off the colours and how the device will look like. The images look pretty real and illustrate the devices in four different colours: gold, pink, white and black.The battle of the top two Chinese manufacturers is going to get messy. Let’s just hope they keep it up so consumers can reap the benefits.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA, 2 ]"

This would enable the 3 telcos to expand their reach and to provide a better internet experience for their customers. The first agreement inked between Celcom and TM is to extend its partnership in TM’s Next-Gen Backhaul service. This would help Celcom to accelerate its 4G LTE coverage by providing a robust and high bandwidth capacity to their sites through TM’s fibre network. Celcom taps into TM’s HSBB Network
The next agreement is to extend’s Celcom’s access to TM’s HSBB Network. This would allow Celcom to offer High-Speed Fibre Broadband services for both home and business users, similar to Maxis and P1’s Fibre offering. About 3 years ago, Celcom did offer Fibre Broadband on TM’s HSBB infrastructure and there’s a possibility of them relaunching this soon. P1’s new 4G LTE service gets a coverage boost from Celcom
As you probably know, TM will be introducing its new mobile 4G LTE service this year via P1. In order to provide a a wide nationwide coverage from the start, Celcom has been signed as P1’s Domestic Roaming partner. This is similar to U Mobile’s Domestic Roaming arrangements with Celcom and Maxis, to cover places where U Mobile’s own 3G/4G sites are not available.So if you’re out P1’s LTE coverage, you can always rely on Celcom’s extensive coverage in Malaysia for a seamless experience. It has been mentioned that both P1 and Celcom have been conducting user trials and network tests to ensure full readiness for its launch in the first half of 2016."

Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, Via, and now the latest one to join their ranks: Grab. Yup, our very own MyTeksi has now rebranded to Grab.While rebranding is pretty common, especially when you’re trying to expand into other regions like MyTek–ahem, Grab is, so it isn’t all that surprising. That’s all peaches and unicorn farts, but what’s gonna happen to this ad?MyTeksi not seksi anymore? Aw, shucks.Regardless, this rebrand does bring more features to the existing Grab app. In an attempt to unify their services into one platform, Grab is adding three new features to their service.No, not that kind of flash, get your head out of the gutter. What this Flash does is put every kind of vehicle (from a standard taxi to a GrabCar+) on the map. Simply hit it and it will call the nearest vehicle to you regardless of the type of ride — perfect for when you’re in a hurry. Keep in mind that Flash is currently only available in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam whereas roll out in Malaysia is set for 30 January.This service lets you input more than one credit card, or choose to pay with cash or use someone else’s verified credit card to book a ride. Once again, the multiple card function will only roll out to Malaysia in February of this year.What this does is basically keep your business rides and expenses separate from your personal ones. In-app features include the expense code, trip detail fields for tracking and expense claim purposes. Passengers can log onto the Grab Passenger Hub to download their consolidated business or personal statements for claims submissions purposes. You can also add a corporate card via the multiple credit card support and toggle between them easily.You can also add a corporate card via the multiple credit card support and toggle between them easily.Besides that, Grab is holding a Grab Freedom Day, across the capital cities of the six countries Grab operates in, where over a hundred Grabbers (including the management team) will spend a day as Grab drivers.If you happen to book a ride with a Grabber, that ride is on the house plus the value of the ride will be donated to charities across the region — Malaysia’s being the Mobiliti Association of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.Wanna get your hands on (ha, see what I did there) this app? It’s available on Android, iOS and BlackBerry."

For a limited time only, the yellow telco is offering a whopping 7GB of data plus free calls to all networks for only RM75/month on its new SmartPlan 75.The plan is only RM10 more than their current SmartPlan 65 that offers 3GB of data with the same free-flow call perks. The rest of the plan remains the same with 10 sen per SMS and 20 sen per MMS. You can also send unlimited SMS to your 3 friends that are on Digi’s network. On top of that, you also get to enjoy unlimited WhatsApp and WeChat connectivity. So even if have depleted your 7GB quota, you can still use them at regular speeds. To restore full speeds, you can top up additional 1GB at RM8 and it is valid for 2 days. Overall this is an interesting response from Digi and they are closing the gap with U Mobile’s Hero Postpaid which offers 7GB of data and unlimited calls at RM70/month. Digi is even cheeky enough to mention “Real heroes should be smart as well” on the SmartPlan 75 page. If you factor in 4G coverage and the extra perks like free iflix for a year, this could be one of the most competitive postpaid offer right now. If you’re interested, you better sign up before it ends on 29th February 2016. For more info, head over to Digi’s SmartPlan page.Thanks to Swee Huatz and @khainiz94 for the tip!"

Now they have enhanced its offering further with its new Hero Plus that’s designed to give you more data for you and your loved ones. For RM120/month, you get a total of 10GB of internet and unlimited free calls on 2 separate lines. There’s no change for the current Hero P70 postpaid plan and essentially what’s new is their new Share 50 supplementary line. Each “Share 50” line costs RM50/month and it lets you enjoy unlimited free calls plus additional 3GB of data. You can add up to 3x Share 50 lines under a Hero P70 postpaid account, which gives you a total of 16GB of data that’s shareable across principal and supplementary lines. For a family of 4, that comes out to RM55/month per person for unlimited calls with an average of 4GB of data each. The Share 50 line is also applicable for i90 and i130 postpaid plans as well. Since the internet quota is shared, there’s no wastage as all lines will utilise internet from the same pool. So if one uses less, the other line holders will get to use more.

Nothing was really based on hard research at that time. Now a Reddit user going by the name “pbrandes_eth” has drawn up a scientific approach to see how the Facebook app “kills” your device. And the evidence says pretty much the same thing.Many have called it a hogger of resources when installed, bugs out and sometimes just fails to work. Facebook hasn’t even changed the looks of the app since material design is all the rage now – with Marshmallow in play.Monitoring how detrimental the Facebook app is on an LG G4, the Reddit user used DiscoMark’s benchmark and ran 13 test – with and without Facebook – to see the differences in performance. After the tests, he found that there was a 15% performance difference. That’s hard facts, no placebo nonsense.It’s pretty obvious that adding/removing any app on your device is going to affect the performance of the CPU but the fact is, why is an app that is only 39MB in size, accounting for such a big gap in performance? We can only think of the bloated coding that was mentioned by a Facebook engineer in the past.A realisation hit me that our reliance on Facebook goes much deeper than just social interactions. ‘Cause if it wasn’t for Zuckerberg, there would be many happy memories forgotten. Posing me to think that if we have to rely on it, at least, be smart of how to make it more efficient – or, at least, make our own experience with the social media platform better.Well, now you have it, don’t want your smartphone to be handicapped further than it usually is, uninstall the Facebook app and use it on your browser instead.Want to try out this experiment yourself?

When you sit down, you whip out your phone. When the food comes, you whip it out to post a picture what you’re eating on social media. When you want to avoid awkward conversations with that family member you’re supposed to be close with but barely remember their name, you have to whip it out.I think you get the gist.It’s a bad habit but most of us are guilty of it. Dinner time should be about the food and the people you’re having it with — especially when it is a family dinner. So, IKEA decided enough was enough and came up with an inventive solution to this particular conundrum: They created a new….table?Who would’ve thought of a smartphone-powered-steamboat-machine-table-thingamabob? I definitely didn’t. It sounds fantastic. While the table was definitely interesting, what’s equally interesting are the subjects’ responses.When they sat down, the usual routine of whipping out the smartphone begins right up until the steamboat pot is placed on the fire. One eagle-eyed observer noticed that the soup wasn’t boiling and after some clarification, hit the button and raised the steamboat platform in a futuristic sci-fi manner.Obviously, everyone started freaking out at how cool that was, but when the waiter told them to take out their phones the subjects thought it was to take pictures of the contraption. When they found out they had to place their devices into the base of the machine to power the steamboat, many were hesitant but eventually gave in to their tummies demands.The result was pretty awesome. Everyone made a whole lot more eye contact and looking at each other’s faces rather than the Zuck’s Facebook. Conversation happened with their mouths as opposed to their thumbs. Smiles were exchanged without the need for round yellow emojis.It was heartwarming, to say the least. We’re big fans of good tech and are always on our devices — for work and for play. But sometimes it’s better to just disconnect from your devices and reconnect with actual people and respond to them without needing a notification tone to prompt you.Are you guys guilty of phubbing at the dinner table?

Basically, the case allows you to record phone conversations with its internal microphone.The cover is only available for the iPhone 5 (and later) for now and allows you to record any incoming and outgoing calls made to an iPhone. There’s no app necessary; no internet and server issues; and no worries about people hacking your accounts and deleting these recordings.Of course, there are some non-ill intents for this case too. Say you’d want to record the voice of a loved one for memory’s sake or a long work related conference call to make sure you don’t miss anything.You don’t actually need to have a phone conversation to record anything so the case basically doubles as a regular voice recording device. All your recorded MP3 files are stored on the 2GB microSD that it comes with. The case also has its own battery so it won’t suck up anything from your iPhone battery.Record up to eight hours of voice playback with the case and don’t worry about not hearing conversations as the mic is able to pick up conversations up to 16 feet. The manufacturer claims that the 2GB card will allow at least 20 hours of conversations. If 2GBs isn’t enough, the case will allow bigger capacity cards too.In a less than discreet fashion, the silicone case comes in three colours (red, black and white) and the outer plastic shell comes in six colours (red, black, blue, white, yellow and green). It is made out of plastic and silicone and has apparently gone under vigorous drop (10 feet) and pressure (220 pounds) testing without a hitch. JIC charges via micro USB.To purchase a JIC case, you can head on over to their Indiegogo site. The most affordable pledge currently goes for US$ 29 (RM 123.13) without shipping. That pledge will entitle you to a JIC case, a 2GB microSD card, rechargeable battery and USB cable.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

To get one officially would probably take months but a couple of grey importers in Malaysia have started to selling the metal unibody smartphone. Like most imported handsets, the first wave of Redmi 3 stocks won’t be too friendly on your wallet.Retailers Satu Gadget and DirectD have started selling the Redmi 3 at RM688 and RM699 respectively, which is pretty steep compared to its original asking price in China that goes for 699 CNY (RM452 with current exchange rate). In fact, you can get the bigger and better Redmi Note 3 from as low as RM699 for the low spec 2GB RAM + 16GB storage model. That gets a faster Helio X10 processor, full HD 5.5″ display and it even comes with a fingerprint scanner at the rear. The only feature disadvantage of the Redmi Note 3 is the lack of a microSD expansion slot.To refresh your memory on the smaller Redmi 3, the budget unibody metal device gets a 5″ 720p display and it runs on an Octa-Core Snapdragon 616 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. You can add a microSD card up to 128GB on its hybrid Dual-SIM slot and powering the device is a huge 4,100mAh battery that supports 5V/2A fast charging. In terms of imaging, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 rear camera and a front-facing 5MP f/2.2 unit for your selfie needs.If Xiaomi sells this officially in our market, we reckon that it should go below RM600.

Often having those two elements lets you bend the truth a little and sometimes you’re caught saying things that don’t really add up.Google is going to make your life a little harder now since they want to help people differentiate the politicians that know their facts and those who fall short. Which side are you on?Taking place in the United States during the Presidential debates, Google will be doing this by combining their efforts with Fox News Channel – not necessarily the best news outlet. This fact-checking will utilise quotes directly from candidates; real-time Google Trends data; and face questioning from well-versed YouTube figures.Pulling this off would require a whole lot of computing and it’ll help American voters make informed decisions on who deserves their check mark. At the same time, Google thinks that it’ll allow all those running for the seat in the White House to have an even playing field to share their thoughts with the masses.So for those in the States, when you search for “Fox News Debate” you’ll get the whole shebang – quotes, photos and social messages from all those running in the race.

Rory Lee,Zomato is going to bring you to your favourite food with Uber,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/27/zomato-is-going-to-bring-you-to-your-favourite-food-with-uber/,"food,food and ride sharing,ride sharing,uber,zomato,zomato teams up with uber,mobile apps,mobile devices","Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices",2016-01-27,"Have you ever been lounging at home when suddenly, like the changing winds out in the open sea, your stomach starts growling in hunger? Yes? Then have you ever been too lazy to get into your car and drive all the way to a shop to grab a bite to eat not knowing if the food will even be good thus making the trip not worthwhile?Well, now you might not have to pull your hair out over it because popular food review app Zomato is teaming up with Uber to help bring you to good food. At least, we hope it’s good food.If you haven’t already heard about Zomato, it’s an app that helps you “discover” new food by providing information such as restaurant reviews and ratings as well as create your “own network of foodies for trusted recommendations”.How this works is: You launch the app and sign in to your account. Then you can scroll through a timeline-esque UI of food reviews and ratings based on your current location. Then, you can hit on whichever restaurant tickles your fancy to find out more information about the establishment. While previously it only gives you directions to the restaurant, now it will give you the option to “Ride there with Uber”.Why is this better than just launching the Uber app and inputting the destination? Well, because it happens with a single touch. Hitting the option would bring up a pickup time plus the estimated price range for the trip — just as you would find on the regular Uber app — without needing to launch a new app. Saves some time I guess?This feature has been available to Zomato users in 30+ cities across 13 countries, namely India, Australia, Canada, The UK, South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, The Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Turkey, UAE and the United States.Unfortunately, as of right now, we are still unable to get the option here in Selangor. Curious, we contacted Zomato and they told us that the function would roll out in stages. So far only users in Kuala Lumpur can access this function, with Selangor’s availability on the way soon.While I think this is pretty neat, I’ve actually never tried it before. So do let us know, if you’re a Zomato user, what you think about this little feature. If you aren’t a Zomato user, would you be interested in trying this out?The Zomato app is available on Android, iOS and Windows."
Rory Lee,Can your drone fly underwater?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/28/can-your-drone-fly-underwater/,"cool stuff,drone,drones,flying drone,loon copter,quad copter,swimming drone,underwater drone,others","Cool stuff,Others",2016-01-28,"Flying drones are pretty cool. Drones that can sail across the surface of the water like boats are also pretty cool. Just the other day we were talking about a whole bunch of really cool drones. But what we didn’t include was this drone. This guy, is a helicopter, a boat, AND a submarine.While drones can let you get some sick wedding shots and awesome drag racing footage, they’re also a little creepy. People can use these little things to spy on you, streaming video directly into their creepy little devices. If you thought you could escape them like you escape bees (diving in the water, in case you’ve never been chased by bees before) you’re sorely mistaken.This flying, swimming and diving device called the Loon Copter was developed by the Oakland University’s Embedded Systems Research Laboratory. It uses a barrel like body, attached to an otherwise regular quadcopter, to act as a ballast tank in a submarine. Filling it with water allows it to sink beneath the surface. It fills in a unique way that rotates the quadcopter ninety degrees in the water, so that the propellers bcome like outboard motors, allowing the drone to navigate under water.It can’t really navigate very deep bodies of water, but as this is nowhere near mass production, we can forsee it diving much deeper in the near future. When you want the drone to fly again, simply empty the tank and it will send the Loon Copter to the surface again.While, swimming and flying drones aren’t all that new, what sets this drone apart is the fact that it uses the clever ballast system. According to the project’s lead scientist, the drone can sit on the surface of the water without any energy usage, as well as change and control depth with little power and no propeller use.Currently, you can’t stream video from the Loon Copter to your smartphone — so you need to record it for playback later — but the creators have noted that future versions of this little guy could make use of acoustic modems or repeater buoys to allow for live streaming and control options.Created out of noble aspirations to help with search and rescue operations, this drone could also be misused — like all good things in life. The end result would come from the user, and while we think that it could be a little scary to give people this much flexibilty when it comes to filming spy footage, there is no denying the cool (and potentially useful) factor of this little device.That said, imagine how much easier filming the next Jaws movie will be with the Loon Copter. All you need to do is strap a fin to its side and queue the music. Dum dum, dum dum![SOURCE, VIA]"

To me, it’s a hotly debated issue that stems from the history of intelligence agencies spying on their nation’s citizens. In most cases, it’s to protect a country’s interest and to ensure the safety of their people.Uber has decided to go big brother and began monitoring how drivers are driving since late last year. The Verge points out that this isn’t their first rodeo as they’ve tracked drivers in China during the unruly protests that were happening in Eastern China.Now it’s taken that isolated situation a step further in a bid to safeguard passenger safety by using gyrometers, GPS signals and accelerometers in driver’s smartphones. CSO (Chief Security Officer) of Uber, Joe Sullivan says that they’re doing this because “If a rider complains that a driver accelerated too fast and braked too hard, we can review that trip using data”.The ride-sharing platform will utilise gyrometer data to see if those behind the wheel are moving their smartphones too much while driving. That means more time looking fumbling with their devices and less time looking at the road. Speeding will be monitored too, by using technology to take note of the average time between two points and calculating if the drivers being too friendly with that accelerator – so to speak.Digging up some extra info on the subject, the Guardian has narrowed down where this monitoring is taking place – Houston, Texas. It’s no question that these experiments will only help Uber maintain rider satisfaction and safety above all else but also will help provide proof to any bad ratings; justifying why a one-star rating was given – if it was because of reckless driving. Providing a case for both the driver and rider in the scenario of an accusation.We’re sure that Uber partners/drivers won’t be happy having someone watching their every turn (figuratively) and as a class-action lawsuit has been filed in the Bay Area demanding for equal rights – drivers might not have to put up with this for long.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

They’re horribly old fashioned and often come in colours that resemble different shades of puke. Plus, except for HTC’s Dot View Case, most flip cases never did anything particularly cool. Sure you might have some practical functions, but none that doesn’t scream “ZOMG WHAT A DWEEB”.Okay, maybe I’m being a little harsh here but the point is, I would never, ever, ever, use a flip cover case…unless they did this.Click to enlargeSo with a flip case for your smartphone, you’re often left with a lot of space on the inside of your flip case. Space which can be used to either let your toddler/cousin/nephew/niece enthusiastically doodle on, or perhaps use it as a space for you to stick photos of your loved ones — y’know like the inside of a locker door.However, neither of those are particularly practical, nor do they help you do more with your smartphone in any way. Well, it looks like the boffins at Microsoft Research — Microsoft’s research division (go figure) — seem to have figured out a brilliant way to make use of that space.Enter the Microsoft “Type Cover” for your phone. What they’ve done with the flip cover is line the inside of the case with an always-on, low-power display that can display “useful information”. Some examples provided by the concept includes the displaying of travel itineraries, tickets, the calendar while you’re composing an email, and (my personal favourite) a fully qwerty touch keyboard. That sounds fantastic doesn’t it?It is, until you realise that if this “inside screen” is touch sensitive and is attached to the side of your phone, how on earth are you going to type with both hands? Here’s a picture to illustrate my point:So unless you’re typing with your index fingers on the table, or if you tuck the case behind your device, it’s kind of unfeasible. Plus, if you do the latter, you might as well just use the multitasking button to switch between apps.There is promise when it comes to the full QWERTY keyboard though, but even that has it’s problems. Because if the phone/case does not have a kickstand it’ll just end up looking like this really silly case for a Samsung Galaxy S6.Either way, it looks like this is merely a concept and could do with a lot more polishing. The good news is that we might not have to wait for the rumoured “Surface Phone” to (hopefully) test this case out because Microsoft Research is supposedly “in deep talks” with the Lumia division to turn these flip covers into real products.What do you guys think? Is one screen enough?[SOURCE, 2]"

Our own device (also from the US) has for the past week and, for the longest time, nobody claimed responsibility or could even identify what was wrong with the device.Well, thanks to our knights in shining armour over at Android Authority and Techradar, we now have an answer.After picking up the story about the bootloop issues from LG G4 users, Android Authority gathered what they knew and confronted LG about it. Thankfully, instead of denying any problems the electronics giant admitted that there was a problem with the smartphone’s hardware and said that they would repair the affected devices, though it is unclear if your device needs to still be under warranty for it to be eligible.The problem puts the phone in a boot-up loop where it tries to reset, fails and tries again and again which then proceeds to brick the phone. We thought it was a problem with our device’s battery, but now according to LG, it is resulting from “loose contact between components”.Currently, it is unclear if this problem affects all LG G4s or if it is just limited to those units in the US. However, according to Android Authority, the bootloop issue persists and affects all regional and carrier models of the device. LG advises its customers who have bought their devices via a carrier and are experiencing such issues to contact their nearest LG Service Center for repair under full warranty.On the other hand, customers who have purchased their G4 smartphones from non-carrier retailers should contact an LG Service Center “with the understanding that warranty conditions will differ”.We don’t know if this problem affects local Malaysian units, so if you are using a local LG G4, do let us know if you’re experiencing such problems. We’ve contacted LG Malaysia ourselves and we’ll keep you updated on their response.[SOURCE, 2]"

At first, it was TM with their UniFi + iflix plan, then now it seems that it’s Digi‘s turn. The telco is offering a 12-month iflix subscription (worth RM96) to its subscribers for free.Unfortunately, this deal isn’t for every Digi subscriber as it is only applicable for those under the Digi SmartPlan 65 banner or higher. If you aren’t one now though, from today onwards you can sign up or upgrade to the SmartPlan 65 (or any higher plan) and get this very offer as well.But there’s more. This deal is supposedly limited and it will operate on a first come first served basis which means that if you want to take advantage of this free year of iflix, it would probably be wise to act soon. That said, Digi never specified a specific “limit” to this offer — no dates, no number of customers, nothing. Could this be a marketing strategy to generate hype?Well, if it is, this wouldn’t be the first time Malaysians have been lured in by the word “free” and “limited”. Let’s just say we like free things.In any case, much like the TM deal, this one requires no login because Digi has “back-end” integration with iflix allowing the streaming service to automatically detect if you’re on a Digi line and grant you unrestricted access to their library. All you need to do is download the app (via a Digi network) on either iOS or Android, and launch it. iflix will take care of the rest. Plus you get 1GB of extra quota (until March 2016) to watch iflix content.If you’re not interested in upgrading to a Digi SmartPlan 65 or higher, you can still opt to retain the 60-days free subscription with iflix that is the result of the first collaboration between the telco and the streaming service. For those who are curious, Digi’s SmartPlan 65 offers two variants — one that has unlimited calls to all networks plus 3GB of data, versus one that has 5GB of data and only 200mins of free calls.

A metal build, a nice full HD display and a snappy fingerprint sensor are hard to come by at this end of the market. While honor have not announced when the device will go on sale or how much it would cost, we got to take a quick look at this all-metal midrange device.A premium metal construction is almost a necessity these days. While we don’t think that a metal body is all that, smartphone manufacturers and people who want to show off certainly do. Has honor delivered with the 5X?Well, I can tell you that it definitely feels better than the more expensive honor 7. The front of the device is nothing to shout about, but when you move to the sides of the device, you can see where all of honor’s effort went. They talked endlessly about the sandblasting they had to do to keep the device feeling smooth in the hand and they did accomplish that to a certain extent.The sides are nicely chamfered (ala-Nexus 6P) to help with grip and very smooth to the touch. They decided to go with a brushed metal look for the back plate but the moment your fingers touch it, the panel feels in no way shape or form brushed. It was smooth as a baby’s bottom — which may appeal to some, but I like a little grain and roughness.There are other niggles that come from the buttons. While they had nice tactile feedback which felt really premium, the power button shifts around a little too much and if you apply pressure to the center of the volume rockers you will be greeted with an incredibly unpleasant flex.Since this isn’t really a high-end device, you can’t really expect much when it comes to performance. It sports a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. With proper optimisation, those specs would do fine for light to medium tasks, but from our brief hands-on it doesn’t seem to be the case.Switching between applications was slow and sluggish. Exiting the camera app was the most painful thing to watch as the frames stuttered and choked. It was a disaster. That said, this can probably be fixed with a quick update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow.The honor 5X comes with a decent 13-megapixel f/2.0 main camera with a dual-LED flash mounted on the rear, right above the fingerprint scanner. It’s a pretty decent snapper with a host of features as is the hallmark of EMUI’s camera app. Stuff like beautification, HDR, panorama are all bundled into it. Shots from that sensor are decent with reasonable amounts of colour accuracy and detail. The front 5MP f/2.4 selfie cam also takes reasonably good pictures, though we would have liked if it was a little wider for those crucial wefies.Its Huawei-made fingerprint scanner is as fantastic as ever. I loved the accuracy and speed though I would have appreciated a little haptic feedback when it successfully reads your finger but that’s me nitpicking. The honor 5X’s sensor only needs 6 taps to register your fingerprint yet it has an amazing level of accuracy.As is a common theme in Huawei made devices, the fingerprint scanner at the back is more than simply a fingerprint scanner. You can swipe down on it to pull down your notifications, as well as hold it to exit your application and return to the home screen. It also allows you to take photos by tapping it though we found that quite pointless and horribly unergonomic.It also has a curious function that lets the fingerprint scanner act as a back button allowing you to tap it once to go back to your previous task. So what if I’ve enabled the camera single tap to take a photo? Design oversight? It also lacks the swipe left and swipe right to scroll through pictures or text.All in all, it’s a pretty decent budget premium device with an okay camera and decent specs. All it needs is some proper optimisation (please patch ASAP) and a little skill when taking photographs. It’s a decent all-rounder but it faces tough competition from the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 and the Redmi Note 3 (when it arrives) even if our estimate of a sub RM1,000 price tag comes true."

The compact package will also apparently arrive with a 16 GB entry-level internal storage, moving up all the way to 64 GB.Making smaller phones could allow Apple to re-enter the smaller device market that has people with smaller hands fumbling and tumbling their larger devices in recent times. And it fuels Microsoft’s keyboard beta-testing for iOS that allows easier one-handed texting.We just hope that making it smaller might allow Cupertino to slash prices if they want to be seen as a competitor in the “more affordable” market. Countries in Asia could benefit the most, together with some European states also having the majority of their citizens opting for more affordable devices.Prices of iPhones have skyrocketed through the roof in the past few generations with increments getting out of hand. Could selling a smaller iPhone allow them to price it closer to the other top end devices and earn them an even larger market share? If you didn’t know, Apple still rakes in the most revenue since their profit margins are a lot higher.Other rumours have come along too with many pointing to OLED screens, waterproof-ability and even ditching the headphone jack on the next generation of iDevices.All rumours and none of them facts. Anything Apple decides, they’ll likely pull it off. Unless they’re going to sell another Smart Battery Case, which is reminiscent of a camel’s hump.Let us know what you think of a smaller iPhone, would you buy it if it has the A9 chipset?[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

The difference in location will be the main variable here – suburbs vs city. On top of that, we’ll also look at how reliable, convenient and comfortable Uber is opposed to driving. We’re looking at a big difference in travel time(s) for both of us. He takes anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to get to work. As for me, I’ll take about 15 minutes to 30 minutes. In terms of fuel, he forks out roughly RM65 weekly and RM20 on tolls.

But, while other one-handed typing modes resemble squashed keyboards, this one fans out.Yup, it can be anchored either on the right or the left side of the device, but then it fans out in a quarter-circle shape which is supposed to make it easier for users to swipe/type one-handed with their thumb.

They anticipate that pricing and  is going to be a key factor in this space. The same can be said for the cost of premium materials and better processors slowly dipping. Touching on the topic of newer OEMs gaining traction by packing all they can in their devices, LG is probably realising that Huawei and Xiaomi are a big threat.

Clad in an all-metal unibody, the honor 5X comes with a 5.5-inch full HD and packs a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage.It also comes with a 13MP f/2.0 primary camera with a dual-LED flash for taking photos. Selfies are taken care of by the front-facing 5MP f/2.4 snapper. The 5X also sports a large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0, plus a dedicated dual-SIM tray — so none of that hybrid-SIM nonsense. The device will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with the EMUI 3.1 skin on top.As you can tell by the name, the honor 7 Enhanced is slightly improved version of the old (but gold) honor 7. It still packs the same 2.2GHz octa-core Kirin 935 processor paired with 3GB of RAM thrumming under a 5.2-inch full-HD display. It also brings over the honor 7’s 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash plus an 8MP front-facing camera with its own LED flash.What has changed then? It has more storage — double in fact at 32GB from the old 16GB found on the original honor 7. While it may seem like a simple change it is a significant one as one of the biggest qualms users had of this otherwise excellent device was the fact that it had a measly 16GB of onboard storage, which as we all know is not going to be enough especially with that 20MP snapper.This is also the first non-Nexus device to come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box that has been launched in Malaysia.If you want to get your hands on either of these devices, you can register your interest on Vmall.my from 26 January onwards.

Coming in at about 8 inches in size, the tablet has a rather unique shape; with four front-facing speakers (called the Predator Quadio) with one situated at each corner of the tablet.The tablet is surprisingly light considering how chunky it looks and how solid it feels; weighing in at a paltry 350g with the battery in.The sides are also shaped in a way that you have a decent place to grip without your hands getting in the way of said speakers if you want to play games in landscape mode. One minor gripe is the placement of its microUSB port at the top of the device as the charging cable will get in the way if you are playing games while charging.The rear of the device is home to a brushed metal plate with the Predator logo on it and is the only bit of the tablet that is made of solid metal. The rest of the Predator 8 is made of a combination of plastic and rubber that only simulates that metal finish but still looks good regardless. Due to its unique shape you probably won’t find many 3rd party cases for it, unfortunately, but a few do exist.Also, we feel we need to mention that this is the first (compact) gaming tablet that has a form of haptic feedback called the Predator TacSense. There are two haptic motors, with one placed on each side. So depending on the games you are playing it might vibrate to your actions, even the startup screen has the tablet buzzing to the logo. We do notice that the tactile feedback doesn’t apply to all games, though, only those which have been tweaked to have the feature in the first place."

The long-awaited Mi 5 was said to be launched after Chinese New Year and now they have locked a date for its official announcement in Beijing.According to its official post on Weibo, the Mi 5 will be launched on 24th February at 2:00PM. For the die hard Mi Fans in China, Xiaomi will be opening ticket sales beginning this Friday, 29th January from the Mi Store app.In terms of models, we could be seeing up to 4 different variants of the Mi 5. The base model could start from 2,199CNY (about RM1,435) and it goes all the way up to 3,099 (about RM2,022). As speculated earlier, Xiaomi will be playing around with 2 different back materials for the Mi 5. It is also expected to run on the latest Snapdragon 820 precessor and it will get a fingerprint scanner as well. The purported Mi 5 variants are as follows:Metal Design – 3GB RAM + 32GB Storage – 2,199 (RM1,435)
Metal Design – 4GB RAM + 64GB Storage – 2,599 (RM1,695)
Glass Design – 2K Display + 4GB RAM + 32GB Storage – 2,799 (RM1,826)
Glass Design – 2K Display + 4GB RAM + 64GB Storage – 3,099 (RM2,022)It is also worth pointing out that Xiaomi’s launch is happening while MWC 2016 is taking place at Barcelona. With Xiaomi missing its sales target for 2015, we expect the Chinese brand to expand to more markets with more competitive devices for 2016. While we didn’t really get the Mi 4 due to 4G support limitation, hopefully, the new one would be a compelling flagship for 2016.UPDATE: Hugo Barra has tweeted that the Mi 5 will be previewed at MWC 2016. This is Xiaomi’s first showing at the annual international mobile event.[ SOURCE 2 3 VIA ]"

Some of the things you can find there are nothing short of amazing, from camera control modules, to remote-controlled paper planes, to movies and even smartwatches. With such a large following though it seems weird that Kickstarter never brought their application to the Google Play Store — until now.It does seem odd that Kickstarter left the Android platform without an app for so long, but maybe they were caught up with something. Well, they clearly got around to doing so eventually, but it appears some key functions missing. With the Android app, you can discover and pledge for projects as well as get updates from your backed projects. You can also connect with your friends to see what they’re backing. As something for you to browse the wealth of Kickstarter’s library, this application is pretty decent then.However, if you’re a project creator, your hands are tied. You would have to resort to the browser version because the application will not allow you to manage your projects with it. It seems a little silly that such a feature was left out front the start and would only be coming in the future, but I guess if you consider the number of backers versus the number of creators, that percentage is pretty lopsided.Kickstarter could instead just make another app specially for creators — like what Facebook does with its Pages Manager app — though that seems unlikely especially if you’re looking at the iOS app. If you’re a big Kickstarter user, definitely try the app out (you can download it here) and definitely let us know what you think about it versus the browser version or even the iOS version.[SOURCE, VIA]"

After releasing five different versions in Malaysia and spinning-off too many devices under the ZenFone name to count. Their flagship smartphone has been on the market for a year already and these benchmarks imply that we’re going to see a new generation of ZenFones pretty soon.Labelled ASUS Z010DD and Z012D, it seems like two versions with different specs went through GFXBench recently. Surprisingly, both seem to be carrying Qualcomm chipsets – indicating that the manufacturer may ditch Intel SoCs that they have dearly utilised in the past.In the past, ASUS used the model numbers Z008 and Z00AD on their ZenFone 2s and the current numbers shown aren’t that far off to assume they represent their upcoming smartphones.Out of the two model numbers, the one that appears to have better specs is the Z012D. The device in question is listed with a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display and a Hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor (clocked to 1.7GHz). Based on the benchmark, it’ll have Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.For the lower-spec Z010DD, it also runs Android Marshmallow but only has an HD (1280 x 720) screen that oddly is bigger at 5.9-inches. It’ll run an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset clocked at 1.5GHz mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.Surprisingly, the listing for Z010DD has camera-specifications. There will be a 12-megapixel shooter on the rear and a 5-megapixel sensor on the front.ASUS is likely to pursue more Qualcomm chipsets due to their battery-life woes. This switch might help and users should welcome this news with open arms.We won’t know for sure where these two devices will sit in ASUS’ lineup and there’s a possibility that both of these are the lower end models not a part of the ZenFone 3 series. Only one thing will be for sure, they’ll release a dozen phones with the same name.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA ]"

The chase begins and you’ll have to act fast if you want to catch the culprit that has stolen your smartphone.Now, what if you’re on the receiving end of these searches multiple times. Does it make you a thief? Or is your house just bringing bad GPS-related luck? We dig deeper into this mysterious case that has a couple in Atlanta constantly having find my phone-like apps bring people to their house.Make no mistake, this duo is not the Bonnie and Clyde of the smartphone industry. They’ve just bought the wrong house. This all began when Christina Lee and Michael Saba moved in together. The following months they started getting odd “visits” from people looking for their smartphones, stating that their phone-tracking apps lead them to this geolocation.So put yourself in their shoes. At every time of day having people bang on your door sometimes accompanied by policemen, asking to search your house for their missing smartphone. Yikes, after the third time we’d move out immediately if it was us.They’ve been through about a dozen accusations and every time they need to explain that “I’m sorry you came all this way. This happens a lot”. Often people take their word but there are times where the accusers fail to believe them.The couple has tried to understand why they keep facing this but their attempts to connect the dots have been in vain. These stolen phones have no real commonality between them. They’re on different cellular networks. While some are Androids and some are iPhones. An official complaint has been filed to their local police department too but it’s all the same.A case as interesting as this isn’t the first time that “Find my phone” apps have failed to give the correct location of where these stolen phones are. Some experts claim that it’s associated with cell tower triangulation – a problem that has been exhibited before in another state.A commentator on Ars Technica points out a reasonable explanation below:“Our utility maps things by GPS, but the fallback is to plug the address into something like Microsoft Streets and Trips or even Google Maps. If the mapping program can’t find it, typically it will default to throwing the coordinates to wherever the geographical center of the zip code is. Sometimes it’s the middle of nowhere and obviously wrong, sometimes it’s a similar street in the same city, sometimes it’s a similar street on the other side of the US. When we encounter errors like this, we have to manually update our database with the proper GPS data, which we get with a handheld. We are supposed to do this when we install new meters and equipment, to map their locations accurately, but most of the time they forget or don’t bother and the person entering the information into the database has to “best guess” where it is.What’s probably happening is that GPS coordinates for these “lost” phones is bad, and the mapping program is throwing up its hands and pointing them to the default location for that zip code, which is unfortunately on top of this address.”Will it ever end for the couple? Who knows but shifting houses should probably be on their minds by now.For those who’ve lost their phones before, do share with us your experiences with the apps you’ve used to locate them.

The brilliant work of author/comic-writer/kid-trapped-in-an-adult’s-body Matthew Inman has been passed around the Internet more often than a keg at a frat house party, and for good reason. His comics are brilliant. He takes daily life situations, adds some magic, some ridiculousness, a bear-o-dactyl and boom, you’ll be on the floor clutching your sides laughing your head off, or trying not to puke from the graphic images. Either way, it’s a lot of fun.While most of his work was designed to have people cackling like witches on a broomstick, he does have some pretty hard hitting and emotional ones as well. One of his newer works about Gene Roddenberry, for example, was as motivational as it was bulu-roma inducing.Not too long ago, The Oatmeal collaborated with Elan Lee and Shane Small to launch a Kickstarter campaign for their own imaginative card game: Exploding Kittens. It became one of the most funded projects on Kickstarter and quickly won the hearts of many but it suffered from the limitation of being a physical card game. Now, well…there’s an app for that.Exploding Kittens is a simple and straightforward game to be played with friends. The objective is simple — don’t explode. Each player starts with four cards and a defuse card with a universal draw deck in the middle. Players then take turns to play an action card followed by drawing another card from the deck in the centre. If a player draws a card with an exploding kitten, they will have to defuse the card or get blown up and ejected from the game. It continues until only one player is left.The app version of the game promises to be exactly the same. That means you get to have all the brilliant drawings of The Oatmeal, plus the simple and addictive mechanics of the game. What’s more, the app version will obviously have more attractive graphics for your actions, like this cat paw stealing your cards:If you’d like to download this app you can find it at the Apple App Store.

Some said there could be as many as four models launched at the same time while others dismissed that right out of the bat. There was never any official confirmation beyond an entry in the Indonesian certification agency (which has been removed) and an exclusive by SamMobile.Now, though, thanks to Indian import-export tracker Zauba, we at least have confirmation of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge’s screen sizes.
Click to enlargeBased on this listing, the two devices bearing the model number SM-G930R4 and SM-G935R4 — which is the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge respectively — have been listed to pack a 5.1-inch screen for the S7 and a 5.5-inch screen for the S7 edge. This reflects the earlier specifications outed by popular benchmark AnTuTu. Plus, since only two models have been imported, it is becoming less and less likely that Samsung will launch four devices at the same time. Then again, smartphone manufacturers have done crazier things. Though, it is worth noting that only two of each device have been imported, probably because they’re tester units (as can be seen in the description “FOR TESTNG”).Based on most leaks, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge should come with a Quad HD display packing either an Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 processor (likely depending on region) plus 4GB of RAM and either 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of expandable internal storage. Yes, there will be a microSD card slot. The camera will probably be a 12-megapixel BRITECELL rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing selfie cam. These devices should also have support for Cat.12/13 LTE connectivity and a USB Type-C port. They should also come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.If you’d like to catch up on what we know about the new Galaxy S lineup, you can find more info here and here. We will definitely know more once Samsung’s Unpacked event in Barcelona which will take place in February. Until then, these specifications could change — though we think unlikely because they match up with our earlier report on the Indonesian certification agency — so don’t follow them blindly.[SOURCE]"

When it was first introduced, it offered the most free high-speed internet at 1GB as long as you top up a minimum of RM10 each month. With the growing demand for internet on the go, Power Prepaid now comes with a whopping 3GB of Free Data. You should be impressed by now but wait until you see the full picture.While it looks like you’re getting a whopping 3GB with full speed internet on the surface, the reality is that nothing has changed. As a mobile internet user, you’ll depend mostly on high-speed internet which in this case, remains at 1GB for free. The remaining 2GB extra is for Basic Internet, which is throttled internet at 64kbps. Previously, when you used up your free 1GB of data, you have a choice to top up more with its UMI plans  or continue using with slower 64kbps speeds at no extra charges. U Mobile didn’t specify a limit for its throttled usage back then and now they have officially put a cap at 2GB. Assuming there was never a limit in the first place, this could be even seen as a downgrade. Considering other telcos are offering 500MB of Basic Internet, U Mobile thought this would be a good idea to boast 4x more throttled internet than the rest. Upon hitting your basic internet limit, you will still lose connectivity until your next top up. The rest of the Power Prepaid deal remains unchanged. The starter pack costs RM8.50 with RM5 credit preloaded and it comes with 10 days validity with 200MB of high-speed internet. The call rates are among the lowest at 5 sen/30 sec (10sen/minute), while SMS is charged at 8 sen each to all networks. As the fastest Mobile Network in Malaysia, we genuinely expected better from U Mobile. 2GB of dial-up connectivity is nothing to be proud of.

With the apparent demand for smartphones in a pink hue, now consumers have an extra device to choose from!This is great news for those who want a Pink Gold Galaxy Note5 but don’t want to have to purchase one via Maxis‘ Zerolution plan. Through the Zerolution plan, users can pick up the device with no upfront payments and no interest charges on your monthly installments from 22 January onwards.If you were to opt for this plan, you will have to pay an RM93/month installment for the device for 24 months but you’ll need to top up an extra RM30/month for the Zerolution Upgrade option. Do note that this does not include your postpaid plan subscription. For more information on this plan, you can head on over here.As Samsung is bringing this phone in themselves, those who don’t want to pay on a monthly basis can simply head down to a Samsung dealer and pick one up yourself today.Yup, this device is available starting today, 21 January 2016, onwards while stocks last at the same recommended retail price of RM2,699 inclusive of GST. According to Samsung, this “special edition” smartphone is perfectly designed for the ladies and they feel that it will “resonate with women of all ages”.What, men can’t buy pink phones too?"
Rory Lee,The OPPO F1 hits Malaysian shores,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/oppo-f1-launch-malaysia/,"f1 launch malaysia,oppo,oppo f1,oppo f1 launch,oppo f1 launch malaysia,oppo f1 official,oppo f1 official launch malaysia,oppo f1 official malaysia,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-01-21,"Earlier we saw the first device in OPPO‘s F range, the F1, make its official debut in Vietnam. Since Malaysia is a key market, we anticipated a local launch would follow soon after and sure enough, OPPO have brought this mid-range device to our shores.Despite the name, the F1 has nothing to do with the popular motorsport Formula 1. It does, however, look like the splitting image of the smartphones from OPPO’s R7 line, from white front panel right down to the square rear-mounted camera module and flash. The resemblance is uncanny.The device has a relatively small 5″ 720p HD display (1280×720 pixels) with a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor on the inside paired with 3GB of RAM for a pretty decent spec list. Internal storage is a tiny 16GB but that’s expandable via microSD for up to 128GB of extra storage. This smartphone also has support for dual-SIM (one Micro and one Nano) but since it’s a hybrid SIM set up, you will have to sacrifice one slot if you want to use a microSD card.This smartphone promises a “premium” photography experience at a reasonable price, so it gets a 13MP ISOCELL f/2.2 aperture rear-facing camera with Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) and a single LED flash. On the front, it packs an 8-megapixel f/2.0 snapper with a 1/4-inch sensor and built-in beautification features.Powering the device will be a modest 2,500 mAh battery which is a touch more than the OPPO R7 Lite and R7 models. It will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop with ColorOS 2.1 running on top.With those specs, this places the OPPO F1 right in the Xiaomi Redmi 3’s crosshairs. The F1 should have the edge in terms of performance though as it has 3GB of RAM versus the Redmi 3’s 2GB, but that extra performance does come with a higher price tag. The only question is how much lower will the Redmi 3 retail at?The OPPO F1 officially goes on sale online tomorrow, 22 January 2016, at midnight on the OPPOStore for RM1,198. The first 200 customers to purchase this device from the online store will receive a free OPPO Selfie Stick. If you’d prefer to check the device out before purchasing it, the OPPO F1 will be available in physical stores starting 25 January 2016."
Rory Lee,Samsung Galaxy A 2016 line to be unveiled in Malaysia next week,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/samsung-galaxy-a-2016-line-to-be-unveiled-in-malaysia-next-week/,"galaxy a,galaxy a series,samsung,samsung galaxy a,samsung galaxy a 2016,samsung galaxy a 2016 launch malaysia,samsung galaxy a launch in malaysia,samsung galaxy a series,samsung galaxy a3 launch malaysia,samsung galaxy a5 launch malaysia,samsung galaxy a7 launch malaysia,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-01-21,"Samsung proved that they can play the premium budget game when they launched their Galaxy A series in 2014. Then in December of last year they unveiled their new 2016 Galaxy A line much to the delight of the Samsung fans on a budget as the new models featured updated specifications and what we think is a better overall design as well.A few days ago, we saw the new Galaxy A trio hit SIRIM. Now, we’ve just received an email indicating that Samsung will be launching these new devices — the Galaxy A3, Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 — next week.Samsung Malaysia has set the official unveiling of the Galaxy A line for 28 January 2016  which is next Thursday. The Galaxy A series will share the Galaxy S6’s good looks with its glass front and back panels held together by a metal frame. The edges are rounded for a better grip and feel in the hand.The devices also get a bump, across the line, up to a 13-megapixel f/1,9 aperture rear shooter and a front-facing 5MP f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates the Galaxy A3’s camera from the other two bigger devices is the lack of OIS though we suspect people who are going for a budget device won’t mind this too much. The best part? All three devices have a Pink Gold colour option — which we hope they will bring to Malaysia as well.Sitting at the top of the Galaxy A’s pecking order is the largest of the trio with a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED display. On the inside, the devices will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Thankfully the internal storage is expandable via microSD to up to 128GB of extra internal storage. The Galaxy A7 also gets a large 3,300 mAh battery.Next up we have the Galaxy A5 which is slightly smaller at 5.2″ but with the same full-HD (1920×1080) Super AMOLED display. Powering the device will be a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. However, it gets a smaller 2,900 mAh battery for juice.Rounding out the trio is the smallest sibling, the Galaxy A3. Sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720) Super AMOLED display with a quad-core 1.5GHz processor running on the inside. It also packs 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. The device will be drawing power from a 2,300 mAh battery.The trio of devices will not launch with Android 6.0 Marshmallow though, as they’re set to come with Android 5.1 Lollipop out-of-the-box. That said, we do expect them to get Marshmallow within a reasonable amount of time. The two higher end devices — the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 — also sport a fingerprint scanner.Those are mighty specs for a budget device, but only if these devices are actually priced like a budget device. Based on the Singaporean pricing of the Galaxy A line, that doesn’t really look to be the case. In Singapore, the Galaxy A3 is going for SGD398 (around RM1,211),  while the Galaxy A5 costs SGD598 (around RM1,820) and the biggest Galaxy A7 will set you back SGD698 (around RM2,125).A pretty hefty price tag then. Then again, Singapore’s prices have generally been much higher than in Malaysia. If we’re going off last year’s Malaysian pricing, the Galaxy A3 went for RM899, Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199 and the Galaxy A7 had an RM1,499 price tag. But, keep in mind that these prices were before GST.Would you consider these devices at those price ranges? Let us know in the comments section below."
Alexander Wong,MCMC Act will be amended to crack down on government haters,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/mcmc-act-will-be-amended-to-crack-down-on-government-haters/,"free speech,freedom of speech,mcmc,mcmc act,slander,social media,website ban,industry in general,mcmc/skmm","Industry in General,MCMC/SKMM",2016-01-21,"The Malaysian Constitution guarantees every Malaysian the right to freedom of speech. When abused, it can cause adverse effects. That’s what Communication and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Salleh Said Keruak believes as the government is mulling for tougher enforcements for online users.According to the minister, social media is often abused for defaming and to incite hatred against leaders and the institutions of government. To put an end to these issues, the government is pushing to amend the MCMC Act in March, which will give it more powers to act on such abusers. The police will work closely with the MCMC in their investigations. To speed up the process, a dedicated deputy public prosecutor has been appointed by the Attorney-General’s Chambers to handle social media cases.  The new amendment could also allow more websites to be blocked, especially those that are seen to be threatening the peace and violating the Sedition Act. One such site is Sarawak Report, which he says has been spreading lies against the government and it creates confusion among the people. The minister has also added that he hopes Malaysians won’t view this in a negative light as it was necessary to safeguard the public’s interest. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen such warning. In the middle of last year, MCMC had issued a notice advising Malaysians against spreading lies on 1MDB. Once the amendment is passed in 2 months time, you better think twice before making slanderous statements on your Facebook, Twitter and other social channels. That one rant could win you a “Go to Jail” card. There are a lot of nasty things being posted on social media these days but there’s a difference between offensive and defamatory. Will the police and MCMC be able to tell the difference between the two? In the UK, there had been several cases of users being jailed for being offensive. What do you think of this MCMC Act amendment? Will it make Malaysians more responsible online or will it suppress our freedom of speech?[ SOURCE 2, IMAGE CREDIT ]"
Arif Lee,Huawei seems to have trademarked the word “MateBook”.

Huawei has apparently gone to great lengths to put ownership on a name that we’d never expect. This comes after news that Chinese tech conglomerate will be entering the PC market in the near future. Supposedly, making a hybrid device that’ll rival the Microsoft’s Surface and other PC-makers’ 2-in-1s.PCs are making a comeback, no not those big towers but ultrabooks and convertibles. But what hopes does Huawei have on entering the market that has been established for so long? And what operating system will they settle for?Earlier rumours detailed that it might be a dual-boot system that’ll have both Windows and Android but no one has offered anything like that out of the box. We’re not entirely convinced that will happen but it’s plausible that it’ll be offered in two OS options like how Xiaomi has just done with the Mi Pad 2.Entering a new market is an ambitious decision and the branching out from networking and telecommunications devices, something that Xiaomi did really early on. They’ve made air purifiers, TVs, routers, and etc. Huawei focuses on the telco side of things, providing network solutions and the works. Of course, to most of the world they’re known for the smartphones they put out but in those markets mentioned earlier, they’re really big too.We’re going to see more Mate(s) than we have ever before. If this trademark is anything to go by and April will be the month to watch out for when Huawei’s factories will apparently start churning out these computers.The market is already so saturated and unless Huawei makes something that changes it all, they might fail in getting the attention of customers who’d rather trust established brands. Not all times have trademarked terms came to something so it could just mean Huawei is setting aside a just-in-case if they were to release a laptop of some sort.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"
Rory Lee,OPPO F1 hands-on and first impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/oppo-f1-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"oppo,oppo f1,oppo f1 first impressions,oppo f1 hands on,oppo f1 hands on malaysia,oppo f1 launch,oppo f1 malaysia,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-01-21,"OPPO plans to take over the midrange smartphone market one selfie at a time with their latest smartphone the F1. OPPO are so committed to the selfie abilities of this smartphone that they’ve even hired “Selfie Ambassador” Nora Danish to demonstrate just how powerful this device is at taking selfies.
Let’s start with the build. If you’ve been following our coverage of the OPPO F1, I’m sure you would have noticed how similar this device is with the OPPO R7 series. It so happened we had an OPPO R7s on hand so we placed the two devices side by side. Quickly, which device is which?Honestly, besides the size and the back firing speaker grille, these two devices are almost exactly the same from the back. The camera module, the flash, the two toned rear panels (because of the different materials), the feel and the rounded edges were all exactly the same. It was unreal.Since it was exactly the same, it also had the same feel in the hand as the R7s — albeit the smaller footprint — so that part didn’t feel so good. Then again, for a midrange device, you can’t really complain. Around the front, that’s a different story.The front bears enough differences to identify which is which. Opting for capacitive buttons instead of the on-screen ones on the R7s, the F1 lets you use its display to its maximum potential. Not that it had a very impressive display, but we’ll get into that later. What I did like was the rounded front edges.With the 2.5D glass set to curve slightly more and slightly later, the glass and the metal blended seamlessly into each other giving the device a nice rounded edge. It was almost iPhone 6s Plus like, so props to OPPO for acheiving the something like that on a midrange device.Beyond that, the device felt generally nice in the hand — though I would have liked it a little more if it had a slight curve, but that’s up to the individual.The OPPO F1 is powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. At the front, the device sports a 5-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) IPS panel which isn’t all that impressive. The device comes running Android 5.1 Lollipop with OPPO’s ColorOS 2.1 running on top. The device draws juice from a 2,500 mAh battery and also has support for dual-SIM (Micro+Nano) although since it’s a hybrid set up you will have to sacrifice a microSD slot for the second SIM.Performance was pretty decent. It didn’t lag when switching between applications (though there weren’t many applications pre-installed to begin with) and it handled what little multitasking I threw at it. I’m not particularly a fan of the ColorOS Android skin, but some of you may like it so that’s ultimately down to personal preference. The display was okay-ish and you probably wouldn’t notice the 720p-ness unless you’re coming from a higher screen resolution.Now we get to the part everyone has been waiting for — the camera. It packs a 13-megapixel ISOCELL rear shooter with Phase Detection AF and a large f/2.2 aperture that was pretty good in the venue’s sketchy lighting. It took decent shots, but since we could only view it on a 720p screen, we won’t make any claims just yet. What everyone’s curious about is the 8MP front-facing snapper.When you think of a “selfie phone”, you’d think of something like the ASUS ZenFone Selfie which sports a massive 13MP front facing selfie shooter with autofocus and dual LED flash for RM1,049. Next to those beastly specs, the OPPO F1 that costs RM1,198 simply pales in comparison. It doesn’t even have a front facing flash — instead it relies on a “screen flash”, which basically turns your screen white and bright, to illuminate dark subjects. Probably best used in dark conditions, the screen flash did absolutely nothing in the launch venue’s dodgy lighting, but again we will have to fully test this out before we make any judgements.When you think about this phone, you can’t go at it purely from a specs perspective. If you were to do that, perhaps the ZenFone Selfie is the better device with it’s 5.5″ full HD display, but look at it. It’s chunky, it’s fat and it is very plasticky. The OPPO F1 on the other hand, is a slim thing with a great build and a premium feel. It’s rounded metal rails and smooth metallic back are awesome to run your hand across. It’s the phone for the fashionista, for someone who cares more about style and looks than pure hardware specs. Let me put it this way, could you see Nora Danish using a ZenFone Selfie?Exactly."

First you guys have to put up with apps – even mainstream ones – that aren’t updated since God knows when then you have that small ecosystem of the Windows Store. Now on top of all that, it seems like that Windows 10 Mobile release for older phones isn’t coming this month.This is based on a twitter exchange between a user and a French telco, Bouygues Telecom. In the conversation, twitter user NotCassim asks if Windows 10 Mobile will be rolling out to old Lumias. The thread continues by another user stepping in and saying that another rep from the same telco told him it will be by “late February”.Microsoft has been rather mum on the subject but we’re sure they’re trying to strategise global recalls of the older-generation Surface Pros that have faulty charging bricks that supposedly catch fire in some instances.Microsoft already delayed this release once before, as earlier reports claimed that they’ll be releasing the big software update in mid-January. That has passed without a peep. You can expect Redmond to give a crap about the existing Lumias in the market, cause they’re sure to outnumber any sales of the current-generation Lumia 950 and 950 XLs that just hit our shores not too long ago.As peeved as everyone is, we’re going to recap some of the devices that’ll receive the update:Lumia 430

Or 5e. Whatever the name though, this Apple smartphone is said to have a smaller 4-inch display and should be unveiled in March. Now a video has surfaced, claiming to be the “First real 4-inch iPhone 2016” video leak, the short 40-second clip — if true — does give at least some information on Apple’s purported next product.Yeah, it looks exactly like an iPhone 6/6s. In fact, it looks so much like an iPhone 6/6s that many are calling this video a fake and that the reason it looks small-ish is because the guy manning the camera has large hands. Honestly, it does look kind of sketchy and as 9to5Mac pointed out, the speaker grille ratios were pretty similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone so that does add some credence to the “big-hands” justification.It is said that MIC Gadget has a reasonable history in obtaining devices for a hands-on ahead of time so maybe there is some truth to all of this. But, there is no way of identifying if this is actually the new iPhone 6C or if it is just a regular iPhone 6. There’s tape over many of the important identifier bits, there is no comparison with the iPhone 6/6s, and there is really nothing in the room that can tell us anything about the scale of this device.Considering how good iPhone clones have gotten, it honestly wouldn’t be too surprising if the phone in the video is actually a clone made to look like it could be the iPhone 6c. There have been many fakes in the past, some running an iOS skinned version of Android, some just flat out running Android, but it seems that there are plenty of people who can’t tell the difference:Clearly many are willing to believe anything people tell them, so perhaps this guy is banking on the gullibility of society? Who knows. What we do know is that you shouldn’t believe everything someone tells you. So, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt.What do you think of this device and its “hands-on” video?

Weeks after being announced at CES 2016, Razer’s first “smartwatch” is now available on our shores. The manufacturer has not had a lot of luck in the wearable segment, with their first, the Razer Nabu X falling short of expectations.But will, this time, be any different?The device would suit any rough and tough individual that needs something that can handle a few knocks here and there. Using a digital Chronograph watch face, the Nabu wearable has a 5 ATM water resistance rating and will be durable enough to withstand drops from 5 metres.It uses a regular backlit display that you can find on other digital watches and has the following (typical) features an alarm, stopwatch, world time. Yet, they stay updated by syncing through Bluetooth when paired with your phone – ensuring your watch is always accurate.Its second OLED screen is where things get “smarter” and when you raise your wrist into view, it’ll turn on automatically. On that screen, you’ll be able to see phone notifications on a single-line. As you would on those left to right scrolling text.Since it’s a fitness watch, you’ll also have activity data on the same secondary display. Although Razer wants to go the fitness route, they left out an optical heart-rate monitor which would’ve added a nice touch.When considering power sources, the two displays rely on different battery sources:The main backlit display draws life from the average coin cell battery that’ll have Razer quoting a 12-month battery life.The secondary display needs a charge every seven days and will be plugged via a proprietary USB cable.The smartwatch will be compatible with Android and iOS devices. Two version will be available on Razer’s online store. The Razer Nabu Watch will go for RM 749 while the fancier looking Razer Nabu Watch Forged Edition will cost RM 999.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

We rely on them for nearly everything under the Sun when on the Internet. They’re some we hate – Internet Explorer – and some we love (Google Chrome). What makes the difference? Mainly the load times between sessions and thankfully, Google has been busy baking their new compression algorithm, Brotli since September of last year. What in the world is this Brotli? That’s their new formula that’ll make Chrome 26% faster and save more data while browsing on 3G/4G LTE.Taking over existing Zopfli, the yet to be released algorithm is now fresh out the oven and is expected to roll out in an update very soon. It’s a lot of jargon to comprehend how Brotli’s new data format makes a difference; to simplify the minimising, the compression size makes it easier for your devices to utilise space and speed up load times of pages. This will take place across all platforms from mobile to PCs, so that means using it while connected to your cellular data will be less strenuous on battery life and data limits. Mass adoption has already begun with Mozilla also said to be using Brotli in the future.While most of the times Chrome is bundled into Android’s platform, those who love who have limited data caps usually rely on Opera Mini.The team at Opera somehow managed to squeeze the living daylights out of pages with their high and extreme data saving modes that has saved many users from hitting their throttled speeds.It’ll be interesting how Chrome’s new compression matches up.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

The team in Mountain View assures that the vulnerability isn’t all that serious after all.Malware attacks have been a monthly problem towards the back-end of last year but, at least, this time, most Android users won’t have much to worry about. And for the rest, a patch has been issued.When announced that 66% of Android devices out there could easily be bugged, there was a real frenzy. But no one gave Google a chance to explain its side of things. Google highlights that any device that runs Android 5.0 or later is protected by an added security layer dubbed Android SELinux policy.On the other hand, the older smartphones out there which run Android 4.4, the particular Linux kernel 3.8 code wasn’t used at the time. Ahh, we can hear a worldwide sigh of relief from our office. Either way, Google wants to make sure that there are no oversights and are releasing a patch as we speak. You can expect this OTA on your devices very soon.The original discovery found that “CVE-2016-0728” allowed third-party apps to access data in the OS’ keyring and encrypt it afterwards so it can’t be accessed by the user. Once exploited, the malicious apps would be allowed to reign terror outside the controlled environment of the sandbox and gain control of the operating system’s root functions.A more thorough explanation of the Android coding environment, you can check out our post here.[ SOURCE.

We’re all dying to know the specs of Samsung’s latest flagship. Most of them have one thing in common, they all say that it’ll be either an Exynos 8890 or Snapdragon 820 processor under their hoods.Benchmark experts AnTuTu have reaffirmed that they’ll indeed be an Exynos 8890 in at least one variant of the Galaxy S7 as well as its accompanying specs.In a post on Weibo, the people behind the app have let the cat out of the bag. They posted that the SM-G930F – corresponding to a the non-edge version of the Galaxy S7 – will have 4GB of RAM and a rather decent 64GB of internal storage. Imagine having that much storage plus a potential (rumoured) microSD card slot? Malaysians are gonna lap this up.Other internals were also detailed, like a 5.1-inch 2560 x 1440 resolution AMOLED display and a 12-megapixel rear lens. Despite there being fewer pixels on the main camera, it’s easily suggested that they’ll be using larger sensors as detailed during their BRITECELL technology showcase. On the front, it looks like a 5-megapixel sensor, possibly with the same BRITECELL tech.You won’t have to wait that long to hear more stuff on the new Samsung flagships, fortunately, MWC 2016 is happening in a month and there’s bound to be more leaks till then.In spite of AuTuTu being a benchmarking app, the makers have yet to publish “official” scores of the device. They claimed that it’s an early prototype and the results won’t do the device justice. At least, they said they might do it later, once the phone’s performance is more stable.For a look at what else the new Samsung smartphones might come with, check out this post here.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"
Rory Lee,Here’s why we think the “Indonesian Iron Man” is fake,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/heres-why-we-think-the-indonesian-iron-man-is-fake/,"fake,hoax,indonesia,indonesia robot arm,indonesian iron man,indonesian robot arm,iron man,robot arm,tony stark,cool stuff,others",,2016-01-20,"By now, I’m sure most of you have seen a video making its rounds on social media, and even 9gag, about a guy with a robotic arm that he built in a garage to help him overcome the limitations of his paralysed left hand. Sounds amazing right?Yeah, we think this sounds too good to be true. Here’s why.// <![CDATA[

// ]]&gt;I Wayan Sutawan, affectionately referred to as Tawan, suffered a minor stroke six months ago which paralysed his left arm. Because he’s a mechanic of sorts, one can imagine that having a paralysed left hand can be quite a cumbersome thing. So, rather than sit around and whine about it, Tawan set to work and in two months created a robotic arm out of spare parts he had around his workshop.He can control the robot arm via a headband around his forehead that picks up his brain signals and allows him to control the arm movement accordingly. Based on the video, not only can he lift objects and move his arm around, he can also pick up and hold on to rather delicate objects.So why do we think this miraculous feat has more in common with the Boy Who Cried Wolf than it does with Iron Man?That means the body part — the muscles, the nerve cells, the tendons and ligaments — are perfectly functional, there is just nothing telling them to move. So, if it’s the brain that can’t issue the command, how then can his “brainwave detector” — that looks like a bunch of LEDs strapped around his head with duct tape — detect the brainwaves issued by a part of the brain that no longer functions?Plus, even if that contraption around his head could pick up the brainwaves from dead/damaged braincells that can no longer issue commands via a human’s regular nervous system, where on earth did he store the processor needed to make sense of those brainwaves (or even identify the correct ones) and translate them into mechanical motor functions? How did he develop such sophisticated programming? What kind of supercomputing power is being used to digest all that data?While the motors and the hydraulics for the upper segments of the arm could possibly pass off as motors to facilitate movement, the glove that controls Tawan’s finer finger movements don’t have any actuators at all. So how could this contraption allow him to make the finger movements necessary to pick up and grip the solder in the video?Prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the brain aren’t exactly new. Take a look at this article by The Guardian on a DARPA-funded research project for robotic arms that can feel. What the scientists at Johns Hopkins university Applied Physics Laboratory did was have the electrodes from the prosthetic hand inserted into his sensory and motor cortexes so that he could not only control the hand with thought, he could also feel and sense when his “fingers” were touched.Once again, this is proof that in order for your brain to control a prosthetic arm, the necessary cortexes would have to be able to send a signal and function properly first. Another thing to note is that if a project led by the brilliant scientists of Johns Hopkins needed funding from a US military agency like DARPA to succeed, how on earth did Tawan manage to build one himself out of spare parts?What is more likely is that the man simply has a weak arm that needs some motorised help to actually function properly. In fact, if you pay close attention to his left arm when he is inserting it into his mechanical contraption, you can see his wrist flick upwards before it enters the sleeve.Everything about this story seems too sketchy to be true. The fact that a simple mechanic from a rural town could just one day up and build something so advanced from spare parts should have raised at least a few flags. Add “brainwave-controlled” to that description and you would have a beautiful script to a story designed for the big screen. You would have Iron Man actually. And Tony Stark doesn’t exist — no matter how hard Elon Musk tries.[SOURCE, 2]"

One of which is the Facebook application. It takes up a whopping amount of space in your internal storage versus something like Instagram that only uses a fraction of the amount, but because this is the only and most complete application for browsing Facebook, we begrudgingly use it.Common perception would be that the mobile browser version is always a whole lot worse than the app, but according to Android Central, that isn’t the case. Russell Holly wrote an article about how he uninstalled Facebook on his Android device and it turned out to be a better experience than he expected.That got us thinking, is the Facebook app really worth it? Well, for what we believe is the majority of FB users, we doubt it. Here are the five reasons we think Android users should ditch the Facebook application.If you’re on it for a moderate amount of time a day, you will notice that it becomes one of the biggest battery drainers on your phone. Plus, it is a performance hog too, something Russell also notes, so it will significantly slow down the performance of lower-end devices.If you’ve ever installed the Facebook app, I’m sure you’d notice the ridiculous amount of permissions they “require” to function properly. It wants access to so much of my information that I’m pretty sure the Zuck knows me better than my mom does."

Tiny in stature, this nifty projector can beam any image to surfaces around your home within short distances.Portability makes this projector the best little thing to bring around if you want to beam stills and video onto tables, walls, floors and even paper. Its ability to be powered through batteries just opens up so many doors. That and it’s really small – 81mm x 131mm x 131mm.The device requires two parts to work, the projector itself and the included wireless HDMI unit. How does it project content? Well the HDMI unit works by connecting to your media source, a PC, TV, smartphone or tablet, and it’ll wirelessly transmit the source to the projector that’ll blast it on surfaces.Resolution-wise it’ll project at an auto-focused resolution of 1366 x 768. Equip with 100 lumens brightness and capable of putting up a projection between 22 and 80 inches. When your source device is near to the actual projector, it’ll be able to pick up media from it and connect through Bluetooth (4.0) Low Energy to display media automatically.The battery is quoted at two hours of projection and it’ll take double that to charge it up fully. Sony’s projector also has built-in dual speakers for any accompanying audio in your videos. It’ll be compatible with Android (4.4 or later) or iOS 9 devices.Sony’s Portable Ultra Throw Projector will retail for ¥ 92,500 (RM 3,503) and will be released on the 13th of February in Japan.

You can also use it to authenticate Google Play as well as Android Pay purchases, but we’ve always hoped it could do more especially since Google baked fingerprint support into Android 6.0 Marshmallow itself.Thanks to the open API though, now you can use your fingerprint to lock specific apps in your phone — but there’s a catch.App locking is no new concept. It simply allows you to lock specific applications, requiring either a password or pin to access that particular app. Let’s say, your friends are the nosy bunch and the moment they get their hands on your device, they like to head into the gallery to look at all your embarrassing failed selfie attempts. Thanks to an app locker, you can stop that by protecting access to that application with an app locker. Some devices even have that natively in their Android skin, while others even allow you to lock entire folders of applications.Entering a password is so last century and developer SurpriseToYou have come up with AppLock -Fingerprint-, an app that lets you (if you’re on Android 6.0 Marshmallow) lock individual applications in your phone with your fingerprint. Although we must note the incredibly sketchy developer name. When I’m using a security app, I don’t really want it to surprise me. To use it, the app requires you to grant it three different levels of access — Apps with usage access, Draw over other apps, and Activate device administrator.Once in, it’s a simple task of choosing which application you want locked by flicking the toggle next to that specific app. Once you launch the app that you’ve locked, the AppLock -Fingerprint- overlay will draw over the app and ask for your fingerprint.But, true to the developer’s name, here’s the surprise — when that overlay pops up and “locks” your app, should you receive a banner notification from WhatsApp, the overlay drops and you have access to said “locked” app without ever inputting your fingerprint. What kind of security is this?!While the fact that this app runs on ads without a way to disable it is a little annoying, I think the far more pressing issue is the fact that you can break the “encryption” with a single banner notification. If, however, that doesn’t bother you and you’re interested in this app, you can get it from the PlayStore. Just, erm I don’t know, turn off your banner notifications in the mean time?[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

The suit comes from an influential NGO that cares for consumer interests in Netherlands, Consumentenbond aka Dutch Consumers’ Association.The group claims that Samsung has a horrible software update policy for their Android-based smartphones. They want the South Korean giant to start being more transparent in providing a relative timeline of how long these devices will be supported. Issues pertaining to Stagefright and other critical vulnerabilities were highlighted in their release.Talking about the Stagefright problem before, Samsung did say that they were going to fight software manipulation by pledging to monthly security updates over-the-air (OTA). For a further explanation of what Stagefright is, head on over here.Consumentenbond attempts of out-of-court discussions with Samsung didn’t achieve a “desired result”. Thus, the association thinks that they should be held viable and will face off with the “undisputed market leader in Android phones” in the chambers of law.A suit comes into picture after the association ran an “Update!” campaign to promote more consistent software updates from Android OEMs. Their claims aren’t baseless either, as they’ve found that an estimated 82% of Samsung smartphones in Netherlands have not received the latest version of Android in the two years after being introduced.Users have nothing to lose from this case and it’s no question that a revamp to Samsung’s upgrade policy will be greatly appreciated on all consumer fronts. In the consideration of security and privacy breaches, at least if done correctly, Samsung could tackle them swiftly by providing (more) regular updates.If the Dutch Consumers’ Association manages to put up a good fight, it could pose Samsung to rethink releasing too many devices in a year and their TouchWiz development team are probably gonna get a lot more work on their hands – plus long-term support could make their phones pricier too.These groups are not to be taken for granted and we’re assuming the EU (European Union) should take notice and demand the same things if things favour Consumentenbond in Dutch courts.Share with us your thoughts if you have a Samsung device.

Suffice to say we will be bringing you live updates from the ground on that very day.Of the two devices launched, the honor 5X is definitely the more interesting one. The 5X is honor’s answer to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, with it’s full metal build as well as rear mounted fingerprint scanner. The 5.5″ device will sport a full HD screen plus a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor — a departure from their home-grown Kirin SoCs. Nevertheless, the Snapdragon 616 will be paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage.What it does have over the Redmi Note 3 is a dedicated microSD card slot which allows you to expand that small internal memory. Because of the fact that honor ditched the hybrid SIM set up, users can use two SIM cards and the microSD storage simultaneously. It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with their EMUI 3.1 skin running over it.For camera optics, the device will sport a 13MP f/2.0 primary shooter with dual-LED flash to help out in low light conditions, as well as a 5-megapixel f/2.4 front shooter. The phone will draw power from a fairly large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0.The honor 5X is going for RMB1,099 in China (around RM730) which is only a touch higher than the Redmi Note 3’s 16GB version and the same price as the 32GB version. In Malaysia you can get an imported Redmi Note 3 (via DirectD) for under RM1,000, so the question is: How low will honor go?The honor 7 Enhanced isn’t all that different than the already good un-enhanced version which we liked a lot. The only enhancement is the fact that this device will now come with 32GB of internal storage and Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.While the bump in storage from 16GB might not be that big of a deal to some, many felt that one of the biggest problems with the honor 7 was the lack of storage space. Now with double that, this device just got a whole lot better.Besides that, this will be the first non-nexus smartphone in Malaysia to be officially sold with Android M out-of-the-box. So, you get to have all those awesome Marshmallow features to yourself.The device features a 5.2″ full HD display on the front with an octa-core Kirin 935 processor clocked at 2.2GHz paired with 3GB of RAM. Camera-wise it has a 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash. The front camera is an 8MP unit with its own front-facing flash to help with those low-light selfies.In China, the honor 7 Enhanced is going for RMB 1,999 (around RM1330) — the same price as the honor 7, with the original getting a bump down to RMB1,799 (around RM1,200) — which is quite the steal. In Malaysia, the honor 7 is priced at RM1,399 so we expect the new Enhanced version match the original’s price."
Rory Lee,Did you damage your device? Soon it’ll bleed to let you know,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/did-you-damage-your-device-soon-itll-bleed-to-let-you-know/,"bleed,car bleeding,casing bleed,color changing polymer,colour changing polymer,early damage detection,how to see tiny cracks,polymer coating,cool stuff,others","Cool stuff,Others",2016-01-20,"Sometimes, a tiny crack is all it takes to cause severe damage to an object. It’s these tiny cracks that we don’t see because they’re often impossible to spot in, for example, your car’s windscreen. However, these cracks become the first weaknesses in any object and could potentially lead to something really bad somewhere down the road.Well, a University of Illinois research has led to a polymer coating that could be an important early damage warning system, making it easier to find cracks or damage in particular objects by making them bleed.This polymer coating consists of tiny micro beads that crack open, causing a chemical reaction that will visibly highlight any damage with colour. These beads are pH sensitive so any damage will cause a colour change — from yellow to red — without the need for additional chemicals. The bigger the crack or scratch, the deeper the object will bleed as more capsules are affected.What’s good about this coating is that it works on multiple kinds of polymers that can coat metals, other polymers and even glass. Plus, they’re apparently not too expensive either, but no specific quote of a price was given. What’s more, the coating shows no sign of degradation — meaning the microcapsules will stay intact until actual cracks or damage happens.The application possibilities of this technology are endless. Since only 5% of a polymer needs to be microcapsules to have a strong damage indication ability, you can apply it to a myriad of things. While this can prove useful to big projects like rocket launches into space as well as deep sea exploration, there are also plenty of everyday products that can benefit.Off the top of my head would be your action cam/smartphone’s waterproof casing. Those things are transparent so it’s incredible difficult to find small cracks in their seal, but all it takes is a little nick to let the water in and damage your precious device.

Earlier on, users were shown the app but clicking on the link would just throw them into the Play Store, where they would have to manually click again to get an app installed.No more, says Google.At least for some. Google is currently rolling out the new feature to Android users worldwide and it’ll come in stages.To see if you’ve got the update head on over to your Google search bar and type in a name of an app.The top result should reflect the app you searched for and under its description, they’ll be an option for you to install the app right away.After clicking it, the typical permissions popup should come up and you’ll choose to accept to install. You should see something like the above.If you don’t, it’s fine, just stay calm. We haven’t got it either.This feature has supposedly gone unnoticed for a month or so but it’s only now hitting a wider reach. Android Police notes that this option should only work on the Google app, Chrome will, unfortunately, be left out. But knowing Google, they might make this common across both soon enough.Adding this feature seems to echo Google’s sentiments of being a mobile company. Making it easier for users on their mobile devices to install new apps. I’d usually find myself searching within Chrome most of the times since it allows me to open the link I click in a newer tab. The Google app doesn’t which is a bummer – hint, Google.Do let us know if you’ve managed to get it working and don’t buy into the ease of installing apps to explain why you’ve racked up purchases on the Play Store.[ SOURCE ]"

After reports of child labourers used in their acquisition of cobalt minerals for lithium batteries, it seems that Redmond will be issuing a global voluntary replacement/recall for Surface Pro charging bricks and cables.The tech giant is claimed to be making a statement this Friday (22nd January) to announce which units of the Surface Pro, Surface Pro 2 and Surface Pro 3 tablets are to be affected. But based on the Channelnomics Europe report, it’ll be the three models mentioned above that were sold in Europe before the 15th of July, 2015.Corresponding via e-mail with ZDNet, the Microsoft representative had this to say:“As a result of damage caused by AC power cords being wound too tightly, twisted or pinched over an extended period of time, a very small proportion of Surface Pro customers have reported issues with their AC power cord. We will be releasing details of how customers can obtain a free replacement cable shortly,”While using the Surface Pro 4, we never noticed any issues of this kind and our colleague hasn’t faced any either while using the Surface Pro 3. Microsoft wasn’t clear on which models but it seems that the Surface Pro 4 won’t be involved if Channelnomics Europe’s report was indeed true – since the timeline doesn’t match-up with the latest Surface Pro only hitting markets in Q4 of 2015.For those in the States, it seems the recall will be directed at the same three generation of Surface Pros but will be for those sold before March of 2015 – clarification from Microsoft’s representative.This twisted fate for the older top of the line Surface tablets has just added another pile of worry on the manufacturer’s lap. Adding to the software issues that have plagued the current-generation Surface Pro 4. They’ve got their work cut out for them.In the meantime, be sure not to put any stress on the power cables by wrapping them around the brick or tightly winding them – we know it’s messy but you don’t want a fire on your hands.The spokesperson also mentions that this voluntary recall will be global, so be sure to look out for Microsoft Malaysia’s official statement (if any) which we will cover in the future.[ SOURCE, 2 ]"
Arif Lee,Maxis now adds support for direct billing on the Google Play Store,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/maxis-now-adds-support-for-direct-billing-on-the-google-play-store/,"direct billing,google play store,google play store malaysia,google+ malaysia,hotlink direct billing,hotlink play store,malaysia google,maxis,maxis direct billing,maxis google,maxis google play store,maxis google purchase,maxis play store,play store malaysia,telco direct billing,android,industry in general,mobile apps,mobile devices,mobile os,players on the field","Android,Industry in General,Maxis,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field",2016-01-20,"Customers on the telco who have Android devices without those plastic cards in their wallets and purses have in the past had no other option but to get one, if they wanted to buy anything on the Play Store. Though now, any Maxis/Hotlink customer can easily purchase apps, in-app purchases, Google Movies, E-books and newsstand content through Maxis direct billing – credit/debit card not necessary.Users on the green-loving telco can now pay for any Play Store purchase through their monthly billings. Prepaid lines aren’t left out either with just two prerequisites you’ll need to fulfill. Maxis hopes that through the direct billing it’ll open doors to those with no credit/debit cards to now make purchases on the Play Store.We’re seeing this trend from other organisations; Digi being another telco that started this initiative in September last year. The limitations of these plastic cards are something that companies are starting to realise with WhatsApp also doing away with the need to pay for their service because of not many people having a credit/debit card.For postpaid, direct billing will be available to all customers except those using Corporate lines. Any purchases will be billed in the next bill cycle. On the other hand, prepaid users will need to make sure they are subscribed (at least) to a Monthly Data Plan of 1GB to be eligible – obviously, they’ll also have to ensure they have sufficient prepaid airtime balance as the billing is instant.These are the steps to set it up:Remember when setting up the first time, you’ll have to make sure you’re connected to a Maxis/Hotlink data network (3G/4G) and you’re able to receive SMS. That’s the only way they can detect if you’re on their network in the first place. Any purchases/downloads that follow can utilise WiFi networks without hindering your direct billing. After doing so, you won’t have to repeat the steps as Maxis direct billing will now be your default payment method for anything on the Play Store.When purchasing it’ll look something like this:It was a nice touch that they added the SMS notification for any purchase that you’ve made. There will also be an added e-mail from Google and a purchase history in Google Wallet for extra documentation. Carefully reminding you of all the money that’ll be flying away. It won’t be that bad, Maxis sets a cap of RM 200/month by default for postpaid users, ensuring that you don’t spend too much on the Play Store.In the scenario that you want to increase your limit, you can do so by contacting their customer service for help. Only principal line holders can readjust purchase limits – some useful info for users on supplementary lines.Interestingly, when using Maxis direct billing for Google Play Store purchases, you’ll be charged an additional 6% GST – added to the amount shown on the Google Play Store. But we’re not sure how this will work for users on prepaid as GST is supposed to be rebated back to you if you’re a Malaysian – you can read about it all here.Since you’ll have to pay GST while using Maxis direct billing, it makes more sense for users with credit/debit cards to use the regular card billing method, since you won’t be hit with the tax.Refunds are the typical as per Play Store policy, giving you a window of two hours to request a refund. You’ll be able to do that by going back to the purchased app and select “Refund”. If you missed the two-hour period, it’ll change to reflect “Uninstall” instead. Any late request will have to be directed to app developers, and it’ll be up to them to decide if your excuse is valid. Users will be notified via SMS if they’ve successfully got a refund.[ SOURCE ]"

LG was even apparently moving their volume and power buttons back to the side of their smartphones.While all of that were just rumours before this, now we have what looks like actual confirmation of what the device will look like as well as some of its hardware features.Android Authority received an exclusive tip from Shai Mizrachi in which they came into possession of several LG G5 diagrams showing exactly what the phone will look like on the outside as well as its dimensions. Based on the diagram, it does indeed look like the phone will have a flat design unlike that of the previous G4 and G Flex models.Besides that the diagram confirms that the G5’s volume control buttons will be placed at the side of the smartphone while the power button remains put beneath the camera module (likely where the fingerprint sensor will reside as well). It does seems kind of silly to have a clickable button at the back, but then again we’ve doubted the back button placement before and that turned out pretty well in the end.Speaking of that camera module, while it does look like a massive module, it seems that there will only be one camera at the back. Judging from the cutout in the middle plus the earlier concepts by CNet Korea, the rest of to module will be home to the dual-tone LED flash and a laser autofocus.It also looks like the G5 will indeed be thinner, taller and wider than the LG G4, measuring in at 149.4 x 73.9 x 8.2mm versus the G4’s 148.9 x 76.1 x 6.3-9.8mm.Unfortunately, while this diagram does confirm a lot about the device, there is no mention of specs or what exactly the body will be made of. If we’re going off past rumours the G5 should have a 5.7-inch QHD display plus an all metal body with a removable battery that can be slid out by popping off the bottom or top of the device.[SOURCE]"

Some of us have tried it out for ourselves first hand. It seemed like a gigantic design oversight by the South Korean electronics giant, but the solution was a simple one — don’t put the pen in backwards.Sometimes, accidents happen and it seems that Samsung has picked up on that as they’ve quietly fixed this gigantic flaw with the S Pen via a hardware modification to their newer Galaxy Note5 models. But, as there is no way of telling if your device has the fix, please don’t try this with your own device.Based on the image, it looks like Samsung have added a little lever (left) to the original circuit board which looks like it will allow users to eject the S Pen if it were inserted the wrong way. According to Phandroid’s sources, this new mechanism works beautifully despite the fact that it looks like it is being held together by some tape.We don’t think that’s how Samsung will actually hold the lever there, but if there is a fix for this issue it is pretty good news. However, since Samsung made the oversight in the first place, we’re sure many of the early Galaxy Note5 adopters must be pissed that their device doesn’t have this hardware fix.Plus, since Samsung seems to have ninja-fixed this, it doesn’t look like they want others to find out about it which is kind of a bummer. While we’d like to hope that Samsung will offer a hotfix for this problem to existing Galaxy Note5 users, we highly doubt that will be the case.Do you own a Galaxy Note5?

Evidence implies that CDM is buying this precious element used to make batteries from traders that purchase their stock from areas infamous for child labour.Click to enlargeThe subsidiary has been processing cobalt ore and selling it to suppliers from China and South Korea, that use this mineral in lithium-ion batteries found in smartphones and electric cars. In an attempt to get a response, the NGO went through the customer list of 16 conglomerates based on public data.Most deny knowledge of any such incidents going on but for Apple and Microsoft, they openly acknowledged that they were reevaluating their suppliers. at the same time, Amnesty mentions that none of the 16 companies provided enough information to successfully retrace the origins of the cobalt supply.Interviews with 87 workers (including children aged 9 to 17) helped exposed the behind-the-scenes of how our lithium-ion cells are made. These individuals spend nearly 12 hours in artisanal cobalt mines in the DRC and have been documented in photographs and video recordings. The documentation shows that the kids that are abused in this process essentially work above ground, collecting and cleaning rocks from these sites and nearby waterways.They face abhorrent conditions having to carry well above their weight, constantly abused physically and breathe in all the hazardous gas and chemicals associated with these sites that abandon safety guidelines and don’t provide protective gear. Facing the surroundings of the site, often they become ill and develop lung diseases that eventually lead to death in some cases.Click to enlargeMaking up at least 50% of the world’s cobalt supply, the DRC’s industry was previously a nation-owned corporation but that fell after the collapse of the Congolese economy in the 1990s. Now the government relies on miners specialising in the art to dig up cobalt that’s too risky for industrial mining.It takes two to clap in this situation and no matter the secrecy of this occurrences, we hope all the companies highlighted in this report does everything they can to ensure that this epidemic stops.Full report available here.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

It’s also because of the brand’s decision to start branching out into parts of Europe and launching the Mate S, honor 7, and Mate 8 among others in international markets.They’re off to a good start with a showing at CES 2016 but is dabbling in too many areas going to bite them in the butt? Chinese brands have been ambitious and their fearlessness to put the best package at an affordable price is hard to beat. Whether or not it’s ambitious to propose Huawei getting into the PC realm, they might just do it after all.Emerging rumours have mentioned that a hybrid laptop will come out of Huawei’s factories soon. They claim that it’ll be a dual-booting Windows/Android hybrid but we’re not sure anyone would bother running the two OS’ in tandem. Some assume it’ll be a Chromebook running machine and that’s more likely than a dual-boot system.Recently, their number one competitor Xiaomi released a tablet that runs either Windows or Android and this could easily be Huawei’s answer to the Mi Pad 2.

The Japanese manufacturer did a first when they put a fingerprint sensor on the Xperia Z5 series and their decision has now come back to haunt them. It’ll go on sale next month in the United States but it’ll be missing the biometric security component that’s available in other markets.And we think we know why.While quite far-fetched, the probably intentional delay of the US release of their Xperia Z5 line could mean that Sony had a chance to see if their new fingerprint sensor would be a hit or otherwise.Following which, they would take note the feedback of their side-placed fingerprint sensor, and decide if it’s worthy to risk having the power button doubles as the fingerprint scanner. Mainly because, it doesn’t work (well).When asked why they decided to pull the scanner, they simply said: “it was a business decision”.Android Authority has reached out for further clarification but has yet to hear back. Sony already has a lot on their plate and if these issues keep cropping up, they better make sure their next flagship makes the cut.This is their first run at such technology on their devices and while we could argue they should’ve perfected it before putting it out, we’ll cut them some slack. This move could be a good one, provided that they make changes to the prices to reflect the lack of a fingerprint sensor.Maybe Americans are better off not dealing with the annoying fingerprint sensor that we talked about in our review of the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual.

Despite top-of-the-line hardware, it seems the Windows 10 OS just isn’t a match for the other established mobile operating systems. But, Microsoft is not done releasing new Lumias as we now have what looks like an official date for the Lumia 650: February 1.However, there is also word that this could be the last Lumia smartphone of this year. So, Surface Phone anyone?Rendered image of the Lumia 650According to Windows Central, multiple sources have confirmed with them that February 1 will be the date that Microsoft reveals details about the device including pricing and availability. This device is said to feature a 5-inch 1280×720 pixel HD display with a quad-core Snapdragon 212 (or 200) processor with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD). It is also said to have an 8MP/5MP rear-front camera combo with an LED flash.What is interesting is that they also note that this could very well be the last Lumia device of 2016 as they said both the rumoured Lumia 850 and Lumia 750 have been cancelled in July of 2015. Then again that article also said that the Lumia 550 was cancelled, so, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt.With the abrupt cancellation of both Lumia devices, it is unlikely that Microsoft will sit on their hands and not launch any more mobile devices this year. So if there are no more Lumias what else does Microsoft have in their pipeline? A Surface Phone perhaps?An earlier report by Windows Central indicated that the much-anticipated smartphone developed by Microsoft’s Surface team — for now dubbed the Surface Phone — could see a release in the second half of 2016. The Surface lineup has always been associated with premium quality devices, so we know that this team knows what they’re doing when it comes to mobile devices. Although, they have received some flak for the Surface Book and Pro 4, but that was mostly down to the buggy software it was shipped with.This then brings us to the persisting problem that is Windows 10. One of the biggest reasons to the lukewarm reception of the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL was the fact that it is running on an operating system that just doesn’t seem ready yet. The specs are good, the camera is good, the build is…well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves there, but the software is just so unsuited for mobile usage.Unless their software game takes a significant step up where you can actually see people moving from other operating systems to Windows 10 (mobile), all the brilliant hardware in the world won’t be able to save you. Things will be even worse if you slap an exorbitant price tag on it.What do you guys think? Are you hyped to see a new Windows 10 powered phone? Or do you share our sentiments?

With all the smartphone manufacturers pursuing metal and glass bodied phones as the agreed ‘standard’ for a premium build and feel, the question becomes: Does that really give the best feel in the hand?

We already knew the wave of rumours were beginning since we’re halfway into January with MWC 2016 hot on the heels a month away.Based on numerous reports, it’s likely that Samsung will announce four devices of the Galaxy S7 series when the mobile related festivities begin in Barcelona. They’re listed as Galaxy S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge+. Reports have given a rough idea that the Galaxy S7 Plus and Galaxy S7 edge+ does indeed exist.You might have also seen postings on how Spigen accidentally started selling cases for the “supposed” four devices on amazon. You can read about it here. Honestly surprised by this (though it does explain a lot). pic.twitter.com/B7fL41qShm— Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 12, 2016Evleaks has already shown off the alleged banner that suggest that the Galaxy S7, S7 edge and S7 edge+ will make its grand opening in a month’s time. And in terms of what processors they’ll be running, leaks way back said they’ll be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and an Exynos 8890 models – usually region specific. Here’s the note that was released months back:Take note of the model numbers and see how they tally up with the Indonesian listings below:You’ve got one that uses the code SM-G930FD and another that uses SM-G935FD. So for one you can believe that at least two devices will arrive during MWC 2016. Based on model names, it seems likely these two numbers match up with the next generation of flagship Galaxys/Galaxies.The same deductions can be made based on the number that differentiates the edge variant from the regular Galaxy S# models. With the flat flagship carrying the “0” number at the end while the edged version ends with a number “5”.The lettering, on the other hand, represents the interchanging processor options – “A” for snapdragon and “F” for the Exynos chipsets. We’re referring to listings of the older Dual-SIM Galaxy S6 that used this code: SM-G920FD.So if this listing holds water, it would mean that the Indonesian market will be getting both a Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge – both Dual-SIM and both using an Exynos processor. Malaysians have a high chance of getting the same duo as well if the past is any indication.For further reading on what features and internals could make their way onto the Galaxy S7 series, head on over here.After checking the certification site, it seems that the listing has been removed. Maybe Samsung noticed and got it removed or it never existed in the first place. What we’re getting at is these are rumours and leaks so always take them with a pinch on salt.In the case that Samsung does release four devices, we’d think that would be cannibalising the Note5’s market share and that’ll definitely be unfavourable if they were to out a Galaxy S7+.

Rory Lee,WhatsApp changes business model. Now free for all,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/18/whatsapp-is-now-free/,"android,blackberry,im,instant messaging,ios,whatsapp,whatsapp fee,whatsapp free,whatsapp renewal,blackberry os,industry in general,mobile apps,mobile os","Android,Blackberry OS,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-18,"WhatsApp has finally announced that their app is going to be completely free for everyone. This is because WhatsApp realises that many of their customers did not possess credit or debit cards and were afraid of losing their access to this service.According to the company, nearly a billion people around the world rely on this app to stay in touch with their friends and family across the globe. Since this app can basically let you reach as far as there is some semblance of an Internet connection, rural folks were worried that — due to their limited to non-existent access to banking services — they would lose this connection to their loved ones.Besides that, WhatsApp has also ensured their users that they would not be resorting to third-party advertisements on their application to generate income. Instead, they’re testing tools that will allow users to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organisations that they want to talk to. Think of it as a messaging gateway for enterprises. For example, you could possibly communicate with your bank about whether a recent transaction was fraudulent or with an airline about your recent flight delay. Also imagine being able to receive TAC PIN number from your bank on WhatsApp instead of SMS. This means instant updates that could otherwise take hours — a good idea in concept at least.The thing about this is, have you ever paid for WhatsApp? Yeah sure, some of you early adopters on iOS and BlackBerry might have had to pay USD0.99 (RM4.40), but I think the rest of us haven’t paid for it once. I know I haven’t, despite all that “free-for-first-year” thing. What about you guys? How many of you have paid for WhatsApp and are annoyed with this?[SOURCE]"

Sony has just laid out its calling card and they’ll be vying the attention of tech sites at the same conference as Samsung and LG; sending out invitations for a special press conference a day after its two competitors intend to release their biggest devices of the year.But what could they release? The flagship Xperia line was just announced at IFA in September. So it couldn’t be that. What about a tablet? or the alleged bezeless Xperia C6? We’re not quite sure just yet but if they want to enter the ring with Samsung and LG – both of whom are going to release flagship smartphones – they better put something good on the show floor.If it would be a tablet, it’ll be a follow-up to the Xperia Z4 tablet and that would indeed make a (good) fuss. Sony’s tablets are no pushovers and has been a beacon of light in the disarray that is Android tablets. Their Xperia Z2 Tablet being (an early) example of how they can produce great slates and the Xperia Z4 Tablet that followed it.It’s also plausible that Sony might announce some new wearable during Mobile World Congress but to hold an event the same day as two competitors that are going to release their biggest devices of the year with a wearable seems even less likely.IFA 2015 was just four months ago and Sony can’t be too brash when it comes to refreshing their flagship Xperia Z line – we’d prefer to think as such since we’ve already advised them to use a longer product-cycle to develop something that’ll change the smartphone game.Repeating our status quo, Sony has to stop playing safe and take some risks. Change up their looks and look towards starting a new trend. They’ve got to risk it for the biscuit so to say.If they don’t, the company may start reconsidering the position of their Mobile division and the ambiguous “alternative options” cloud that hangs above them isn’t something they should play with.The Japanese company better watch out, cause if they fail to shock us positively when trying to steal that thunder from LG and Samsung, they’re going to be an afterthought we won’t bother with.For a look at what Samsung might put out, check out this post here.

Rory Lee,Huawei P9 to come in four models — one of which has a dual-camera set up,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/19/huawei-p9-to-come-in-four-models-one-of-which-has-a-dual-camera-set-up/,"android,barcelona,dual camera,huawei,huawei p9,huawei p9 enhanced,huawei p9 variants,huawei p9lite,huawei p9max,kirin 950,mwc,rumour,rumour mill,smart phone,smartphone,industry in general,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,huawei,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-01-19,"Big smartphone manufacturers seem to love adding variants to their popular devices so you can pretty much expect at least two versions of what is essentially the same smartphone (or at least under the same line) that will cater to different people’s needs. Huawei isn’t bucking this trend as new information has surfaced that they’re launching four different variants of their upcoming P9 handset — one more than last year. What’s more, the fourth device will feature a dual rear camera setup.According to a report on VentureBeat by Evan Blass, otherwise known as @evleaks, Huawei’s P9 lineup will include the regular P9, a budget-friendly P9lite, a larger P9max as well as an unnamed “feature-enhanced P9”. Although Blass noted that his source fell short of dubbing it a premium model, this enhanced P9 is said to feature a larger screen (though not as large as the P9max) more RAM, more internal storage as well as a dual 12-megapixel rear-facing camera.This isn’t new for the Chinese smartphone manufacturer however as they’ve already tried the dual-camera set up on the 2014-2015 honor 6 Plus. In fact, this new P9’s camera is supposed to be a second generation upgrade of that very dual-camera. Therefore, it will likely mean that the P9’s dual-camera will offer the same additional features afforded by the honor 6 Plus’ like post-capture refocus, simulated aperture adjustment and filter application plus what VentureBeat says will be “even more unique capabilities” as this camera concept has been further refined.Is two better than one? If our earlier leak on the upcoming LG G5 is any indication, it would appear smartphone manufacturers definitely think so, as that device is rumoured to sport not only a dual-screen setup like the LG V10 but also a dual rear mounted camera. That said, these are merely rumours as there has been no official confirmation beyond a person with alleged knowledge of Huawei so take this with a grain of salt.One thing is for sure though none of the P9 variants will feature a QHD resolution screen (2560×1440 pixels). As with all Huawei devices (except the Nexus 6P which we can all argue can be considered more of a Google device), the company feels that the slightly better screen and image quality offered by a QHD screen just isn’t worth the shorter battery life. We were pretty impressed with the Mate S’ battery life, so maybe they do know what they’re doing.As far as specs are concerned, Blass’ source didn’t reveal anything, but we did come across a device that posted a blistering score on Geekbench that we believe could be the Kirin 950-powered Huawei P9. With that kind of horsepower and now a dual-camera, suffice to say we’re excited.Despite all of this information and anticipation, Blass indicates that Huawei will not launch these smartphones during the Barcelona Mobile World Congress’ timeframe, choosing instead to give them a dedicated launch several weeks after MWC. However, it is said that Huawei is expected to unveil a Surface Book-like 2-in-1 in Barcelona next month but there are unfortunately no details on this product for the time being.[SOURCE]"

He’s earned billions by making business decisions in his own companies and thinks he’s the best man to seek business advice from. In this case, the way Apple’s manufacturing system operates.Speaking to an audience at Liberty University earlier today, Mr Trump as he’s so fondly referred to on the Apprentice, shared some of his insights on how to make Apple more American. We’re not talking about Apple Pie here.Imposing his good-sense, he began by suggesting businesses who produce goods out of the country should be hit by a 35% tax for putting their factories overseas. This is the same man who supposedly supports free trade. The front-runner for the Republican Party ended by saying:“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers in this country instead of other countries.”Remember, this man has a net worth of an estimated 4.5 billion USD and he’s built an empire worthy enough to shout about but what about Apple? Well, the Cupertino-based outfit achieved sales over US$ 200 billion, with a net profit of US$ 45 billion and have assets accumulating to that of US$ 260 billion. So who really has the bigger piggy bank here?To suggest that Apple throws aside deals with Foxconn (full list here) and others is just plain silly. Regardless if Trump were to become President or not, he’d have to push for new legislations that allow him to have those fundamental powers in the first place.It’s a given that Apple utilises overseas supply partnerships because other parts of the world simply have bigger factories, a larger workforce and overall bigger set up. The makers of the iPhone outsource their labour and manufacturing because it maximises profit.Trump is not shy to make outlandish remarks every typical day while on stage but for him to do this would require a method to penalise these companies. To the extent that he’ll have to convince them America match China’s production capabilities – in its own, requires a lot of funding and implementation.Sure, if Apple decided to be more-American (if there’s ever such a thing), it would spur the local economy – more jobs will be available, worker conditions would likely be better than that of Foxconn’s and you’ll get “Made in America” on devices.You can watch the whole segment below:Skip over to 1:05:00 when Trump makes his appearance on stageLet us know what you think of the latest remarks made by the potential Presidential candidate in the comments below.[ SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

A reliance of our cars might rise since fuel prices are lower than usual but knowing markets, they could easily balloon again. Despite cheaper petrol, most car manufacturers upped their price-points, toll prices and public transport has raised their prices too and well… let’s just say it’s going to be tough getting here and there with our economy being the way it is.Considering all the factors, Uber Malaysia has decided to make their uberX rides more affordable.Kuala LumpurBringing some joy to Uber riders, they’ve revised the Klang Valley fares to reflect the breakdown above.Previously, those riding on uberX were charged at RM1.50 for base fare followed by RM0.30/minute and RM0.60/KM. So they’ve lowered the base fares by RM0.55 and decreased the per minute cost from RM0.30 to RM0.25. Per kilometer pricing has remained at RM0.60.Uber thinks that lowering prices would, in turn, make more people use it – pretty much a given but they hope this will bring better remuneration for the people behind the wheel of Uber cars too.They’ve given a comparison table of the old and the new fares  in between points and how much the prices have decreased. For short distances, this translates up to 50% less compared to the previous rate.At the same time, they’ve dropped prices for uberX rides in Penang and Johor as well.PenangPreviously, those riding on uberX in Penang were charged at RM1.50 for base fare followed by RM0.30/minute and RM0.60/KM. So they’ve lowered the base fares by RM0.60 and decreased the per minute cost from RM0.30 to RM0.25. Per kilometer pricing has also been reduced to RM0.55.That’s roughly a 15% decreasing in overall pricing.Johor BahruPreviously, those riding on uberX in Johor were charged at RM1.50 for base fare followed by RM0.20/minute and RM0.60/KM. So they’ve lowered the base fares by RM0.50 and per kilometer pricing has also been reduced to RM0.50. But increased the per minute cost from RM0.20 to RM0.25.The above is a comparison table of the old and the new fares  in between points and how much the prices have decreased for those in Johor. It works out to about 15% cheaper fares. Relying on data from their case study in New York, they saw a gradual growth of partner driver earnings once they dropped prices every year. In the span of 3 years (2002 to 2015) they make Uber rides cheaper by 30% and following the trend was driver earnings.True enough, once prices dropped, drivers were busier and they spent their hours more efficiently. More trips, less idle times means more money.Hey, after all, the people ferrying us here and there deserve to be earning a good wage too and it doesn’t hurt us one bit. Let’s hope Uber can maintain standards and keep both riders and drivers happy.You can download your Uber app at these links for iOS and Android.[ SOURCE, 2, 3 ]"

That was back when the iPad Pro was officially released and has seen many tech sites talk about the typing experience that Logitech offers.If you threw down some serious Ringgit on an iPad Pro, many have suggested this to be the best keyboard option (out of only two keyboards currently available). It’s also more affordable than Apple’s own option which battles us. Apple’s version has keys that are covered by a nylon fabric while Logitech’s is more robust (725 grams) and made out of plastic.The CREATE Keyboard case makes use of the dedicated Smart Connector on the iPad Pro for connecting the two together. Using this technology allows the keyboard to be thin and light as it doesn’t require inbuilt power, drawing that from the Apple tablet it attaches to. This is similar to the technology on the Surface Pro 4.Typing on this keyboard, in theory, should be a good experience as it uses full-size 19mm keys with a key travel of 1.5mm. Each individual key is backlit ensuring you won’t be lost when typing in low-light.Because it is backlit, you’ll have to keep in mind that it’ll draw more power and you’ll have to manually turn the backlighting off when you’re using the iPad Pro while the keyboard is attached. However, it does auto wake and auto sleep when you shut the case, saving battery when doing so.On the keyboard itself, you’ll find an iOS shortcut keys that’ll allow easy navigation through iOS 9. Some of the shortcuts include changing volume, play/pause for music and video, home button, search and etc. More special keys mean you’re less likely to touch the screen and that’s fit nicely with Tim Cook’s suggestion that the iPad Pro will replace a laptop – we don’t think it will, not even close but at least, it’ll help his “reasoning”.Built in a way that makes it adjustable to two angles, users are allowed to orientate it in a manner that eases their interactions with the tablet: typing and viewing mode, as they refer to it. Logitech puts an MSRP price of RM 699 (w/ GST) and you can expect to find it from Bluelogic Enterprise Sdn Bhd and MCL Bhd.At the same time, Logitech also delivered the Focus a protective case with an integrated keyboard for the iPad Mini 4. A similar typing experience with plastic keys but with fewer keys. This keyboard also has iOS shortcuts and is capable of an adjustable viewing angle within its 50-degree range. You can find it at the same retailers mentioned earlier and go for an MSRP of RM 199 (w/ GST).
Both keyboards will be available in 3 colours: black, red or blue."

Some timely information, given that last week we talked about how the iPhone 6s Plus destroys every (currently available) smartphone out there on AnTutu – Android is back with a vengeance – or at least when this unknown Huawei device comes to light.Keeping up with current rumours, it seems that the device we’re talking about is none other than the Huawei P9. It’s assumed that it’ll arrive with a home-grown Octa-core Kirin 950 processor and a Mali T880 MP4 GPU.This processor is built based on a 16nm fabrication process and it utilises 4 high-performance ARM Cortex A72 cores that can be clocked up to 2.3GHz and followed suit by 4x low power Cortex A53 cores clocked at a more efficient 1.8GHz.It’ll run the a big.LITTLE configuration, that allows that Octa-core processor to efficiently run to deliver the best performance at the optimal power consumption. Further reading about the Kirin 950 processor can be found here.Based off purported images showing a device by Huawei hitting a home-run in the multi-core test of the famous benchmark test. If the 7313 multi-core is true, you could say that the Kirin 950 processor is going to be a beast. Reports claim that together with the Kirin 950 SoC, the P9 will don the same 5.2-inch screen that its predecessor did, together with 4GB of RAM and Android 6.0 Marshmallow running the operating system show.The Kirin 950 processor beats the current chart-topper in the MediaTek Heli X20 that runs in a Deca-core format – 7037. But out of the four big guns of chipsets, the current front-runner is still (supposedly) the Exynos 8890 that’s slated to be on the Samsung Galaxy S7 devices that’ll be announced come MWC 2016. The breakdown of performance is shown in a graph provided below:Click image to enlargeWe echo the sentiments that usually when undergoing testing, manufacturers clock these processors lower to prevent complications and gradually ramp the clocked speeds once they’re happy with how the device runs – heat and all. Then again, these leaks could turn out to be fake, so be wary when seeing them.As detailed in our earlier article, the times of unbelievably fast (on paper) processors really have superseded the needs of their users. The differences are often negligible and often people barely notice them. Apps still run fine and multitasking is breezy – no matter the flagship processor that’s inside your device – at least most of the times.Do let us know your thoughts and if you’ve experienced a Kirin processor before, share with us your observations in the comments below.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA ]"

Now the word “optical zoom” may not be a term everyone recognises. Some of you might be thinking that your current smartphones can zoom jolly well, so why would you bother about this device?You see, the zoom commonly found on your smartphone camera is what people call “digital zoom” which essentially crops the image to a smaller frame and enlarges to make it seem like you’re bringing the subject closer to you. No lens movement happens within the camera module. On the other hand, conventional DSLRs and their respective lenses use “optical zoom” which works when the different elements that make up a lens move around to refract light differently, bringing the image closer to you.The biggest difference though is that when you use digital zoom to zoom in on a subject, you lose quality, because you are no longer using the full image — rather you’re only using a cropped fraction of it. Optical zoom then is the way to go if you want to zoom (but not with your feet) and you don’t want to lose image quality at the same time.If the benefits are so great, why don’t more manufacturers equip their smartphones with optical zoom? The biggest reason is size. With more than one element in your lens, the whole camera module tends to get pretty ginormous. Think Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom or the Galaxy K Zoom. However, with ASUS’s 13-megapixel camera on the ZenFone Zoom, they have used a special dual-periscope design to mount the camera horizontally across the back of the smartphone, letting them hide the camera bump with the ZenFone’s signature curved back.But, to say that this tiny lens array strapped to the back of a smartphone is on par with those on a DSLR’s lens might be pushing it. In fact, we weren’t even that convinced this whole “optical zoom smartphone” thing would work very well. So, while we were at the launch event, we came up with the brilliant idea of pitting ASUS’s camera-centric ZenFone Zoom against some of the best cameras in the market right now. And whaddya know, we conveniently had a Nexus 6P, a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ and an Apple iPhone 6s Plus with us at the time. Here’s the camera zoom shootout you’ve been waiting for."

So far, Sony has been on the short end of the stick but they were once in a very different position.This Japanese company used to be offer different designs and qualities in their smartphones. They once tried different things and were daring enough to explore angles that others didn’t. We had the CyberShot and Walkman lines from the Sony Ericsson days.

Samsung has started to ditch plastic-backed smartphones, now instead making use of more metal and glass panels – as seen on their mid-range Galaxy A series.

Even using the design on their most affordable device yet – the Redmi 3.Huawei, the other Chinese brand has refined their methods and designs to great lengths, now putting great specs and better designs to the point of creating the premium Mate S.

They aimed high with a range of 80 to 100 million devices but they fell slightly short last year. Still that’s not too bad as they haven’t even started to enter Western markets.In a post on social site Weibo, Lin Bin posts how the company managed to sell 70 million devices just last year alone. Xiaomi’s reasoning for the less than stellar was because the result comes at the time that the Chinese market is rather saturated.Eventually, their domestic smartphone market started to slow and they had to compete against Huawei, who have been ramping up brand awareness internationally with appearances at CES 2016 and launches in Europe. Huawei also took to new heights being the first Chinese manufacturer to take a crack at a Nexus device, giving them an advertising opportunity for those who’ve never heard of them.It’ll be hard for Xiaomi to replicate their own success from 2014, seeing the company’s annual smartphone sales catapult by 226% from 2013. Playing with the big boys by starting to utilise metal in their smartphones will be a tough one. The jump from “affordable and good” to “premium and worth the money” is a long stretch.But at least, they’ve already started by moving towards non-polycarbonate materials, looking at alternative operating systems and occasionally releasing more than one processor variant of a device to reach wider markets. If they maintain competitive prices, the brand could easily plaster themselves all over the world.Now it’s down to the consumers, who will have to start changing their mentality and accept that Chinese smartphones can be just as good as devices from US, South Korea and Japan. Once Xiaomi manages to find its way around Western markets then we might see their untapped potential start coming alive but they’ll have to tweak the brand’s image slightly.In the light of this, we only have one question for co-founders Lei Jun and Lin Bin.Are you okay?In all honestly, we don’t think the company has missed too many steps and hope to see them continue to improve in 2016. The Mi 5 coming in February should bring about greater things for Xiaomi and it’s only the beginning of the year.We think you’re doing (better than) okay.Do share with us your thoughts on how Xiaomi can improve their products in the comments below.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

In fact, most smartwatches suffer this same fate, which is why fitness trackers that are cheaper but still retain many smartwatch functions, like Fitbit‘s lineup, have been immensely popular.Well, Samsung wants to try their hand at shaking up the budget fitness tracker market as the company is allegedly working on a fitness tracker with a new, dare we say revolutionary, feature up its sleeve.Not only is it supposed to improve on the current tracker’s existing functions, it will add depth to fitness trackers as well allowing things like a bioelectrical impedance analysis, a detailed breakdown of organ measurements, an electrocardiogram showing electrical activity of one’s heart and a graph showing skin temperature.[SOURCE]"

The pink flagship smartphone is offered by Maxis from as low as RM93/month on its Zerolution program. Retailing at RM2,699 (with GST), Maxis Zerolution lets you own the device with no upfront payments and no interest charges on your monthly installments. The easy ownership program lets you own the Galaxy Note5 today and have the option to switch to a newer phone hassle-free after 12 months. The RM93/month installment for the device is for 24 months duration and you’ll need to top up RM30/month for the Zerolution upgrade option.

After which, we started seeing the Apple wearable start gaining traction (at least in published sales reports). They were number two, behind Fitbit – if these numbers were indeed true but with sales dwarfing that of other mainstream smartwatch brands (e.g. Samsung and Pebble), would Cupertino allow the Apple Watch to see out a longer product cycle to ensure big advancements across versions? Or will they make small refinements across generations – like we’ve seen on the iPhones with a distinctive “s” being all the difference.TechCrunch’s latest report believes it could be one or the other.Based on multiple sources, the report suggests that we could see the same Apple Watch (in essence) tieing up with designers and add-on accessory makers but no massive changes in hardware. Contradictory to the fact, other sources claim that there will be one major difference on the latest smartwatch from Apple: a FaceTime camera.An analyst from Creative Strategies, a market research firm says that dormant supply chain checks are key signs that no new Apple Watch is currently being produced.He continues by saying the cuts in component providers’ supply chains, it just doesn’t add up that a new smartwatch would be on the way – if anything, production should’ve started in the tail end of 2015 to be out by the first half of 2016. Mr Bajarin, observes that in light of this information, Apple’s product patterns might take a big shift in direction.On the software side of things, it seems to be just as quiet and that seems to just add fire to the assumption of the Apple Watch 2.0 announcement being a long way off. But then again WatchOS2 was just announced a while back, so there’s that to consider as well.Will Apple have a keynote in March? Definitely. What will unveil during that time? The Apple Watch 2.0 would be unlikely.Changing the product-cycle of the Apple Watch could bring some good after all. With smaller devices, technological advancements happen less often, because well… you can only make things so small. This extra breathing room between generations could easily bring about more hardware changes and big jumps between what our wrist companions can actually do.Whatever Apple has in the works, we’ll keep on monitoring and keep everyone updated.

The latest Redmi Note 3 Pro that runs a Qualcomm processor, instead of a MediaTek chipset – that’s not all either, they’ve upgraded the internals as well.The Redmi Note 3 Pro maintains the form factor and metal make but swaps out the MediaTek Helio X10 SoC for a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 (previously named the Snapdragon 618).Click to for a large imageIts new Hexa-core 64-bit processor is clocked at 1.8GHz coupled with an Adreno 510 GPU and allows the Redmi Note 3 Pro to support faster LTE speeds (Cat.7) and depending on telcos, it has future-proof support for VoLTE (Voice over LTE) too. The following video demonstrates the differences of VoLTE and regular call quality:Our full post on VoLTE is available here.Xiaomi ups the camera credentials of the Redmi Note 3 Pro by adding a 16-megapixel rear sensor that has an aperture of f/2.0 and PDAF (Phase detection autofocus). Bettering the non-Pro version by 3-megapixels. On the front, you’ll still find the 5-megapixel camera.Otherwise, it maintains the same spec sheet as the Redmi Note 3, keeping the sleek metal and fingerprint sensor on the Pro. Here’s a recap if you missed out; the smartphone will carry a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution display, in two different RAM/internal storage options: 2GB/16GB or 3GB/32GB. When deciding to purchase the device, keep in mind that Xiaomi still left out a microSD slot so choose the 3GB/32GB version if you have the cash. MIUI forum states that on AnTuTu’s most recent Benchmark 6.0 it registered a score of 77,592. A respectable score for a mid-range device. Those in India could see the Redmi Note 3 Pro arrive in their market soon enough, with Xiaomi starting a Redmi Note 3 Explore challenge in the country.

Rory Lee,ASUS ZenFone Zoom hands-on and first impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/14/asus-zenfone-zoom-malaysia-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"asus,asus malaysia,asus zenfone zoom,asus zenfone zoom hands on,asus zenfone zoom malaysia,asus zenfone zoom malaysia launch,zenfone zoom,zenfone zoom first impressions,zenfone zoom hands on,zenfone zoom impressions,zenfone zoom malaysia,android,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-14,"Yesterday, ASUS officially launched the much anticipated ZenFone Zoom on Malaysia and we got to spend some time with their new flagship device. Here’s what we think of it. Do note that the white unit with the black camera module is a prototype given to professional photographer Peter Tan.Of course, this device’s party piece lies in its massive camera module that dominates the back of the phone. Its 13-megapixel Panasonic SmartFSI sensor has a 10-element f/2.7-4.8 aperture lens that utilises a dual-periscope horizontal-mount design allowing it to not only have a massive 3x optical zoom, but also maintain a relatively thin form factor. Besides that the primary camera comes with other goodies like optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus and a dual-tone LED flash. To help the camera out in low light, the ZenFone Zoom comes with ASUS’ Pixel Master 2.0 technology which is renown for its low light and long exposure capabilities.If 13-megapixels isn’t enough, ASUS have bundled a Super Resolution function into the camera which allows it to take gigantic 52-megapixel photos, by stitching four 13MP shots together for more detail and clarity. While the sample shots on display (taken by Peter Tan) looked rather impressive, we would have to fully test out the functions for ourselves before making a decision.Being a camera-centric phone, the smartphone comes with dedicated camera hardware buttons — a dedicated shutter and video record button — which were awesome and tactile. The device also has equally tactile dedicated zoom keys that can double as volume rockers when not in the camera app.Zooming in and out with the keys was pretty satisfying as the phone gives you a little buzz when it hits the maximum 3x optical zoom. We did notice that launching the camera from the shutter button (which you can do by holding it down) was a little slow (maybe 2-3) seconds. Besides that, the shutter speed and time between shots were not as snappy as something like an iPhone 6s or a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+.However, it does have a complete manual mode with full manual controls that can be easily accessed via a tap of the M button located to the top of the on-screen shutter button.What we were impressed with was the macro capabilities of this device. ASUS boasts a 5cm macro focal distance and from our brief testing, you could get pretty darn close to the subject and still focus with no problems. The front camera is an average 5MP f/2.0 unit with a wide-angle lens and support for Pano Selfie.For a better understanding of this device’s cameras and what optical versus digital zoom really means, stay tuned for our camera comparison.Spec wise, the ZenFone Zoom isn’t all that different from ASUS’ previous flagship, the ZenFone 2. It has an updated quad-core Intel Atom Z3590 processor clocked at 2.5GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable (via microSD up to 64GB) storage.The smartphone also comes running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’ ZenUI running on top. It’s a shame that it isn’t a more updated version of Android but we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update. Connectivity wise, the device will have a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot and will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi.From our brief hands-on, though, the device handles itself quite well, not stuttering or lagging when switching between applications, then again with 4GB of RAM and a high-end Intel chip, this isn’t really surprising.Being a premium phone, it is definitely built well. The nice rounded metal rails were fabulous to hold in the hand and the back curved nicely to fit in our palms. The camera unit is barely noticeable, letting you believe that it could just be a normal camera. Kudos to ASUS for hiding such a beast of a lens array.ASUS says that the leather on the back of the device is real leather, not some faux nonsense, and we were inclined to believe them…until we took the rear panel off. But, when we held the panel by itself, we started to doubt their claims. That said, the stitching around the “ergonomic hump” is real as we could move the thread around.It felt flimsy and plasticky so be careful when you rip that baby off. The bump on the back to help ergonomics was interesting, to say the least, and we quite liked it since it helped a little with the ergonomics. But as most of us usually take photos with a certain finger positions (like pictured earlier), we didn’t really notice it helping much with grip. What did feel nice were once again the metal rails and those fantastic buttons.ASUS also includes a wrist strap that attaches itself to the back of the device, which is a nice touch. As a whole it was fantastic to hold in the hand and it definitely feels like the premium price you’re paying for.However, do note that from the devices on display, there was a difference between the front of the device between the black model and the white model. The black one will remind you of every other ZenFone model with that familiar chin, but the white one seems to have done away with the chin, instead moving the ASUS logo to the bottom of the device.The device is priced at RM2,099 and ASUS says that the device will be available locally at the end of January."
Rory Lee,Netflix is sick and tired of your VPN and Proxies,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/15/netflix-is-sick-and-tired-of-your-vpn-and-proxies/,"netflix,netflix blocking proxy,netflix blocking vpn,netflix malaysia,netflix malaysia proxy,netflix malaysia vpn,netflix proxy,netflix vpn,proxy,vpn,android,ios,mobile apps,mobile os,windows 10","Android,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-01-15,"Netflix recently went “global” and everyone got very excited. We’ve all heard good things about this streaming service, from the shows they have to the quality of their stream plus all the Netflix exclusives like Daredevil and Jessica Jones. It’s gotten so popular that we see it mentioned in TV shows themselves, that one time in Suits when Mike Ross wanted to piss Edward Darby off for example.But, when we took a hard look at their catalogue from our Malaysian accounts, we were quite bummed out that there were so many shows missing. Even popular comedy series How I Met Your Mother wasn’t there. So the craftier of us went ahead and used VPNs (Virtual Private Network) and proxies to mask our IP addresses and as a result, gain more access to their content.Well, it seems like Netflix has had enough of our scheming ways and has said openly that they’re putting a stop to VPN users once and for all.For those of you who don’t know what a VPN or proxy does, it basically masks your IP address, preventing a website — Netflix for example — from finding out where you are connecting from. So, with a VPN or proxy you can set it up to have the site or app detect that you’re connecting from an American IP address, for example, then the region locked site would grant you access to their content as if you were coming from the US. If you’d like a more detailed explanation you can head on over to Gizmodo’s article on how VPNs work.In short when it comes to Netflix, this allows you to bypass region restrictions and circumvent the walls Netflix have put up (because of licensing, censorship and other technical reasons) and have access to whatever content you want — something Netflix is clearly upset about.In a blog statement by Netflix Vice President of Content Delivery Architecture David Fullagar, he said that Netflix would continue to enforce content licensing according to geographical location. However, they did say that they were working on making all their content available to all their subscribers — something they anticipate being able to do.For now, though, they’re focusing on blocking proxies and ensuring that you can only access content from your own region. Although they didn’t say exactly how or when they would block the proxies aside from a vague “as technology continues to evolve and we are evolving with it” line.One possible way we could see them doing it is locking your account by credit card. For example, if you wanted to use an American account, you would have to have an American credit card, likewise, if you’re using a Malaysian credit card you can only access the Malaysian Netflix content. Although they could also take more drastic measures and force you to use your IC/identification numbers to register. Though we doubt it since it would cause some amount of hindrance to user experience. Either way, it looks like your proxy days are numbered.If you want to know more about Netflix in Malaysia, check out our list of five things you should know about Netflix Malaysia.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Keeping it powered will be a 2,900 mAh battery that has fast charging abilities.Connectivity options get an upgrade too with Cat 6 LTE capabilities in its Dual-SIM slots. It’ll have the same WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC features and the charging port is still microUSB. But at this price point, the home button will act as a fingerprint scanner.On the top of the A series is the Galaxy A7 and deservingly so with its bigger 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution Super AMOLED panel. Oddly, the Octa-core processor is still clocked to 1.6GHz but gets its RAM bumped up to 3GB. Internal storage again stays the same at 16GB but you’ll have that microSD slot if you want to expand it up to 128GB.This device also has Dual-SIM capabilities and the same connectivity options as the A5. But the battery is a larger 3,300 mAh cell to make up for the larger screen, still with fast charging. The Galaxy A7 also has a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay.It’s refreshing to see that a big name like Samsung is starting to adjust itself to markets but in a market that requires you to adapt or perish, that makes a whole lot of sense. Only thing the specs of the three devices don’t seem to match up to their competition in respective brackets.In spite of that, could you see yourself owning any of the Galaxy A series devices? Or are you going to splash a more money on the anticipated Galaxy S7(s) that are to arrive after MWC 2016? Do let us know in the comments below!"

With this new version, though, 2015’s report is the first cross-platform ranking report and my goodness was it an interesting one. While we weren’t that surprised that the iPhone 6s Plus was #1 on their list, we were shocked at how MUCH further it was from the competition. Let me give you a hint: 132k.According to the popular cross-platform benchmarker, the average score of an iPhone 6s Plus is 132,620 points, the only device to break the 100k mark in 2015.On paper, this gap doesn’t seem possible as the iPhone 6s Plus is powered by a dual-core Twister A9 chip that is clocked at a tame 1.84GHz  and a PowerVR GT7600 GPU paired with (a frankly depressing) 2GB of RAM. Comparatively, the second placed Huawei Mate 8 packs a monstrous next-gen octa-core Kirin 950 SoC — four Cortex A72 CPU cores clocked at 2.3GHz, four Cortex A53 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz and a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU — plus 4GB of RAM.Yet somehow the iPhone 6s Plus outperforms it by about 30%. It is worth noting that the top 3 performing phones all run on full HD displays so they have less pixels to push compared to their Quad-HD competitors.As we move down the ladder, we find the Samsung Exynos 7420 chipsets occupying places three to five with the Meizu PRO 5 leading the pack. Not surprising since it only runs a 1080p full-HD display opposed to the Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+‘s Quad-HD display.Just after the Samsung chips comes 2014’s iPhone 6 Plus, scoring a respectable 80,554 average score. Not bad for a 2014 phone especially if you take a look at the phones below it. Yup, in case you didn’t notice it yet we have not come across a single Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chip yet.Coming in at 7th is the first and best-performing Snapdragon 810 smartphone, the OnePlus 2. A “2016 flagship killer” got killed by a phone from 2014. Oops. Scoring an average just shy of 80,000 the OnePlus 2 edges just ahead of the Letv Le 1 Pro, Xiaomi Mi Note Pro while Google’s Nexus 6P rounds out the 10.I guess it REALLY isn’t about how much horsepower you have, it’s about how you use it. However, it is worth noting that these are average scores so the number of benchmarks ran as well as the conditions in which these benchmarks were run should also factor into the results. That said, I don’t think anything short of a nuclear war could stop the iPhone 6s Plus from running away with the crown.[SOURCE, VIA]"

We thought that nobody would be able to hold a candle to it, much less challenge it.Well, we were wrong because Lenovo came out of nowhere and swung a left hook right in the Redmi 3’s face with their new budget smartphone.Affectionately named the Lemon 3, Lenovo’s new device sports a 5-inch 1080p full HD display — which is one up over the Redmi 3’s measly 720p HD panel. On the inside, it is powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon 616 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage.In terms of camera, the Lenovo Lemon 3 packs a 13-megapixel rear sensor and 5MP front camera combo.  It also supports 4G LTE and dual-SIM functionality plus a 2,750 mAh battery all encased in a metallic body.Hoping to one-up other budget phones (as if it hasn’t already), the smartphone will have a pair of Dolby Atmos speakers. The only unfortunate thing is that they’re rear facing, instead of front facing like their Vibe K4 Note that they announced earlier. Then again, for the price of RMB699 (around RM467) we can’t really complain.Also, since it’s priced at that sweet spot of RMB699, Lenovo couldn’t have made it more obvious that this Lemon 3 was designed to slay the Redmi 3. Odd isn’t it that we’ve arrived at a point in time where there is such a thing as a “budget flagship” killer. All the better for consumers, though!The way we see it, your options are clear. Do you want a better screen plus a better set of speakers for a smaller battery, or do you want a massive battery with compromises in the other two departments. With that laser etched lattice-diamond-design-thing, we will give the Redmi 3 a slight edge for now in terms of build, but we’ll have to hold them both before we make a decision.Currently, there is no information on availability outside of China, but we will keep you posted if there are any updates. For now, do let us know what you think of this device and if you would get it over the Redmi 3 in the comments section below.[SOURCE, VIA, 2, 3]"
Arif Lee,Take your pursuit of happiness seriously with Feel: The smart mood-ring for your wrist,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/13/take-your-pursuit-of-happiness-seriously-with-feel-the-smart-mood-ring-for-your-wrist/,"ces 2016,consumer electronics show 2016,emotion tracker,emotional intelligence,emotions,feel,mood tracker,mood-ring,sentio solutions,smart emotion tracker,smart wristband,cool stuff,mobile apps,mobile devices,mobile os,smart watch","Cool stuff,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Smart Watch",2016-01-13,"Wearable technology is getting serious. We’ve already seen devices that give us psychic abilities, keep us safe, and help us hear better. The future looks great and these wearables will enable us to do things we never thought possible. But what about our feelings? Our mental state and emotional wellbeing? While slaving away trying to create a technologically able world have we forgotten a key aspect of living?Our happiness.A wearable from Sentio Solutions wants to refocus efforts and tackle our feelings. They (and I quote) want you to “Own your emotions. Hack happiness”. We all deserve to be happy after all.Mood rings were a big fad back in the 70s and it has taken four decades before we this company realised that the 70s weren’t all about afros and protests; to them, it was about emotional intelligence or EQ. If you haven’t heard of emotional intelligence, it’s basically our ability (or lack thereof) to understand and recognise emotions, allowing us to differentiate and label what we feel, before using it to think and behave appropriately.Back to the present, Feel will be today’s technological equivalent of the mood-ring. Much like other wearables, it’ll connect to your smartphone through Bluetooth and via the companion app, you’ll get real-time stats on your current emotional state.Four sensors inside the wristband allow Feel to measure and track skin temperature, blood volume pulse and galvanic skin response (tracking sweat through your skin). A whole load of gibberish to us but we’ll just nod for the name of science.The wearable looks like an adjustable rubber bracelet with sensors along its sleek surface. It’ll collect biometric readings coupled with movement tracking to gauge activity levels; then on, it’ll gather the data and illustrate it in the form of a cool graph.Looking at the visualisation, you’ll get to see when your stress levels peaked and what your moods were like throughout the day. It’ll all be personalised too, in their wellness programme that (hopefully) will allow you to be happier and constantly stay focused towards your emotional goals.Feel and its app will work hand in hand to give suggestions on how users can mediate stress and improve overall emotions – that’ll include breathing and meditation based exercises to bring you back to Earth. The app will also recommend you to “laugh more” or blow off some steam by exercising.CEO George Eleftheriou shared with Mashable that the wristband will be really helpful while battling traffic; snapping the user out of their rage by vibrating suddenly on their wrist. He claims that vibration will help calm the user – we’re not sure if this was backed by science.Those interested can expect Feel to go on pre-order in Spring 2016, with an estimated shipping and store availability in December. The wearable will come in four colours: White, Black, Turquoise and fire Red. Once in stores, it’ll go for US$ 199 (RM 872.44) but during the pre-order period, it’ll cost US$ 149 (RM 654.27).[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

In an effort to dispel its “cheap” image, the Chinese smartphone maker is adding a touch of luxury by switching from plastic to metal in their latest models. The bigger Redmi Note 3 came as a surprise, launching just months after it unveiled the Redmi Note 2. With more competition jumping into the affordable segment, Xiaomi aims to defend its spot with its latest Redmi 3 (not to be confused with the Redmi Note 3). Looking at the spec sheet alone, you’ll be amazed that this will be their cheapest phone for 2016. The hardware is a class above and the build of the phone is something you wouldn’t expect at bargain basement price. Here are 5 reasons why this is the best smartphone to get for less than RM600. The Redmi 3 packs a massive 4,100mAh capacity battery and that’s unheard of for an entry-level device. In fact, it is the biggest they have ever fitted on a Xiaomi smartphone. As comparison, its larger brother, the Redmi Note 2 has a 3,060mAh capacity while the latest Redmi Note 3 packs a 4,000mAh unit. On paper, this should give you an all day battery life and you won’t need to lug a power bank around for most users."

The LG G4 was one of the last remaining flagships to feature a removable battery and an expandable microSD slot. This is a trend that is slowly diminishing as brands are moving towards a fully enclosed design for a better look and feel.The LG G5 is said to be following the same route but new information suggests that they won’t be abandoning the needs of power users.The folks at CNet Korea has posted a render of what the new flagship could look like. Instead of a curvy shape as seen on the G Flex and G4 models, the new G5 will have a flatter design with round edges. Another radical change is the volume rocker and power buttons are now purportedly moved towards the sides.Despite having a full unibody design, the source also claims that the battery is still removable. How is this even possible? Apparently their engineers have made a mechanism that allows the bottom portion to be removed, giving you access to its battery. The lower end of the device will get a drawer-like design that helps to keep dust and water away.When we think of a full unibody design with a removable battery, we thought of the old HTC Legend that was released about 6 years ago. It had a sturdy body made from a single block of aluminum and the removable cap at the bottom gives you access to its SIM, microSD and removable battery. This was the time when HTC was at its peak.If the alleged LG G5 design is true, this is something interesting to look forward to next month. However, some LG fans might be disappointed if they are doing away with its signature rear-mounted volume and power buttons.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

If you’re looking for a smartwatch, you might want to wait for what’s coming up next.The ASUS ZenWatch 2 was spotted recently on SIRIM. In most cases, if a device gets the certification green light, we can expect it to hit the Malaysian market very soon. Announced middle of last year, the ZenWatch 2 is their 2nd generation smart watch that runs on Android Wear. To suit different wrists, it will come in two display sizes – 1.63″ and 1.45″. The front uses Super AMOLED display pushing a modest 280×280 pixels resolution and it is protected by a 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It is also water resistant with IP67 rating and the case is made of durable stainless steel. In terms of design, it looks quite similar to its first ZenWatch but it gets an extra button at the sides that’s designed to look like a crown. The ZenWatch 2 comes in an array of case colours and straps of various materials. For a touch of exclusivity, there’s even a Swarovski edition strap with studded cyrstals. As it uses Android Wear, you get access of apps, watchfaces and you can customised your own design with the ASUS FaceDesigner app. Charging the ZenWatch 2 is done via a magnetic cable that snaps underneath the watch case. According to ASUS, you can get a 50% charge to its 300mAh battery in just 36 minutes. If you need to charge on a go, there’s an optional chargeback accessory that functions as a powerbank for your watch. The obvious omission is a heart rate sensor which was included in the first version. Since the ZenWatch 2 is certified along with the Zenfone Zoom, there’s a chance that it could be announced today.

Surely this is great news for One M8 owners and paves the way for more OEMs to get Marshmallow and all the goodies that come along with.The Taiwanese company appears to be one of the first few manufacturers that have managed to get the latest version of Android up and running on their devices. Though we’re not sure what other models will receive the update as there’s no official statement from them yet.We received the tip from h_1_s that the HTC One M8 has received an OTA update earlier today; sharing with us the screenshot you’ll see after the break.To see whether your HTC has an updating waiting for you simply check manually by going to:Settings > About > SoftwareThe software update sizes in at 1.14GB and according to HTC, it’ll take an hour for the whole upgrading process to finish.Sense has been skimmed down a lot since its heavier days and the new update should probably further reduce the clutter – as promised by the twitter account of HTC USA – that promised those who bought HTC’s A9 would receive Google SW updates within 15 days. Seems like their policy has in some way trickled down to their older devices as well with Marshmallow making its way down.If you need a refresher on what will be on Marshmallow, here’s some things you can expect:Do note that images shown below are from a Nexus 6P, used as an example.App permissionsThose using HTC devices can now individually give permissions to certain apps and remove them without rendering these apps useless.Now on TapUsers can now pull information based on contextual data on their screens. E.g. a text message containing a movie title, holding down your home button will allow you to bring up Google cards related to the movie.DozeBattery optimisation is finally here and HTC users will benefit vastly from it. Marshmallow will allow your devices to go into a deep(er) sleep than usual, saving a lot of battery in the process.Don’t expect Sense to look like a Vanilla carbon copy because they’ll definitely maintain some distinctive qualities. Please share with us if you’ve managed to update your HTC devices, do let us know what model and be sure to pass along some screenshots too. We’d like to see how Sense 7 looks!Thanks to @h_1_s for the tip."
Rory Lee,Soon Google Maps can guess where you’re going and tell you how to get there faster,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/13/soon-google-maps-can-guess-where-youre-going-and-tell-you-how-to-get-there-faster/,"driving mode,google,google maps,google maps driving mode,google maps driving mode malaysia,google maps driving mode update,google maps malaysia,google maps navigation,google maps update,google maps v9.19,navigation,android,mobile apps,mobile os","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-13,"I’m sure that if you’ve travelled to work by car for some period of time, you would know most (if not all) of the logical routes to your office. The only reason we switch on navigation apps (like Waze) in the morning is to find out which is the least congested route, but doing so every morning, having to manually set your location each time can be rather cumbersome.So what if you don’t want to have to set your location each morning but still want to find out which is the least congested/fastest way to get to work on time? Google Maps has the answer.With the continuous development of Waze, it has become a fantastic navigation app and I personally use it over Google Maps, less because I feel that it is a better navigation app that Maps (which I don’t) and more because of its nifty, user-friendly features.Features like knowing where you’re going based on your history — for example, if you leave for work at 9 AM a few days in a row the app will suggest “work” the next time you fire it up at around the same time of day — as well as changing your route on the fly based on the changing traffic.That said, I do feel that the application updates the routes rather slowly (especially when it comes to congestion) and the navigation isn’t as crisp and informative as Google Maps’. Plus I really hate the way it looks and how slow it is to launch and calculate routes.With Google Maps v9.19 though, it seems that there is an alternative to that. With the acquisition of Waze by the search engine giant, Google has slowly integrated more and more of Waze’s features into their own navigation app. Now, along with a whole host of interesting new things, Google Maps has support for Driving Mode — but you’ll have to activate it first.Driving Mode isn’t what you think it means. It doesn’t convert your phone into a landscape screen that has gigantic buttons for doing simple tasks to like answering your phone calls so you won’t get distracted on the road. Instead, it guesses (based on your history) where you’re going and it gives you live updates on the traffic situation as well as the fastest routes to your destination, without the need for you to set a location beforehand.However, thanks to the comments section, users have pointed out that signing out and signing into Maps itself will trigger the feature and unlock the additional options. From there, simply hit “Add Driving shortcut” and you can access this awesome new feature.Once in you will be greeted with the new interface that shows you multicoloured roads (much like Waze) with different colours indicating different levels of congestion. You can then begin your journey or tap the screen once to bring down the menu and set your destination.Click to enlarge[SOURCE]"

Sporting a massive 3x optical zoom camera mounted at the back, this device is supposed to be the thinnest of its kind, featuring a 5mm “ultra-thin edge” thanks to the ZenFone series’ familiar curved back.It’s no one-trick-pony either as the smartphone packs a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom Z3590 processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable (up to 64GB via microSD) internal storage — plenty for all your photography needs. It also features a 5.5″ full HD display hidden under the protective arm of Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4.Enough about the performance specs though, we’re interested in that massive camera module. ASUS have mounted their 3x optical zoom glass horizontally across the back of the device allowing its thickness to be greatly reduced. The primary camera itself is a 13-megapixel Panasonic SmartFSI sensor with an f/2.7-4.8 10-element lens and a whole host of goodies like optical image stabilisation (OIS), Pixel Master 2.0, laser autofocus plus a dual-tone LED flash. If you’re worried that 13MP isn’t enough, ASUS have included a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for up to 52-megapixels per photo.Besides that, the camera boasts a 5cm macro shot distance as well as a pro-style Manual mode. The front camera is a modest 5MP f/2.0-aperture, wide angle 88-degree lens with Pano Selfie.While the device itself has nice metal rails — an improvement over the plasticky ZenFone 2 — the back is made of some kind of soft touch leather that ensures the phone is grippy even in one hand. Close to the dedicated shutter and video record button is a slight bump which helps with the ergonomics when you’re shooting pictures with this device.This smartphone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’s ZenUI skin on top. It also sports a reasonable 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS’s BoostMaster fast-charging technology. The ZenFone Zoom will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi and a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot.Being a relatively premium device, the ZenFone Zoom will come in two colours — Ceramic White and Pure Black — at a retail price of RM2,099 and will be available at the end of January."

Tech Sina sat down with Lenovo‘s Senior VP, Chen Xudong and the exec shared what’s to come for the bat-wing logoed brand.It doesn’t surprise us that the bridging of brands means that the Motorola profile will change to reflect the interest of Lenovo and Motorola – two brains in one head if you will – yet Lenovo will be the one wearing the pants in this relationship.He shared four big puzzle pieces and here they are:All Moto-branded devices will come with an embedded fingerprint sensor in 2016
Moto-branded products that launch in 2016 will be either 5-inches or larger
Moto-branded products will be designed in a way to reflect Eastern and Western needs
Moto and Lenovo’s UI will merge to create a new skin that will be available in 2017Those are some big bombs to drop so early in the year and comes during a recent period that has had many questions answered – the future of Motorola especially – which they clarified last week.Now we’ll share Android Authority’s analysis of what 2016 will mean for Moto devices.Biometric securityThe manufacturer has flirted with the idea before – on the Nexus 6 – though they scrapped it towards the end. But it was once on the telco specific (AT&T) ATRIX 4G, albeit leaning towards Lenovo’s slide-type fingerprint sensors. We haven’t seen anything similar since then but since most smartphone makers are doing so, it’s time for Moto to do the same – it’ll even fit nicely in that rear dimple.Going biggerBased on their statement last week about “Vibe” and “Moto” devices, we could’ve seen this coming. Moto will occupy the higher end and from what we’ve seen in Motorola’s trend of devices getting bigger, it’s a clear no brainer. No Moto Es will exist once they start marketing the two ranges differently with entry devices be relegated to the Vibe name.Promise of design based on market needsMotorola devices of this generation aren’t ugly, in fact, they look pretty good. The dimple is a matter of opinion but since Lenovo’s CEO has positive impressions on how they look, it shouldn’t warrant any big changes.Merging UIsWe’re not too happy about this. These days people usually buy a Motorola because its UI is almost stock and whatever they add turns out to be actually useful. Do you want them to return to the MOTOBLUR days? Google did them a favour after purchasing them, please leave that alone – we beg of you.A bulky skin would mean longer delays for updates and they wouldn’t want that – surely irking existing users familiar with the current Moto.Final thoughtsIt’s likely that more information will be available as we’ve come to know that they like to contradict their older announcements with new ones. The next card they play will allow us to get a better picture of the whole 2016 master plan, we just hope the disruption is positive.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"
Rory Lee,Leaked Xperia C6 images show a pink bezel-less device,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/12/leaked-xperia-c6-images-show-a-pink-bezel-less-device/,"android,smartphone,sony,sony mobile,sony xperia c5,sony xperia c5 ultra,sony xperia c6,sony xperia z5,sony xperia z5 pink,mobile devices,mobile os,rumour mill","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Sony",2016-01-12,"Sony‘s last flagship, the Xperia Z5 was a little hit or miss. While there were some who liked it, everyone in our office was not impressed with their “flagship”. It was a little sluggish and for a device rated so highly on DxOMark, we were quite disappointed with the camera.With a device that left much to be desired and a quiet CES 2016 showing, Sony fans must be hungry for something cool to come out of the tech giant. Well, we don’t have their new flagship for you, but here’s a pretty pink-gold (rose gold? It could just be gold with bad white balance/me being a little colour blind) Sony device.It appears all of Sony’s quietness hasn’t stopped someone from leaking what looks to be the Xperia C6 — sporting a sexy rounded bezel-less design with Sony’s trademark camera-shutter-esque power button. If you’ve been paying attention to futuristic sci-fi movies, you’ll know that bezel-less is the way to go and we were glad Sony are going one step further from the near bezel-less display that appeared on the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra from last year.That said, this doesn’t look like a C6 Ultra simply because it looks relatively small in what we’re assuming is the leakster’s hands. Unless of course he/she has gargantuan hands. Either way, if we look at the device’s designs, the good looks we’ve grown accustomed to in a Sony device are all mostly apparent with that thin body and the familiar shape. The edges are rounded like the Xperia C5 Ultra which should make it nicer to hold than the Xperia Z5 though it does seem that the device still has a flat back.There is also a distinct lack of front-facing speakers (aw man) despite all that chin and forehead sony are giving it. What’s a little unnerving is that the back panel of this device seems to be peeling off — which we hope won’t be a problem on the finished product. Sony devices have had pretty good build quality after all.The Xperia C6 is rumoured to sport a 5.5″ full HD display up front, with a 2.0GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor running on the inside. Besides that, there isn’t much information left about the device itself. I guess we’ll have to wait for the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year to (hopefully) find out more.Since it’s pink though, it could potentially tie in with an upcoming pink Sony device that the company has been endlessly teasing on their Instagram account, With, nine images teased thus far, this device’s reveal has been set for 12 January 2016 and the folks over at Xperia Blog reckon it isn’t a pink Xperia Z5.Hype?UPDATE: The new Pink smartphone from Sony is a Xperia Z5.

Rory Lee,Upgrade your Windows 8 device or be exposed to security risks,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/13/upgrade-your-windows-8-device-or-be-exposed-to-security-risks/,"ie,internet explorer,microsoft,microsoft edge,microsoft internet explorer,microsoft stops support for internet explorer,microsoft stops support for windows 8,microsoft windows 10,microsoft windows 7,microsoft windows 8,no support for windows 8,windows 8.1,industry in general,windows 10","Industry in General,Windows 10",2016-01-13,"As with all old software, Microsoft is terminating support for Windows 8, as well as older versions of its Internet Explorer (IE) web browser — IE 8, IE 9 and IE 10. This is to facilitate the push towards Microsoft’s new operating system, Windows 10. When we say terminate, we don’t mean that your Windows 8 machine will just up and die or stop working straight away, it’s just that Windows 8 won’t receive updates, security fixes and bug fixes it used to get.If you are running on Windows 8 though, don’t worry because there is a simple way around this issue.Besides the obvious upgrade to Windows 10 being one of the solutions, Windows 8 users can also upgrade to Windows 8.1, which based on their lifecycle fact sheet, will continue to receive updates for two more years until January 9, 2018. If you’ve read the horror stories of Windows 10’s ominous privacy terms and want to avoid such dangers by staying on an older version of Windows, you can now do so.As you can see, today also marks the end of Windows 7 service Pack 1’s mainstream support — but don’t worry you will still continue to receive security updates as extended support will go all the way to January 14, 2020. All you lose is the mainstream support which includes free incident support, warranty claims and fixes for non-security and security bugs, plus design changes and feature requests. Based on statistics published by Tech Crunch, 2-3% of PCs (30-40 million devices) are still running on Windows 8, while Windows 7 is said to currently be in use on 56.26% of global PCs.Why is it important to keep your system updated and within Microsoft’s support lifecycle? Well, the first and most obvious reason is security. As operating systems lose their security updates, they become vulnerable to new malware and potential attacks, which puts your information as well as your system at risk. Microsoft, via updates, patches these new vulnerabilities when they come up so that these exploitable holes are fixed. Once that support ends, you lose all protection against future vulnerabilities.Besides Windows 8, Microsoft is also terminating support for older versions of IE, urging users to upgrade either to IE 11 or Microsoft’s new Edge browser. I’ve personally never been a fan of IE because of how messy the interface is and how clunky it makes browsing feel, so it comes as a surprise to me that 20% of the desktop web browser market still uses the older versions of IE (8, 9, 10) as their daily driver. Unfortunately for those people, they will have to migrate to either the new IE 11, Microsoft Edge, or other third party browsers like Chrome or Firefox, or else they would be facing security vulnerabilities when browsing the web.Microsoft Edge, the built-in browser on Windows 10, promised much in terms of functionality and performance. Things like extensions were supposed to come to Edge to keep it up to par with browsers like Google’s Chrome but til this day, there is still no sign of those extensions anywhere. I don’t know about you guys but I definitely need my extensions.Killing off old software is nothing new, and I welcome it because not only does it allow software developers to focus on their latest and greatest product, it also allows them to free up valuable resources to focus on new projects. Resources that would otherwise go to updating and patching old software can now be redirected towards either new software or the improvement of current software.[SOURCE, 2, IMAGE SOURCE]"
Amin Ashaari,Sony took their time to find the perfect shade of pink for the Xperia Z5,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/12/sony-xperia-z5-now-in-pink-colour/,"android,light dusky pink,pink,smartphone,sony,sony mobile,sony xperia z5,sony xperia z5 dual,sony xperia z5 pink,sony xperia z5 pink colour,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2016-01-12,"Fresh for the new year, Sony has released a new pink colour for its Xperia Z5 flagship smartphone. This joins its current colours of Black, White, Gold and Green, and we are glad Sony Mobile isn’t calling it Rose Gold. Under the hood, the pink colour Xperia Z5 has the same specs as the existing models. The front gets a 5.2″ Full HD screen that’s flanked by a pair of stereo speakers. Under the hood, it gets an Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM and it comes with 32GB of on-board storage. It still accepts external expansion via microSD up to 200GB. The home button now is flush with its metal frame and it also doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. For imaging, it packs its newest 23MP f/2.0 camera with PDAF which claims to be the best camera on a smartphone as rated by DXOmark. When we compared its camera to other flagships, it doesn’t seem to be the case but it performs spectacularly well in videos despite not having an Optical Image Stabiliser. The Xperia Z5 shoot videos up to 4K with Steadyshot and it is further enhanced by Intelligent Active mode. For selfies it gets a front-facing 5.1MP shooter that supports HDR and Full HD videos. Powering the device is a 2,900mAh capacity battery which is rated to last up to 2 days on a single charge. Like its previous Xperia Z series, it is also water and dust resistant with IP68 even with its new cap-less microUSB design. According to the lead designer, picking a new colour for the Xperia Z5 is a detailed process on its on. Apparently it is a challenge to find the right shade of pink that would work well with its frosted glass and aluminium frame. They researched various sources from Sakura cherry blossom to the colours of the sky during a sunset. As a result, they finally settled on a light dusky pink that complements its current Xperia Z5 colour palette. Is this the pink phone worth waiting for?[ SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,Using iPad or iPhone during bedtime? iOS 9.3 will help you sleep better,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/12/using-ipad-or-iphone-during-bedtime-ios-9-3-will-help-you-sleep-better/,"ios 9,ios 9.3,ios 9.3 update,ipad,iphone,iphone 6s,iphone 6s plus,low blue light mode,night shift,reading mode,apple,ios,mobile devices,mobile os","Apple,iOS,iPad,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-12,"Several studies have shown that using your smartphones and tablet during bedtime could affect your quality of sleep. This is due to blue light emitted from digital screens that can cause eye fatigue. This could even cause eyesight impairment in the long run.With the upcoming iOS 9.3 update for the iPhone and iPad, Apple wants you to sleep better at night with its new “Night Shift” feature. According to Apple, Night Shift aims to make it easier for you to sleep by making the display more pleasant to your eyes. Using your device’s time and GPS, it will know when it is sunset and would gradually change the display to show warmer colours, cutting down on blue light emission. As a result, it would help to increase melatonin production naturally, a vital component to get better sleep at night. Of course, this isn’t entirely new. Most smartphones from China including Xiaomi, OPPO, Huawei and BenQ have their own low blue light or reading mode that does the same thing. The only difference is that Apple is making it automatic based on your current time.  There’s no mention if there’s an option to turn it off, but we are sure it would be important for those actually working night shifts. Apart from this low blue light mode, the new iOS 9.3 update will also introduce a multi-user feature for the iPad. This would allow several people to share a single device and the experience will be customised based on their individual profiles. Unfortunately, this appears to be catered for schools and we are not sure if they would extend this to end users as well. On top of that, the native Notes app can be secured with your fingerprints. So you can keep your private info safe and unlock them with a single tap. [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Fascinating people who talk about the chassis, drive and power-to-weight ratios of the Ferraris and Lamborghinis that they don’t own, all decked out in their respective car-branded gear.They say that the easiest way to spot that a person does not drive a Ferrari is to look for the guy wearing the Ferrari branded sunglasses/shirt. And since there are many more people who don’t own luxury cars versus people who do, car branded accessories are popping up everywhere. What’s worse is that these “accessories” are usually just overpriced versions of otherwise normal products. Slap a Rolls Royce logo on a microwave and it will probably be worth 10 times more.Bentley has the same idea, and working with luxury phone manufacturer Vertu, they’ve smacked a Bentley badge on a USD9,900 (around RM43,600) phone to create the Vertu Signature Touch for Bentley. My bank account isn’t ready for this.Vertu is renown for being the manufacturer of ultra-premium phones that usually prioritise form over function. But with their latest device, the Signature Touch, they’ve managed to combine the two aspects as it packs an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and 4GB of RAM with 64GB of internal storage under that pretty stitched exterior.The Signature Touch also has a 5.2″ 1080p full HD display with sapphire crystal glass. It also sports a 21MP rear shooter with PDAF for their rear camera while the front will have a 2.1MP selfie camera. Powering the device is a 3,100 mAh battery.So what’s the difference between this Signature Touch for Bentley versus the regular Signature Touch? Well, it has a 3D Bentley logo; two-tone Beluga and Hotspur Bentley leather with Hotspur stitching. Besides that, the Signature Touch for Bentley also features knurled side keys, a “unique” pillow rail and sound bar.I know right? Try explaining why this phone is special without sounding pretentious.Other than the potentially absurd price tag, there really is nothing too special about this smartphone that makes it a better phone than a similar flagship. It even runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop. I honestly think it looks really ugly, unnecessarily tacky and frankly quite ah beng (there is really no English word for ah beng) too.I’d like to say that this automobile-branded-regular-product-fad has gone on for way too long and things are getting out of control so we should all refrain from buying them. But, I know that somewhere out there, there is a guy sitting in his million ringgit car thinking: “Hmm, if only I had a smartphone that costs about the same as a Myvi to match my Bentley…”.[SOURCE, VIA]"

If you’re wealthy enough to splurge on multiple Apple Watches, switching from one watch to another can be a pain in the butt.Not too worry as the Cupertino company understands what Apple Watch aficionados have to go through and here’s what you can expect with the upcoming watchOS 2.2. With the new software update, users would be able to pair more than one Apple Watch on the same iPhone. This gives you the opportunity to connect an Apple Watch Sport and an Apple Watch Edition to your phone, and you can switch between them without resetting and repairing the watch. This leads to a possibility that Apple is preparing to launch its new Apple Watch 2, and it would help existing Apple Watch owners to keep both timepieces in use. Another speculation is that Apple might introduce a fitness band and it works hand in hand with the Watch.watchOS 2.2 also brings other notable changes as well. The built-in maps will let you run searches and points of information under glance. So in theory if you’re wondering what to do at a location, this feature would help to recommend cafes, restaurants and shops near you. For fitness buffs, the watch will display more detailed information on your workout including active energy burned, plus a full summary on time spent on exercising and standing. At the moment, watchOS 2.2 is only rolled out to developers and it shouldn’t take too long for them to release this to all Apple Watch users.The Apple Watch is currently priced between RM1,599 to RM80,000 in Malaysia.

Rory Lee,Xiaomi’s Mi 5 could come in both metal and glass variants,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/12/xiaomis-mi-5-could-come-in-both-metal-and-glass-variants/,"android,rumour mill,smart phone,smartphone,xiaomi,xiaomi mi 5,xiaomi mi 5 2 variant,xiaomi mi 5 glass,xiaomi mi 5 metal,xiaomi mi 5 rumour,xiaomi mi 5 two variants,xiaomi mi 5 variant,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Xiaomi",2016-01-12,"A few days ago we reported on some leaked images of what looked like the finished product of Xiaomi‘s upcoming flagship the Mi 5. The images gave us a look at the front of the device but we never got to see the back of it.Now, information has surfaced that suggests the new flagship device could feature two different variants sporting different specs and different back panels.Xiaomi is no stranger to bold choices when it comes to their products. Look at their Redmi Note series where the Redmi Note 2 and the Redmi Note 3 were wildly different — one had a full metal body and a fingerprint scanner — yet they were both launched only two months apart.Would it really surprise you then that they would do something as radical as having two different back panel/constructions on their upcoming flagship device? Well if it comes true that will definitely still surprise me.Of the two devices, the first one is purported to have curved 2.5D glass at the front and the back of the device with a metal frame. Think Samsung Galaxy S6 or Galaxy Note5. This variant is also supposed to feature a 1080p full HD resolution display with the possibility of having 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.On the other hand, the supposed second phone is said to feature an all-metal design — that means full-metal rear housing instead of curved 2.5D glass. Additionally, the device is said to have a higher QHD 2K resolution display and it could possibly house the 4GB RAM/64GB internal storage variant.Other than that, both devices should be identical — sporting a Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a suggested screen size that can range from 5 to 5.2-inches. The smartphone is also said to have a 3,600 mAh battery and become official by January 21, though sales are only expected to start on February 8.Of course, this is all just guess work based on rumours at this point and for all we know it could be the other way around. That said, this isn’t the first time Xiaomi have done two versions of the same device as the Mi Note and Mi Note Pro are essentially the same device except for the fact that the Pro variant has a more powerful processor plus more RAM and a higher resolution screen.If these rumours of the Mi 5 are true though, it would be the first time that the Chinese company have gone with two completely different back constructions on a phone. So, take this with a grain of salt.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

We need it to function but often don’t bother getting enough of it. For humans, at least, that’s a proposition that is a paradox in itself. Personally, there has never been an issue getting up from the bed but we can all nod in agreement about some people in our lives that hit that snooze button a handful of times.Often some of them never leave their pillow fort but for those who really have commitments worth getting up for, the Ruggie could be something for you.Ruggie in as the name implies, is a floor mat that doubles as an alarm clock and for it to stop ringing, you’ll actually have to get out of bed – you can’t snooze it either. How do you shut Ruggie off? You place both your feet onto the “smart” mat for a good three seconds. We’re not too sure how perceptive Ruggie is as the video doesn’t really “show” it working as advertised.After it has got to up and at em’ the alarm will shut off and start playing customisable motivational speeches and humorous phrases to get your day moving with some positivity – more of a novelty feature but it’s still nice to have – I mean, having Schwarzenegger himself give you a speech every morning to “Get to the chopaaaa/showerrrrr” would be really cool.Crowdsourcing their effort on Kickstarter, Ruggie has already surpassed its goal of US$ 50,000 in just five days. Battery powered by three AAA batteries, Ruggie will go without a battery swap for at least a year.Pledges for the “smart” rug currently start at US$ 110 ( RM 484) with shipping to Malaysia going for an additional US$ 21 (RM 92.52). The pledge gets you:One Ruggie
One USB cable for charging and transferring those motivational speeches
One Bonus EbookBefore the Ruggie came into the picture, we never thought they’d be so many quirky and innovative alarm clocks. Some require you to bust out 30 bicep curls; Clocky makes snoozers run around their bedroom to locate the wheeled alarm clock; and BanClock requires the sleeper to put actual coins into it, making a point that time is money. You can find a full list here.Whenever backing a Kickstarter project be aware that some projects are never delivered to backers, disappointing we know but it’s something we’ll have to live with. Make sure you raise any concerns in the comment section and run through the FAQs before you do so.So what do you think? Will this make its way into your bedrooms? Well if the answer is a yes there’s gonna be a long wait – Ruggie’s Kickstarter states that “deivery” (assuming they meant delivery) will only happen in September of this year.That’s a lot of snoozing till then.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Powering the processor is an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 Octa-Core unit, similar to the newly announced Redmi 3, and it gets 3GB of RAM for all your multi-tasking needs. On-board there’s 16GB of storage which can be expanded to 128GB extra with microSD. This is a Dual-SIM device that accepts a MicroSIM and Nano-SIM, but you would lose a slot if you need to use a microSD card. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP f/2.2 main camera with PDAF and it is assisted with a single LED flash. Meanwhile, the front gets an 8MP f/2.0 shooter with built-on beautification features for the perfect selfie. Keeping the lights on is a 2,500mAh battery which is slightly more than the OPPO R7 Lite and R7 models. Out of the box, the F1 runs on ColorOS 2.1 that’s based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. In Vietnam, the OPPO F1 is priced at 6,490,000 Dong, which is about RM1,270 if converted directly. As an earlybird bonus, the first 1,500 buyers will get a pair of iLike Bluetooth headset thrown in for free. The OPPO F1 is now available in Gold and we expect them to release a Rose Gold version later on. With Malaysia as a key market, they are likely to release the OPPO F1 here very soon.

Sporting a metal unibody and a massive 4,100 mAh battery, the device looks be a strong contender in the budget end of the smartphone market.The device will feature a 5″ 720p HD display with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 processor coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage running MIUI 7 out of the box. That’s bordering on mid-range territory.It will also have a hybrid SIM setup where users can choose to either run dual SIM or one SIM and a microSD card (up to 128GB) for more storage. One of its strongest selling points is the massive 4,100 mAh battery which Xiaomi says will give you an 80% improvement in talk time duration compared to its predecessor. Despite all that extra battery capacity though, it is thinner than the Redmi 2, coming in at just 8.5mm and weighing only 144g. Besides that the battery also supports 5V/2A fast charging so you can top it up in a jiffy.All of the internals will be housed inside a full-metal body — a first for the Redmi line — that has an all-new lattice design made up of 4,166 stars woven together to reflect an arrangement of diamonds. From the images, it certainly looks pretty good.Camera wise, the device will sport a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear shooter with phase detection autofocus (PDAF) which Xiaomi quotes will give you a fast autofocus time of 0.1 seconds. Selfies, on the other hand, will be taken care of by a 5MP f/2.2 snapper at the front.The Redmi 3 will be available in three fashion colours — fashion gold, fashion silver and fashion grey — plus a classic gold colour and will be priced at RMB699 (around RM470), which is the same price in RMB as the Redmi 2 before it. It will go on sale in China tomorrow (12 January 2016) on Mi.com and Tmall.

Thus lies the subjectivity of it all but when you have a majority of people who feel that your attempt is a half-hearted one, prepare for the worse – especially when a fan releases a concept and it makes your (in this case Microsoft/Windows) UI look silly.Refining Windows 10 Mobile by tackling its flaws, the concept takes a full swipe at what Microsoft outed. Redesigning the action centre, start screen and Windows 10 Store, designer Jobs Robson makes Windows look nice again.Changing out those bland coloured tiles for a more uniformed frosted glass effect to the operating system, Robson uses familiar elements that were found much earlier on Windows 7 and now seen again on desktop-based Windows systems.Utilising spacing better on Windows 10 Mobile devices, he makes some apps freely transform based on unallocated space on screens.People in the comment sections have gone off on Microsoft, saying that it’s shameful that their own designers aren’t capable of putting something like this out. Adding that Jobson should be hired and allowed to actually put this concept to work.While their Surface line has been relatively successful, their mobile division has lacked some gusto. We felt that the latest Lumia 950s, were boring and there was a high drop in quality in terms of the polycarbonate case. Apps were slow and the OS was buggy when switching between apps and menus.Our full rundown of the Lumia 950 and 950 XL can be found here.Microsoft has even delayed Windows 10 Mobile on older devices, pointing us to think that they’ve dropped the ball on the operating system. This concept could offer a lending hand but only in terms of looks, they still have a lot to do in terms of optimisation and functionality.I for one think that (this) Jobs deserves a cookie. There would be a high possibility that a Windows phone would be in my pocket if the UI looked like this. You can check out his other work here.What looks good is subjective but do you think that the concept looks better than what Microsoft originally put out?

Rory Lee,Anyone can crash your WhatsApp with the power of emojis,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/11/anyone-can-crash-your-whatsapp-with-the-power-of-emojis/,"android,emoji crash whatsapp,smartphone,whatsapp,whatsapp crash,whatsapp emoji,whatsapp vulnerability,whatsapp weakeness,mobile apps,mobile os","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-11,"WhatsApp seems to be full of vulnerabilities these days. At first, it tried to steal your banking information through a malware in WhatsApp’s update, now it seems that you can crash specific users’ apps by sending them a whole bunch of emojis.5,000 emojis to be precise.Researcher Indrajeet Bhuyan reveals that people can cause Android versions of the WhatsApp application to crash by sending them at least 5,000 emojis from the web version of WhatsApp. When a user receives the application and tries to open it, the whole app would crash.The only way to recover from that is to delete the entire conversation. Through our experimentation, it does indeed work. When we tried to open the “malicious” message, sure enough, our application crashed and we had to close and restart it before we could access the app again.However, the other conversations were unaffected by the malicious thread, so as long as you leave that conversation alone it won’t crash the application. This also works for group chats. The only way to access that conversation again is to delete the entire thread and start a new conversation with that contact.That said, if you have 4GB of RAM like we did on our Oppo R7s, you can have varying degrees of success in opening the thread again though you would have to wait awhile. This vulnerability does not extend to the iOS version of WhatsApp as the emojis only cause the app to lag, unlike a previous iOS vulnerability that relied on a specific message.Although WhatsApp does have a character limit of 6,000 — to prevent messages that the application cannot handle — it seems that this still far too many as a mere 5,000 emojis will kill the app.When talking about the potential exploits of having such a vulnerability, Bhuyan says that an attacker could be sending abusive messages to their victim, blackmailing or threatening them, then send them 5,000 emojis to crash that thread and make it so that the victim can’t access the thread for evidence again.Let’s hope WhatsApp (or Facebook) pushes out a fix for this soon before people with bad intentions catch on and start abusing this.[SOURCE, VIA]"
Rory Lee,Samsung’s modular TV is something that belongs in your space-loft,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/11/samsungs-modular-tv-is-something-that-belongs-in-your-space-loft/,"ces 2016,future tv,modular tv,moving tv,samsung,samsung future tv,samsung modular tv,cool stuff,others","Cool stuff,Others,Samsung",2016-01-11,"Besides the upward trend of putting a screen on everything, the next thing on everyone’s lips is modular. As we’ve covered stories before about small modular smartphones or modular phone cases, we thought it’d be fitting to follow up with a bigger modular device — a TV.Yup, Samsung have come up with a modular TV that can split into several different parts and dance around your wall like something you’d find in a bachelor pad from the future. If you can’t wrap your head around what I’m talking about, take a look at this short clip by Gizmodo:Pretty freaking cool. However, Mashable’s Pete Pachal does note that while all the moving around is cool and stuff, when the screens do come together, he could see the seams between the displays which we found pretty disappointing. Then again this is relatively new tech so there are plenty of kinks to work out.Another TV that Samsung had on display showcased the ability for the TV to change its aspect ratios with the modular technology. The display could rotate two sides of the screen to switch it from a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 4:3 aspect ratio in seconds. This means you can use up all of those valuable pixels for either of the popular aspect ratios, eliminating those annoying black bars. It’s pretty cool but once again Pete noted that the seam was visible.One final modular TV on display, however, showcased what is realistically the closest to a completed product — a massive 170″ wall TV that is made up of several smaller panels. Mashable notes that this is perhaps the most practical use of the modular technology, especially since the seams were not visible.Not only does it allow manufacturers to push the TV’s size to even more ridiculous proportions, Mashable notes that it also makes these monstrous TVs easier to ship because movers can break down a huge set to smaller screens.That’s cool and all but we can think of one more way to utilise these modular panels. Assuming they’re easy to remove and hot swap, parents could easily remove a section of the TV to prevent their kids from watching it when they’re being grounded or during their study sessions. In fact, you could probably remove one panel and bring it along with you on holiday to discourage thieves from nicking your precious television. Then again they’d have to have a pretty sizable moving truck to be able to ship a 170″ television in the first place.Either way, as all modular things usually are, the possibilities are almost endless. What do you guys think of a modular TV? Can you think of any other useful things it can bring to the table that your current TV set can’t? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE, 2]"

They have been posting teasers of the honor band, and it’s a sign that it shouldn’t take too long for it to get here. After its global naming contest, the band is now called the honor band z1, instead of its “honor band zero” name for the Chinese market. To recap, the honor band z1 is an affordable circular smartwatch that comes with a black and white OLED display. It is thinner than most smartwatches and it can last 3 days on a single charge. With a metallic frame and a rubber sports band, the band z1 is also water and dust resistant with IP68 rating.There are no physical buttons and the band is operated from its touch sensitive display. Compared to other smartwatches, the features are quite basic but it still offers fitness tracking capabilities including activity and sleep monitoring. Apart from being able to tell the time, it can be used for notification alerts for your calls, SMS and email. When it was announced for the European market, the band is priced at 79 Euros, which is about RM380.

And the only thing stopping it is well… you know what. Anyway, while it still hasn’t been considered illegal in some states in Malaysia, let’s take a look at the one and only “hookah-like” smartphone.Phubbers who love vaping can now finally put two and two together, making the Vaporcade Jupiter a novelty that’s worth trying – the Verge seems to think so at least when they tried it out at CES 2016. This takes the cake in a time that has most smartphone manufacturers adding features likes fingerprint sensors, dual-cameras, and even ticker displays. But you can be sure that they won’t even consider adding vape modules to their devices.Vaporcade wants to go against the grain and fit the niche that they’ve created – cellular vaping. Their first smartphone is called the Jupiter IO 3: a 3G device goes for US$ 299 (RM 1317.11). The smartphone in question will run Android KitKat 4.4 – dated but then again you’re buying it to vape not to have the best smartphone.It’ll run for 16 hours (smartphone only) with its two batteries – that’s shared to power both the phone and vape. Vaporcade intends to release a 4G model as well but that’s yet to be announced. Bear in mind the amount stated above doesn’t include the “Shuttle” – a pop on module that attaches on the top of the smartphone – those cost US$ 14.99 (RM 66.07).Vaporcade claims that the device has already passed FCC certification but we’ll have to see what hurdles they have to jump if you’re ever expected to find the Jupiter in Malaysia.We don’t condone harming your body and the effects of vaping are still up in the air but it’s crazy to think they managed to put this on a smartphone.

The device that aims to reinvent the phone with its 3 in 1 proposition – an iPod, a phone and an Internet communications device. At the same time, Apple had also dropped the word “Computer” from its company name, to better reflect its growing product portfolio that goes beyond Macs. The move of getting into the phone business was timely. Close to a billion mobile phones was sold in 2006 worldwide. That’s about 5X more than PCs, over 7X the number of MP3 players and 10X more than digital cameras at that time. Steve Jobs was targeting just 1% market share with a goal of selling 10 million iPhones for 2008. The iPhone was revolutionary back then with its full touch-screen capacitive display with its multi-touch technology. Browsing the web was smooth and there were no cluttered keys or buttons that get in the way. Steve Jobs even mocked the use of a stylus as the iPhone was intuitive enough to be used with your bare fingers. Compared to today’s iPhones, the original model was very barebones. At a time when smartphone makers are moving towards 3G, the iPhone was only a 2G device supporting up to EDGE. There was no AppStore, meaning you’re stuck with its native apps, and the common copy and paste feature was only introduced with iOS 3.0, 2 years later.At the time, many had doubts on the iPhone. The base 4GB model was priced from US$499 (RM1,746 at that time) on a 2-year contract. If you want more storage, the 8GB version was going for US$599 (about RM2096), also on contract. Even Steve Ballmer of Microsoft had a laugh about it and this was a time when Windows Mobile and Nokia Symbian phones reign supreme. When it was eventually released in 2008, Apple sold over 10 million phones, surpassing its original goal and the rest is history. For Malaysia, the first iPhone to reach here officially was the iPhone 3G via Maxis. It was priced at RM2,540 for 8GB and RM2,960 for 16GB models. Until this very day, the iPhone is still considered as the de facto benchmark for the smartphone industry. It changed the way we interact with touch-screen devices and how we consume content and services on a mobile device. However, after Steve Job’s departure, it seems that Apple hasn’t been innovating as much as before, with the competition offering compelling choices at a much competitive price point. For Steve Baller, he regretted not moving into the hardware business earlier, which saw themselves overtaken by Apple and Samsung.

Then again nothing is truly invented until Apple does it right? Now it seems that Apple is “reinventing” the smartphone by removing the headphone jack. Whether they actually choose to label it as such remains to be seen, but this bold design choice by the Cupertino company doesn’t seem to be going down well with at least 200,000 of their loyal fanbase. Well, to pacify the angry mob, Apple’s got the AirPods for you — at least we think that’s what they’re going to be called.
Motorola HintBased on 9to5Mac’s article, the AirPods looks to be exactly what the name suggests — “air” versions of Apple’s EarPods — completely wireless earbud headphones. Likely bearing a physical resemblance to the Motorola Hint, these new headphones are co-developed with Beats Electronics (which Apple acquired awhile back) and are designed to be compatible with the new iPhone 7 that is rumoured to be ditching the 3.5mm jack altogether.That’s not to say the EarPods will just die off, no, the wired EarPods are expected to be connected via the Lightning connector, a feature that has been included in iOS since 2014. The AirPods on the other hand, are expected to be sold separately as a premium upgrade to the wired in-ear headphones.9to5Mac also suspects that these earbud headphones will feature a noise-cancelling microphone system for phone  calls and communication with Siri even without Apple’s in-line microphone and remote. It would make sense, after all, they’re supposed to be built for a phone so it wouldn’t make much sense if you couldn’t make calls on them.These AirPods are suspected to come with a carrying case that will charge your wireless headphones when you’re not using them. Without which 9to5Mac estimates the headphones’ battery life at just under 4 hours on a single charge. These AirPods could also be port-less requiring you to charge them in that case.Ditching the 3.5mm jack is nothing new in the mobile phone industry, even Oppo has done it with their uber-thin R5. While Apple’s decision could be driven by the fact that they want to make the iPhone 7 thinner, it could also be because — with all these waterproof iPhone rumours floating about — having a 3.5mm jack would mean another headache when trying to make the device waterproof.When the original iPhone came out right until the iPhone 4s, the headphone jack was located at the top of the device. Since the iPhone 5’s inception, however, the 3.5mm jack has transferred to the bottom, a trend that has carried on even to the iPhone 6s of today.Apple isn’t a stranger to changing things up with their line of products; removing the optical drives from most of their computer devices was one move, changing the headphone jack placements is another. When they made the first move on the iPhone 5, it was because it apparently made more sense to have all your cables sticking out on one end of the device. People were also more inclined to placing their devices head first into their pockets — something I agree with.With their upcoming iPhone 7, Apple is looking to mix things up even more — design wise — with a waterproof body made out of a “new material” and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, opting instead to stick with either a Lightning port or a wireless Bluetooth solution. The thing is, wireless devices run on battery, and if you’re already charging your smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, tablet and over-ear headphones, do you really want to charge your earbuds too?The worst part? Having to charge your earbuds are just the tip of the iceberg. At first, Apple locks you within their app ecosystem. Then they don’t allow you to use third-party ports and connectors. Now, they don’t even want you to use third-party headphones, forcing you to stick with their proprietary ones. What about those of us who have bought a solid set of headphones with a 3.5mm jack? Are we forced to use an adapter?Apple has always made some beautiful devices, with gorgeous fit and finishes, but ever since they launched their rendition of a battery case, we’re a little worried about the new iPhone. Maybe the Smart Battery Case was a dud, the ugly apple pie you hide from your guests when they come over for dinner. A lazy oversight. For Apple’s sake, we sure hope so.[SOURCE]"

Previously leaked press renders hinted that the device would take a rather big turn when it comes to design as it looks to feature a physical button at the front. Now, new images have surfaced on Weibo of the actual device that seems to confirm that suspicion.Besides that, the device also seems to sport metal rails along the side that should lend it a more premium feel in the hand though we’re not entirely sure if the device will have an all-metal unibody though it does seem likely. The speakers look to be placed at the bottom of the device, flanking a charging port. Whether or not that will be USB Type-C port remains to be seen.Since it’s a flagship, the device is no slouch, sporting Qualcomm’s latest quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There are rumours that there will be another model sporting 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It is also said to feature a 5.2-inch 1080×1920 pixel display, but there are other rumours that it might be a quad HD display (2560×1440) instead.As far as camera optics are concerned, the device is rumoured to have a 16-megapixel rear sensor with a 13-megapixel front camera to boot. It is also said to feature a 3,600 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0.Those are some interesting specifications and design choices but do note that these are not officially confirmed so take it with a grain of salt.

Rory Lee,This is a 16-lens DSLR killer that can fit in your pocket,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/this-is-a-16-lens-dslr-killer-that-can-fit-in-your-pocket/,"16 lens camera,android marshmallow,camera,ces 2016,dslr,dslr killer,l16 camera,light l16,light l16 camera,snapdragon 820,android,cool stuff,industry in general,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-08,"This has been the hardest story I’ve ever written simply because of the way the camera looks. If you have Trypophobia, you’ve been warned!The problem with getting started on a DSLR is that you have to fork out a tonne of cash to be able to afford a decent body plus a lens. Sure some of you might say that you’re OK with the kit lens, but let’s face it, we all want a red band around our lens. Unless you’re not using a Canon device.A startup called Light is trying to change that with their L16 camera — a camera that has 16 lenses packed into a body small enough to fit in your pocket.Well, sort of. By Mashable’s estimate, the camera is about the size of three iPhone 6 Pluses stacked together. It probably won’t fit in your skinny jeans then. Nevertheless, it is still an impressive feat that they managed to cram that much tech and that many lenses into a body so small. Oh, did we mention it’s powered by a Snapdragon 820 SoC?On the hardware side of things, this camera has 16 (5x35mm, 5x70mm, 6x150mm) different prime lenses that work together to take an image. The camera sets it up in a way that — depending on your zoom and framing — 10 lenses will fire at the same time, taking different quadrants of an image. Note that Mashable says the device has 120mm lenses instead of 150mm lenses, but from the company’s video and several other sites, they say that it uses 150mm lenses.The camera then stitches the 10 images together to form a high 52-megapixel image that is should eliminate quality loss normally experienced at the fringes of a lens. These lenses don’t use any kind of fancy glass, instead, they all use f/2.4 P5 plastic lenses coupled with smartphone camera sensors. Plus, since it uses so many lenses at so many different focal lengths, Light claims that the camera has a near infinite depth of field — something you can adjust in post processing.Sporting a 5″ touchscreen paired with a Snapdragon 820 SoC and an interface based off of Android M, this device looks to bring camera and smartphone imaging technology closer together. Don’t be fooled, this doesn’t have a cellular modem so you can’t make phone calls.A best of both worlds then? We certainly hope so.News of this little guy has been floating around for quite awhile now but recently Mashable got to take a look at one of the prototypes for the device. According to them, the photo stitching on the prototype took a little while to process (it ultimately froze), with the company stating that they’re trying to get the image stitching and processing down to below 1 minute. A pretty ridiculous waiting time for a photo if you ask me.The silver lining is that the processing time is only for the 52-megapixel image, so if you want to post a quick snap on social media, the camera will generate a lower quality image for you. My nose is wrinkling in annoyance.According to Mashable, when Light compared the images between an iPhone, Canon 5D Mark III and the Light L16, they were impressed with how detailed the L16 images were but noted that there was a lot of image noise. Battery life on the other hand, Mashable says that the company ballparks it at about 400 shots.While this is a noble attempt at killing our tried and tested DSLR cameras, it seems like it is still a long way off from actually dealing the final blow. Even if the software is perfected and the device works wonderfully, we (like Mashable) believe that the DSLR will continue to live on and be the primary tool for professional photographers.For events and on-the-go photography though, we can see how this device can be very useful for the professionals thanks to it’s portability and, hopefully, stellar image quality. We will have to see how it stacks up against other compact monsters like the Sony RX100 series before jumping to a conclusion though.That said, if this device works out, it could be a great (and much cheaper, coming in at USD1,699 which is around RM7452) alternative to the DSLR for hobbyists and prosumers. Exciting stuff then![SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Did you wish it came with a slide/flip/rotate out physical keyboard? Or did you wish that Samsung made a funky strap-on keyboard like they did with their bigger models?Yes? Good news then! One2Touch have introduced the SlimType — an NFC keyboard smartphone cover designed specifically for the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. Do you want to touch it?Smartphones took the world by storm as people discovered exactly how much they could do on a tiny little device that fit in their pocket. Users began using them for instant messaging, web browsing, social media browsing and media consumption. In fact, people are using them for anything but making a call.However, productivity has been the weakest link in the smartphone’s chain, due to many reasons. First is the fact that with screen real estate that is only the size of your palm, it is quite difficult to view something like a spreadsheet, for instance. Matters are made worse when users have to type because the virtual keyboard usually takes up half the screen.Plus it isn’t very satisfying typing on a virtual keyboard — one reason why BlackBerry kept the keyboard on the PRIV. With SlimType though, it looks like you can use your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge as a productivity device.There is one major problem that we’ve picked up on, though. Have you seen it yet? Yup, it doesn’t have a kickstand.Most tablet keyboard covers either rely on the device’s built-in kickstand or they fold in some sort of elaborate manner to form a triangular base. On the SlimType though, none of those options appear to be available. We don’t know about you but a kickstand seems mighty useful when you’re trying to be productive.The keyboard doesn’t look like it has much travel or much of a mechanical feel, which makes sense since it’s a phone cover.

Rory Lee,This is the mechanical Apple Watch you’ve been waiting for,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/this-is-the-mechanical-apple-watch-youve-been-waiting-for/,"apple,apple joke,apple watch,h moser & cie,joke,smart watch,smartwatch,swiss alp watch,watch,industry in general,mobile devices","Apple,Industry in General,Mobile Devices",2016-01-08,"Have you ever looked down at your Apple Watch and thought it was simply waaay too digital? You’re not alone! Swiss watchmaker H. Moser & Cie, who are seemingly appalled by the smartwatch fad, have launched what is essentially a mechanical Apple Watch.Remember that one guy saying that the Apple Watch looked like it was designed by students? Well, this Swiss company just took making fun of the Apple Watch to a whole new level.You might have noticed that Apple’s coveted Watch has finally made its way to our shores. If you haven’t, what rock have you been living under?! While many see the Apple Watch as a marvelous piece of engineering, these Swiss watchmakers are unimpressed. So much so they told smartwatch users to “get a life” by upgrading to a mechanical watch.Oops, we’d better not show them our smartwatch buyer’s guide then.Dubbed the Swiss Alp Watch, H. Moser & Cie’s light-hearted jab at Apple comes complete with an Apple-esque product video, complete with rotating close up shots and cheesy “revolutionary” one-line product descriptions. There’s even audio of what sounds like someone taking a bite out of an apple. Kind of reminds us of the time Ikea took a jab at Apple, complete with the same type of packaging!.As amusing as this video is, the Swiss Alp Watch is certainly no joke. Besides being a carbon copy of Apple’s smartwatch, the Swiss Alp Watch comes in 18-carat white gold body that has the same dimensions as the Apple Watch.It also has a screw-in non-digital crown adorned with an M, which will power on the device with a single twist. Besides that, the watch has a see-through sapphire crystal rear case that allows you to see the watch in all its beautifully-crafted mechanical glory.As far as features are concerned, the watch (obviously) doesn’t have support for phone calls, heartbeat sensors, text messages or sketching. It does, however, show what H. Moser & Cie calls the “most valuable commodity”: The time. It will “let you reconnect with people by getting out there, meeting your friends and spending time with your loved ones”.All that intricate engineering will cost you, as the watch — which is limited to 50 units — costs a whopping USD24,900 (around RM109,000) which is a touch more than the Apple Watch Edition, which will set you back RM80,000. Okay, maybe more of a smack than a touch.Either way, this video shouldn’t be taken too seriously, as The Verge points out because H. Moser & Cie is by no means a large watchmaker. So it’s more likely that this was made simply to be a tongue-in-cheek joke than anything else. It supposedly represents the company’s “resilience” and their “ferocious desire to fight our values and traditions”, embodying everything they believe in.The important thing is that this is compatible with every device.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"
Alexander Wong,Maybank and Visa lets you make payments from your wrist,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/maybank-visa-payband-contactless-payment-malaysia/,"contactless payment,maybank,maybank payband,maybank visa payband,nfc,smart wearable,visa,visa payband,wearable,wearable payment,cool stuff,mobile devices,others","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-01-08,"Paying by cash is troublesome. You would need to keep a sufficient amount in your wallet and if you don’t have exact change, you’ll end up with bulky coins in your pocket. While Touch ‘n Go is gaining momentum in stores, here’s another way to pay without cash.Maybank together with Visa has just announced the PayBand, the first payment wearable in Malaysia. According to Visa, Malaysians are moving towards contactless transactions and they are more likely to shop at a place that accepts one. How it works is somewhat similar to the Maybank’s Visa payWave Microtag, which is a sticker that you can stick onto your smartphone. Details of Maybank’s Visa PayBand isn’t available on their site, but if it follows the same mechanism, you can make payments up to RM250 without the need of signatures or pin numbers. Think of it as a Touch ‘n Go in a wristband form and it charges directly to your credit card. In terms of acceptance, it will work with Visa PayWave terminals throughout Malaysia. Just like that PayWave enabled credit card, you would need to wave it in less than 4cm from the terminal to make a payment. This apparently is better than handing over a physical card as there’s no chance for merchants to obtain your full card details. You can learn more about its availability here.The PayBand device isn’t entirely new as Barclaycard had introduced this in the UK in wristband, keychain fob and sticker format. So if you’re going for a jog, you can stop for coffee or breakfast without carrying your wallet. We have yet to see the Payband ourselves and we are curious to know if there are offering customisable band options. With most smartphones and even smartwatches these days supporting NFC, we are still surprised that mobile NFC payments have yet to catch on in Malaysia. There were several attempts by Maxis with FastTap, in collaboration with CIMB and Maybank. Unfortunately, it was short-lived and we haven’t heard of them since. Carrying an extra band would be quite cumbersome if you’re already wearing a smartband or a smartwatch. Having SamsungPay and Apple Pay in Malaysia would be a more elegant solution don’t you think?Would you consider getting a Visa PayBand? Let us know in the comments below.[ SOURCE 2 3 ]"

Usually adopting a twice in one year refresh for their devices, Sony decided to focus instead on marketing and promoting its current generation of smartphones.And they haven’t disappointed either.Take a look at their latest video that attempts to put a dozen Xperia Z5 Compacts shooting 4K in harmony; that works out to 12 4K Sony sensors or “48K” of sheer madness.The final result? Mind blowing 360-degree views of the Les Deux Alps in France.Gape and stare in awe taking in footage from the icy slopes, snowboarders zooming down the course and the panorama views as they bask in the sun while out in the snow – yes it sounds as majestic as you think.Marking their innovative bid in creating a custom 3D printed rig just for the occasion, this breathtaking scene was more to show off their camera capabilities opposed to the prowess of Sony’s creative R&D team. But they deserve their fair share of credit.Editing this video that took place at the Rise Ski and Snowboard Festival in the French Alps, was probably a daunting task given that you could barely see any video stitching or gaps. You can also expect a lot of retouching as when we tried out the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual’s video capabilities, we weren’t too happy with the quality of the content BUT the company’s SteadyShot video stabilisation was really amazing.Just to recap, Sony’s Z5 line all carry the same 1 / 2.3-inch 23-megapixel Sony Exmor RS sensor. Its hybrid autofocus has Sony boasting about a 0.03-second speed; you’ll be able to take stills and video up to 12800 (Photo) and 3200 (Video).This would probably be a good time to grab a VR headset, you can find some of them here on our Ultimate Gadget Gift Guide. Maneuver and interact with the 360-degree YouTube video and take your time looking around.To take a look at how the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual performs, check out our camera comparison here and our video comparison here.

The Sun, a massive star that sits in the center of the solar system; once considered a deity to some, it has always played a huge part in our lives – powering our electronics included.Solar panels have been here, there and everywhere but none of them have been mounted to an action camera. Or rather someone didn’t think of it yet. Somewhat bizarre if you consider the main flaw of something so small – battery life – usually running out of juice in a couple of hours. You won’t have to worry about that anymore as Activeon has just announced its solar-powered 4K action camera.Aptly named the Solar X, this is an action camera that uses the sun to power itself. Besides having solar capabilities and being relatively the same size as a GoPro, this action cam comes with a 16-megapixel CMOS sensor at an aperture of f/2.4. If you ever want to take stills with it, it’ll manage quick snaps up to 6 frames per second.Able to shoot in 4K resolution, this camera has a 2-inch touchscreen for its menu options and checking your content. It’ll also support WiFi data transfers to Android and iOS devices; you can choose to use the mini HDMI port instead if you like.Standalone, it’ll deliver two hours of battery life, numbers that don’t amaze us by much but when you strap on its X Station solar panels, you’ll get an additional four hours of recording time. And by chance you’re having a long shooting day, fully recharging the camera using the sun will only take an hour or 80% in just half an hour with its “Burst Speed Charging”.We’d like to see more companies make use of solar power, even if they aren’t making action cameras. After all, soon enough our Earth will eventually be too environmentally imbalanced for us to live comfortably with global warming already taking place. Don’t bother telling yourself otherwise, this “theory” is legit as can be. We’ve already seen the Paris Agreement take place last year and we can only hope nations of the world can curb CO2 emissions.Before we ramble on any longer, filmmakers will have to wait until March before they can pick up the Solar X that goes for US$ 450 (RM 1,969). Thinking about it, this action camera could probably be used as a car dash cam as well. Malaysia has sunny days year around, so this is a no-brainer; more so when it’ll technically always be powered.When it arrives it’ll be compatible with 40 add-on accessories that include mounts, grips, selfie sticks, and straps; underwater goggles and a WiFi remote too. Adding that all up, it’ll probably cost a fair bit but the future is all about renewable energy; a fair price to save the Earth eh?[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

While this time the details have been all over the place, we all know that Lenovo bought Motorola away from Google in 2013. Today, news broke that Lenovo will bid farewell to the “Motorola” branding and pushing solely the “Moto” name. So they are removing a name but the entity will continue to tinker away under a division of Lenovo.One has to have a sense of humour to appreciate the different stances that took place but for once we think Lenovo and Motorola have finally sorts out their branding issues or so we hope.Back in August, this was what Lenovo decided to do as reported by Android Authority. A slight U-turn of decisions by our records but we guess it’s not easy running a company as large as Lenovo and they’re bound to make some wrong turns along the way.At least following their statements today we can conclude that brand name-wise, Motorola will cease to exist. Subsequently, any new devices under the umbrella will be sold as Moto by Lenovo or Vibe by Lenovo.So the crux of all this is, any future “Moto” device will still very much be built, designed and created by Motorola – e.g. Moto X, Moto G and Moto E – the only different being the company name that sells it. Business will go on, as usual, just the technicalities behind the “names” who sell them will differ.We already saw all of this coming since Q3 of last year but riding the “Motorola” name is really sad to see. In the light of this move, we’re going to take everyone on a trip down memory lane.[ IMAGE SOURCE ]Do you remember the powerhouse brand that created the first handheld mobile cell phone (DynaTAC) in 1973? Yupp, Motorola.Then what about the RAZR V3 flip phones that changed the game forever?

The video, while it gives us some insight into what the regular version of the device should look like, it doesn’t have any renders of the variants.Awhile back, there was some discussion on whether the S7 launch in February would see four variants (the S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge Plus) of Samsung’s new flagship. We didn’t think so, but new information has surfaced recently about the possibility of a Galaxy S7 Plus and a Galaxy S7 edge Plus being launched.Popular case manufacturer Spigen has put their Samsung Galaxy S7 cases on sale on Amazon even before the device has been launched, though the cases are not on Spigen’s website. The cases are going from USD14.99 (around RM66).What’s interesting isn’t that the cases are out — because this isn’t the first time Spigen has done this — it is that there is a case for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Plus and Galaxy S7 edge Plus. This could very well be confirmation of an earlier @evleaks post about the 4 S7 variants. While we don’t think that Samsung will be launching the S7 Plus and the S7 edge Plus in February, it also doesn’t make sense for Spigen to have the preorder for those cases so soon if Samsung weren’t going to launch their devices until the end of the year.If they do launch four of them at the same time, the devices could either be separated by region, size or even processor. However, if the devices do get separated by region like HTC’s One M9 and One M9+, we’re sure there will be many unhappy Samsung fans.That said, the images look like placeholder/rendered images because if we were to compare them to @OnLeaks’ (who is quite reputable when it comes to leaks) youtube video, you’d notice that Spigen’s model device is missing the Galaxy Note5-esque rear curves.As a recap of the specs. both the S7 and the S7 edge are said to run either their latest Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 depending on the market paired with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Good news is that that storage is said to be expandable as leaks claim Samsung is bringing back the microSD slot that was missing from their 2015 flagships.Camera wise, the Samsungs are said to have a lower megapixel count, at 12MP for the primary, but feature the Korean manufacturer’s latest BRITECELL camera technology that is said to improve low light photography and reduce the camera hump. That coupled with a rumoured f/1.7 aperture lens should see the camera do quite well in low light.The S7 should come in a 5.1″ form-factor while the S7 edge takes on the 5.5″ body. Both devices could also be waterproof,  which looks like a trend for the upcoming 2016 flagships.[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

According to OPPO, this is their new mid-range device that focuses on producing premium-quality images. As mentioned earlier, it looks like another OPPO R series that’s touched up with rounded edges along the sides. Now we finally have a clearer look thanks to a Vietnamese tech site that managed to get a proper hands-on. The OPPO F1 looks very much like an R7 but with some subtle changes on the specs and design. For starters, the front features a 5″ HD 720p display and underneath it gets a 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. From the video, it appears to be having just 16GB of storage but there’s a hybrid dual-SIM slot that accepts microSD. The rear camera is said to be a 13MP main unit with Phase Detection AF, while the front has an 8MP shooter. This is hardly any difference from its current OPPO R7 range but hopefully it gets a couple of surprises during its official reveal. The OPPO R7 was priced at RM1,598, while its lower spec R7 Lite is priced at RM1,298. If OPPO wished to make this a compelling mid-range smartphone, they would need to price it competitively against the likes of the Lenovo Vibe Shot. The OPPO F1 will be announced next month and it will be heading for Malaysia. [ SOURCE 2 ]"

That said, they added something that was missing on this mouse – RGB lighting; RGB stands for red, green and blue – making the mouse easily “camouflage-able” in whatever personalised colourway you’d desire.On the surface, aside of stripping the teal coloured accents, it remains the same 11-programmable button mouse. The removable weights are still there, allowing you to make your mouse’s weight configuration to your liking.As far as technology goes, an overhaul usually means a price jump but in this case, it’ll go for the same US$ 80 (RM 354.44) price tag on its predecessor. That’s in terms of pricing in the US but here, the MSRP is quoted at RM 279; although there’s no word on what the new mouse will go for when it arrives locally.For more info, head on over here."

Now, on Xiaomi’s official Weibo account, the company released an image confirming our suspicions.What’s more, they’ve also included a release date!Beyond that, Xiaomi hasn’t confirmed any of the other specifications but if we’re going off the TENAA entry, the device should have a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. That 5″ screen should also be a 720p HD screen and the device will likely run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.For camera optics, the Redmi 3 should have a 13MP primary camera paired with a 5MP front camera combo. On paper, this is a significant boost over the Redmi 2, pushing this into the mid-range category. We can only hope that the price will not follow suit.Popular Youtuber MKBHD once said that good phones are getting cheap while cheap phones are getting good and we share that sentiment. This is definitely something that is catching on because it seems that even Xiaomi realised they can’t continue making plasticky budget phones anymore.The only unfortunate thing is that this move to metal will most likely bring a higher price tag, which we’re sure many would frown upon.

Razer adds a regular old illuminated backlit display we’d expect on a normal watch, hands it features accustomed to on watches: alarm, stopwatch, world time but all these numbers sync through Bluetooth to ensure they’re as accurate as you can get.Nabu AppFitbit AppCompatibility will be a-okay as far as Android and iOS devices are concerned while the Nabu app looks a lot like Fitbit’s – imitation is a form of flattery, it seems.Nabu is a dual displayed smartwatch, so the secondary OLED screen will be the sole “smart feature” screen. Raising your wrist allows you activate it, enabling previews of phone notifications and activity/data tracking through its accelerometer sensors. Though it seems an optical heart-rate monitor didn’t warrant enough importance for them.You’ll also be able to share social media details easily using a shake-to-shake feature, making contact exchanges seamless and more than just a simple “introductory” while meeting someone for the first time.When considering power sources, the two displays rely on different battery sources:The main backlit display draws life from the average coin cell battery that’ll have Razer quoting a 12-month battery life.The secondary display needs a charge every seven days and will be plugged via a proprietary USB cable.Thus, if you’re a simple person that loves G-Shocks that aren’t G-Shocks, you can opt to leave the secondary display “off” and simply stick to the main one. But that defeats the purpose of a smartwatch anyway, doesn’t it?Razer’s Nabu might appeal to adventure folk who want something that looks stealthy and can take a beating. More so for fitness aficionados who go out seeking a sweat outdoors; wilderness optional.Standard EditionForged EditionGoing with the duality of things, there will be two models available, a polycarbonate body that goes for US$ 149.99 (RM 646.96) and a little while later a Forged Edition model will be released. The latter model will arrive with stainless steel buttons and the same black finish; it’ll go for US$ 199.99 (RM 868.26).In the same pricing ballpark as other smartwatches that we’ve seen, Razer has a lot of competition out there and being their second try, they’re gonna need a lot of luck.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

As announced at CES, Netflix is virtually everywhere except for China, Crimea, North Korea and Syria. Now you can enjoy binge watching TV shows from the US with having to use a VPN. Similar to iflix, you get to watch Netflix anywhere across multiple devices including your PC, mobile device, media boxes and gaming consoles. In terms of subscription, 3 options are available which varies on quality and number of simultaneous streams. Netflix starts from RM33/month for the basic plan that lets you watch on a single device in standard definition. Moving up the notch is the standard option with HD quality streaming up to 2 devices for RM42/month. For the ultimate experience in Ultra HD, you can go premium for RM51/month and it supports 4 devices. For new subscribers, you can try Netflix free for a month but you’re required to enter your credit card payment details upon signing up. If you do not wish to continue, you are able to cancel the subscription under your account settings. In terms of connectivity, Netflix recommends at least 3.0Mbps for Standard Definition, 5.0Mbps for HD and 25Mbps for UHD quality. By default, the quality is set to auto but you can change this under Playback Settings under “Your Account”. If you’re tight on data quota, Low Quality takes up about 0.3GB/hour while Medium (SD) consumes 0.7GB/hour. On the highest quality setting, it can go up to 3GB/hour for HD and a massive 7GB/hour in UltraHD.  To maximise your home’s 4K TV potential, you’ll probably need to subscribe to a Fibre Broadband plan of at least 30Mbps. In terms of pricing. Netflix is more expensive compared to iflix that costs RM96 per year (RM8/month). Furthermore, iflix is currently offered for free for TM Unifi home customers. You can learn how to activate your free iflix subscription here.To sign up, visit netflix.com or you can download the app on Android and iOS.Would you pay RM33/month for unlimited TV Shows on Netflix?

Arif Lee,This wireless charger lets you charge your phone in mid-air,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/07/this-wireless-charger-lets-you-charge-your-phone-in-mid-air/,"ces 2016,consumer electronics show 2016,cota,cota power,cota transmitter,cota wireless charger,ossia,ossia cota,ossia wireless charger,wireless charger,wireless charging,cool stuff,mobile accessories,mobile apps,mobile devices,technologies","Cool stuff,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Technologies",2016-01-07,"We love being cable free, our earphones, our chargers and other peripherals have all gone wireless in the past few years but Ossia has just revealed its freakishly cool wireless charging system that lets you charge a device in mid-air – making wireless Qi chargers look lazy and obsolete.Dubbed the Cota transmitter, this cool hub is reminiscent of Google’s OnHub, albeit a little larger. Founded in 2008, Ossia wants to hit the ground running this year by announcing that their transmitter will be in store shelves and homes by Winter of 2016 – making REAL wireless charging a thing.This won’t stop at phones, it’ll extend to other household electronics too: remote controls, security systems and even battery operated devices.The wireless charging system is rather complex and really smart at the same time. So you’ll have to place a Cota base station near the device you’d like to charge. Inside the base station is packed with tiny antennas and to get your device charging, it’ll have to be “tweaked” to include a built-in RF receiving chip. In other words, Cota transmitter plus RF receiving chip equals mid-air charging.You don’t NEED to have the chip installed inside your device and for most people Ossia’s wireless charging case lets you do the same, despite adding size. Though you should know that Ossia is trying their best to downsize the chip to make it easier for OEMs and manufacturers to place them inside devices.RF signals are sent wirelessly through the Cota chip one hundred times every second while the base stations’ tiny antennas pick them up. Detecting those signals from different angles, the base station then relays wireless RF power in the same trajectory. When the two signals meet on the same “path”, they’ll match up and wala! Wireless charging.So far Ossia envisions that by year end, they’ll get a transmitter working with a range of 10 feet. They’ll continuously work on this and the plan is to eventually release larger base stations that will be able to support charging for larger spaces.Now the tradeoffs:Charging devices at one watt through the air will make charging times four times as long compared to using a cable
Only one device can be “wirelessly” charged at a timeOssia’s tech makes a big step but it’s only the beginning, hence don’t expect Quick Charge 3.0 or VOCC-like speeds. Yet it’ll be really amazing to think that while you can’t see it, Cota is beaming power to your devices.We can already hear people making implications about these “waves” potentially causing health problems for humans and animals. Studies and research on the effects of micro/radio waves are out there and before we start mass producing something that’ll likely be everywhere, there should be some sort of testing done.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Huh?The Taiwanese company isn’t nuts (at least not this time), what they intend to do is release the (second) developer version first. Bridging the gap in the form of this in-between period, the Pre will be prototype Alpha aka the final stage before hitting consumers.Developers out there will be receiving the second-generation development kit that dials in on pushing the envelope and making the least compromises to deliver its experience. Naming it the Pre, HTC hoped that people would understand it literally – Pre as in, pre-production – and it was never supposed to exist.It’s makers and partner Valve felt that if they didn’t, they’d be letting an opportunity go to waste; passing up the front-facing camera that allows users to see what’s really happening outside the VR headset. This prevents you from stubbing your toe on an edge or bumping yourself face first into a nearby wall, saving us from a lot of accidents in our homes or anywhere else for that matter – HTC calls this room-scale technology “Chaperone” – implementing it properly should allow its users to use it for longer periods without having to remove the headset.Aesthetically it has changed a lot since first being shown off, here are some photos for comparison courtesy of Gizmodo:Vive Pre headset last yearVive Pre headset this yearController last yearController this yearFrom observations around the tech scene, they mention that the headset is now more ergonomic, making it sit easier on your face. They bumped up the foam and rubber around the Pre as well, ensuring a better fit to go along with a reworked strap system.HTC and Valve have also added that front-facing camera we talked about earlier. While the hand-controllers are revamped to make buttons easier to reach, inbuilt haptic feedback and an included rechargeable batteries.The Vive exists in a space that has Oculus, Sony, Samsung, Microsoft, Fove, Avegant and Razer all in one picture, each vying for a slice of the virtual reality pie that’ll soon exist for consumers to weigh their differences.But something that holds all of them back would be their pricing – none of them cost below US$ 200 – while some (including HTC) have yet to put a number to their products. In retrospect, we don’t expect a VR headset in everyone’s home so soon however you can bet on everyone wanting one.[ SOURCE, 1, 2, 3 ]"

With that extra real estate though, ASUS can fit a large (and fast) f/1.8 aperture lens which should let it perform well in low-light conditions.ASUS’s camera also has a ‘Parking monitor mode’ that lets the camera detect movement in front of your vehicle and automatically start recording until it detects no further movement for one minute. Coupled with a 150-degree wide-angle lens, this Reco Smart cam is shaping up to be a pretty good dash-cam.In the event of a collision, the built-in three-axis G-sensor triggers the emergency record function. It will then save the recording to the ASUS WebStorage cloud and lock it down so it won’t be deleted by accident. Besides that, the camera can also be programmed to send out an emergency text message to a designated contact.Although there is no mention of the sensor’s megapixel count, the camera supports full-HD 1080p video recording as well as real-time previews and downloads on smart devices via the Reco app. Pairing with your smart device should also be a breeze with NFC One Touch Engage. As the device is WiFi capable (802.11 b/g/n), you also get 500GB of ASUS WebStorage cloud storage for free for one year.When ASUS said that the device could also function as a portable camera, they weren’t kidding because from the looks of things, the Reco Camera is compatible with a wide range of standard camera accessories. Stuff like tripods, monopods and even lens filters (which work with 58mm diameter lenses) should fit with no problems.The only bummer is that the device comes with a tiny 720mAh battery that can only support up to one hour of 1080p video recording with the WiFi turned on. As a comparison, a GoPro Hero4 usually averages 1.5 hours of battery life at 1080p recording.You do get a decent amount of kit in the package though, including a microSD card, car charger, dual USB car charger, GPS mount holder and more. A waterproof housing for the camera is also available for purchase. For now, there is no information on availability or pricing.[SOURCE, 2]"

And while their devices have never been sleek, fancy or elegant, they’re hoping that the latest Blaze might help more people jump into the whole fitness watch scene.But this is not really a smartwatch, by definition. It doesn’t have third-party apps like other smartwatches (Apple Watch and Samsung Gear S2) out there. This niche segment that Fitbit hopes to approach could be for those who want to be fitness focused, yet not jump into a whole new world of complications associated with “smartwatches”.It’ll be interesting to see how the masses react to a more fashion-focused fitness tracker/watch, considering how Swiss (TAG Heuer and Breitling) makers have also decided to join in. Maybe the days of the analogue are over.Fitbit’s Blaze is going to do what their products do best, tracking fitness. Whether you choose to have it on your wrist 24/7, that’s pretty much up to you but you can rest easy if you decide so; it’ll monitor sleep, count your steps, track your workouts and records your heart rate throughout.If you’re unfamiliar with the whole Fitbit ecosystem, you can read about their other devices here.The actual device is modular, so the choices of bands/straps will fit pretty much any occasion – coming in the typical Fitbit elastomer, leather and stainless steel options. The brand’s devices have always been squarish, straying away from the traditional watch face but the Blaze is octogonal watch face, so it’s less cube-ish this time.Notably, Fitbit’s latest fitness tracker will feature an LED colour screen – a first for the company. Adding that makes a big change but for some reason they left out inbuilt GPS on Blaze; a key feature that differentiated their top of the line Surge tracker from its lower models.Though, it does have “connected GPS”; a fancy way of saying that you’ll need your smartphone to track distance and map out your route. They probably left this out to keep battery life at a bearable 5-days.Although, we didn’t choose to call it a smartwatch, it does have some form of notifications: call, text and calendar alerts to be precise. You’ll also be able to control your music playback options while doing all your fitness related activities.Most of the specifications are still up in the air but from what we’ve been able to gather, it’ll play nice with iOS, Android and Windows smartphones/tablets, together with PCs too. The elastomer Fitbit Blaze will retail for US$ 199.95 (RM 875.70) and come in three colours: black, blue and plum. If you want to go higher up in the looks department, you’ll have to fork out more – an additional US$ 99.95 (RM ) for the leather band and US$ 129.95 (RM ) for the stainless steel band. The new fitness tracker will be for sale internationally in March 2016.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Both have the same sapphire glass protecting the watch face (as the manlier option) but the two women models get their diameters increased to 44mm from 42mm and are overall larger.The extra bezels were probably added to make way for those crystals, I mean, they had to go somewhere right? Granting all this, the straps for these two models get slimmed down to 18mm, so it “might” look better suited for ladies when they put it on; we sure hope so.Its AMOLED screen size remains the same on the two, even with all that extra bling on the Jewel – at 1.4-inches (400 x 400 resolution).

When I look around at my friends, more than half of them have more well-defined abs than I do life goals.To fulfill this desire to track health and fitness, tech companies have launched a myriad of fitness bands, trackers and applications designed to keep you as well informed about your body as possible. But while most of those devices existed as individual elements, none were truly unified.At least, that’s what HTC and Under Armour said when they launched their brand new ‘fitness system’ that costs USD400 (around RM1751).You must be thinking, you’d get a lot of gear right? Well, that depends on your definition of ‘a lot’. What we do know is that with the UA HealthBox, you will be receiving three devices — a fitness band, a smart scale and a heart-rate monitor.Dubbed the UA Band, this fitness band is designed to be worn all-day every day because it tracks daily activities, workout and sleep. Under the band’s “seamless exterior shell” is a display which is “discreetly hidden” allowing it to disappear when not in use. While we don’t know how hidden they wanted the screen to be, from the pictures (even their product shots) it certainly looks like it’s well hidden enough to be a nightmare to view under sunlight.The UA Band also features an advanced workout mode with a display that stays on during the workout as well as an LED that indicates heart rate zone when paired with the heart rate monitor. Wow, a screen that stays on!Next, we have the UA Heart Rate — a compact heart rate monitor that is designed to be undetectable during workouts. It is also supposed to help individuals monitor intensity and train smarter while providing an accurate calculation of calories burned. How refreshing, a heart rate monitor that actually does all this accurately!Finally, we have the UA Scale. It’s a smart scale that is “beautifully crafted” and WiFi enabled in an “iconic circular design”. This scale also has a hidden LED display that makes the technology invisible when not in use. It also looks like there is a “nifty” feature where they show you a bunch of logos, greet you and only after they’ve done all that do they show you your weight. Perfect for when you’re in a hurry!According to them, these three devices are perfectly synced to provide the user with a “customised experience”, but they fail to mention exactly what that customised experience is. Based on the video, it looks like it’s just a personalised profile on your “dashboard” in the UA Record app.Speaking of the app, UA and HTC have made it available in both the App Store and Google Play as a free download. The application shows you the results of your daily health and fitness tracking plus a “How do you feel?” scale.That said, there is some benefit to having all of these devices connected. Like they highlighted in their video, there is a lot of potential for growth into an actual ecosystem (via smart shoes, headphones, etc.). Plus there is the benefit of it being simple to use and understand.For now though, this “system” seems more like your paying a lot for a brand to be plastered onto existing technology and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, look at Beats by Dre, they’re selling like hot cakes.This fitness system will be available on January 22 in the US, retailing for USD400 (around RM1751), with pre-orders beginning today on HTC, UA and at Under Armour Brand House locations. The HealthBox will eventually roll out internationally throughout this year."

While smartphone cameras have gotten better with each iteration, one of their flaws have always been a lack of optical zoom.This was because adding an optical zoom would cause your device to be much thicker than a regular smartphone — a compromise device manufacturers were not willing to make. So, unless one was willing to manually zoom with one’s feet, smartphone photographers often had to settle for a grainier picture if they wanted to zoom.With the Zenfone Zoom, however, ASUS is claiming that this is the thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphone…in the world. They accomplished this by mounting the smartphone camera’s dual periscope horizontally across the back of the device. As a result, it boasts a 5mm “ultra-thin edge” thanks to an ergonomic curve that looks a lot like ASUS’s other Zenfones.The primary camera itself, while only sporting 13-megapixels, comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus, a dual-tone LED flash and a SmartFSI Panasonic sensor. To make up for the lack in resolution, ASUS has implemented a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for greater clarity (up to 52MP). It also has ASUS’s PixelMaster 2.0 — a feature famed for its low-light performance.To facilitate the impressive camera specifications, the Zenfone Zoom will have not only have a dedicated shutter button, it also has a dedicated video button.It’s no slouch when it comes to performance either, sporting a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom CPU paired with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB/128GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). The phone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box with ASUS’s ZenUI skin on top.At the front, this camera-centric smartphone features a 5.5″ full-HD display tucked under Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. It also has a metal finish along the rails of the phone to give it a more premium feel. Around the back, there seems to be some differences compared to the one launched in Taiwan recently, as that one had some kind of textured back (faux leather perhaps?).However, this could be because the images in the Malaysian site are outdated. If you head on over to the global site you can see that the build more closely resembles the one released in Taiwan. Nevertheless, we will find out how it looks like in about a week’s time.The Zenfone Zoom will sport a 3,000 mAh capacity battery, paired with ASUS’s BoostMaster technology. It is supposed to give you a 60% charge in 39 minutes. Although the Zenfone Zoom has support for up to 802.11ac WiFi, it only has one micro-SIM slot for mobile connectivity.In the US, the Zenfone Zoom comes in at around USD399, which translates to about RM1,760. Considering the state of the ringgit, an optimistic estimate of the Zenfone Zoom’s price here in Malaysia would be RM1,799, but realistically we should probably see it closer to RM1,899.While we’re pretty stoked about the device, we want to know what you guys think. Let us know in the comments below. Stay tuned for our coverage of the official release.[SOURCE]"
Arif Lee,Huawei’s Mate 8 goes global and it’s coming to Malaysia very soon,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/huaweis-mate-8-goes-global-and-its-coming-to-malaysia-very-soon/,"4g lte,android,android marshmallow,annoucement,availability,ces 2016,consumer electronics show 2016,huawei,huawei ces 2016,huawei malaysia,huawei mate 8,kirin 950,kirin 950 processor,launch,marshmallow,mate 8,phablet,price,processor,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-06,"UPDATE: The Huawei Mate 8 is now official in Malaysia. Priced at RM2,099 (Standard) and RM2,399 (Premium).Those at Las Vegas were lucky enough to see Huawei’s latest 6-inch phablet in the flesh at the company’s CES announcement; previously only released in its native China. And Western markets should be paying attention to the Mate 8 now since the Chinese manufacturer has already put its name out there with the Nexus 6P.But the Mate 8 isn’t a Nexus, there’s not a lot of “stock” on its EMUI skin, despite running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. The overlaid skin also has a UI that’s comparable to iOS.Putting Huawei devices in a tough spot – top of the line hardware but with software that is “different” – a little too different for some.Looking at what it has under the hood, you’re compelled to believe that this is a flagship. Carrying a home-grown Kirin 950 SoC, this was one of the first devices to equip itself with the aforementioned Octa-core processor. Four cores are clocked at 2.3GHz while the other four run at 1.8GHz. Quoting Huawei on its Kirin 950 chipset, they’ve said that the “i5” coprocessor manages power efficiency better and also makes it capable of speech recognition.Together with its main systems, it’ll release (internationally) in two variants: 3GB RAM or 4GB RAM. Seemingly, there’s no information on what the storage specifications are but based on the China release, it’ll likely be 32GB and 64GB respectively.The resolution on this 6-inch beast is a letdown, to be honest. For a screen that big, Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution doesn’t cut it. And once you notice it has a huge 4,000 mAh, you’ll be even more peeved; giving them no excuse to up the resolution, as battery life wouldn’t be a factor.On the outside, it’s the same all-metal design that we’ve (recently) seen Huawei put out. Its front will feature 2.5D curved glass around the display and on the top, an 8-megapixel front camera takes care of all those selfie shots. Moving to the back, there’s a 16-megapixel Sony IMX298 lens, as well as a rounded fingerprint sensor. As we talked about earlier, it’ll have a big battery but even while being rated 4,000 mAh, Huawei claims a 30-minute charge delivers a full-day of use.Albeit a centrepiece of Huawei’s conference at CES, there was no word on when it’ll hit US stores, if at all. But here’s the plot twist, it’ll be arriving in Malaysia during the first wave launch in four colour options, Champagne Gold, Moonlight Silver, Space Grey and Mocha Brown. Huawei failed to give a date to this “first wave launch”.As per presentation, Huawei was quoted that the Mate 8 will arrive in 30 countries; you can find a full list at Android Headlines.Looking at Chinese prices, the phablet could make an RM 1k price jump to: 3,199 RMB (RM 2,118) – 3GB/32GB
3,699 RMB (RM 2,474) – 4GB/64GBSo there’s that to consider if Malaysians were already eager to pick it up.Alternatively, these were the European pricings:€599 (RM 2,818) – 3GB/32GB
€699 (RM 3,290)  – 4GB/64GB[ SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,LeTV Le Max Pro: The First smartphone with Snapdragon 820 processor and Sense ID,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/letv-le-max-pro-the-first-smartphone-with-snapdragon-820-processor-and-sense-id/,"802.11ad,android,ces 2016,fingerprint scanner,letv,letv max pro,qualcomm,qualcomm sense id,qualcomm snapdragon 820,smartphone,snapdragon 820,wigig,uncategorized",Uncategorized,2016-01-06,"Last year was a rough time for Qualcomm as it faced criticisms over its top of the line Snapdragon 810 processor. The newer Snapdragon 820 processor aims to turn things around while bringing its performance up to the mark. At CES 2016, Qualcomm had announced China’s LeTV Le Max Pro as the first smartphone to use their SoC. Apart from having top end performance, the Le Max Pro is also the first device to feature Qualcomm’s Sense ID and the first to support multi-gigabit 802.11ad WiFi, which is also known as WiGig.  The LeTV Le Max Pro is a large 6.33″ phablet that pushes Quad HD resolution. Under the hood lies a Snapdragon 820 processor with quad Kyro cores at 2.2GHz that’s mated to 4GB of RAM. The processor claims to be more efficient with a 16nm process and it is accompanied by a Adreno 530 GPU. The new processor with quad-cores apparently provides 2X the performance of an Octa-Core based Snapdragon 810 unit. The Sense ID is supposedly a more advanced biometric feature as it uses ultrasonic sound waves that’s superior than capacitive based scanners commonly used today. Instead of recording an image of your fingertips, Sense ID scans deeper below the skin. As a result, it harder to spoof and it works well even with contaminated fingers. Another advantage is that it works underneath glass, plastics and metal materials, allowing manufacturers to implement the sensor discreetly on smartphones. In terms of design, it looks like a Huawei/honor device with a familiar antenna band stripes from an iPhone. Strangely there’s still a visible fingerprint scanner at the back which could have been omitted with Sense ID. The rear camera is said to be a 21MP shooter with Optical Image Stabilisation and powering this phablet is a generous 3,400mAh battery. As seen in the pictures below, it uses USB Type-C for charging and data transfer. Connectivity wise, it also supports Cat 12 4G LTE with download speeds up to 600Mbps and uplink up to 150Mbps. There’s no mention of its availability but you can expect more Snapdragon 820 flagship smartphones to be announced next month during MWC 2016.[ SOURCE 2 3 ]"

Well, there has been a new development in the matter as TM have decided to postpone their defaulting to the e-Bill format by six months.Towards the end of last year, TM broadband subscribers (Streamyx and UniFi) exploded in outrage when they found out that TM was planning to charge them an exorbitant amount for their printed bills. The ISP justified their actions by claiming that it was part of their move to go green — cutting down and eliminating the usage of paper.As a form of ‘motivation’ to get customers to switch to e-Billing, the telecommunications company was going to incur a monthly charge of RM2 for those who still want to receive their bill in paper format. Charge Malaysians extra for anything and you know outrage will soon follow.In any case, TM issued an explanation that ended up giving consumers more confusion than confirmation because while they announced that it was an RM2 surcharge on their website, a surcharge of RM5 was mentioned on the printed bills. Now, there is finally a very official document detailing TM’s plans.According to the release, TM is postponing the defaulting of billing to the e-billing system to 1 July 2016 — seven months after the original intended implementation date of January 2016. This means that customers can still continue to receive their printed bill for now, but are strongly encouraged to make the switch as soon as possible.Customers who fail to make the switch by 1 July 2016 will continue to receive their printed bill but be incurred a surcharge of RM2 per month. TM is calling on all their subscribers to make the switch as soon as possible if they don’t want to be forced to pay more.They highlight that there are many benefits to using the e-billing system, from speed (customers can receive their bills within 4 days) to SMS alerts and even the ability to check your bill online (up to 6 months) from anywhere at any time by simply logging on to this website.To do so, simply update your preferred email address and mobile number by sending an email to help@tm.com.my or visit the nearest TMpoint outlet, or call TM Contact Centre at 100 from your landline. According to TM, over 700,000 out of more than 4.4 million TM residential customers are already on the e-Bill statements. That’s only about 16% of the user base.Do note that this does not affect people who are only subscribed to TM’s telephone services (without broadband). These customers will receive the printed bill for free.[SOURCE]"

He also put the rumour of the Mi 5 having a Snapdragon 820 chipset to bed; confirming that Qualcomm’s top processor will indeed be inside.This confirmation serves to reignite the flailing rumours that went flying around in early December, even confusing us in the process following the release of the Redmi Note 3 – like seriously, the Chinese manufacturer chose to put an all-metal frame and fingerprint sensor on their more affordable smartphone line – we’re still left in awe but hey, who doesn’t love a good deal?Redmi Note 3 picturedIn spite of getting our bets thrown into the drain, we’d like to think that Xiaomi will match their strategy and utilise metal and a fingerprint sensor on the Mi 5 as well.

On paper, having a Snapdragon 820 processor plus that much RAM, we can safely assume it’ll be a beast.The alleged spec sheet also state that it’ll come in either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage; feature a 16-megapixel rear camera and 13-megapixel front sensor; and a fairly large 3,600 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 included.This time, we won’t place big bets anymore, just in case we get burned again.

Not only it is super fast with transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, it is also capable of pushing more power and it can even replace your existing HDMI cables as well. As the one connector to rule them all, the new reversible port will be a common sight in upcoming smartphones, tablets and laptops. To be in the forefront of this new standard, Acer has announced at CES 2016, the World’s first monitors to support USB Type-C. The H7 monitor series lets you connect your smartphone or laptop onto a bigger screen, while allowing you to transfer files and charge the device simultaneously. This basically sounds like a monitor with a built-in Microsoft Display Dock.  The Acer H7 series isn’t entirely new and its existing HDMI/DVI/DisplayPort lineup employs the same classy look that’s being held up by a premium crafted brushed metal stand. It gets a ZeroFrame design that’s wrapped up in aluminium. There are 2 models available – 25″ and 27″, both of which boast WQHD resolution of 2560×1440 with 100% sRGB colour gamut reproduction. The monitors come with built-in speakers, that’s assisted with DTS Sound and Acer TrueHarmony enhancements. To protect your eyes, it also gets a Blue Light Filter to reduce eye fatigue over extended usage. For backward compatibility with older devices, the new H7 monitors also support HDMI 2.0. The Acer H7 series is priced from 499 Euros (about RM2325), and it is expected to go on sale globally in February.Also announced at CES 2016 is the Acer R1 – The World’s Thinnest Monitor under 7mm. It is virtually bezel-less with its ZeroFrame design, allowing seamless viewing when paired with multiple monitors. The Acer R1 monitor series pushes Full HD resolution and it comes in either 21.5″, 23″, 23.8″, 25″ and 27″ sizes. Price starts from 139 Euros (about RM648) and it will be available globally starting this month."

The display, which the company claims has a 1000:1 contrast ratio with adjustable colour balance, will be tucked under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3.On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC paired with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. For optics, the device will see a 13MP rear shooter with PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) and a fast f/2.2 aperture. Helping the device out with low-light shots is a two-tone LED flash to the right of the camera module. For selfies, the phone unsurprisingly sports a 5MP front-facing camera.What is surprising is the fact that the device will feature a pair of front-facing stereo Dolby Atmos speakers, something that’s missing even on most flagship devices. What’s more, this mid-range device also sports a fingerprint scanner mounted at the back just below the primary camera (my personal favourite location), something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market.Powering everything will be a quick charge enabled 3,300 mAh battery that is supposed to deliver 265 hours of 3G standby time and 22 hours of 3G talk time. The device also comes with dual-SIM support, both of which have support for 4G LTE. The device will run Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovo’s Vibe UI skin on top, though we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update in the near future.The reason they bundled the smartphone with a VR headset is so that users can take advantage of Lenovo’s TheaterMax technology which converts regular content into immersive VR content. While we don’t know how “immersive” TheaterMax will end up being, Lenovo seems pretty confident in it, leaving the final judgement to time itself.Lenovo’s mid-ranger will go on a flash sale on Amazon India on January 19 at INR11,999 (around RM783) for just the device, while the VR bundle will cost INR13,299 (around RM868). Note that for the first few flash sales, the device will only be sold in the VR bundle, but priced at a discounted INR12,499 (around RM816). No information on whether this device will make it to Malaysia is present at the time of this article’s writing. It is important to point out that the predecessor, the Note K3, is available on DirectD at RM599.[SOURCE, 2, 3]"

The TabPRO S though should bear the Ativ badge since it looks very much like it is going to be a Windows 10 machine.A possible explanation for this is that the device could either be a dual boot system or come in two variants, much like the Xiaomi Mi Pad 2. Then again, we don’t know if these are official pictures or not, so take them with a grain of salt.The tablet looks to come with a keyboard attachment as well, but since it is supposed to be a massive 12-inches, we do hope that Samsung finds a more elegant solution to fold their keyboard than Apple did with their iPad Pro‘s Smart Keyboard.That said, the keyboard will likely mean that this tablet should be marketed more towards the productivity side, much like their previous Galaxy Tab Pro. This would put it in direct competition with Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 and the Apple iPad Pro.As a spec recap, the Samsung Galaxy TabPRO S is said to feature a screen resolution of either 2560×1600 or 3840×2400 pixels stretched out over the 12-inch screen. On the inside, the device is said to be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM.Some have also indicated that the tablet may come with an S Pen, which could greatly increase productivity when coupled with a full Windows 10 experience. With Android though it will probably only be as useful as the S Pen on the Galaxy Note5.Unfortunately, @evleaks didn’t release any information on when this device might be launched, if at all.[SOURCE]"

How? With their annual development challenge of course!This year, the participating parties are offering a USD100,000 (RM434,000) grand prize to the team that can build the best application for launching a drone from a moving vehicle as part of a search-and-rescue mission.Although we’ve seen drones being launched for rescue missions in the past, none of them have been launched from a car in motion. This is an issue because the conditions of a disaster are never the same, often needing the rescue team to stay on the move to avoid getting caught up in it themselves. So, the participants are tasked with launching and landing a drone from the bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.Here’s the full timeline of the DJI SDK Developer Challenge:March 19th – Developer package sent to 25 teams
May 10th – Only 15 teams make the cut, receiving Matrice 100 (a fully programmable modular aerial drone) and Zenmuse X3 (DJI’s latest camera) to complete their systems
July 17th – 10 remaining finalists start developing their autonomous landing and object recognition software
August 27-28th – Grand finalsIn certain parts of the world, drones bring about more fear than anything else, though it’s amazing to see that there are (obvious) pros in utilising them for aid drop-offs and search-and-rescue missions; lessening the risk of rescuers by putting drones out there instead. And let’s not forget the use of these drones by photojournalist worldwide, capturing civil unrest in states observing media lockdowns.Besides holding competitions to save the world, DJI has also updated their existing Phantom and Inspire drone series. While DJI’s uber cool Inspire 1 gets a minor colour update (it now comes in black), they’ve added a 4K camera to the Phantom 3, a feature only available on the Phantom 3 Professional in the past.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2, IMAGE SOURCE]"

Priced from RM1,599.One of the biggest thorns in our smartwatch sides has been the fact that Apple has yet to bring it’s coveted smartwatch, the Apple Watch, to our shores. Well, the wait is almost up because Apple is set to put two exclusive Apple Watch Sport designs on sale in Malaysia on February 8.To commemorate the Chinese New Year celebrations, Apple looks to be putting these two “special” models on sale in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This comes after an announcement message appeared briefly on the countries’ corresponding Apple websites before being removed earlier today.The announcement read:Exclusive models for Chinese New Year…We’re celebrating the new year with two special Apple Watch Sport models, available until 22 February.9to5Mac also reports that while the “Buy Now” and “Shop Now” links appeared for a short time on Apple’s website, it looks like the company might have launched the announcement a bit prematurely. It is currently unclear how Apple plans to sell these devices, or if they will be priced at an equally “special” price from the normal Apple Watch Sport models.While Apple officially launched the Watch way back in 2014, the final release of the product was in April the following year. Since then, the availability of the device has slowly trickled into our neighbouring countries. Now it seems our time may be near, though at this point it is still a rumour because there is no official confirmation.That said, this information was sourced from 9to5Mac and MacRumours, both of whom are usually right when it comes to stuff like these. If this launch date holds true, this would mean that Malaysia is one of the last markets to get the Apple Watch — almost an entire year after it was officially released. To make matters worse, this sale is only available until February 22 while supplies last.

Nikon’s new addition will make the KeyMission 360 an only child (for now) in their new family of action cameras – probably the one and only that is capable of delivering a 360-degree field of view shot.In a market space dominated by the likes of GoPro – as well as other emerging companies entering the party fashionably late, TomTom, Garmin and Sony to name a few – Nikon seems to be riding on the same wave.Being a 4K ready 360-degree capable video camera, the shape it holds is weird, especially when we’ve come accustomed to the looks of GoPros. The frame is pretty much square but this is definitely no cube; two lenses sit on the front and rear of the KeyMission 360 while the exterior sure screams “rugged”. It isn’t all for show either, Nikon claims it’s shockproof up to a 2-metre drop and waterproof up to 30 metres. It doesn’t surprise us that other influential imaging companies are hot on the heels, as GoPros have been relatively popular since making its inception in the early 2000s. Drones have been hot too, so these two, when used in unison, would probably be one of the biggest leaps for photojournalism and news reporting. Knowing this, GoPro will soon put out the Karma, a drone and 360-degree camera combo but that’s still in development; you can read about it here.Nikon enters a new space and despite the forerunners mentioned earlier entering the market much earlier, none of them offer a small (true) 360-degree action camera. With this type of dual-lens 360-degree camera hitting the scene, it might pose a huge question mark for those bulky camera rigs that are used to deliver VR-videos; making these smaller options something you can pocket and go, rather than needing a fully fledged crew to handle a production.The KeyMission 360 along with some nifty dedicated accessories will be out in Spring of this year; no pricing details have been released but more information will be available during Nikon’s CES exhibit scheduled to take place tomorrow.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Yes, a Windows 10 device bearing the Galaxy tag and we have all the juicy specs right here.The Galaxy TabPro S will come with a choice of either a Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro operating system, so there is no option for an Android OS of any kind. Up front, the tablet will have a 12-inch FHD+ (2160×1440 pixels) sAMOLED display — the first Windows 10 tablet to have a Super AMOLED screen.On the inside, this massive tablet will be powered by a dual-core Intel Core M processor, clocked at 2.2GHz. paired with 4GB of RAM and either a 128GB or 256GB SSD. Because the device is powered by a Core M processor, it has a fanless design which eliminates that annoying whirring sound.We initially thought that this device would be competition for the Microsoft Surface 3, but with these specs (of course depending on the price) it looks to be able to take on even the low spec Surface Pro 4 with a Core M3 processor. Do note that Samsung did not mention which Core M processor they’re using, only that it is a 6th-gen one.The device will also support 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac MIMO, WiFi Direct, NFC and Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity. For those on the move, there’s also a 4G LTE (Cat.6) version alongside a WiFi only version. GPS and GLONASS are also supported.For optics, the Galaxy TabPro S will have a 5MP front and rear camera, which isn’t impressive but you don’t want to be that guy taking pictures with your 12″ tablet do you? For video, the cameras will support recording up to an FHD resolution (1920×1080).Powering the components will be a 5,200 mAh battery that Samsung says can last up to 10 hours, and because the tablet sports a USB Type-C port, it will also have fast charging allowing you to top the device up in about 2.5 hours.Since 2-in-1 devices are all the rage right now, the Galaxy TabPro S will come with a keyboard (not sold separately) that looks very much like the old Surface Pro 3 Type Cover. Unlike the iPad Pro, this keyboard can actually function as a cover because it adopts a more old-school approach to keyboard attachment. Also, note that it has a touchpad, something that is missing from both Apple‘s Smart Keyboard and Google’s Pixel C.For users who want a stylus or more ports, Samsung is offering a Bluetooth Pen and a multi-port adapter (HDMI, USB Type A & C) but are sold separately. Samsung says that the Galaxy TabPro S will be available globally come February 2016 though there is no mention of a recommended retail price.[SOURCE, 2]"

The folks at Samsung has officially confirmed that they are adding iOS support for its current Gear S2 smartwatches.This follows the earlier rumour however it is happening only later this year without specific dates. Similar with Android Wear powered smartwatches, the Gear S2 is expected to lose some functionality when it’s paired to an iPhone but it should work with your standard day to day notifications.In the past, Samsung has limited its Gear smartwatches exclusively to Galaxy devices but recognising the need to go mass, they have finally opened up the Gear S2 to work with most Android smartphones. The Gear S2 is their first round smartwatch and it stands out with its rotating bezel that we feel is more intuitive to use than the digital crown on the Apple Watch.The Gear S2 is currently priced at RM1,399 while its Classic version is going for RM1,599. As a comparison, the Apple Watch is priced officially from RM1,599 and that’s for the base aluminium model with a smaller 38mm size. The straps for the Gear S2 are also replaceable and the Classic version lets you swap with any traditional 20mm watch band. If you’re an Apple iPhone user, would you get an Apple Watch or a Gear S2?

That means you can just toss it in the air and the drone will start flying though it does need a little bit of room to get it climbing.The Disco, with it’s single propeller and detachable wings, can hit speeds of up to 50mph (around 80kph) and stay flying for about 45 minutes on a single charge. There is also an ultrasound camera mounted at the bottom of the drone that helps it land autonomously.Well, more like crash autonomously if we’re looking at the teaser footage.Like the Bebop 2, you can control the Disco with Parrot’s Skycontroller or plot a flight plan and have the drone do the flying itself. The drone also has a “return home” function that does exactly what the name suggests.Mounted at the front is the same eye-like 14-megapixel fisheye lens camera Parrot mounts on the Bebop 2, so it will likely feature the same digital panning and stability options as well.While ditching the quadcopter design lets you fly more realistically (especially with FPV goggles), there will inevitably be drawbacks. The drone, for example, loses its ability to hover and takeoff vertically, making it less ideal for filming. It will also inevitably be less stable and manoeuvrable than a quadcopter.Upside? Y0u can fly, turn and pitch like an actual plane. COOL.Despite their claims, The Verge points out that Parrot aren’t the first to introduce a ready-to-fly fixed-wing drone as there are already several small fixed-wing drones in the market.Though we do think the Disco is one of the best looking fixed-wing drones out there. Or almost out there, since it’s still a prototype. Parrot does plan to make this available to consumers within this year so that’s something to look forward to.[SOURCE]"

Having seen a barrage of R series smartphones (R7, R7 Plus, R7s), the Chinese smartphone maker will be introducing an all new F series that’s focused on “premium-quality mobile photography”.According to OPPO, the F series will be a core product for 2016. It promises impressive specs and eye-catching style with an amazing price. So could we be looking at an affordable “Lumia Pureview” alternative? At the moment, OPPO has a photography-centric N series that offers a rotating camera module on the OPPO N1 and N3. From the teaser image above, the F series appears to have unibody metal design and it comes with rounded corners and edges as opposed to having squarish looks like its current R series. The side does look like an iPhone 6/6s with its power and SIM tray slot switched places. In terms of specs, don’t expect it to be a top notch device like its Find series. The OPPO F series will be a mid-ranger which is unlikely to be powered by Qualcomm’s newer Snapdragon 810/820 family of processors. The first model would be called the OPPO F1 and it could be launched in Malaysia sometime this month. If they are looking to push photography in a mid-range segment, the phone to beat would be the Lenovo Vibe Shot that’s priced at RM1,399. That comes with a 16MP sensor with OIS, Laser AutoFocus and a triple LED flash."

However, as she was too preoccupied with her device, she didn’t notice when she gradually began walking towards the edge of the water.Online surveillance footage shows Wang struggling for over a minute before she disappeared from the surface of the water. Her body was discovered after her husband Yang spotted her shoe floating on the river when he went looking for her the next morning.Although the river was only chest-deep, the sludge at the riverbed can cause people to slip and fall. This incident has served as a wake-up call to the Chinese public as netizens took to the social media, calling for people to exercise caution when using phones.We’d like to say that this is the first tragedy caused by phubbing (snubbing someone in favour of your smartphone), but that just isn’t the case. It used to be “don’t drive and text”, now it needs to also be “don’t walk and use your phone”.You might think, “oh that’s not me, I only use it at the dinner table!”. What people don’t realise is that everything starts somewhere. Using them initially to avoid socially awkward situations can often lead to a reliance on the device and we all know where that leads.An Ohio State University researcher discovered that the number of pedestrian deaths has dramatically increased over the past few years and many of which were caused by telephone distractions. The figure is expected to double by 2015.Be mindful when using your device. It’s perfectly fine if you post that tweet an hour or even a day later.

But with doors, windows and grills, one can only do so much to protect their own home. Let’s face the facts, break-ins happen all over the world though it doesn’t hurt to have some sort of surveillance system around your compound.Meet the Netatmo Presence, a smart outdoor security camera released at CES 2016.Wait, another “smart” home-monitoring system that has a motion detector? Well yeah but this one can identify the differences between a person, animal and car.The brand isn’t a stranger to the home-monitoring scene; before launching Presence, the “Welcome” indoor camera had this revolutionary facial recognition technology – letting you always put a name to known faces. Presence doesn’t go as far but the ability to distinguish a person, animal and car is already a feat in itself.Connecting to your home Wi-Fi network to send you real-time push notifications of what it has been seeing, it’ll buzz you on your designated device if it notices a person moving around the vicinity, an animal running about or a car pulling up to the driveway – proceeding to show you a video recap of it happening. Able to detect people/animals/cars up to 20 metres, the camera also allows users to pinch-to-zoom to ensure you manage to identify the culprits in your video recording. It’ll be interesting to see how capable the software is and if any costumes/hoods or etc can fool it into not “recognising” a person.Having Presence on your porch will definitely help when you’re expecting a valuable package; keep an eye on gardeners and handymen; or when you’re too preoccupied to notice the doorbell going off. It makes perfect sense since we’re always on our smartphones anyways, the push notification should be seen quickly.As a fixed outdoor camera, it’ll obviously be working during the night-time but once the sun goes down, the camera kicks into infra-red mode – if you want it to – otherwise the floodlight that sits above the lens will be mighty useful.Personalise Presence and its corresponding app by going through its notification settings and allow it to continuously record when a person is detected. The 4-megapixel smart camera shoots in Full HD (1920 x 1080) and has a 100-degree angle field of view. Storage is done internally and that means if you don’t get to your recording fast enough, someone could easily destroy the camera before you realised.Sitting inside an aluminium shell that’s IP66 certified, you’ll mount the 50 x 200 x 110mm unit with the included mounting kit. In terms of the floodlight specifications, it’ll be a dimmable 12W LED unit with IR night vision detection up to 15 metres. Access your Netatmo camera through its free app that runs both on iOS (8 minimum) and Android (4.3 minimum). From what we’re familiar with, other smart home security options require you to pay for their monthly based app subscriptions and services, so it’s pretty neat that you’ll save some money using Netatmo.Presence is slated to make its way to homes around the world sometime during Fall 2016 while no pricing information has been released.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

If the current watchfaces for the Gear S2 doesn’t tickle you fancy, why not make one on your own? Samsung has just released its Gear Watch Designer, a designing tool that allows you to create watchfaces without complex programming. If you’re already a designer you can get started immediately with its familiar Adobe Flash-like interface. For first time users, it looks pretty straight forward and you can customise your own background, hour markers, hand design and overlay text or elements. For an added touch of creativity, you can throw in additional conditions like showing a sunny background during the day and a moon background during the night. This can be extended further based on steps taken, activities performed and even your current battery levels. You could also add your own animation using a PNG sequence, which can be used as a watchface element. Once you’re done, the tool helps you to publish your watchface straight to the Gear Store that’s accessible by other Gear users. The Gear Watch Designer works with Windows and Mac computers, on a machine that has at least dual-core 2GHz processor, 2GB of RAM, 1GB of available disk space, minimum 1280×1024 display and JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 1.8 or above.

You probably wake up, brush your teeth, take a dump, shower, change and head down for a cup of your favourite wake-me-up drink while you catch up on your social media feed — Facebook, for instance.Unless you’re me, then that all changes depending on how many times I hit the snooze button.Facebook could probably be your favourite social media platform. Heck, you’re probably reading this article because it popped up on your Facebook feed. Now, what if I told you that your favourite social media platform was secretly experimenting on you?According to a report by The Verge, it appears that Facebook had secretly experimented on its Android mobile users, crashing their apps intentionally, “selectively disconnecting” them from their Facebook applications for hours on end.Why? Well, apparently it was done to prepare for the possibility of Google removing the Facebook application from their Play Store for competitive reasons. They wanted to prepare for a future where users might have to resort to downloading the Facebook application from a source outside of the Google Play Store.Despite the fact that Facebook is one of the Play Store’s biggest application developers, there is a looming threat that the social network could bypass Google’s services altogether.The tests were allegedly conducted to see how far they could go to get Android users to abandon their platform altogether. The results? “People never stopped coming back.”According to a person familiar with the tests, those who were locked out of their application defaulted to the mobile web browser version of Facebook, rather than abandoning the application. Are you surprised?We weren’t. Right now, there is simply no alternative to Facebook and what the social media platform offers, so it seems only natural that users would find any means possible to access the site. The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back.The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back.Although this was supposedly a one-time experiment conducted years ago, this isn’t the first social experiment Facebook undertook. Yes, we’re talking about the controversy in 2014 where Facebook altered the content on users’ News Feeds to see if it would change their moods.Information surfaced last year that Facebook bombarded several users’ News Feeds with sad and depressing content to see if they were less likely to visit the site if it made them sad. The experiment was so controversial that even the editor behind the study was “creeped out“, questioning if the results of the study were actually worth all the backlash.What most people don’t realise — or choose to turn a blind eye on — is that social experimenting on the Internet is nothing new. Pretty much every website has done it to some extent. The question then becomes whether you know you’re being experimented on or not.Perhaps what makes what Facebook did so painful was that it felt personal on some level because these were people’s personal feeds. Privacy settings exist for a reason right?What do you guys think of anonymous social experiments conducted by your favourite websites? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE, 2, IMAGE SOURCE]"

It is an interesting safety feature as it disconnects if someone tripped over your cable, avoiding the risk of dragging your laptop to the ground. When Apple introduced the new ultra-thin MacBook, it was ditched in favour of the all-new USB Type-C. This is supposedly the future standard of connectivity, allowing you to deliver power, data and even high-resolution video on a single cable. Sadly that means you’re stuck with an old-school cable design like other gadgets. If you want to restore that MagSafe feature of old, cable maker Griffin finally has a solution for you.Simply called as BreakSafe, the new magnetic USB cable works essentially like the MagSafe that came as standard with previous MacBook models. It is fairly easy to release and it will automatically disconnect when there’s excessive pressure. On one end, you get a fixed USB Type-C connector that goes into your power adapter, while the other end has two pieces, with the small stub that stays permanently in your MacBook port. The cable is 6 feet (1.8 metres) long and the magnetic connector is about 12.8mm deep. On their online store, it is listed as coming soon with the retail price tag of US$39.99 (about RM173). As comparison, the original USB Type-C cable (2 metres) for the MacBook is going for RM139.If you’re looking for a sleeker alternative, there’s Znaps that debut on KickStarter. This isn’t a cable but a two-piece connector head that gives you a “MagSafe” and a reversible feature for your existing Lightning, Micro-USB and USB Type-C cables. A set for Lightning and Micro-USB costs US$18.00 (about RM78) while USB Type-C costs US$24.00 (about RM104). Individual connectors and adapters are sold separately so you can “MagSafe” your entire device collection if required. You can pre-order now and they will ship by end of this month.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Of course, there are many that frown upon its compromises. It was their first flagship to not have a removable battery and most critical of all, it lacks an expandable microSD slot. If you were disappointed by the Galaxy S6, there’s a lot to look forward to on the upcoming model.According to @evleaks, the new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will finally offer a microSD slot. Like the current S6, both models will be offered with either 32GB and 64GB storage options, which in Malaysia we are likely to receive the smallest option of just 32GB.This would be good news for those taking loads of pictures and 4K videos as the device is alleged to support microSD cards up to 200GB. This reaffirms an earlier “insider source” that Samsung is finally bringing back the microSD slot to its latest flagship.With each new model, the Galaxy S lineup has always seen an increase of battery capacities. However on the Galaxy S6, it was downsized from 2,800mAh on the Galaxy S5 to just 2,550mAh (2,600mAh on the S6 edge). Fortunately, the new processor and energy efficient Universal Flash storage were good at maximising every mAh of power.The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are alleged to receive 3,000mAh and 3,600mAh capacity batteries respectively, which is a huge jump. That’s like fitting a Galaxy Note battery into a smaller device, and hopefully this could translate to more than 24 hours of usage.Wireless Charging will still be the star of the show and Samsung will likely to support fast wireless charging for the new flagship duo as it did with the Galaxy Note5. Charging an S7 is reported to take about 2 hours wirelessly while the S7 edge will take slightly longer at 2.2 hours.First introduced on the Galaxy S5, the S7 is said to be getting water and dust resistance with an IP67 rating. This is similar with the Galaxy S5 which in theory can be submerged up to 1 metre for up to 30 minutes. Even if you don’t go to the pool, having water resistance is a good feature to have especially for those unexpected moments. Even word has it that the folks at Cupertino are working to make its upcoming iPhone waterproof.If Samsung is doing it, it better be a cap-less design without those clumsy flap covers.The Galaxy S7/S7 edge will be running on their latest Exynos 8890 processor but there will be a Qualcomm-powered version for selected markets that runs on a Snapdragon 820 processor. Expect them to come with 4GB of RAM and has support for faster Cat 9 4G LTE.In terms of screen size, the standard S7 is likely to retain the same compact 5.1″ Quad HD display while the S7 edge is rumoured to be either a larger 5.5 or 5.7 incher. To have a 5.7″ smartphone at this time of the year doesn’t make any sense as it would cannibalise its own S6 edge+ that was launched not too long ago.Camera wise, the new flagships will get a smaller pixel count of 12MP instead of its current 16MP shooter. However, it is compensated with faster f/1.7 lens versus f/1.9 for better low-light performance. With a smaller BRITECELL camera module, the new S7 could have a flat and flush back design without the protruding camera hump.Are you excited now?

From OLED displays to a remake of the iPhone 5c, we’re still left guessing as to what Apple’s new standout feature will be for the 2016. This year was surely a busy innovating year for the tech manufacturer, as we saw the iPad Pro and the Pencil adding themselves to Apple’s inventory. But in terms of design it got weird, yes, we’re looking at you, Smart Battery Case.Weird or different, however you look at it, Apple might do it again. Just in a way that’s more functional rather than aesthetically appealing. We say this due to new reports that cite Apple will make the iPhone 7 waterproof and it won’t be made out of aluminium this time. DigiTimes claims that using this new “material” (whatever it is) plus sealing all the ports, grills and buttons will allow them fully classify the iPhone 7 as waterproof. Hopefully, they’ll find a workaround for the flap enclosure like Sony has, otherwise, it’ll be quite frustrating having a flap for everything. But having said, they might just drop some ports all together as other rumours have said Apple will merge the lightning cable with the 3.5mm headphone jack.Their report goes on to state that Apple will likely rework the antenna lines that run along the device but they don’t provide a how to the statement. Interestingly, this leak could be referring to the much talked about 6c, that will follow in the footsteps of the 5c but who knows.We’re a long way off from Fall 2016 so you can bet that more information will come about throughout the new year. They’ve done it before and they’ll probably do it again, Apple will probably “reinvent” something else.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

While it may be “smaller”, this little device’s spec sheet is going to surprise you. Subsequently, this may not even be the highest specification for the One Plus 2 Mini, as the Shenzen-based company has always listed the last number to correspond to a higher specification. For example E1003 would be better than E1000, that’s if a E1003 were to exist.OnePlus X shownWeirdly, it shares the looks more of a One Plus X, rather than the OnePlus 2, being more rounder around the edges and its backing receiving what looks like a glossy glass finish. At the same time, the front also looks to have capacitive keys.Based on the TENAA listing, it’ll be a 5-inch device, hence the Mini. The screen itself will feature a Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080) and it’ll have the infamous Snapdragon 810 SoC underneath its chassis. Surprisingly, the 810 processor on the Mini (2GHz) won’t be under-clocked, as it was on the bigger One Plus 2 (1.8GHz); leaving us to believe that OnePlus has managed to solve thermal issues that were associated with the chipset in the past.OnePlus 2 shownThe other key internals differ from its big brother but the OnePlus 2 Mini doesn’t fall far from its family tree. It’ll get 3GB of RAM, instead of 4GB; 16GB of internal memory, instead of 64GB; and feature a microSD slot, unlike the OnePlus 2.Camera-wise, the 13-megapixel remains but its front shutter apparently gets bumped up to 8-megapixels from 5. You’ll also find 4G LTE on this smartphone but there’s no mention if it will come in a Dual-SIM version.At the same time, OPPO‘s A30 has passed the same standard certification and they both look like twins (identical to the last groove). We’re not too sure what to make of this but it could finally mean that OnePlus and OPPO recognise their “links” that they’ve tried to deny for so long.Now to the question that everyone has been waiting for… will it be sold through the same invite system?[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

One of the sexiest words to come out of tech. The idea that you can swap out any old part on your smartphone for new one, but keep everything else exactly the same, is almost too alluring. Too bad it keeps getting delayed.Well, thank goodness for crowd-funding because now we have the next best thing: Modular smartphone cases.
The thing that makes the idea of a modular device, be it a smartphone, smartwatch, or, in this case, a smartcase, so brilliant is that it is completely customisable. For the first time the users themselves can decide exactly what they want or don’t want to have on their device.Fancy a good camera? Get a powerful camera module. Need more juice to last you an entire day? Get a battery module. Want a chainsaw to go jungle trekking? Get a…err well, I don’t think there’s a module for that yet but I’m sure you can see my point.Initially, people thought that a modular smartphone was the way to go, so companies like Google poured their resources into developing a modular smartphone, but it obviously that had its own host of problems too.Then, along came the people who founded nexpaq, a small group of talented individuals who wanted to bring the modular concept into the world on a much smaller scale: a smartphone case.It’s something everyone uses, it’s something almost everyone needs and — perhaps most importantly — something far more accessible to the general public.Despite claiming to be cheaper than the smartphones we know and readily purchase today, purchasing a modular smartphone was always going to be a big investment. However, with a case like nexpaq’s, a starter kit that includes a case and four modules would only set you back USD169 (around RM728).The best part? The folks at nexpaq are enlisting the help of the community to develop their modular smartphone case, releasing developer kits for both the modules and its accompanying software.Now, more are following suit, with the latest one coming from a company called i-Blades who have put up their version of the modular smartphone case, the i-Blades Smartcase. The i-Blades Smartcase is currently on Indiegogo looking for funding and the best part about it is that their modules can apparently stack infinitely.Your device would look like it has one of Apple’s Smart Battery Cases though, but I digress. If you’re interested, head on over to their project page and check it out.I really do believe that modular devices are the future. I don’t want some guy I don’t know in a lab coat in some factory in the middle of China deciding what I should and shouldn’t have on my smartphone. I want that power. It’s my phone after all.That said, I don’t think we’re quite ready for the modular smartphone just yet, but a modular smartphone case? I wouldn’t mind me some of that.Baby steps, right?[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

While there have been rumours going around about a potential Samsung Galaxy S7+, SamMobile believes that this will likely be the S7 edge instead.We highly doubt Samsung would cannibalise their popular recent flagship and risk their consumers getting pissed at them, just so they can be “radical”. It’s very unlikely that they would pull a Xiaomi.Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, the picture also reveals another interesting specification: The camera module. According to the picture, the S7 (or S7 edge or S7+) looks to feature a 12.2-megapixel rear camera coupled with a 5-megapixel front shooter.What’s interesting is the drastic drop in megapixel count for the rear camera, down from 16MP, in a 2016 device. This is in-line with an earlier rumour that the device would sport a 12MP large pixel sensor, though it doesn’t match Samsung’s other camera technology reveal.At their Investor’s Forum last year, Samsung unveiled the BRITECELL camera technology, which utilises tiny one micron pixels which are “the smallest pixel for slim smartphone”. If Samsung were to use these small pixels and also drop pixel count, then they would really have to have something up their sleeve to help the sensor cope with low-light photography.The image also reveals that the device will have a Snapdragon 820 processor with an Adreno 530 GPU mated with 4GB of RAM, which is, unsurprising.In any case, these are only rumours and Samsung could just be pulling a fast one, using multiple prototypes to mislead leaksters. Although you should probably take this with a grain of salt, this does give us a lot to be excited about for 2016’s smartphones.[SOURCE]"

So, what’s going to be the next big thing in 2016?It looks like the sky is the limit for Samsung. In a patent application just released by the US patent office, the Korean manufacturer is going all out with a crazy mobile device concept that combines a foldable body with a flexible display, and a built-in projector that can project hologram images.This is of course only a patent application so it’s too early to say if we’ll see a similar device being released this year, not all the tech in one device, at least. You might see Samsung expanding its range of flexible display devices, and it’s not the first time they stuffed a projector into a smartphone (remember the Galaxy Beam?).Released in 2010, the Galaxy Beam is a novel idea that was probably ahead of its time but today with video on demand and mobile content steaming being a big thing, a phone with a built in projector wouldn’t be such a bad idea.

What needs? Well according to the people behind the Infant Cries Translator app, it could only one of four things.Created by a team from the National Taiwan University Hospital of Yunlin, they claim that this app will be able to distinguish the sounds made when a newborn is howling away; telling you why in the process. How it works is the app will record a 15-second clip of the crying noises, analysis the frequencies of acoustic variation and compare it to an online database. Dr Chen Si-da and Chang Chuan-yu lead the show and they’ve managed to get the app to work 92% of the time, telling those using the app that their baby is either hungry, sleepy, in pain or needs a diaper change.That 92% has some caveats though, the accuracy of the app diminishes as the baby gets older:92% accuracy – under two weeks old
85% accuracy – under one to two months
77% accuracy – under four months oldThe researchers hypothesise that once the baby reaches six months, it’ll be almost pointless to rely on the app as he/she will be more receptive of the environment around them. And mainly as humans develop, they get more complicated – we can attest to that.Yet, this could be the app every soon-to-be parents will need when it comes to tending to their babies, especially for first-time parents. Learning as it goes, the Infant Cries Translator, will constantly update its database by taking results from babies around the world and it’ll allow parents to personalise their “results” by adding their own feedback to the learning algorithm.We’re sure parents reading this now want to know where to get the app:iOS – US$ 2.99 / RM 13
Android – RM 11.76The screenshots of the app being used on the two app stores are shown in Mandarin but the Apple App Store lists support in English and Japanese as well.And don’t expect this app to solve all your problems, it’s just another tool to help identify why your baby is crying. There’s also a probability that cause of tears don’t match the “reason” the app tells you, so a pediatrician or a child psychologist might always be handy.If everything we mentioned doesn’t work, try this:[ SOURCE, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

As far as we can tell, seems the US market will have their hands on a Huawei tablet and possibly a smartwatch on the 5th of January.Appearing on their official Weibo account, the first image looks to be a thin metal-clad tablet/smartphone of sorts, with Gizmochina claiming it’ll be the honor X3 tablet. We’d think that it’s more likely be a Huawei X3 since they’ve kept the X-line for the higher-end brand.In the same image, you’ll see speaker grills on the device; given the placement, we’re going to assume that it’s a tablet as well. There’s also a wine glass in a form of a velvet cloth-like material with the words “rhythm x entertainment” leaving us to believe it’ll be multi-media focused in terms of features.Given the timing of the Kirin 950 chipset release, many have pointed out that the tech conglomerate will utilise their new top of the line SoC on the X3 but that’s mere speculation for now.The other device they casually let out of the bag seems to be a watch and based on earlier reports, this could be the smaller version of the Huawei Watch. According to the makers, this new watch will be a rounder smartwatch – we have no idea what that means. Take a look at the Huawei Watch and tell us if you could make this “rounder”.Similar to the other photo, the second image has two words: technology and fashion. The “watch face” used also seems more feminine than usual, hinting towards something more female focused.Chinese tech companies have teased devices before, with Xiaomi being the more transparent out of the two; letting us see everything we need to make our own assumptions. We credit co-founder/President of Xiaomi, Lin Bin for showing “teasers” of their own products.Whatever the circumstance, mark your calendars for the 6th of January 2:00 am (Malaysian time), Huawei is going to put on a show.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA ]"

It’ll be the Korean maker’s first ever all-metal smartphone too, according to a source involved in the organisation.The dominos have started to fall since the day before, as an image of a supposed camera setup of LG’s latest smartphone was leaked but we’ll hold that for later.LG V10 shownApparently the G5 will take some elements from the V10, as well as the older G-series that it hopes to successfully replace. That won’t be all since a new device should come with new features – unless you’re HTC and Sony.Now onto what specs we can expect on the LG G5. As mentioned earlier, it’ll be a metal unibody case and it’s purported to carry a 5.3-inch display capable of Quad HD (2560 x 1440) resolution. Why did they shave off 0.2-inches? That’s to make way for the secondary “ticker” display that has been shown on another LG device: the V10. We talked about what the ticker display does here.Besides that, LG will allegedly reduce battery capacity to only 2,800mAh, though the efficiency of the processor underneath the G5 will be the main factor when its comes to battery life; all signs point towards a Snapdragon 820 processor, while the G5 is said to have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.The ticker display might help with battery life too, being the only screen that lights up instead of the main display when notifications come in. This could mean that LG’s new device could be thinner than its predecessor but we’ll have to wait and see if that’s the case.Evan Blass aka Evleaks and VentureBeat also mentioned that there was no talk of a microSD slot but they’ve pointed out that external storage has always been conspicuous with LG devices. So in other words, a no mention doesn’t mean it won’t be there.In another act to market themselves differently from the pack, the source also claims that LG will include some sort of modular expansion through a feature called “Magic Slot”. Again, there was no talk of how this would be implemented but there were examples given to show what it could include: camera add-ons, audio amplifier and physical keyboard.We saved the camera leak for last as LG’s cameras (of late) have been top notch. Based on an older leak, it’ll look something like this:Showing a dual-camera module, we’re forced to remember the pitfall of the Ultrapixel but we’ll hope in earnest that LG doesn’t screw this up. The main rear lens has been rumoured to be a 16-megapixel sensor and adding the secondary lens would allow wide-angle shots up to 135-degrees. The cameras will be separated by a module with four internal elements; two of them will be LED flash bulbs, one will be a laser autofocus and the last will be a similar RGB sensor.If all these specs have got you salivating – hold on – no word has got out of when it’ll be released. VentureBeat only managed to get a “first quarter of 2016” range of when it’ll be out.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA ]"

If you’ve been envying our neighbours in Indonesia, who are paying nearly half of what we pay for 1GB of data, we feel you too.But, if you’re thinking of creating a blog to hate on our mobile carriers, citing examples of how much cheaper data is in our neighbouring countries, you might want to reconsider. This is because based on data collected by website Tech In Asia, we actually have more affordable data — on average, per 1GB — than most countries in Southeast Asia.In their study, Tech In Asia compiled data from all the Southeast Asian countries and calculated what the typical price of 1GB (in USD) of data was. Then, they looked up the minimum wage of each country, (picking the typical wage of a low-income worker in Brunei, Singapore and Cambodia because they didn’t have an official minimum wage) comparing it with the respective data costs.Finally, they used that data to estimate how many hours a worker would have to work to be able to afford 1GB of data and arranged the countries according to scale in a nifty infographic. The results of their study are as follows:Full infographic at the end of this postFrom the data, Malaysia is actually doing quite well, finishing within the top 5 of all the countries in SEA for the most affordable data, despite the fact that we’re paying nearly USD1.60 (RM6.88) more than Indonesia and almost USD1 (RM4.30) higher than Vietnam and Myanmar for 1GB of data. Thanks to our higher minimum wage, a Malaysian minimum wage worker would only have to put in 3 hours and 45 minutes of hard work to enjoy 1GB of data.We’re still far off from Brunei though, who leads the pack at only 1 hour and 4 minutes of work needed for 1GB of data, despite their data costing USD2.67 (RM11.48) more than Malaysia. The power of a higher income nation eh?Another interesting bit of information is how incredibly low the price of mobile data in Cambodia is, coming in at a cool USD1.50/GB (RM6.45), sliding them into third place right behind Singapore despite their minimum wage being only USD0.66 (RM2.84) per hour.There is only one cause for concern: The accuracy of this data. Let’s take Malaysia for example. Based on the infographic, we average USD4.42 per 1GB of data, which is roughly equivalent to RM19/GB.

Keep in mind the lower average value is likely because of the promotions that are currently active. Hashtag legit information (as far as Malaysia is concerned anyway).It’s no secret that we’ve arrived at an era where everyone is obsessed with staying connected. In the past, only moderately large F&B chains offer free WiFi to their customers, but now even mamak shops have “FREE WIFI” signs pasted in and around their establishment. Why? Well, smartphones are getting more and more accessible for the masses and we all know that unless we keep our phones connected to the Internet, they’re little more than 180g bricks.But, we can’t always rely on WiFi to stay connected. What if we’re on the train? Or in a cab? I mean, we can’t just NOT send that tweet or NOT check if our new Instagram picture broke the 11-like barrier right? That would be absurd. As the citizens flailed about in a chaotic mess, crying out for a saviour, our local telcos came riding in on white stallions offering data plans like food to the hungry.Those who could afford it rejoiced while others griped about how expensive it was compared to our neighbouring countries — some of which could be considered less developed than we are. The problem with that is when you argue “affordability” based purely on how much a plan costs, you’re leaving other crucial factors like income, development, penetration and even freedom of Internet, out of the equation.That’s like arguing who’s the best badminton player based purely on how fast their smashes are.It seems that the folks over at Tech In Asia have had enough of this nonsense and thanks to them, we now have a better understanding (hopefully) of what affordability really means. That said, this chart doesn’t appear to differentiate between connection speeds (4G LTE, 3G, 2G, etc) so that could be another factor affecting cost.Stability and coverage could also be another reason for the difference in cost. We’d much rather pay a little more for a wider and more stable data connection.What do you think of this infographic? Should carriers focus more on reducing cost or improving coverage and stability?

Using a mobile app, Uber lets you request for a clean and reliable ride, which is like a breath of fresh air in cities with failed taxi services. The one billionth trip was taken in London on a Honda Insight Hybrid. To celebrate the occasion, the lucky rider is receiving a year’s worth of Uber rides, while the driver will be getting a well deserved holiday at a Uber city of his choice. Not bad for a short trip that only costs £5 (about RM32). To top it off, Uber is also making a charitable donation to an organisation at the neighbourhood where ride had started. Despite its political and regulatory hurdles, Uber has been growing quite rapidly covering hundreds of cities in 68 countries worldwide. It is said that they are currently doing 3 million trips a day which is substantially more than its competitor, Lyft. While they are doing well in most markets, Uber is also facing bans and suspension by some local authority such as Spain and Germany. Fortunately, it is still business as usual in Malaysia as it still operates in Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru. Despite protests by taxi drivers, SPAD (Land Transport Authority) has yet to implement new regulation for these new “ride-sharing” services. For riders, it is a better alternative to taxis without the hassle of haggling. At the same time, driving with Uber is an opportunity to make extra income which is more critical with the rising cost of living. At the current rate, Uber isn’t slowing down and eventually it could possibly render car ownership redundant. Of course, this is only possible if it is extensive and affordable enough to do so. Already it is cheaper than most taxis and in some markets, it could be cheaper than taking a bus. Whatever regulation SPAD plans to enforce, we hope it would be beneficial to both consumers and the industry. Would you consider taking Uber daily if it is cheaper than buying a car?[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Can you confidently tell how far apart one building is from the next and navigate it without a proper scale? What about those little parts that are obscured by a building or a shadow? Can you tell what’s hidden there?Now imagine all of that detail compressed into the body of a baby girl and you’ve only begun to scrape the surface of how difficult surgeon Dr Redmond Burke’s operation was.Teegan Lexcen, a 4-month-old baby was admitted into the Niklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami, Florida because she was born with a misplaced heart. Without surgery, she would be dead by Christmas.The worst part? Doctors couldn’t see a way in to operate.I don’t think I need to tell you how delicate heart surgery is, or how difficult it can be. It becomes nigh impossible when you don’t have all the information you need.Burke says that surgeons need to be able to visualise the entire procedure before they step into the operating room, which is why many surgical teams passed on Teegan’s operation because they kept running into walls during this process: It seemed inoperable.Burke had the same problem as he had no way of knowing if a standard incision over the sternum would be enough, but “inoperable” was not a word he enjoyed using. Exhausting medical solutions, the team began looking for creative solutions and one particularly enterprising member uploaded the scans of Teegan’s chest to Sketchfab, converting them into 3D stereoscopic imagines, which allowed them to view it in VR.Virtual Reality. That was the answer. Burke said that with Google Cardboard and a smartphone he was able to see the patient’s entire heart by simply tilting his head. He could turn it and manipulate it as if he was already in the operating room.From there, Burke could see Teegan’s heart as well as her chest wall and with that information, he knew that a standard incision would indeed be fine.According to Burke, this solution came just in the nick of time; any longer and her kidneys may have suffered too much from her being put under. She would be alive, but on dialysis for the rest of her days.We’re floored that a little bit of cardboard and a smartphone actually saved someone’s life. That and good old fashioned human ingenuity of course.Burke views every operation as possible and it was down to whether the doctor had the confidence to perform it or not. With VR he could visualise the steps in his head and help him come up with a plan of operation for his team which allowed him to save his patient.Seven hours later, little Teegan was all patched up and ready for Christmas and ho, ho, ho-pefully for many more Christmases to come.[SOURCE, VIA]"

Yup, the company that brought you productivity apps such as Microsoft Office, OneDrive and OneNote is doing selfies and it’s called simply as the Microsoft Selfie.With more selfies taken each day, Apple is still reluctant of putting any form of selfie beautification features into its camera ap. Most smartphone these days, especially from China are equipped with selfie enhancing features that automatically smoothes your skin with some fine touches to your eyes. This trend has also caught on with mainstream brands including Samsung, Lenovo and even Sony. The Microsoft Selfie app is pretty straightforward. Just snap a picture or take an existing one, and it will automatically apply the necessary effects to make you look better. The selfie enhancement takes into consideration your age, gender, skin tone and lighting which is close to Xiaomi’s camera app. If you remembered, Microsoft had experimented with this Machine Learning feature on its How old do I look website. If the selfie pic isn’t good enough, you can still tweak the levels and select additional filters like you do on Instagram. You can tap on the compare button to compare the before and after effects. The app is currently only available for iOS users. This isn’t the first time Microsoft had made a selfie app as they had developed a Lumia version for Windows Phone.For the extreme narcissists, there are more advanced beautification apps like MeituPic that lets you touch up skin imperfections, enlarge eyes or make your face slimmer.

Alexander Wong,This might be the best alternative to KLIA Express,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/30/here-is-a-cheaper-way-to-go-to-klia/,"car sharing,comos,electric car,klia,klia express,klia express alternative,renault zoe,ride sharing,uber,uber malaysia,cool stuff,others","Cool stuff,Others",2015-12-30,"If you’re a frequent traveler, KLIA Express (ERL) is the best way to get to Kuala Lumpur International Airport in under 30 minutes. With everything going up, the fares will be increased to RM55/way effective 1st January 2016. That’s a hefty RM110 for two people heading to the airport. Is there a cheaper alternative? What if we tell you there’s another way of getting there with zero emission and it costs less than an Uber ride?COMOS, a ride-sharing provider that uses 100% electric vehicles has introduced an Airport Valet Service. For a flat rate of RM70, you can head to KLIA or KLIA2 in an electric-powered Renault Zoe. The service comes with a designated COMOS staff, so you can hop-on and hop-off without worrying about parking. Do note that the Renault Zoe is a compact hatchback, so the boot isn’t as spacious as a typical sedan car. The COMOS Airport Valet service would cost you RM70 which is inclusive of GST, toll and delivery charges to your location. So that equates to RM35/person for a trip for two or RM23.34/person for 3 pax. On the downside, it is only available from 9:00AM to 4:00PM, and it covers just the following areas in the Klang Valley. If you haven’t tried COMOS before, the first step of getting a key card would take a while. You would need to register for a membership which now costs RM50 for 1 year (Normal: RM300). Once that’s done, you can collect your COMOS card and start booking as follows:
1. Login to your COMOS account.
2. Go to “Search Cars” and select “(RM70) KLIA Valet Service” as your pick up location, followed by the date and time required.
3. Next, select “(RM70) KLIA Valet Service” as your drop off location.
4. After completing your booking, a COMOS representative will contact you to confirm your request.
You are advised to request the service at least 2 hours ahead of the intended time and it is subject to actual availability of cars. You may book for the next day but the option is only available after 10:00PM. This is a cashless service and the final amount will be charged to your registered credit card. You can read up more about the service here.COMOS was introduced as an alternative means to car ownership. Being a ride-sharing service, you only pay for membership and usage fees according to your usage. At the moment, the rental costs RM6 for 15 minutes with a minimum booking of 30 minutes (RM12). For an all day usage, it will cost you a flat rate of RM144. With its fleet of electric cars, there’s no fuel cost involved so you won’t need to return the car with a full tank. There are several COMOS pick up stations located around PJ and KL with more being planned out in the near future. Currently all bookings are done via its website on comos.com.my and soon they will be releasing a mobile app for iOS and Android.We’ve tried COMOS a couple of times and it is quite an experience driving a quiet vehicle that hums like a spaceship. Since it’s new, the number of stations with charging points are quite limited. It isn’t really that cost efficient for simple point to point trips since you’re required to return the vehicle to its limited pickup/drop off points. If you’re making a stop, you would still need to pay for parking, which defeats the purpose of saving time and money. This would probably make more sense once they have more stations around strategic points including shopping malls and office complexes. If COMOS isn’t viable due to timing and location, Uber is currently offering a flat rate of RM75 (excluding tolls) to KLIA/KLIA2. There’s no promo code required, and you can request anytime from now until 5th January 2016. Uber is available on Android, iOS and Windows Phone.If you’re traveling alone, KLIA Express is still the cheaper option overall. Despite the RM55/way announcement, there are additional discounts if you book return tickets and purchasing them online or using specific credit cards. At the moment, Mastercard holders are entitled to a 20% discount. A return KLIA Express ticket cost RM100 and it will cost you just RM80 which is equivalent to RM40 per way. That’s basically RM5 more than usual RM35/way price. [ SOURCE ]"

These projects are basically pet projects that their best and brightest decided to take up when given some project-specific time off.Samsung has released some small tidbits on what we’re to expect and so far they include: A “smart” belt
An advanced hand-motion controller for VR games
A “smart” UX system that allows you to take calls with the tip of your fingerThese innovative projects have been running under Samsung’s Creative Lab, an avenue for employees to build ideas from the ground up. First of the bunch is WELT – a smart (literal) belt that allows its users to keep tabs on their waistline by analysing daily habits and behaviours. This makes a lot of sense since everyone wears a belt. WELT’s smart innards are discreet and won’t resemble anything other than a regular looking… belt. WELT takes note of your waist size, eating frequencies, track steps and even notes your sedentary moments. Finally, the belt will go through all your data by sending it to its designated app and provide you with useful health related tips and plans. Who knows, maybe the engineer in charge will even steer us away from fast food joints by making the belt tighten itself based on GPS and geographical tagging places like KFC.“rink” is the next project that lets you “take mobile VR to the next level”. The device itself is a hand-held motion controller that further explores the possibilities of virtual reality technology. Combine that with Samsung’s Gear VR and consumers might just enter these VR realms themselves.We saved the best for last; here’s TipTalk, an amazing device that lets you play secret agent by allowing communication through a special watch strap and your fingertips. TipTalk allows its wearer to listen to sounds after pairing to smartphones, bringing your finger to your ear makes it seem like you’re suddenly wearing headphones. Answer calls in public and don’t worry about having eavesdroppers, apparently Samsung says loud environments won’t impede TipTalk. This smart strap can be attached to analog, digital and smart watches – after which, it’ll sync to your phone, allowing you to take calls and listen to music by placing a finger on your ear.Cool ain’t it?[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

Click “About Gear”
Click “Update Gear software”Meanwhile, we’d appreciate if Samsung further refined the low-battery warning prompt, which we felt was too passive and lead us to always finding a “dead” smartwatch on our wrist.

There hasn’t been much traction for their adoption with battery life still not lasting long enough for most to accept.

A tree, nothing, without its roots. A product, nothing, without its consumers. So what happens when a smartphone manufacturer gets slapped with a class action lawsuit filed by the very people who used to preach their excellence?Draaaama!More than a hundred infuriated iPhone 4s owners have filed a lawsuit against Apple, claiming USD5 million (around RM21.5 million) in damages, accusing them of significantly slowing down their devices with the new iOS 9 update. The lawsuit was filed with a New York district court, though no hearings have been set at this time.According to plaintiff Chiam Lerman and several others, the new update slowed the device down so much that it interfered with day-to-day usage.It seems that after upgrading, both first and third-party applications exhibited delayed launch times, slow response to touchscreen input and other problems. Overall performance was also affected by freezes and crash events.They also accuse Apple of engaging in deceptive trade practices and false advertising by proclaiming that the update is compatible with legacy smartphones dating back to the iPhone 4s models. The lawsuit also claims that Apple were well aware of iOS 9’s negative impacts on the iPhone 4s but went ahead with the marketing campaign anyway.The campaign advertised faster performance, enhanced security, longer battery life among other enticing features. To make matters worse, the company’s advertisements, website, and iOS page did not have any warning of potential compatibility issues for older devices.Apparently the complaint went after Apple’s iOS system itself, because when faced with a sluggish and slow device, it is more likely that the average Apple user would upgrade to a new iOS product instead of branching out. The reason being that transferring information across devices within the same ecosystem is much easier. Plus there is also the familiarity factor.It isn’t too surprising that a new iOS update would slow down older devices because each new update is designed to take advantage of the hardware from the recent models. This includes a host of new features and improvements that an older device may not have even dreamt was possible, much less have support for it.Apple has been in this situation before, back in 2011, where plaintiffs complained that iOS 4 turned their iPhone 3G into “iBricks”. That case was tossed out a year later and it seems likely that this lawsuit will suffer the same fate.One of the main arguments in the iOS vs Android war was that Apple always pushed new updates, even to old devices such as the iPhone 4s while Android devices have a realistic lifespan of 2 years. After 2 years, it is very unlikely that your Android device would be getting any updates from its manufacturer.Apple fans argued that this was because Android was so fragmented, with so many different manufacturers making so many different versions of the Android OS. iOS isn’t the same because everything was unified under one banner.That said, there is an exception to this Android dilemma: The Nexus devices. Nexus smartphones tend to receive OS updates much quicker and for longer than most other devices. But unlike what’s happening to these unfortunate iPhone 4s users, each Android update usually improves the performance of older devices due to improved optimisation of the OS.This brings Apple users to what looks like a difficult decision. Do you update your OS to get new features and better security at the risk of sluggish performance? Or do you stick to what already works and brave potential security risks? Let us know in the comments below.If you’re as frustrated as these users and think Apple does this on purpose so that people will be forced to buy a new iPhone, don’t hesitate to drop your opinion in the comment box too![SOURCE, VIA]"

It even helped save a life. The problem is that unless you’re OK with Google Cardboard or other cardboard-like VR goggles, a standalone mobile phone VR headset — like the Samsung Gear VR — is quite pricey.Thankfully we can always count on China to produce more affordable options and with FiresVR, proper smartphone VR gear could become easily accessible to everyone.Dubbed the “Xiaomi of China’s VR industry”, FiresVR is looking to shake up the pricing of quality VR headsets with its new JiDome-1. Although China has produced many cardboard-like VR pieces in the country, the JiDome-1 is the first “serious” VR product that can be compared to the likes of the Gear VR.The JiDome-1 has a high-precision 9-axis gyroscope and proximity sensor as well as redefined weak interaction buttons. It also has a built-in air-cooling system with a balanced cooling efficiency and working noise. This cooling system will hopefully work well to keep your device cool and stave away moisture or fogging.While the Gear VR is only compatible with Samsung devices, this JiDome-1 is compatible with a variety of Android smartphones as long as they meet the design requirements. For now, it is already compatible with 30% of all Android devices but FiresVR wants to push it to exceed 50% compatibility in 2016.As a proverbial cherry on top of the icing, the device is currently being sold at RMB199 (around RM131.60) which is a whole lot cheaper than what the Gear VR goes for. There is a catch, though: When it goes on sale in Q1 of 2016, it will only be available to developers, but it is expected to reach consumers in the second quarter of 2016. Because of that, a consumer price has not yet been released.If you can’t wait that long, there’re always more options for VR headsets, head on over to our gadget gift guide for more information.[SOURCE, VIA]"

As the transition is taking place with new reload cards entering the shelves, a couple of telcos are dishing out special offers that will give you more than your money’s worth. Read on to find out what offers are available.For Digi, they are giving an extra 8% bonus on top of your actual airtime. So if you purchased a RM10 topup at RM10.60, you’ll be getting 80 sen bonus extra. The bonus airtime will be will be given to you within 72 hours and this is only applicable until 31st December 2015. According to the FAQ, this is only applicable to the current reload cards that carry the prefix “10”. The newer reloads that are sold without GST (RM10 RRP=RM10 Airtime) or carries the prefix “11” will not be entitled to the 8% bonus. The free airtime will be valid only for 5 days. For Xpax Prepaid by Celcom, they are doing something similar but they are giving only 6% extra. This is basically matching the same value ringgit to ringgit based the retail price. So a RM10.60 top up will grant you an extra RM0.60 airtime, giving a total value of RM10.60. Strangely, the Xpax offer is only valid until 30th December 2015. Like Digi, the extra airtime will be granted within 72 hours, but take note that this is only applicable for domestic use only (not for roaming). TuneTalk probably has the most generous offer of all. With a RM100 top up, they are giving RM20 extra airtime plus 3GB of mobile data.

If you’re still unable to access iflix on your UniFi network, it might take awhile. In the scenario that you’re still prompted to login, an alternative method would be removing the iflix app and reinstalling it again on your mobile device.It is a little patchy as we still couldn’t get iflix to work on our Mi Pad and an iPhone 6. Good luck with all your binge watching, make sure it doesn’t affect your productivity."

Based on the new diagrams, it seems that Samsung will keep to old habits and maintain a 5.2-inch screen on the Galaxy S7, while the curved Galaxy S7 edge variant will get a larger 5.5-inch display.Then on, things are pretty much the same, as information has shown that the rear of both Galaxy S7 should look very similar. Pointing towards the backings of these smartphones to feature the same metal and glass composition – a real sore of a fingerprint magnet.Taking a thorough look at the diagram, Android Authority spotted that Samsung looks to have omitted the IR blaster this time around, continuing what they’ve done on their larger devices: Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+.At the same time, a Korean tech site has released a different diagram, that reaffirms the two different sizings for the flat Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge.Based on earlier rumours and leaks, many have concluded that these bigger screens will also see Samsung implement pressure sensitive technology for the first time, if their patent filings were to materialise so quickly. Otherwise, there has been whispers of a microSD slot making a return; a feature that would be welcomed openly by those who strayed away from Samsung devices after dropping external storage all-together.Camera-wise, the new BRITECELL sensors that were revealed back in November should make an appearance as well. Touted to enhance low light performance by increasing sensitivity and reduce size too by 17% – leading us to assume the Galaxy S7 series will have a reduced camera bump.It’s more than likely that Samsung will announce these devices during MWC 2016 in Barcelona, that’s scheduled to begin on the 22nd of February, so be sure to expect more leaks as the date nears. Do let us know in the comments below what you make of this information and if you’d consider getting a Galaxy  S7 or Galaxy S7 edge.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA ]"
Rory Lee,This could be the Samsung tablet worth waiting for,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/29/this-could-be-the-samsung-tablet-worth-waiting-for/,"android,rumour mill,samsung 12 inch tablet,samsung 12 inch windows 10 tablet,samsung 12 inch windows tablet,samsung tablet,samsung windows 10 tablet,samsung windows tablet,windows,windows 10,mobile devices,samsung","Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-12-29,"Let’s face it. Android isn’t the most optimised operating system for tablets. OK, it’s quite useless actually since you can do practically everything on your Android smartphone anyway.So maybe Windows 10, despite how incomplete and frustrating it is, is the way to go. Samsung certainly thinks so since what looks like their latest 12-inch Windows 10 tablet was just certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG.Rumours that Samsung were working on a 12″ Windows 10 tablet have been floating around for quite some time now but this is the first piece of solid confirmation that this device is indeed in the pipeline. According to SamMobile Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG certifications are usually a good indicator that the device is on the way to the shelves soon.The 12-inch unit bearing the model number SM-W700 is said to feature a screen resolution of either 2560×1600 or 3840×2400. On the inside, the device will allegedly be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM.Some have said that the tablet may also come with an S Pen which, coupled with the full Windows 10 experience, could certainly improve productivity. If Samsung adds a keyboard accessory then we may have another Surface/iPad Pro challenger on our hands.As Android phones continue to get bigger, the equivalent OS tablet is becoming less and less relevant because people can already do so much on their phone. Front facing speakers plus a 5.7″ Smartphone can provide just as much immersion (if not more) as a side/rear speakered 7.9-inch tablet.It’s just not worth carrying an extra device just so you have a slightly bigger screen. Keep in mind bigger, in this sense, doesn’t always mean better as in general smartphones have a better pixel density than tablets and a better pixel density usually equals a better viewing experience.Let me put it this way, spreading a single cup of waffle batter over a baking tray the size of your palm would get you a thicker, fluffier, and more satisfying waffle versus spreading the same amount over a tray the size of a dining table.The same concept applies to screens. If you spread 1080p over a 5.7″ display, you’re bound to get a better screen than if it was spread over 12-inches of real estate.So if media consumption is not the best, productivity has to be the tablet’s redeeming factor, and in that Windows 10 beats Android hands down. Considering how wonky Windows 10 is, that’s saying quite a lot about how unoptimised Android is for the big screen.The Korean electronics giant isn’t the only one launching a Windows 10 tablet though as Xiaomi has just released its Mi Pad 2 in both Android and Windows 10. It has been a while since Samsung has launched a Windows-powered tablet but it seems that they’ve recognised that if you want a tablet, Android is no bueno.[SOURCE]"
Alexander Wong,Here’s all you need to know about Prepaid and GST for 2016,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/28/malaysia-prepaid-gst-reload-refunds-2016/,"budget 2016,digi,digi prepaid,gst,gst prepaid,gst rebate,gst reload,hotlink prepaid,malaysia gst,prepaid,prepaid gst refund,prepaid reload,prepaid reload gst,prepaid top up,top up gst,tune talk,tunetalk,xpax,xpax prepaid,celcom,hotlink,industry in general,players on the field,u mobile,xox","Celcom,DiGi,Hotlink,Industry in General,Players on the Field,TuneTalk,U Mobile,XOX",2015-12-28,"Beginning 1st January 2016, all prepaid reloads in Malaysia will be sold without the extra 6% charge. This is in line with the directive to exempt prepaid reloads from GST. It doesn’t mean that prepaid is free from GST, as it will be charged upon usage, instead of being paid upfront. Fortunately, the government will be offering GST rebates as announced during Budget 2016. To address concerns, MCMC has published the full details ahead of its implementation on new year’s day Beginning 1st January, a RM10 prepaid reload will be sold at RM10, while a RM30 prepaid reload is sold at RM30 just like the old days. So you’re getting a full ringgit to ringgit value without the extra 6% charge. The official FAQ also states that old top up tickets must be sold at the original price without the extra 6% charge. At the moment, several prepaid brands are offering extra bonus and rewards if you top up by 31st December.However with the new mechanism, the GST charge will kick in when you reload. So after activation of a RM10 top up, you’ll get RM9.43 airtime with RM0.57 (6%) being deducted for GST. To the regular consumer, it appears to have no difference since eventually you’re getting 6% less versus paying 6% more. This will be running from 1st January until 31st December 2016 and there’s no mention if it will be extended to the following year. The good news, of course, there’s a full GST rebate on prepaid usage. This will be applicable only to Malaysian citizens based on the NRIC or police/army identification number during registration. According to MCMC, the 6% GST will be refunded within 24 hours. So if you’ve topped up RM10, you should be getting the earlier deducted RM0.57 back to your prepaid account. In a nutshell, Malaysians should be able to enjoy the full reload amount but provided that you’re registered. You are advised to check with your telco provider to ensure they have your correct details. The GST rebate is only for prepaid users, so Malaysian postpaid users will still continue to incur the 6% charge in their monthly bills.All domestic use including phone calls, SMS, mobile services and data are GST chargeable. International roaming including data usage overseas are zero rated and non-Malaysian prepaid users are also eligible for a refund.

Both the Lumia 950 and 950 XL were plagued with bugs and poor (particularly plasticky) build quality which irked even the most steadfast of Windows Phone fans.Perhaps Microsoft simply doesn’t know how to make good flagship mobile devices, but that’s a tough claim to make considering not many are having a go at it.Until now.Early this month, a fancy new Windows Phone dubbed the HP Falcon was spotted on GFXBench. What caught everyone’s eye was the dragon it had beating at the heart of the device; a Snapdragon 820 to be specific. It was the first Windows Phone device to have been spotted with Qualcomm‘s latest baby in the driver’s seat.What’s more, the GFXBench entry also indicated that the device would feature a large 5.8″ 2560×1440 pixel panel with a 20-megapixel primary camera and a 12MP front-facing selfie camera.Mmm, yummy specs.There were some oddities, however, as memory was only listed at 1GB of RAM with a peculiar 43GB of internal storage. Then again, it isn’t uncommon for manufacturers to configure the device differently when running benchmarks.In any case, it looks like there could be a monstrous Windows Phone (likely running Windows 10 Mobile) set to be released sometime next year. In fact, a new report out of Germany’s Dr Windows claims that the device could see an official unveiling at the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona next February.However, the report also notes that HP has yet to give the project the final go-ahead. With specs that exceed even Microsoft’s own Windows flagship devices (plus it could be cheaper), could this be the Windows Phone messiah fans have been waiting for?We doubt it. Especially if Windows 10 Mobile doesn’t receive the updates it needs in time. Though we haven’t spent time with the Lumia flagships, reports and reviews point to a worrying trend of incomplete (plus buggy) software, similar to that on the Surface line of 2-in-1 devices.Reviewers have noted some minor problems such as 4K video recording not working properly to big problems like the home screen disappearing entirely after an app crashes — something that happens quite often apparently — which shouldn’t happen in a completed product. If these problems lie with Windows 10 Mobile, then all the hardware in the world won’t be able to save the experience.It is admirable that it seems like HP wants to show Microsoft how to really build a Windows 10 Mobile flagship, but unless Redmond steps up its own game, the new device will likely not amount to anything. What a shame that would be.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"
Alexander Wong,Is this Xiaomi’s new budget smartphone?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/29/xiaomi-redmi-3-smartphone-certification/,"android,redmi 3,smartphone,xiaomi,xiaomi redmi 3,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-12-29,"The Redmi 2 is probably the best entry-level device for those with a tight budget. It offers a decent 4.7″ HD 720p screen, dual-SIM slots and 4G LTE for under RM400. While the specs are impressive, the build quality is still quite plasticky, which is understandable for its low price tag. Following the release of its metal-clad Redmi Note 3, Xiaomi appears to be taking the same premium route for its upcoming budget device.The phone you’re seeing here has just appeared on China’s TENNA certification and it is believed to be the new Redmi 3. It gets an all metal back like its larger Redmi Note 3 but without a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Being a unibody design, the back cover doesn’t seem to be removable, which means you can’t replace the battery on your own. According to its purported spec-sheet, there will be a microSD expansion, which is likely to be housed on the SIM tray slot. The Redmi 3 is said to be having a slightly larger 5″ HD 720p display and it is expected to run on a higher 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM. On-board storage is listed at 16GB and it also comes with a standard 13MP + 5MP camera combination. This is quite a huge step up, pushing the Redmi into the mid-range category, even if this was an “enhanced version”. With better specs and premium materials, we are curious if Xiaomi could maintain its affordable 699CNY (RM463) price tag as the Redmi 2. It is likely to priced higher but it shouldn’t exceed its bigger Redmi Note 3 that starts from 899 CNY (about RM595). [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

We put these four heavyweights in the camera department to the 4K video recording test. And while we understand that most people out there won’t have the technology to view 4K content, we decided that choosing the highest recording resolution for all four devices would be the fairest gauge. Duking it out will be:Nexus 6P
iPhone 6s Plus
Samsung Galaxy Note5
Sony Xperia Z5 DualA slow but steady advancement of camera technology has us finding that most flagship smartphones are now capable of being the only device we’d use to take images and video, rendering point and shoots somewhat obsolete. Easily put – the best camera you’ll have is the one in your pocket.How you use that technology will be dictated by the photography skills you’ve honed throughout your “journey”, if there’s one to begin with. That said, a professional photographer could definitely take better photos than someone that has little/no knowledge on the matter. Of course, when using a smartphone, you don’t necessarily have to be knowledgeable in photography to begin with but have you seen those campaigns dedicated to showing off what these smartphone cameras are capable of?Apple has been running a campaign to show-off what the iPhones can do. Other smartphone makers didn’t bother following suit but you can check out their imaging and video capabilities through a quick search.When 4K video recording hit the scene back in 2013, we thought capturing content at that resolution was crazy; more so, when you’re viewing it on screens that hover around 5-inches.But we’re not here to argue about whether Full HD or Quad HD screens are sufficient when it comes to actually viewing the content on them. We’re here to see how 4 smartphones perform when tasked to handle the rough and bumpy Malaysian roads that often surprise you with a new pothole or two with every passing day – obviously, OIS would be important here.The following are a breakdown of the 4 respective specs:All four devices had some form of image/video stabilisation; the Nexus 6P uses software based technology, shared also by the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual which uses its own software-based two-stage SteadyShot stabilisation.On the other hand, Apple is the only one that uses solely hardware based stabilisation. Particularly special out of the bunch, the Galaxy Note5 uses both hardware and software video stabilisation but this combination is only available when shooting up to Full HD (1080p) at 30fps.We thought it was clear which came out on top but feel free to share your opinions."

Piles upon piles of perfectly good food were thrown it out because they were slightly old, or looked a little less than perfect.The sad thing is that this is the same for most things, including smartphones. If you’re a smartphone buyer, odds are you have bought more than one device. The only problem is, what do you do with your old phone when your new one arrives?Do you toss it out? Give it to a niece/nephew/child (let’s be real they probably have better phones than your old iPhone anyway)? Try to sell it to on a certain popular local forum filled with lowballers? Well, Vmall now has a new option for you.Vmall Malaysia is currently conducting a BETA test for their “Trade-in & Go Green With Honor!” programme, in collaboration with LTG Technologies, where — yep you guessed it — you can trade in your old devices and be compensated for it.You won’t be getting money, though. Instead, you’ll be getting a Vmall code which you can then use to redeem a Vmall voucher which you can use to purchase any device on the website.To put it in simpler terms:1. Head on over here.
2. Then, hit “Start Here” and choose your old device’s make and model from the drop-down menu in the resulting page.
3. Hit “Next Step”, then choose your device’s condition and hit “Next Step”.
4. Fill in your details in the resulting page and hit next once more.
5. You’ll arrive at a page where they will ask you to confirm your information and agree to some terms and conditions. Smack that “agree” button and you should be set.At this moment, the number of devices per manufacturer, with the exception being Apple and Samsung, is rather limited. Hopefully, they will add support for more devices further down the line.If your trade-in value is RM40 or higher, LTG will arrange for a pickup at your specified address free of charge. Once LTG receives your products, they will evaluate and see if your devices are worth the quoted amount. If they sign off on it, you will receive a Vmall voucher code of equal value to that of your devices.If they don’t, they will inform you of the new value of your device, allowing you to decide whether or not you want to take the offer. If you don’t respond within 3 days, they will automatically assume you accept the revised offer.The best thing about this programme is that you can register any amount of smartphones, from old and functioning to broken phones (yes they accept broken phones if it is within their criteria).However, remember to register all your devices at one go so that you receive a single code for a single voucher. Not only will this help you hit that RM40 free delivery sweet spot, it will also help when you make purchases on Vmall, because you can only use one voucher per purchase.Keep in mind that this programme is only in BETA but it is expected to go live sometime early next year. If you’ve had your eye on an honor or Huawei device, this seems like a pretty decent incentive to go and get one.[SOURCE]"

A few months ago, we’ve reviewed the Samsung Gear VR Innovator Edition and it offers an immersive experience when paired with a Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Retailing at RM799 back then, it is quite an expensive toy if compared to a Google Cardboard. However you do get a proper hands-free usage and it even comes with hardware control buttons at the sides. Now Samsung Malaysia has brought in a new one that supports more models and most importantly, a lower price tag. Dubbed simply as the Gear VR, the new version is more affordable at RM459 (inclusive of GST). With its new flagship phablets around, the new Gear VR now supports 4 models – Galaxy Note5, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. Compared to the Innovator Edition that we’ve tried with the S6, the new version uses a softer upper strap without the hard piece, that secures the headset across your head. You do however still get a touchpad on the right which is slightly improved for better feel at the fingertips. The optical components remain unchanged with a 96 degree field of view and a 54-70 IPD coverage. The Gear VR also gets additional controls which include a volume rocker, back button and a manual dial at the top for minor focus adjustments. As it is powered by Oculus, you’ll gain access to a library of apps and games that are designed for an immersive experience. If you are interested, you can find the Gear VR at Samsung Stores.

And we mean big feature.As our demands for smartphone performance and portability grows, manufacturers have often skimmed on battery life to ensure that their device stays as lean and mean as possible. But that means they hardly ever last a day, much less two days. Carrying a power bank or a charger has become a norm in our society.Acer has good news for those who want raw, unadulterated battery power, because their Liquid Z630 smartphone comes with an enormous 4,000 mAh replaceable battery. With a battery this size it becomes very unlikely that you will need to carry a powerbank around, much less another battery.In fact, that massive battery supports USB OTG (on-the-go) charging so you can even help a friend out by giving them a quick top-up if their device is running low on battery. Mighty handy in a pinch and for RM659, this is one of the most affordable and good valued devices with a 4,000 mAh battery that supports OTG charging in Malaysia.This is because the device itself does boast pretty decent specs, with a quad-core MediaTek processor clocked at 1.3GHz paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. This should ensure that everyday tasks and light to moderate application multitasking will go on without a hitch. It also has a 5.5-inch HD IPS panel and an 8-megapixel front and rear camera combo.8-megapixels is quite a lot for a front facing camera, especially in this device’s price bracket. Even some flagship devices only rock a 5MP sensor. More megapixels mean that your selfies will be much more detailed and less pixelated.If you don’t fancy such a big device, or you simply feel that you don’t need all that battery power, Acer does offer a smaller device with a 5” HD IPS display, the Acer Liquid Z530. The name suggests that this smartphone would be a downgrade from the the Liquid Z630, but it also shares its bigger brother’s internal hardware as well as camera optics. That’s a pretty good deal for RM559.Acer also has an entry level device in the Liquid Z line, the Liquid Z330, priced at RM439. It comes bundled with a 1.1GHz Snapdragon 210 quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM running underneath its 4.5” screen. That should be more than enough for you to get a feel of what the Android experience is all about, making this device the perfect starter smartphone for anyone.All three devices will have blazingly fast dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity and will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Acer’s Liquid UI running over it. Additionally, these devices will have the Acer Float Apps which essentially allows users to open more than one application and multitask at the same time. Acer also bundles a Float Caller which appears as a mini popup when a call comes in, letting the user decide how to respond without interrupting what they’re doing.Every one of the trio will also have what Acer calls the Quick Mode. The Quick Mode functions to allow users to pick between three customised layout options: Standard Mode (for those familiar with smartphones), Easy Mode (for those just starting out), and Basic Mode (locks down application and usage for kids).There is also a Kids Center application which grants parental control over the device for a safer browsing, viewing and playing environment for your child. These devices also come with Acer’s Bluelightshield which reduces strain on the eyes by reducing the amount of blue light emissions from the display.For more information, head over to Acer’s Liquid Smartphone page."
Rory Lee,What if your car could see?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/23/what-if-your-car-could-see/,"autonomous cars,segnet,self-driving cars,cool stuff",Cool stuff,2015-12-23,"Autonomous cars are the next big thing. Well, it’s actually the current-to-next big thing, but we digress. The point is that people are apparently bored of driving cars and want systems and programs to drive them around everywhere so that they can sit in the back seat and pretend to be Donald Trump.The only problem with self-driving cars is that they aren’t able to function properly in the real world as you simply can’t replace human instinct and reaction when things on the road get challenging. Why? Because cars can’t see in real time the way we do, so it makes it very difficult to make split second decisions when that double parked car pulls out suddenly.Apparently, now they can.
Thanks to SegNet, a new system created by the University of Cambridge, your dreams of being driven around by software might just come into fruition. SegNet can “read” the road in front if it, allowing it to differentiate various elements like the sky, other cars, road markings and even people.SegNet “sees” the road in an RGB image and then classifies different layers and objects using a Bayesian analysis of the scene. According to the release, the system can “take an image of a street scene it hasn’t seen before and classify it, sorting objects into 12 different categories in real time”. It can also apparently deal with light, shadow and night environments and currently labels more than 90% of pixels correctly.Unlike laser/radar-guided systems that require expensive base sensors which cost more than the car itself, SegNet has been “trained” by a group of Cambridge undergraduates who manually labelled every pixel in over 5,000 images. Once that was complete, the researchers proceeded to train the system for over 2 days, after which one of the students notes that it is surprisingly good at recognising things in an image.From our testing, we tend to agree. It does a remarkable job at differentiating between the 12 elements though there is quite a lot of polishing to do, especially at night. As this system is “trained” though, it can only get better over time as it sees more images and learns to recognise more elements.One of the biggest problems about driving around in Malaysia is that the lines are never where they should be. Add that to the fact that people double park like there is no tomorrow and that the roads have potholes the size of Canada, even human beings would have trouble navigating our treacherous streets, what more a software?With this though, there is the potential to train the system to recognise these little nuances that make up our little snowflake of a country. Given the right circumstances, the possibilities are quite endless. Although the researchers say that this is still far from being able to be implemented into autonomous cars, we could possibly see this in a domestic robot – like a robot vacuum cleaner – in the short term.From where we stand, trust in an autonomous car seems to be the biggest hurdle for people to overcome. Would you relinquish control of your car in a highway to a computer program developed by some bloke in a laboratory?If you want to test out this system for yourself, head on over to their website and you can upload a picture of your own to be scanned by SegNet, or you can browse through the sample images they’ve uploaded.[SOURCE, VIA, IMAGE SOURCE]"

Well, for starters, it costs roughly the same as the Samsung Galaxy Note5 but it doesn’t have nearly as many features or boast nearly the same specifications.What’s more, it comes with Huawei’s EMUI which is slowly starting to look like every other Chinese smartphone manufacturer’s Android Skin.A perplexing smartphone at this price point then, when they clearly could have made it a much more well-rounded device. Well, Huawei is trying to sweeten the deal with their Malaysian launch of the Rose Gold variant of the Mate S.It is now on sale in all authorised Huawei authorised retailers and the price will remain the same at RM2,698. It will sport the same internal specifications and camera, but now that it comes in pink – uh Rose Gold – it suddenly should appeal to the “special woman in your life”.I’m personally more concerned with the performance and build of a device, but what do I know about what women want. I will say that it is kind of refreshing to at least get a second colour option because let’s face it, the Mate S’s Gold always seemed a little too tacky."

Steve Ballmer unfortunately took upon the intimidating task and his reign lasted a good 13 years. A robust character, Ballmer excelled in his early days but by 2012 stock prices were idling too long and that ensued criticism of dropping everything that he had managed to achieve. Many have speculated that the failure of Surface RT tablet was the last straw for Microsoft’s overseeing board of directors, with a US$ 900 million write off being a mistake that couldn’t go unnoticed.Two years after Ballmer’s retirement, Satya Nadella has filled some big shoes and it has been an upward journey so far. Akin to Ballmer, the Surface Pro 4 sits in a precarious position as it has never been easy living up to your past successes.Microsoft said during their product launch that the Surface Pro 4 is measurable to the MacBook Air but we haven’t seen a refresh on that since March 2015. And that wasn’t a huge facelift to begin with, so 2016 could really shape up to be a big year for laptops and convertibles; Apple says they won’t bother making anything in-between the MacBook Air and iPad Pro but they may rework their formula – ala a Pencil instead of a stylus.Competition outside of Apple has everyone trying to “emulate” the Surface(s) and what they can do. The first name that comes to mind is the Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700, closely followed by HP’s Spectre x2. These two try to do what the Surface Pro 4 does but they don’t match up in terms of specs.This time around, more power equates to being more expensive. People might stay away hearing that, though we hope you’ll give this a read first before making any preconceived notions just based on the price."

What’s the point of having fast internet if you don’t have enough quota? That’s like having a Ferrari with a tiny fuel tank!The folks at Celcom apparently is aware of the increasing needs of its customers and they have just announced what they claim to be the greatest internet plans yet. How about 40GB of internet at just RM100 a month?Not to be confused with the Celcom First Blue and Celcom First Gold plans revealed not too long ago, Celcom has introduced another similar sounding postpaid product that’s designed for data-only users. Basically for those needing a data SIM for their tablets and possibly MiFi devices. The star of the show is the Celcom First Gold Internet plan that offers a whopping 40GB of internet. Before you get too excited, mind you that the actual mobile data is only 6GB and it gets an extra 4GB for weekend use (1GB per weekend). The balance 30GB? That’s coming from off-peak (1am-7am) mobile data quota of 12GB and Celcom WiFi quota of 6GB plus additional 12GB WiFi quota for off-peak (1am-7am) use. Seriously who uses Celcom WiFi, let alone being able to access one during off-peak hours? Even the WiFi coverage map gives an impression that it’s as wide as their mobile network.If you’re a light data user, the Celcom First Blue Plan offers an accumulative 6GB of internet for RM45/month. Basically, this is the same perks as the normal Celcom First Blue postpaid plan for smartphones. Both First Blue Internet and First Gold Internet options let you carry forward unused data up to 2GB and 6GB respectively to the following month. Note that these new plans are data-only, so you can’t use it for phone calls, but strangely SMS is permitted.

The latest iPad Pro 128GB will be offered too but so far there’s no details from Celcom on its bundled pricing."
Rory Lee,"HTC’s One X9 is definitely no flagship, but maybe that’s not such a bad thing",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/28/htcs-one-x9-is-definitely-no-flagship-but-maybe-thats-not-such-a-bad-thing/,"android,android marshmallow,htc,htc one,htc one x9,htc one x9 launch,htc one x9 launch china,one x9 launch,one x9 launch china,smart phone,smartphone,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-28,"MORE HORSEPOWER. That’s usually a buyer’s biggest criteria when looking for a smartphone. It’s also what people look for when determining the value-for-money aspect of a device, as consumers will try their best to squeeze every bit of horsepower for as low of a price as possible.It is these buyers that were ultimately disappointed when HTC launched the One A9 because it had decidedly mediocre specs for a not-low-at-all asking price of USD400. In a world where smartphone manufacturers are churning out devices with incredible specs for an equally incredible low price, this is simply unacceptable. Thankfully, HTC’s new “hero” device seems to rectify this problem, to some extent at least.Rumours have been floating around for awhile now about HTC’s new One X9. Early leaks suggested that it could run the latest top-of-the-line processor from Qualcomm or MediaTek, which reignited the fire within the hearts of many an HTC fan. However, as time progressed, the rumours changed and on paper it looked like the One X9 was going to be another disappointment.Well, the device has finally come out from the shadows and at first glance, it definitely doesn’t look like the flagship device everyone was clamouring for. Then again, since this was launched this year, were we realistically expecting it to outperform the One M9 especially since it doesn’t even bear the M badge?The One X9 sports a 5.5″ 1080p panel (though there doesn’t seem to be any information on whether it will be an AMOLED or IPS screen) which results in a pixel density of 401 ppi that HTC claims has a 170-degree viewing angle. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 processor and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of internal storage. Thankfully, HTC has included a microSD slot that allows expansion up to 2TB.It will also feature a reasonably large 3,000 mAh battery and support for dual-SIM. Optics-wise, the device sports a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with optical image stabilisation and 4K video recording, plus a 5MP f/2.8 front-facing shooter. It is likely that the device will come pre-loaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, much like the HTC One A9.Although the specs are nothing to shout about, the device does bring back HTC’s much-loved BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers, something that is missing from it’s smaller brother, the One A9. HTC also went further down “nostalgia alley”, bringing back their backlit capacitive keys, which is placed where the HTC logo usually goes. One aspect that will be missed is the absence of a fingerprint sensor, something that is available on the HTC One A9.Another serving of good news is that the metallic smartphone looks to retail at a lower price than the One A9, coming in at 2,399 Yuan, which translates to around RM1,598. Yes, if you did pick up on it, the retail price is in CNY which means that this device — as of now — has only been launched in China with no information about availability elsewhere. This device, it seems, represents HTC’s stab at trying to get a bigger cut of the affordable premium smartphone market by competing with other Chinese manufacturers on their home soil.If you think horsepower is the be all and end all of smartphones, then this HTC One X9 will look like another disappointing HTC “hero” device that could have been so much more. It isn’t the best value-for-money device out there, but is a device’s worth measured only by how well it does on benchmarks? Sure, 4GB of RAM looks good on paper, but can you realistically feel the difference between 4GB and 3GB of RAM?Fit and finish has always been one of HTC’s strongest selling points. That and their front-facing speakers, both of which can be found on One X9. It honestly doesn’t look too bad either — except for that slightly sketchy camera visor — and based on the company’s track record, they certainly know how to do metal unibodies. The device’s closest competitor would probably be the Sony Xperia M5 Dual, and based on build alone, we definitely prefer a metal finish to the Xperia M5 Dual’s fingerprint-magnet glass-plastic construction.With proper optimisation, these specs should get you through day-to-day usage without a hitch and for a frankly reasonable price tag, this doesn’t seem like that bad a deal for HTC fans. Yeah, sure, you won’t be able to brag about it to your friends but then again, there aren’t that many brag-worthy HTC devices to begin with. With HTC’s flagships only managing to stay afloat as well as the Titanic could, perhaps the midrange premium market is where they can reclaim some of their former glory.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"
Arif Lee,This could be the biggest leap in space travel since the moon landing,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/22/this-could-be-the-biggest-leap-in-space-travel-since-the-moon-landing/,"aerospace,america,china,dragon,elon musk,elon musk spacex,falcon 1,falcon 9,falcon heavy,landing zone 1,nasa,orbcomm,orbcomm-2 mission,rocket,russia,space,space travel,spacecraft,spaceship,spacex,travel,usa,cool stuff",Cool stuff,2015-12-22,"Try, try and try again. We’ve just seen a spacecraft do the impossible, the first BIG step for man into space travel and smaller steps towards colonising Mars – Elon Musk’s long-term mission through SpaceX. Launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the Falcon 9 has just made huge advancements in reusable rockets.Let’s now talk about what SpaceX is all about. One of many of Elon Musk’s brainchilds, Space X is a private space company and they’ve done some amazing things – launching the Falcon 1 in 2008 being one of them, leading to NASA handing them a contract worth US$ 1.6 billion. Fast-track through their history, the space capable delivery service (yes, we said it) has delivered 15 deliveries, some for NASA, and some for satellite missions. Though 6 months ago, SpaceX received a rude awakening, after 20 successful stints, the predecessor of the Falcon 9 blew up on the way up.So what did they do today that is such a big deal?They launched a rocket, went into orbit, released 11 satellites, floated sideways (in orbit), re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and made a successful propulsion based landing. It’s a big deal because once someone does (did) this, it translates to a major breakthrough for the aerospace industry. A mode of transportation that can be reused, over multiple occasions for travel but through space! Making future travel into space a whole lot cheaper.
This was the game-plan that the company laid out for the successful launch today:
*click for a bigger image*SpaceX just did something that was never done before by country-backed space programs – NASA, China and Russia included. These programs have spent an unimaginable amount of money to propel the human frontier into space and it has been more about showing who has the biggest “package” so to speak rather than bringing people to other planets.Successfully launching the Falcon 9 today, the company will continuously innovate their technology, eventually making the overall cost of space travel a lot cheaper in the long-run. Well I guess Musk’s mission of colonising Mars just got a lot more realistic. Long exposure of launch, re-entry, and landing burns pic.twitter.com/Vw1ZJAtvhy— SpaceX (@SpaceX) December 22, 2015Putting this scene in a much smaller scale:“This is hard. If you scale down all the sizes, it’s like firing a pencil over the top of a skyscraper and trying to land it on a shoe box on the ground—on a windy day. SpaceX likens the challenge of controlling the descent through the atmosphere to “trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm.” Popular Mechanics calls it “a tense juggling act, where any one of thousands of moving parts can push the entire system into mayhem. If the rocket does land softly on the barge, it’s because millions of insanely detailed self-adjustments have kept the Falcon 9’s composure as it dove through chaos.”Looking forward, SpaceX will hope to allow people to buy a ticket to Mars for only US$ 500,000 – an anthill compared to the figure estimated by NASA back in 2004, US$ 10 billion per person. Their next step is making the Mars Colonial Transporter a reality, a spaceship that will hold at least 100 people.Musk hopes that by 2070, a high-tech metropolis will exist…. on Mars and we hope that it becomes a reality.Watch the whole spectacle here:[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"
Rory Lee,It looks like John Chen isn’t done pissing BlackBerry fans off,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/22/it-looks-like-john-chen-isnt-done-pissing-blackberry-fans-off/,"blackberry,blackberry priv,blackberry priv discount,blackberry priv price cut,john chen,priv discount,priv price cut,android,industry in general,mobile apps,mobile devices,mobile os,promotions","Android,BlackBerry,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Promotions",2015-12-22,"What do you do when one of your devices fails to meet sales targets? You take drastic measures, that’s what. Take a look at action camera maker GoPro’s dramatic slashing of the GoPro Hero4 Session’s price, effectively halving its original USD400 price tag. It was simply too expensive for what it did and how it stacked up against GoPro’s own line, what more the competition.BlackBerry CEO John Chen apparently has the same idea because he recently said that the company’s latest (and only) Android smartphone, the PRIV, will be receiving a price cut next year. So, early PRIV adopters…oops?When everyone found out that the slider device would see an official launch in Malaysia, everyone began speculating on a price for BlackBerry’s flagship device. Simply converting its exorbitant American pricing of USD699 to our frankly depressing Ringgit, yielded a figure close to RM3,000 which caused some distress among the smartphone community.Then we found out that the PRIV would be sold at RM3,559 and everyone went nuts. Why would anyone ever pay that much money for a smartphone?Privilege, BlackBerry says. It was the only BlackBerry device running Android…which made it just another Android smartphone, of which we have plenty and plenty that are better. Privacy, they added. It was supposed to be Android’s state-of-the-art device in terms of security…but it doesn’t even have a fingerprint sensor. I think we can start to see why this device didn’t do as well as they wanted it to.To make matters worse, the smartphone didn’t feel like it was RM1,000 more premium than any of the other Android flagships. Performance then? Nope, it is smooth, but so is every other flagship device. Aha! The PRIV brought BlackBerry’s physical keyboard over, a big plus point when it comes to BlackBerry phones! Uh, nope. Based on our hands-on with the device at the launch event, the keyboard felt a little too soft and was nowhere near as satisfying to type on as older BlackBerry phones.It seems then that the Hail Mary phone that was supposed to be the saviour for the Waterloo-based company, would instead end up being the final nail in its coffin. Seems like dire straits for John Chen, so he recently made an announcement that the device would receive a price cut around the time of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which will be held from February 22 to 25.Due to the obvious fact that the other smartphone manufacturers would be releasing new devices, John Chen said that the PRIV would receive a “mid-life kicker” in addition to its price cut to hopefully remain competitive in the free market. He seems optimistic enough though, since he said that if the PRIV performs well, they will launch an affordable mid-range device. John, maybe you should start with that next time.While we don’t think that they would halve the price the PRIV, we do hope that it receives a significant enough price cut to remain competitive. The thing is, even if they cut RM1,000 off its price, would you buy the PRIV over, say, a Samsung Galaxy Note5 or a Nexus 6P? Do, let us know in the comments below because we know we wouldn’t.[SOURCE]"

While one could make the argument that previous Nexus devices were geared more towards those with experience rather than the mass market, we feel that the Nexus 6P is the first truly “mainstream” Nexus device that we would have no problem recommending to anyone.It’s got great software, a great camera, a great screen, and a premium build with a premium price to boot. Naturally, more and more people who are not so entrenched, some inexperienced, in the ways of the Android (sorry coming off a Star Wars high here) would be enticed to purchase this device.If you are one of those people and the entire universe of Android customisation seems a little too overwhelming, fret not, we’ve got you covered.

Not only were these devices supposed to give the best Android experience of any smartphone, they also shored up what was traditionally every Nexus device’s weakness: the camera. Even more excited than others were the fans of Google‘s old Nexus 5 because they finally had an upgrade to their beloved 4.95-inch phone.Well, that was until it melted in one of their pockets.User AFChimpanse took to the /r/Android forums yesterday and shared a story about how his/her brand new Nexus 5X had a meltdown, literally. According to the OP (original poster), the device was sitting in his/her pocket when suddenly it started heating up. When the OP took it out, it continued to heat up and started producing a “low frizzling sound” releasing an “extremely toxic smell”. The smartphone eventually got too hot to hold in the hand and the OP had to put it down.When (we’re assuming the frizzling had died down) the device was picked up again, the user noticed that a portion of the back cover to the right of the LG logo had melted inwards. User DarcyFitz and GlassHalfFull pointed out that it should be a battery issue judging from the location of the melted bit relative to the device’s internals identified by iFixit’s teardown photo:According to AFChimpanse, the device was only 11 days old and had never been plugged into a third-party charger before. So I guess we can rule out faulty cables as a cause.While there is nothing official to validate the user’s claims, this isn’t the first time a smartphone has exploded, as there have been cases where this OnePlus One and this Samsung Galaxy S3 (though this was because of a counterfeit battery) suffered a similar fate. Most smartphone batteries are filled with chemicals that could potentially be triggered if it endures excessive force or physical trauma, as can be seen in this video by TechRax below:Although you might not be taking a hammer to your device, there is a chance that these devices may come in contact some unfavourable conditions which may cause undesired reactions. Unfortunately, when it comes to phones you stop drop and roll so if your phone is getting a little hotter than usual, our suggestion would be to take it out of your pocket immediately. We don’t think this is the type of explosion you’d want in your pants.As you know, the Nexus 5X isn’t officially available in Malaysia, but you can get it through DirectD. If you own a Nexus 5X yourself, do drop us a comment if you’ve experienced any overheating issues or if you think your device smells funny.[SOURCE]"

Amin Ashaari,Why did Maxis CEO Morten Lundal tell all his employees to come to work dressed like they’re going to the beach?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/18/why-did-maxis-ceo-morten-lundal-told-all-his-employees-to-come-to-work-dressed-like-theyre-going-to-the-beach/,"bali,beach holiday,maxis,morten lundal,random,industry in general,players on the field","Industry in General,Maxis,Players on the Field",2015-12-18,"You get an email. Your CEO tells you to come to the office not in office attire but in beach wear, and he tells you to bring your passport and a packed suitcase. What do you do?So this happened at Maxis.CEO Morten Lundal told all his staff to prepare for a beach holiday, which meant dressing up in beach wear, bringing a valid passport and packed suitcase, when they came to work on Thursday (Dec 17).On the day, Morten did an unplanned town hall and randomly picked the names of 13 lucky Maxis employees. All of them won an all-expenses VIP trip for two to Bali. Right after the announcement, the winners we’re chauffeured to KLIA and were soon on their way to Bali, just like that.It’s refreshing to see a company with such a fun and dynamic CEO like Morten. And those who got picked to go on the trip certainly got a huge morale boost. I like companies that do crazy things like this and I guess Morten subscribes to the belief that if you take care of your employees, your employees will take care of your customers. And if your customers are happy, your company should be doing ok.Some may disagree but I think Maxis is one of the better mobile operators in Malaysia. They are not perfect but they’re doing the right things.I hope the positive vibe that Morten is spreading to his employees carries through to the customer experience. And as a Maxis customer, I certainly wouldn’t mind getting a phone call from Morten out of the blue telling me that I got chosen to go on an all-expenses paid beach holiday. That would make me happy.What do you guys think?"

Maxis has finally extended its Zerolution program to cover the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. With zero interest and zero upfront fees, you can own the latest Apple smartphone from RM100/month across a 24 months duration.At the moment, the Zerolution program for the iPhone 6s/6s Plus is only for the entry-level 16GB storage version. On top of that, it is only eligible if you sign up with their higher commitment MaxisOne Plan 158 or 188. To refresh your memory, the iPhone 6s (16GB) is priced at RM3,199 while the equivalent iPhone 6s Plus version is priced at RM3,699. iPhone 6s 16GB
iPhone 6s Plus 16GB
If you plan on switching phones after 12 months, you can opt in for the upgrade option at RM20/month, which is surprisingly cheaper than the typical RM30/month upgrade fee for other Android flagships. For greater peace of mind and to avoid paying potential penalties when upgrading, you can take up the RM15/month protection program that covers accidental damages and theft. In total, that’s RM135/month for the iPhone 6s and RM156/month for the iPhone 6s Plus, excluding your monthly plan commitment. The Maxis Zerolution program is a refreshing way of owning a device without the hefty upfront payments that come with traditional postpaid contracts. The only downside, of course, is the limited choice of postpaid plans and phone models. If only it covers higher iPhone 6s models such as 64GB and 128GB, with the flexibility of selecting lower monthly commitment plans. The iPhone 6s Zerolution promo is available now and you can order directly from the Maxis Online Store.

Earlier, we found out that Maxis gave 13 lucky employees an all-expense-paid trip to Bali, and now it seems Tune Talk is also handing out Apple iPad Pros to their staff.At what looked like a Star Wars themed party at Svago KLCC, the MVNO handed out iPad Pros to its employees, though it is unclear how many of them actually received it. These iPad Pros aren’t just the entry-level models either, oh no, they’re the 128GB cellular+WiFi models which retail at RM4,899 in the Malaysian Apple Store.Unfortunately, from what we can decipher from the pictures posted on their twitter profile, it doesn’t look like there are any Apple Pencils or Apple Smart Keyboard included with the iPad Pro. But hey, I’m sure buying just the keyboard and stylus when you already have the tablet won’t be too bad. Besides, they can always just use it to watch videos. Or to answer phone calls via Continuity.12.9-inch phablet anyone?It’s nice that big companies are taking care of their employees and perhaps after these two show what they’ve done for their employees, more may follow suit.

The Lenovo Vibe S1 with two selfie cameras has officially arrived in Malaysia. This mid-range device allows you to do more than just taking a standard picture of yourself. The unique dual-camera concept is quite similar to HTC’s Duo Camera setup and Lenovo is taking it to the front seat for better selfies. It consists of an 8MP main camera and it is assisted by a 2MP secondary unit that helps with depth of field. This allows you to take creative blur shots with refocusing and bokeh effects. It is a shame that it doesn’t come with a front facing flashlight. If you need to take better lit selfies, you can always pop-in an optional VIBE Xtension selfie flash that plugs into the headphone jack. For regular photoshoots, the rear of the Vibe S1 has a 13MP ybut with Phase Detection AF, and it is assisted by dual-tone LED flash. As for the phone, it gets a 5″ Full HD IPS display and it is powered by a 64-bit MediaTek MT6752 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board, it gets a generous 32GB of storage which is expandable with microSD. Like most smartphones today, it supports 4G LTE and has Dual-SIM slots. Keeping the lights on is a 2,500mAh capacity battery and overall it weighs 132 grams with a respectable thickness of 7.8mm. At time of writing, the Vibe S1 is running on Android 5.0 Lollipop.If you love taking selfies, this could be the device for you. However for those who prefer to take photos with the rear camera, the Lenovo Vibe Shot would be the better alternative as it comes with a 16MP main camera with Optical Image Stabiliser and Laser Auto Focus. The Lenovo Vibe S1 is priced at RM1,299 and it comes in either Pearl White or Midnight Blue colour options. If you’re interested, you can get it from GEMFive at a discounted price of RM1,225."
Alexander Wong,Soon all Chinese smartphones might look the same,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/21/oppo-coloros-3-0-android-alpha-release/,"android,coloros,coloros 3,coloros 3.0,miui,oppo,oppo os,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2015-12-21,"Android is currently the most popular mobile platform and unlike Apple, it is driven by several device manufacturers. While the underlying operating system is the same, each brand would have their own customised skin to differentiate themselves from the rest. For the regular consumer, the custom interface adds more value and nifty features which doesn’t come stock standard. Of course, there are others that will consider pre-installed software as unnecessary bloatware, and proclaim plain vanilla is the way to go. Whichever side you pick, let’s take a look at the Chinese manufacturers. With Apple seen as a status symbol, most of these Chinese smartphone UI lacks an App Drawer. Yes, it can be simple for first timers but power users might find it cluttered or annoying when it comes to organising their home screens. Of course, another popularity with Chinese Android UI is the wide availability of themes that you can customise to your preference.So Xiaomi has their MIUI, while Huawei has their very own EMUI. On the current version, EMUI looks awfully similar to Xiaomi’s own interface from the flat icon design, to the minimalistic approach for its built-in apps such as phone dialer, alarm clock, stopwatch, toggle switches and even the menu page. Even the shutdown menu interface that’s displayed after long pressing the power button looks the same as well. Just recently, images of OPPO’s new ColorOS 3.0 has surfaced, and it looks awfully familiar with both custom interfaces. The photos you’re seeing here is an OPPO R7 Plus that runs on ColorOS 3.0.0_151216_Alpha. At first glance, it looks like another honor device if you didn’t notice the ColorOS and OPPO branding. So far there’s no word of its release but it is likely to be running out of the box with their upcoming 2016 models. Disappointingly, it still runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop instead of the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow.At the rate these Chinese companies are going, they all might end up looking the same and the only difference is the exterior and the logo plastered at the back. What do you guys think? Do you fancy these app-drawerless interfaces or the mainstream offering from Samsung, HTC, ASUS and Sony?[ SOURCE, VIA ]"
Arif Lee,Malaysia’s broadband still lags behind,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/21/akamais-q3-state-of-the-internet-report-shows-malaysias-broadband-still-lags-behind/,"akamai,broadband speed,ericsson,internet speed,malaysia broadband speed,malaysia internet speed,singapore,sri lanka,telekom malaysia,thailand,tm,unifi,cool stuff,industry in general,mobile devices,players on the field","Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-12-21,"One of the leading content delivery networks (CDN) and cloud-based service providers, Akamai Technologies, has just released their global State of the Internet Q3 report and our data shows that we’ve dropped the ball in some areas.In terms of data presented, the Intelligent Platform gave us information regarding key metrics, as followed: connectivity speeds, broadband adoption rates, usage of IPv6 and added observations from Ericsson (a partner).Sitting at a lowly 73rd spot with an average speed of 4.9 Mbps, we fall behind neighbours Thailand (43rd) and Singapore (17th, while at the same time the Ceylonese Island of Sri Lanka betters us by 2 spots. YoY/Year on Year, we’ve made a steady improvement of 20% but there’s still much to be done.Our numbers show a slight 3.2% dip, based on Q2, possibly indicating a sudden surge of users subscribing to more affordable/slower plans, feeling the pinch from the economy or that our internet providers can’t keep up with demands, rolling out infrastructure slower than usual in this particular period.Interestingly, TM the major ISP in Malaysia revamped their plans in the month of October, leaving us to believe that Q4 will bring about more positive numbers. If you’re unaware TM is now offerings 30Mbps / 50Mbps download speeds but at a lower monthly fee – you can read about them here.Looking at average peak connection speeds, we managed slightly better, at the 54th spot but our broadband providers still have room to improve. Our government has allocated RM 1.2 billion on expanding internet access points for non-urban locations, upping the current 5Mbps speeds to 20Mbps and we’re likely to see these measures starting to show in the coming year. According to Ookla’s speedtest report for Malaysia, it seems that our 4G LTE enabled network operators are capable of delivering speeds faster than fixed broadband. In developed markets, it should be the other way around. The stark reality is that it’ll be hard to roll-out this basic need (by our standards) to rural areas, especially in East Malaysia – where even the major states have a lack of accessibility for high-speed broadband. An issue that still haunts most Malaysian users on TM’s network, is the fact that they’re still on Streamyx “broadband”, a lower-end network that offers slower speeds at a unappealing price. In retrospect, the most affordable Streamyx plan is offered at RM 116.60 per month for 1Mbps, which means it makes more sense for consumers to jump to UniFi, if it’s available in their area.Hopefully, we can only move onwards and upwards, hoping that eventually the basic networks infrastructures will be opened up for other competitors, making the internet more affordable for all of us. [ SOURCE ]"

Thanks to our eagle-eyed reader, the Galaxy View has just gotten the green light from SIRIM and it is very likely to hit Malaysia very soon.Is it a TV or a tablet? Samsung says it is neither. But to us, this is a touch screen Smart TV that fits on your coffee table. The 18.4″ screen does Full HD resolution which gives a pixel density of just 119ppi. There’s a pair of stereo speakers and it runs on a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor mated to 2GB of RAM. To store your entertainment content, it comes in either 32GB or 64GB storage capacities which fortunately is upgradable with microSD. Upfront there’s a 2.1MP front camera for your video confering or occasional selfies. Being a TV/Tablet convergence device, you can use it without being plugged in for up to 8 hours with its 5,700mAh capacity battery. Connectivity wise, it has Bluetooth 4.1, WiFi 802.11ac and there’s an optional model for LTE but it looks like we are getting a WiFi only version according to the specs shown on SIRIM. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop and the interface is customised with large buttons for ease of use as a media centre. After all, this is designed to be as a media consumption device that’s smarter than your average TV. It is just a pity that it lacks external sources like HDMI.

Yet, it’s nice to see Malaysians are all over the place when it comes to wanting to find out about current affairs, both internationally and locally.Cited as the Top Trending Searches for 2015, we’re perplexed as to why the most searched “term” in the country was “HRMIS 2.0”, an internal system used by those in the (extremely large 1.5 million people) public service. Though you’d think that a frequently visited site used for work would deserve a bookmark or at least remembrance of the URL.Moving on, there were searches regarding BR1M 2015, the annual subsistence handout by our government; How-Old.net, an application that tells you how old it thinks you are (duh); and some local shows/movies. No surprise as the “USD to MYR” was searched highly too, followed by “GST” and the “Bersih 4.0” rally.For the top 10 most searched individuals list, it seemed that Malaysians looked for information regarding notable people who passed away during the year. That includes, the late: Lee Kuan Yew, Former Prime Minister of Singapore; Paul Walker, the famous actor that passed away during a car crash; and Kevin Morais, the murdered deputy prosecutor.Our current Prime Minister was also on the list, while athlete Farah Ann Abdul Hadi made her way on it as well (for obvious, gymnastic attire reasons). People also kept up with international news, as searches for the missing QZ8501 airplane, the Paris Attacks and ISIS, topped the list for trending news searches.The list of searches really show what we’re looking for, be it happenings of the world or an important individual. Given the growth of the Internet and Google being one of the go-to search engines (seriously, who still uses Yahoo or Bing?), we’ll continue to see what sort of information our country is keen to look for, hopefully John Cena won’t make the list again next year.For a full low-down on what Malaysians looked for on the internet, head on over to the full-list here."

Many, ourselves included, felt that Microsoft shipped an unfinished product. From what we gathered, it isn’t the hardware that the Surface users are unhappy about, rather it was the software implementation that let the devices down.What’s worse, Microsoft’s “solution” to the problem was an apology on their forums which only served to irk more users. Now though, they seem to have actually come up with a solution to at least one of their problems.Besides the issues with the device’s power drainage during sleep and random reboots, one other nagging issue was the Surface device’s keyboard and touchpad. The much improved Surface Pro 4 Type Cover keyboard was so advanced, it seemed, that it didn’t deem the Surface Pro 4 a worthy device and thus refused to pair with it properly. The Surface Pro 4 had issues connecting with its keyboard, especially when removing the Type Cover and reattaching it, bugging out the mouse cursors and other modes for Continuum.For us, the problems were more rudimentary when it came to the Surface Pro 4. We found out that if the keyboard was attached when the device was off, it wouldn’t detect the keyboard when we switched it on, forcing us to disengage and reattach the keyboard to the device.This update also affects Surface Book users, where apparently the device had problems with its touchpad and keyboard as well. Here are the System hardware update: 12/17/15 changelogs: If you were anywhere near as excited as us for the launch of the Surface Pro 4, and dropped a considerable chunk of your savings to get one with the Type Cover keyboard, I’m sure you were equally crestfallen when you discovered that Microsoft already knew the device had issues yet still decided to put it in the market.While doing something like this is, frankly, unforgivable, you’d think that a company as big as Microsoft would have some kind of fix ready almost immediately after it put an unfinished product on sale. Instead, they said that major fixes would only be coming next year.In any case, these problems seem to be software based, and fixable via updates so if you’ve bought a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book device, our advice is to hunker down and weather this initial storm in the hopes that your device will eventually live up to its full potential.If you’re still on the fence about purchasing one, stay tuned to our upcoming review of the Surface Pro 4 where we will be taking a close look at the device, all of its problems, fixes and more.[SOURCE]"

It makes sense though as smartwatches tend to be rather gargantuan to accommodate more screen real estate, resulting in big and bulky devices that don’t go well with everyone’s wrist.Huawei has caught on this trend as well, as there are reports coming in that there will be a “for women” version of their new Huawei Watch. While it is unlikely that there will be any upgrades on the internals of the smartwatch, there will be aesthetic differences because the new watch will apparently be rounder.Yep, rounder than a round watch.Apparently the new Huawei watch will sport a modified “rounder and more elegant” watch case to match the supposedly more feminine-looking bands that will be bundled with it. If they plan on following the generic his/her accessories trend then the device will likely be smaller in both their bands as well as the watch case itself. It should probably also come in gold and maybe pin-uh sorry, Rose gold as well.The existing Huawei Watch is no small device as it has a rather thick case to go along with that premium hefty feel. This definitely won’t go down well with delicate wrists, so a smaller and especially thinner design language will be much appreciated. This “made-for-women” Watch could see a launch during CES next year.Talk has been going around that the Chinese manufacturer’s second-generation smartwatch is already in the works and could see its way into the market by the second half of next year. There are hardly any details on this smartwatch at this point in time, but 9to5Google reports that they could be working on a cellular version of the device. This is unsurprising news though as Android Wear now officially supports cellular connectivity. The regular, non-cellular version of the Watch should also see improvements to battery life and performance.Announced during the Mobile World Congress this year, Huawei’s first generation Watch was only recently launched in Malaysia, alongside the Nexus 6P. We were mighty impressed with its premium feel and we thought it was one of the best-looking smartwatches of the year. For more information on the device as well as its launch, head on over to our announcement post.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Besides answering questions regarding some of India’s best-sporting pastimes, he also touched on how Google will choose to name the follow-up to Android Marshmallow, which by habit should follow the letters of the Alphabet.Being relatively candid on the subject, Pichai jests that he’ll take his mum’s considerations when the time comes to name Android N, though it won’t only be her he’ll be looking to; supposedly, Google will also run an online poll to help decide if the N stands for Nougat, Nutella or something entirely different.Speaking mainly to an Indian crowd, one of the attendees asked about why there has never been an Android version named after sweets and desserts from India, Google’s CEO replied “When I meet my mom, I’ll ask her for suggestions”He added the following regarding the next nickname:“Maybe what I’ll do next time, is when we’re working on the next release of Android, Android N, maybe we’ll do an online poll on what the name should be. And if all Indians vote…. I think we can make it happen!”From the super sweet list below, it’ll be tough to see anything other than something sweet make the list:Cupcake
Donut
Éclair
Froyo
Gingerbread
Honeycomb
Ice Cream Sandwich
Jelly Bean
KitKat
Lollipop
Marshmallow
N?Android is widely adopted across the globe and while most of these nicknames have their namesake desserts/sweets originating from western countries, maybe Google will let globalisation do its own thing, allowing international sweets to be a part of the fun.Heck maybe when the list continues along the alphabet, you’ll see an Android (O)nde-Onde or Android (P)isang Goreng – okay that probably won’t happen but we’ll keep on wishing.Here’s the entire Q&A session on video:

This service is available on their Boeing 737-900ER planes, which mainly flies to India, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.Working together with AeroMobile Communications, Digi will allow their postpaid customers to roam on the satellite based network at RM 32 per day. Malindo Air adds to their long list which include Aer Lingus, Air France, Air Serbia, Alitalia, Emirates, Etihad Airlines, EVA Air, KLM Airlines, Lufthansa, Malindo Air, Qatar Airways, SAS, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. A couple of months back, AirAsia had introduced its in-flight internet service that runs on WiFi. For AeroMobile, you will be connected to an actual mobile network. This is like connecting to a roaming network while traveling overseas. While there’s no mention of download speeds, you can enjoy surfing at RM32/day without the expensive pay per use charges. On AeroMobile, you can make and receive calls too but at a premium rate of RM15/minute. Meanwhile, SMS are charge at 99sen each. Digi’s Head of Marketing Services had this to say on the matter:“Digi is committed in constantly improving our services. This service, coupled with our widest 4G LTE network, connects Malaysians with high-speed internet services even when travelling.Through this partnership with Malindo Air, our customers would be able to use their mobile devices onboard, empowering them to change the way they work, learn, play and live and provide them seamless connectivity.”This isn’t the first time Digi had offered in-flight service. Back in 2009, they had introduced the service on selected Malaysia Airlines flights but it costs a colossal RM100 per MB. Maxis is also an AeroMobile partner, but we can’t find further details on their website. Celcom is also offering in-flight roaming service and they support both AeroMobile (15 airlines) and OnAir (17 airlines) networks. However they charge a slightly higher RM38/day for each network. Need to know how to get the service working on your device? Here are the super easy steps to get the service working.
1. Turn on your smartphone and make sure your Airplane Mode toggle is OFF
2. Turn on Data Roaming on your smartphone
3. Your device will automatically detect the AeroMobile network and connect to it (the name displayed will vary depending on your smartphone)
4. A text will come in welcoming you to the network and give you a brief walkthrough
5. You’re now connected, so feel free to surf the internet
Do note that only selected flights are supported and the airline crew will make an announcement if the inflight mobile service is available. For any information regarding this new in-flight service and safety concerns, head over to the FAQ section on Digi’s website here ."

All he wanted was to buy an iPhone 6, but instead, he was forced to fork out more than double the price by an unscrupulous seller. Just when you thought nobody will pull the same trick here in Malaysia, think again. A local paper had reported several customers being held against their will until they pay up more than what was agreed upon. A 28-year-old victim was reported to be buying 4 phones at RM200 each at Kota Raya Shopping Complex. However after making the payment of RM800, he was told to enter a secluded room where he was locked up for hours. He was then told to pay an exorbitant RM10,000 fee for his release. Eventually, the victim was set free, but not after he withdrawn RM5,000 from an ATM. To rub salt to the wound, the 4 phones which he got was different from what was shown earlier. Obviously, the next thing to do was to report to the relevant authorities. He was said to have complained to several agencies including the Ministry of trade and Consumer Affairs, but no action has been taken. As a last resort, he seeks help from PPIM (Persatuan Pengguna Islam Malaysia) which proceeded to raid the shop. From the operation, it was found that there are a number of phone shops at Kota Raya that are selling counterfeit products at skyrocketed prices. In total, they had managed to cover as much as RM11,900 on behalf of 7 victims. Apart from locals, these shops tend to target foreigners especially women that would often fall prey to such tactics. As always, it is advisable to shop at reputable retailers and beware of dodgy dealers that offer unbelievable deals. If the deal is too good to be true, then it probably is. This isn’t just limited to expensive phone models as we’ve seen fake Xiaomi devices in the market as well.If you’re planning to get a smartphone, it is best to visit an authorised dealer or order directly from the official online store.

Microsoft Malaysia has officially announced its Lumia 950 along with its larger Lumia 950 XL sibling for the Malaysian market. The duo is also the first flagship mobile devices to launch with Windows 10 out of the box. 
To recap, the Lumia 950 has a 5.2″ Quad HD display and under the hood you’ll find a 1.8GHz Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board storage which is expandable via microSD. For photo taking, it a 20MP PureView camera with OIS and triple LED flash, while the front gets a 5MP selfie shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery that juices up quickly via a USB Type-C Port or Wirelessly using Qi Standard. Going up a notch, the Lumia 950 XL is the phabet equivalent with a larger 5.7″ Quad HD display and it gets a beefier 2.0Ghz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage. The camera optics are similar with a 20MP + 5MP combo, while the battery is larger at 3,340mAh. It also connects via USB Type-C and it supports Qi Wireless Charging. In terms of pricing, the Lumia 950 is going for RM2,699 while the Lumia 950 XL is priced at RM2,999. As an early bird promo, the first 100 customers to purchase either model will get a Microsoft Display Dock worth RM309. With the Display Dock, you can extend your Windows 10 experience onto a big screen by hooking it up to a monitor, keyboard and mouse. This allows you to edit Microsoft Office documents and respond to Outlook emails like you do on full-fledged computer. Both the Lumia 950/950 XL are available for pre-order from the Microsoft Online Store on Lazada and it will be available through selected Microsoft Authorised Resellers on 18th December onward."

The new flagship smartphones are expected to be announced during MWC 2016 and they are likely to retain a duo release of a standard and an “edge” version that comes with a curve screen.We’ve seen a couple of speculations for the Galaxy S7 and a new report by WSJ has reaffirmed what we know so far.According to their sources, the Korean maker will be implementing a pressure sensitive display that’s very much like Apple’s iPhone 6s/6s Plus. Based on a patent filed by Samsung, the display allows you to alternate between space/tab, upper/lower-case keys according to the pressure of your touch. Also introduced for the first time in their product line is a high-speed charging/transfer port via USB Type C.Probably a much-welcomed feature is the likely return of a microSD slot. This year Samsung has gotten brickbats from its users for dropping expandable storage for its Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5. The expandable slot is said to be available on specific models, and it won’t be included across all flagship models.In terms of cameras, Samsung will be introducing its new BRITECELL sensors that boast better low light performance. If you hate camera bumps. the new shooter is said to be flush with minimal protrusion at the back. As an extra party trick, Samsung might just include a Retina Scanner to unlock your device and we’ve seen ZTE implementing such feature on the Axon.Design wise, Samsung is expected to stick to its winning formula of using metal and glass. Its choice of using premium materials had helped Samsung to move upmarket and it was a huge leap from its former plasticky smartphones of old. Don’t expect a radical change in appearance but perhaps some minor tweaks to differentiate the Galaxy S7 from its existing models.If the Galaxy S7/S7 edge launches in February, we might be able to see them in stores locally as early as end March or early April.[ SOURCE 2 ]"

These issues cropping up are a follow-up to the shambles that was Microsoft’s style of dealing with its angry OneDrive customers, that showed that their customer service approach has a lot of refining to be done and this time, it seems like deja vu all over again.Josh_F a forum owner took to Microsoft’s Community site to provide an official statement from the team at Redmond and the reply is rather lackluster. The moderator starts off by thanking those who own the two Surface devices mentioned above, proceeding to dish out the monotonous recording playback-like sentence “we’ve heard your complaints, we value them and are working on a fix” – y’know the typical sentiments.Some of these problems were fixed with an update that users received in November but with that said update, devices started to drain battery percentage faster while in sleep mode. A fix to this will only come next year, though Microsoft was already aware of the issue before they shipped the two products – say what? We’ve said this time and time again, never fast-track a product if it’s riddled with bugs; case and point the LG Watch Urbane 2nd gen.This was what another moderator (Joe) had to say: “The ‘standby’ battery life is an issue we are working on and have been working on.  We can put the processor into a deeper sleep state than it is currently set to.  We couldn’t do it at RTM (release to manufacturing) for a variety of reasons, power management is a very hard computer science problem to solve especially with new silicon.  Currently it is not in the deepest “sleep” that it can be so there are wake events that would not otherwise wake it.  We will have an update for this issue sometime soon in the new year.”These excuses and justifications pose no help to those who’ve already purchased the versatile Surface products. In earnest, we really do hope that the Surface team solves these issues, otherwise our review isn’t going to be rosy.[ SOURCE, VIA, 2 ]"

The question is, will it change Microsoft’s success in the local market? Let’s see if Digi enterprise/business customers take advantage of this special deal.The smaller of the two, the Lumia 950 will be absolutely free of charge though it’ll come with a hefty monthly fee of RM 238 on a 2 year (24 months) contract – working out to a huge RM 5,712 total. It isn’t just for the phone, as you’ll be getting 10GBs of mobile data, totally unlimited calls, text and instant messaging (WhatsApp and WeChat).If you’d prefer something bigger and more powerful, the Lumia 950 XL will be available too. You’ll get the same plan as talked about above, at the same monthly price, but you’ll have to fork out an additional RM 330 upfront for the smartphone itself; bringing you to an eventual RM 6,042 total cost.Given that spending RM 238 per month doesn’t sound as practical for someone who doesn’t use all that bundled data, calls/texts and instant messaging, you can bump that price down by choosing other Digi plans that will be announced on the 18th of December; mind you, the two smartphones’ will cost more, but you’ll be paying less monthly.During the same announcement, Digi mentioned that this collaboration will bring about a third (more affordable) device, the Microsoft Lumia 550, that will be free on the Digi SmartPlan 98. It’ll be available slightly later, at the end of December of this year.Head on over to our announcement post for a full recap of what these Windows 10 devices have to offer, as well as their full specs."

Not only did their flagship device lose out to high-end flagships from other manufacturers like Samsung and Apple, it was also plagued with controversy as its Snapdragon 810 was running way too hot, all of which led to plummeting sales. Then in hopes of pulling more sales, they launched the One A9 which has been accused of looking like a carbon copy of the iPhone 6/6s, though was rather well received by critics. On paper, the One A9’s specs were far from being a world beater, with only a Snapdragon 617 processor mated with 2GB of RAM, so it left many HTC fans who desired a worthy flagship wanting more.Then, the Taiwanese company gave fans another glimmer of hope when the HTC One X9 leaked online with what looked to be promising specifications. Now, more pictures of the device have also been leaked and it looks…different to say the least.Based on the pictures, the new addition to the One lineup looks to have a couple of very interesting design choices. The first, and most obvious of which, is that camera “visor” ala-Nexus 6P that stretches across the top of the device right around the camera module.When images of the Nexus 6P were first leaked and people saw the visor, they were a little apprehensive to it and how it seemed to have tainted what could have been a good looking device. Now though, that visor has become a signature of the latest Nexus device and at a glance, people can easily differentiate it from its less powerful brother the Nexus 5X. The thing is, while Huawei decided to set that visor apart, letting it dominate in its blackness across the top of the phone, HTC seems to have tried to “hide” their “visor” by painting it the same colour as the rest of the device.Again, apprehensive is the word we could best use to describe those looks. That said, taste varies between the individual so there obviously will be people who completely dig that look. Around the front of the device, HTC seems to have gone “retro” with the inclusion of capacitive buttons along the bottom of the device (where their logo usually is) while the HTC logo has moved to the device’s forehead. There also seems to be, what looks like, a pair of front facing speakers (which we hope are BoomSound speakers) as well as a front facing camera.The HTC One X9 recently passed through Chinese certification authority TENAA. revealing what looks to be some frankly disappointing specifications. It looks like the device will be running an octa-core 2.2GHz processor (which rules out the Snapdragon 820 and Helios X20 rumoured earlier) mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable via microSD up to 1TB. The smartphone also looks to sport a 5.5″ full HD IPS display (1920×1080 pixels).In terms of optics, the device will get a 13MP primary camera with an LED flash and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter on the front. It is also rumoured to run Android 5.0.1 Lollipop (likely with HTC’s Sense UI on top) out of the box. To be fair, we couldn’t really expect this to be a full-fledged flagship device, especially since it doesn’t bear the M badge. One could hope, right?[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Well, Google has the next best thing. Ahead of the official Malaysian premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Google has thrown together an interesting new Chrome web browser experience that lets you wield a lightsaber to fend off First Order Stormtroopers.The Lightsaber Escape game uses a simple mechanism that lets you wield your phone as if it was a lightsaber and slay Stormtroopers on either your laptop or computer in an attempt to escape a space station. Here’s how you play: Simply log on to the Lightsaber Escape website with your laptop or computer, then enter the URL displayed on the resulting web page into your phone. Once there, your phone should begin calibrating its accelerometer and upon completion, turn into the lightsaber it was always meant to be. You can then either play it on your computer’s monitor or cast/hook it up to a projector and have some theater level fun like we did.When you’re calibrated and past the tutorial mission, that’s when the real fun begins. The game takes you on an on-rail action adventure through a space station filled with Stormtroopers who happen to be surprisingly accurate. With your trusty lightsaber equipped, you will engage in ranged combat, where you deflect blaster fire back at your attackers,  as well as melee combat. We haven’t made it far enough into the game where we’ve encountered a Sith yet, so do let us know in the comments below if you have.It is a fantastic experience we highly recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or otherwise especially since it works on both iOS and Android. We did encounter some input lag in our adventures through the game as well as some drops in framerate but that is kind of expected when playing a browser game. The experience in itself more than makes up for it though, so all is forgiven. Maybe by the next installment of the Star Wars franchise we will be able to play this (or something like this) in virtual reality.[SOURCE]"

They flooded the online stores on Lazada and Vmall which resulted in an impressive 1,000 Nexus 6P units sold on launch day itself. However, purchasing anything online can be rather risky because sometimes, mix ups can happen.Local Ian Oz found this out the hard way. He, like many other Nexus 6P fans, ordered the device off Lazada’s website, however, when the package arrived, instead of unwrapping a brand spanking new smartphone, Ian unwrapped a pair of…earrings? Oh dear.
(click to enlarge)It turns out Lazada had somehow screwed up the order and sent Ian six pairs of earrings (worth RM58), which were initially meant for someone named Irene Yeow. The worst part was that based on the receipt, Irene’s earrings were meant to go Johor, which in case you didn’t know, is in another state.As it looks like Lazada had mistakenly stuffed the earrings into the Nexus 6P package, it seems likely that Ian’s smartphone was stuffed into the earrings package. The good news is that there is a contact number included in the shipping invoice. Ian, obviously outraged, took his irritation onto the social media, posting a picture of his receipt on Huawei’s Facebook page. Luckily, Huawei responded fairly quickly and ensured Ian that they had escalated the problem to their core fulfillment team and Lazada.What we don’t understand is how a mistake like this could be made in the first place. On the Pos Laju statement, it clearly states that the package should weigh 0.2kg (Nexus 6P weighs around 178g) which reflects the device’s weight, but it seems unlikely that six pairs of earrings would weigh the same as Google’s latest device.Nevertheless, paying RM58 for a brand new Nexus 6P seems like a phenomenal deal. Where can we sign up for it? In all seriousness though, we wish Ian luck in the retrieval of his device because we know how terrible it must feel to pay over two and a half thousand ringgit only for your shipment to be messed up. If you were thinking about getting the Nexus 6P, perhaps it would be wiser to purchase it from Vmall.my, which is Huawei’s official online store.[SOURCE]"

So this means all Windows Phones are simply called a Windows 10 mobile device.It has been a while since we’ve seen a flagship Lumia and the last one was the Nokia Lumia 930 back in early 2014. After Microsoft took the helm of the mobile business, they are mostly preoccupied with entry to mid-range devices running on Windows Phone 8.1.After almost 2 years of waiting, the Lumia 950 and 950 XL have officially landed in Malaysia. Not only this is the first flagship Lumia under the Microsoft banner, but most importantly they are the first Windows 10 smartphones in the market.Like most flagships today, Microsoft is going with a two size approach for its flagship. The Lumia 950 with a compact 5.2″ display is going for RM2,699 while its larger 5.7″ “phablet” model, the Lumia 950 XL is priced at RM2,999. That’s a significant price jump over its predecessors, and you can partly blame our foreign exchange rates for that.The internals has the best specs you would expect from a flagship, which includes Quad HD displays, Snapdragon 808/810 processors, 3GB of RAM and a minimum of 32GB of storage. Both has an expandable microSD slot and dual-SIM slots with 4G LTE support.Being a flagship Lumia, it comes equipped with their renowned PureView camera. It has a 20MP sensor at the rear with triple LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation, while the front 5MP camera takes care of selfie duties. Keeping up with the times, it also shoots videos in 4K resolution. There’s fast charge that does 0-50% in 30 minutes, USB Type-C connectivity and Qi wireless charging support. The only difference between the 950 and its XL version is the screen size, processors (950 – Snapdragon 808, 950 XL – Snapdragon 810) and battery capacity (950 – 3,000mAh, 950 XL – 3,340mah). On concerns of overheating, Microsoft says they have implemented liquid cooling to keep things cool as the going gets tough."

Alexander Wong,Guess who else is about to roll out 4G LTE in Malaysia?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/13/guess-who-else-is-about-to-roll-out-4g-lte-in-malaysia/,"4g lte,4g lte malaysia,4g malaysia,lte,malaysia 4g,malaysia 4g operators,malaysian telco,yes,yes 4g,yes 4g lte,yes lte,ytl communications,players on the field,technologies","LTE,Players on the Field,Technologies,Yes",2015-12-13,"Next year would be exciting with TM finally rolling out its full 4G LTE services. Competition is always good for us consumers and this could be a wake-up call to existing operators to buck up, or risk losing its customers. So in total, you’ll have Celcom, Digi, Maxis, U Mobile and TM as the 5 key 4G LTE telcos in the country. Is that enough? Well, it appears a new player is about to jump into the ring.5 years ago, the Malaysian government had allocated 2,600MHz LTE spectrums to 9 companies. Only 4 of them had officially rolled out commercial services namely Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. With TM’s acquisition of P1, they now have access to the 2600MHz spectrum which they can roll out full LTE based telephony and data services. This is different from TMgo, a wireless broadband service that operates in a lower 850MHz frequency.If you run a manual network search lately, you probably would notice a new network bearing the number 502 152. This was spotted at several locations including Seremban, Shah Alam and Damansara Heights. At some locations, you could detect 502 153. For those who are clueless about the numbers, these are Mobile Network codes. According to MCMC, 502 152 belongs to YTL Communications while 502 153 belongs to Packet One Networks. We haven’t heard much from YTL Communications in a while and they could be making a big come back next year with 4G LTE. Their Yes 4G WiMAX service is still alive and running with occasional device bundle promotions. So what’s the big deal if YTL launches its LTE service? Almost 2 years ago, YTL was reported to be testing TD-LTE on 2.3GHz, which supposedly is more efficient in bandwidth and cost. Utilising Time Division instead of Frequency Division, TD-LTE requires just one channel for download/upload as opposed to having a pair of frequencies for the same purpose. In Malaysia, our existing telcos are running on FDD-LTE, while TD-LTE is commonly used in China and India. Whether TD-LTE is better than FDD-LTE boils down to the telco itself. It is not what you have, but how you manage your network and your customer experience. Seamless transition from WiMAX, is also a factor why YTL favours TD-LTE. In an interview last year, its CEO Wing K Lee says that their WiMAX network is future proof and it won’t cost much for them to roll out LTE. Back then, YTL is claiming 85% population coverage with WiMAX and we can confirm it was definitely wider than P1 in our road test conducted exactly 5 years ago. If they could light up LTE nationwide at a flick of a switch, YTL could be a serious rival to Digi and Maxis. What do you guys think?Thanks @ZikriMzd for the tip![ SOURCE ]"

Hold on a minute, the latest Android hasn’t even gone mainstream but they want to talk about the future?Representing Google during an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session, the 6-man team chipped in on a slew of topics, including: the direction of Pixel C and the future of Android. If you’re asking why there’s such a bridging of the two; it’s mainly due to a merger that’s reported to take place come 2017.The report suggests that heads at Google think combining the two makes the most sense, since Android has had an early start as an operating system for quite some time. And we’re already starting to see small changes that point towards a unification in latest Pixel product.Google’s Pixel branding has been have over the place, of late; partly due to the Pixel C choosing Android over Chrome OS. This further points to a crossover of operating systems and that might mean more “desktop”-like capabilities to ease productivity in the following phase of Android.So while mediating all these unanswered questions regarding the switch, the software team thought it would be a great idea to hold an AMA session. Allowing users to ask whatever they needed to. But it was surprising that the developers choose to share two facts about Android N, given that non-Nexus devices have yet to receive Marshmallow.The first of the two is a proper split-screen/multi-window function that we’ve already seen on iOS (iPad Pro only) and some Android OEM skins as well. This pretty much only applies to tablets since it’ll be a tiresome experience navigating multiple windows on your smartphone screen.Another feature that came about was DisplayPort via USB Type-C connector, that a competitor has put to good use – yes, we’re looking at Windows with their Continuum support. A trend that you could see a mile away, with more people dropping PCs for day to day task and opting convertibles that are slowly catching up in the processor department.These replies below were from the team themselves:Regarding Android N“We’re working on lots of things right now for N that, of course, we wish we had, you know, yesterday. But we’d spoil the surprise of N if we shared all of them. Split screen is in the works!”Regarding Multi-Window on Android tablets“We’re working hard on a range of enhancements for Android in this form-factor – there are many things, like multiwindow, that we’ve been spending a lot of time on – hopefully we can share more about this soon.”Regarding DisplayPort through USB Type-C“Yes, the Pixel C will be supported on AOSP just like other Nexus devices. The bootloader can be unlocked to enable booting an alternate OS. Pixel C does not support Chromebook style recovery via USB. The firmware is open source. It is Coreboot. DisplayPort support over Type C is being worked on but we don’t have a release date yet.”Faster processors in smaller packages are already here and they’ll only continue to get better. And you can expect us to start using smaller devices on bigger screens real soon. Oh and maybe a Pixel smartphone?Let us know what you make of this announcement and share with us if your technological consumption habits have changed of late, in the comments below.[ SOURCE, 2, VIA, 2 ]"

A new model that’s larger than its current Galaxy A8 has just surfaced online and it’s called the Galaxy A9.The device isn’t announced officially yet, but the promo images and the specs for the Galaxy A9 have been leaked online. The full HD display remains a Super AMOLED unit and it is purported to be running on a 1.8GHz Snapdragon 620 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM.Accompanying its bigger screen is a larger 4,000mAh capacity battery. It isn’t confirmed yet but word has it that it could be used to charge other devices via USB OTG as seen on most recent smartphones with larger batteries. It also gets the same 13MP f/1.9 shooter with OIS as the rest, however the front gets an upgrade to 8MP for higher resolution selfie shots. On-board storage is said to be atleast 32GB with the option to expand further with microSD. The home button also comes with an integrated fingerprint scanner which can be used for Samsung Pay. The Galaxy A9 is expected to be available in China by end of this month or early January next year with an estimated price tag of 3,000CNY (about RM2,000). [ SOURCE, VIA ]"

As a whole we’re pretty fascinated by it and the experience it provides so when we finally got the update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, we were pretty stoked.Although it really wasn’t a major update, we thought we’d give you guys a brief run-down on what you can expect out of this little update.As the name suggests, this isn’t a very big update but there are several little tweaks that are fairly interesting. The first of which is the addition of new emojis. Now we finally get access to the head bandaged emoji, the updated poop emoji and the ever useful eye-roll emoji. If you want more information on these emojis, Ars Technica has a pretty comprehensive list.Besides that, this update acts as a catch-up update for older Nexus devices, bringing the Nexus 6P’s double-tap-on-the-power-button-to-wake-the-camera shortcut to the Nexus 6, Nexus 5 and Google’s Nexus tablets.Though unrelated to the Nexus 6P, according to TrustedReviews, 6.0.1 brings more improvements to the Nexus tablet user. Before this update, the back, home and multitask keys were always located in the middle, which made things tricky for tablet users to actually reach the buttons when holding a tab in both hands. Now, the back and home keys have been pushed to the far left corner of the screen while the multitasking key has been shoved to the far right.All of those plus Google’s monthly security update pretty much sums up this new patch. We will be keeping a close eye on any future updates so do stay tuned to SoyaCincau.com for all your Nexus 6P needs."

Since the OnePlus 2 would be their flagship killer for 2016, it is safe to say they won’t be rushing to replace it anytime soon. Instead, it seems like they are working on a mini flagship smartphone that could go head on with the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact.According to its listing on Geekbench, the new OnePlus device has a compact 4.6″ display that pushes full HD (1920×1080) resolution. It also gets the same Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor as the OnePlus 2, as well as 4GB of RAM for all your multitasking needs. On-board the list shows 64GB of storage which is quite huge for a device of this class.The main camera appears to be a 13MP shooter that supports 4K, while the front gets a 5MP unit. No mentions if it has Laser AF assist like its bigger brother. At the moment, the device is running on Android 5.1.1 and you can expect it to run on their own stock-like OxygenOS when it is out.

Announced during IFA 2015, the Acer Predator 8 has finally arrived in Malaysia. Sporting a 8″ Full HD (1920×1200) display, this is Acer’s compact tablet with the gamer in mind. It gets a gaming inspired aluminium frame and has not one, not two but four front-facing speakers with Dolby Audio enhancement. For a more immersive gaming experience, the Android tablet has two haptic motors inside that rumbles on both ends. Powering the device is Intel’s Atom x7-Z8700 2.4GHz Quad-Core processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. Onboard, it gets 32GB of storage which you can expand via a microSD up to 128GB. The Predator 8’s IPS display claims to have 100% NTSC colour gamut that provides a vibrant and accurate colour reproduction. The included MediaMaster settings let you optimise the display and audio for gaming, movie, photo viewing and standard modes. The main highlight, of course, would be its Predator Quadio (Quad Audio) setup that offers a virtual surround sound. Whether you’re holding it in landscape or portrait mode, it is smart enough to switch orientation automatically. Despite its chunky utilitarian appearance, it is 8.7mm thin and weighs 350 grams including its 4,420mAh battery. It does feel solid in the hands while the red coloured speaker grills protrude out from each corner to remind you that this is no ordinary tablet. There’s no 3G/4G mobile connectivity, but it has your usual Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and 802.11n WiFi with 2×2 MIMO support. Should you need to take pictures, it gets a 2MP shooter at the front while the rear gets a 5MP camera. At time of writing, it runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop.The Acer Predator 8 will go on sale in Malaysia starting next week with the retail price tag of RM1,499. To get your game on, they have also pre-installed Asphalt 8 with 320,000 credits worth US$50."

Well, it’s a good thing it wasn’t “soon ™”  because Google has begun the rollout for Maps offline navigation on iOS.Huzzah!As the initial rollout began on Android, many countries were initially left out, including Malaysia and it wasn’t until the second-half of last month that availability was extended to our home soil as well. Now, it has finally been made available to iOS users as well with the latest update to the Google Maps app.The downloaded maps will be stored for 30 days with the option to update it either automatically via WiFi or mobile network/WiFi, or manually. By default, the application will update maps over WiFi automatically. To navigate, simply search for the location in the application (as you normally would) and if it falls within your downloaded area, simply hit the little car icon and then hit the little arrow key and the turn-by-turn navigation will launch and start guiding you.Besides offline navigation, the application also supposedly brings the option to view petrol prices and when local businesses are supposed to be busy, but from our testing, it doesn’t appear to work in Malaysia. Then again, the ability to view petrol prices doesn’t really matter here since it is standardised across all stations.In any case, this will surely put a smile on iOS users’ faces (ironic that it would be Google to do so) as they now have another choice for reliable offline navigation in Malaysia.[SOURCE]"

Notable house-hold OEMs have had their hand in the growing appreciation that is, a Vanilla flavoured Android OS; a list that include two Korean manufacturers (LG and Samsung), one Taiwanese (HTC), one American (Motorola) and the rookie to the bunch, the Chinese-based Huawei with their Nexus 6P.What Huawei brings to the Nexus name?Can Huawei add a new spin to the Nexus name after leaving many hoping for more after the Nexus 6?

The one description, be it on the spec sheet or in the build quality, most people sought after when going for a smartphone. With technology getting more and more advanced, the premium feel has begun to spill down the price pyramid to the point where even midrange phones can give users that “premium feel”. However, these lower end “premium” smartphones usually come with some corners cut to keep the price low.I love a great bargain, phones like the OnePlus One or the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, have great specs for their price, but you can clearly see what was left out. Today though, it isn’t about the best value for money. Today, it’s about two phones that sit close to the top of the price point hierarchy, an echelon where there can be no compromises because anything lower than the best would be unacceptable.Today is about the Huawei Mate S and the Samsung Galaxy Note5.As these devices are priced so similarly (RM2,698 for the Mate S and RM2,699 for the Galaxy Note5) the question most people are interested in is “which do I buy?”. Well, we’re pitting these two behemoths against each other in a head-to-head comparison to help you answer that question a little better.Let me be clear upfront, I won’t go over every detail of each device, rather the devices will be judged on how premium or special they make you feel. If I were going to shell out over two and a half thousand ringgit on a device, I want to make sure that the device is absolutely the best device in every single aspect I could ever purchase with that kind of money.

Malaysian Apple fans have been clamouring for the Apple Watch ever since it was announced, but here we are eight months later and still no Watch in sight. Well, we actually don’t know if this is good news or just slightly sad news because apparently Apple is already preparing a March 2016 event to unveil the second generation Apple Watch alongside what could be the 4-inch “iPhone 6c”.9to5Mac reports that the second-generation wearable could possibly start shipping in April, a full year after the first device was launched. They also report that Apple had long developed the technology needed for future Apple Watch generations even before the original Apple Watch started shipping. Components that allow sleep tracking, wireless, health sensor technologies and even a new camera for the wearable have already been developed.When we last saw the iPhone 6c, it was rumoured to be launched in the first half of 2016 and based on this new report, it looks like it should, at least, get a first half announcement alongside the 2nd gen Apple Watch. Following the success of the iPhone 5c, it doesn’t really come as a surprise that Apple wants to continue the c-badge because there are many Apple fans that simply cannot shell out the dough needed for their flagship devices.What’s even better is that the iPhone 6c could be powered by an Apple A8 (iPhone 6/6 Plus)/A9 (iPhone 6S/6S Plus) chip, so performance on iOS should be about as buttery as can be. If it follows in the footsteps of the iPhone 5c then it should come in a plastic body sporting a multitude of funky and bright colours. The smaller size would be a throwback to a time before iPhones became “iPhablets” which we’re sure will be welcomed by those with smaller hands.However, with the current abysmal exchange rate of the Ringgit, if this device is launched, would it be affordable enough to appeal to those below the high-end market? Based on the iPhone 5c’s launch prices, RM1,999 for the 16GB model and RM2,399 for the 32GB model (keep in mind both of these are without GST), we doubt so. But then again, the iPhone low-to-midrange end isn’t exactly the same as other low-to-midrange brackets.[SOURCE]"

Wow, where have we seen that before? In any case, the device does pack some mighty specs as it sports Apple’s monstrous A9X chip with 4GB of RAM and a choice of 32GB or 128GB of internal storage.All of these “laptop replacement” specifications come at a cost though as the 32GB WiFi base model (without the keyboard and Apple Pencil) will set you back RM3,599, whereas the top-end device with 128GB of internal storage and cellular + WiFi connectivity options will cost RM4,899 with GST.On the other hand, Maxis is offering the high-end 128GB with WiFi and Cellular connectivity for RM3,982 (device only) if you purchase it with a 24-month Maxis SurfMore50 plan. The SurfMore50 plan comes with 2GB of Internet quota and will cost RM50 a month. However, when you purchase this device from Maxis, you will also have to pay a device advance payment of RM300 as well as one month’s subscription upfront which will amount RM4,282.

Arif Lee,Apple’s first ever battery pack is ugly and expensive,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/09/apple-now-has-a-smart-powerbank-for-the-iphone-6s/,"6s,apple,apple malaysia,apple powerbank,apple smart battery case,ios,iphone,iphone 6,iphone 6s malaysia,iphone 6s smart battery case,iphone malaysia,iphone smart battery case,malaysia,powerbank,smart battery case,industry in general,mobile accessories,mobile devices,mobile os","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-09,"Form and function. These are synonymous with Apple. People may disagree with a lot of things but many will agree that when it comes to making something as ubiquitous as a smartphone look like a work of art, Apple does it best.But sometimes, even the best get it wrong.This is the Apple Smart Battery Case. It’s the company’s first ever battery pack and it’s decidedly un-Apple. More on that later but first, let’s go into the specs.The Smart Battery Case is a battery pack that fits the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. It packs a 1,877mAh battery and Apple says it’s good for 18 hours of internet browsing time on LTE or 20 hours of video playback time. The battery case has a soft touch silicone exterior with a microfibre inner lining to protect your iPhone. There are two colours to choose from (white and charcoal gray) currently and it’s the only battery case that comes with a lighting connector.So why is the Smart Battery Case un-Apple?It’s the design. Next to the slim, sleek and slender iPhone 6, the Smart Battery Case, with its unsightly bulge, looks like an afterthought, like the designers at Apple didn’t even bother to make this thing look good.It’s not that great as a battery case either. There’s no separate switch to activate or deactivate the battery case and the lack of an external battery indicator makes it difficult to know how much power you have left without turning on your iPhone.You do however get an integrated battery status built into iOS when the battery case is plugged into your iPhone but that means you will have to turn on your phone every time you want check the power status of the battery case.And for the RM469 asking price, you’re not getting a lot. A popular battery case alternative like the Mophie Juice Pack Air with a 2,750mAh battery pack, a dedicated on/off switch and external LED indicators costs about the same.So if you’re an iPhone 6 or 6S user that’s constantly looking for a power point because your iPhone is out of battery, you might want to stay away from the Apple Battery Pack. It’s ugly, it’s expensive and for something that’s designed for the iPhone by the makers of the iPhone itself, it’s decidedly un-Apple.Maybe Apple took some inspiration from the device below.

Apple has just started pushing its iOS 9.2 update for its iDevices while the Apple Watch is getting a newer watchOS 2.1 update. For iOS devices, the latest release focuses on Apple Music and some minor improvements on its native apps. There are a couple of bug fixes as well that fixes stability issues with Safari, Contacts, Calendar and its native keyboard. If you’re using the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, iBooks now supports 3D Touch and you can perform the usual peek and pop from the table of contents. iOS 9.2 is available now in Malaysia and you can download it under Settings > General > Software Updates. It weighs 272MB so it is best that you’ll find an unmetered WiFi for this. Following the release of watchOS 2, Apple has released an incremental update which adds Malay as a language option for the Watch along with Arabic, Czech, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Portuguese and Vietnamese. Islamic and Hebrew Calendars have also been added, as well as Siri and dictation support in Arabic. The update which weighs 57MB also squashes a couple of bugs including calendar updates, the issue with time not being able to display in power reserve mode and a bug which prevents 3rd party apps from launching. To update, just open the Watch app on your iPhone and look for General > Software Update. The Watch has to have at least 50% of battery and plugged in before you can proceed.[ SOURCE 2 ]"

Released after their epic Single’s Day sales, the Redmi Note 3 has a more premium unibody metal design, upgraded specs, a fingerprint scanner and also the largest battery for a Xiaomi smartphone. If you can’t wait for Xiaomi Malaysia to bring it here officially, the folks at DirectD has started offering imported units under RM1,000. Available in two variants, the 2GB RAM and 16GB storage base model is going for RM859, and they have both Silver and Gold colour in stock. If you need something with more grunt, the higher spec 3GB RAM with 32GB of storage version in Silver only is available at RM999. The rest of the specs are almost identical with the current Redmi Note 2. The front display is a 5.5incher that does Full HD resolution while processing is handled by MediaTek’s Octa-Core Helio X10 processor. The cameras appear to be unchanged with a 13MP PDAF camera at the rear while the front gets a 5MP shooter. While the battery isn’t removable this time, the Redmi Note 3 gets a huge 4,000mAh capacity battery while still maintaining a slender 8.65mm profile.It also gets 4G LTE support with dual-SIM but sadly there’s no microSD expansion slot with the Redmi Note 3. Also new for Xiaomi is a fingerprint scanner at the back which unlocks instantly on a single tap. Out of the box, it runs on MIUI 7 that’s based on Android Lollipop. As a reference, the Redmi Note 3 in China is going for 899 CNY (about RM596) for the lower spec unit and 1,099 CNY (about RM728) for the high-spec version. If the extra premium of about RM260-270 for an import set is reasonable to you, you now have the option to get one today. Otherwise, you could settle for the Redmi Note 2 which is now available with special bundles during its Christmas sale.If you’re interested, head over to DirectD’s Redmi Note 3 page.[ SOURCE ]"

A term, to the layman, that is commonly associated with a certain ugly vehicular abomination that claims to be green and is well loved by Hollywood actors who want to appear environmentally conscious. Cameron Diaz has one y’know.In tech, it is also a term that has been gaining popularity because it usually means you can afford to carry one less device around with you. Yup, we’re talking about hybrid laptops and tablets. Or the laptop cum tablet. Or the tablet cum laptop. Or a “convertible”.Well, that’s what Google is calling their latest device, the Pixel C, and yup you’ve guessed it, the C stands for convertible. It’s not just a tablet, it’s a tablet AND a keyboard. Wow.

Ribbing aside, the Pixel C does have an impressive spec sheet. At the front, the device sports a 10.2-inch 2560×1800 pixel display that achieves a 308ppi pixel density. On the inside, it is running a quad-core Nvidia Tegra X1 chip with 3GB of RAM and a choice of 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The Pixel C will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box, abandoning the Chrome OS normally found in other Chromebooks. This is a strong indication that the merging of Chrome OS and Android is probably well on the way. The device also charges its 9,000 mAh battery via USB Type-C.It also sports an 8-megapixel rear camera that supports 1080p recording and a 2-megapixel front camera, but we do advise against being one of those “tablet photographers”. The tablet attaches to its keyboard via magnets, but the thing that we found great was the fact that the keyboard has a solid base which means you can use it on your lap. For more information on the tablet and its keyboard, head on over here.Marketing it as a tablet with a keyboard means that the Pixel C was not exactly designed to be a hybrid laptop or tablet. And that kind of shows since it is running Android instead of a dedicated laptop/desktop OS. Clearly it isn’t meant to replace your laptop but we do hope that ChromeOS-Android hybrid comes soon so that we can see what this tablet is fully capable of. Of course, this isn’t the first tablet to come with its own keyboard. Sony has done it with the Xperia Z4 Tablet, Samsung has Galaxy Tab S, ASUS has the Transformer, and even Google themselves have the Nexus 9 with a keyboard.The Pixel C is currently available in the Google Store with prices starting at USD499 (around RM2,130). The magnetic keyboard is a USD149 (around RM635) optional extra, but it does also come with a folio keyboard, similar to the Nexus 9’s and will also be priced at USD149. Based on these figures, the Pixel C looks like its a pretty good bargain, especially if you compare it with the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet which will set you back RM2,699 for the device and another RM799 for the accompanying keyboard.Unfortunately, the Pixel C isn’t available in Malaysia. As of this moment there doesn’t seem to be any information on availability in our market but we do hope they will bring it over soon so that we can see first hand what Google thinks is the proper way to build a tablet.[SOURCE, VIA, 2]"

Now in its 7th generation, Google has partnered with Huawei with the all new Nexus 6P. It isn’t just another reference device but an upmarket one that could very well compete with the current crop of flagship smartphones.After its announcement in late September, the Nexus 6P is finally here in Malaysia and you can place your orders beginning this Thursday, 10th December.Available in a single 64GB storage variant, the Nexus 6P is priced officially at RM2,698 inclusive of GST. For Malaysia, we are getting two colour options – Aluminium and Graphite. So far there’s no news of its other Gold and Frost White versions.In terms of size, the Nexus 6P despite its “6” moniker has a 5.7″ screen which makes it more compact than last year’s Nexus 6 by Motorola. The AMOLED screen pushes a Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440 that gives a pixel density of 518 pixels per inch. The exterior is where the Nexus 6P stands out. It gets an all-metal unibody design with a “helmet visor” bump at the back that houses its camera module.Accompanying its high-resolution screen is a pair of stereo speakers which is perfect for gaming and audio playback. For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P also gets a fingerprint scanner at the back that’s natively supported by Android Marshmallow. Like most rear-mounted fingerprint scanners, it unlocks instantly in a single touch.Powering the device is a flagship class 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of RAM, which should be more than sufficient to provide a buttery smooth experience. Like all Nexus smartphones (except for the Nexus One by HTC), there’s no expandable microSD slot and it comes with a single nano SIM slot supporting 4G LTE.In terms of cameras, the Nexus 6P focuses on larger pixels rather than the usual pixel count. Despite having a 12.3MP sensor from Sony, it boasts a larger 1.55 μm pixel size that allows in more light and this apparently is good enough to compensate for the lack of an Optical Image Stabilisation. It gets a dual-tone LED flash, Phase Detection and Laser Auto Focus so that you won’t miss a shot. Over at the front, selfies are taken care by its rather large 8MP shooter.Keeping the lights on, the Nexus 6P has a generous 3,450mAh battery and it charges up via a reversible USB Type C port. Out of the box, you get 2 sets of cables – a USB Type-C to Type-C and the standard USB Type-C to full sized USB. The power adapter pushes a higher 3Amp output through a USB Type-C port which should be faster than standard 2Amp chargers in the market. Of course the main reason why anyone would get a Nexus, is for its pure Android experience without the unnecessary fluff that’s often preinstalled by OEMs.The Nexus 6P will be available online this Thursday (10th December) through Huawei’s vmall.my and Lazada Online store. Those who snap up units quickly, Huawei will be throwing in an introductory offer of a Chromecast (the first version) worth RM 199, totally free of charge to the first 600. The Nexus 6P also comes with a 1 year one-to-one swap program through Huawei Service Centres.

With the current generation of smartphone cameras breaking barriers and capable of some amazing photographs, given the right conditions; what does the flagship Nexus have to offer?Utilising Sony’s lens on the rear and front, the device in question doesn’t boast an amazing pixel count, only at 12.3-megapixel. It also doesn’t have optical image stabilisation, which by today’s standards could be a big no-noGoogle does however bet on the sensors large pixel size, listed at 1.55 µm to compensate the fact that the lens has no Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS). A combination of an aperture of f/2.0 and the larger micrometre would mean that it’ll absorb a lot more light, at least on paper; making shots in low light scenes easier to manage. Also, PDAF and laser autofocus makes a formidable duo, mediating those poorly dialed in images.How about the front? Well, the 6P gets a much appreciated 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor that’ll greet you every time your eyes meet the screen. There are no fancy add-ons on this 1.4 μm pixel lens, it’s just a bare-bones camera but you will be lucky enough to get HDR+ on the front too."
Rory Lee,BlackBerry launches the much anticipated PRIV in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/08/blackberry-priv-malaysia-official-launch/,"blackberry,blackberry malaysia,blackberry priv,blackberry priv celcom,blackberry priv launch,blackberry priv launch malaysia,blackberry priv malaysia,blackberry priv official launch,blackberry priv price,priv official launch,android,celcom,mobile devices,mobile os,players on the field","Android,BlackBerry,Celcom,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field",2015-12-08,"The highly anticipated “saviour” of manufacturer BlackBerry, the PRIV, has finally been launched in Malaysia. This matrimony of the Android operating system and the security plus convenience of BlackBerry’s own operating system comes in a premium body with a curved display that will surely appeal to existing mainstream smartphone users. The PRIV does have a trick up its sleeve though as it features a physical QWERTY keyboard that slides out from under its display.This slide out keyboard also functions as a touchpad for scrolling that makes text selection quicker and more accurate. There is also a text prediction feature that lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard.BlackBerry’s PRIV is the largest device the ever manufactured by the Waterloo corporation and comes with a 5.4″ quad-HD panel, that is curved every so slightly, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy S6 edge and Galaxy S6 edge+. Spec-wise, the device runs an octa-core Snapdragon 808 processor with 3GB of ram and 32GB of internal storage. Storage is expandable via microSD up to 2TB, assuming you ever find cards with that much storage.Powering the device is a relatively large 3,140 mAh battery and it also runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box. The bonus feature is that the PRIV comes with a host of BlackBerry productivity apps including a unified Hub.In terms of optics, the device features an 18-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) and a dual-LED flash. It is also certified by Schneider-Kreuznach. Unfortunately, the PRIV only receives a 2-megapixel selfie-panorama front facing camera for selfies, which we’re sure may disappoint some. However, cameras aren’t all about optics, so we will have to see how good this 2MP shooter is.Many expect the PRIV to be a game changer as it is supposed to bring the best of both Android and BlackBerry operating systems together in a premium device. Well, it certainly has to be a game changer because BlackBerry CEO has stated that the company is relying heavily on the PRIV to do well for them to stay afloat.If you want to get your hands on this device, you can preorder the PRIV at a discounted price of RM3,388 for the first 60 customers on 11street.my, or head over to any Celcom Blue Cube outlets to preorder for the same price until the 14th of December. Alternatively, you can try your luck with 11street’s shocking bid from as low as RM1.The device will be available from 15 December onwards and will retail for RM3,559. That’s a hefty price to pay for this device, no matter how premium. Would you shell out that kind of money for this device?

We love them because they do what we don’t ever, ever, ever, ever want to do ourselves. We also love them because it’s fun to watch an extremely premium device get smashed to bits in the most ridiculous fashion ever.If you share our sentiment then good news! UnboxTherapy just dropped a new video where he uses the Samsung Galaxy S6 active (which we know is one tough device) as a hockey puck. If you can’t tell, our noses are wrinkled with excitement now.In case you don’t already know, the Samsung Galaxy S6 active sports a 5.1″ quad-HD Super AMOLED display (1440×2560 pixels). On the inside, the device is powered by an Exynos 7420 octa-core processor with four cores clocked at 2.1GHz and four at 1.5GHz paired with a 3GB of RAM and a choice of 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The camera unit is a 16-megapixel/5-megapixel front/rear combo and the entire device is wrapped up in a super-rugged shell.Designed to be a super rugged version of the Galaxy S6, the device is IP68 dust and water-resistant up to 1.5 metres and 30 minutes. It’s also MIL-STD-810G certified salt, dust, humidity, rain, vibration, solar radiation, transport, and thermal shock resistant. Yup, that means it has a military certification for being able to take a beating.All credit to the device, it really can take a beating. Unfortunately, the Galaxy S6 active isn’t available in Malaysia in case you were thinking of getting one to have a go at it on Sunway’s ice rink. That said, we would really like it if Samsung Malaysia brings one over for us to have a spot if sepak takraw with. Pretty please?[SOURCE]"

If they keep the pricing in the same bracket as the previous Galaxy A series, we could have a serious contender in the low-to-midrange end of the smartphone market.The Galaxy A series consists of three phones, the Galaxy A3, Galaxy A5, and Galaxy A7 all bearing their new “6” badge that is supposed to represent 2016. We don’t know about you, but this peculiar badging just seems like another way to unnecessarily confuse prospective buyers.At first glance, all three devices share Samsung’s Galaxy S6 flagship’s looks with a metal body sandwiched between two panels of glass. They also feature the rounded edges of the Galaxy S6 and pretty much the same layout we’ve grown to get used to for Samsung devices. All three devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box.One thing that we were quite impressed with was the camera. All devices across the announced Galaxy A range feature a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture rear shooter and a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates them is that on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 both come bundled with optical image stabilisation (OIS) for their primary imaging unit. That’s pretty impressive for what looks to be mid-range devices. The best part? They all come in Pink Gold, so if you’ve ever wanted that colour but not the price tag it usually comes with, this could be your chance.That aside, the Galaxy A series begins with what looks like the entry-level Galaxy A3 sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) Super AMOLED display. The device would be powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz processor mated with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. This smartphone will also come with a 2,300 mAh battery.The Galaxy A3 will also have dual-SIM support, but it doesn’t appear to be a hybrid-SIM set up which means that you can have two SIMs and a microSD card. Other goodies include Cat.4 LTE connectivity support and 802.11 b/g/n WiFi. It also comes with Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, but no support for Samsung Pay.Moving up the pecking order comes the mid-range Galaxy A5. As the name implies, the Galaxy A5 is a step up from the Galaxy A3 and features a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (also expandable via microSD up to 128GB). It is also bigger, with a 5.2” full-HD (1920×1080 pixels) Super AMOLED display. Powering it all will be a 2,900 mAh battery with fast charging.Connectivity options include Cat.6 LTE support, 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, this time with support for Samsung Pay. Perhaps one of the key features of this device is the fingerprint scanner, which is quite rare beyond the top end of the smartphone spectrum. Much like the Galaxy A3, the Galaxy A5 also has dual-SIM support.Sitting at the top of the range is the Galaxy A7, which is the largest device, featuring a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel. Under the hood, the smartphone will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. It also has dual-SIM capabilities.Connectivity options are the same as the Galaxy A5, but the Galaxy A7 gets a bigger 3,300 mAh battery also with fast charging. Like its smaller brother the Galaxy A5, the Galaxy A7 also comes with a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay.Though the specific type of processor was not revealed, we have a hunch that it is Samsung’s Exynos processor. The first range of the Galaxy A smartphones were launched towards the end of 2014 and it was Samsung’s first attempt at truly bringing premium build quality to the masses. Before the Galaxy A series was launched, Samsung’s low end devices were all very plasticky and felt cheaply made, which felt like a rude reminder to all those who bought them to work harder.Now, with the rise of Chinese OEMs and their seemingly impossible smartphone value-for-money, especially in the lower end of the spectrum, the Korean electronics giant can’t afford to be complacent in their budget smartphones and risk giving up this lucrative section in the market.If the refreshed 2016 versions of the Galaxy A lineup are to be priced similarly to the previous Galaxy A lineup, we think that it could definitely be very competitive in that market. However, if Samsung prices these devices higher than their previous lineup, you’d be better off with a discounted Galaxy S6 instead.As a reference, when the original Galaxy A lineup was launched, the Galaxy A3 was priced at RM899, while the Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199, and the Galaxy A7 would set you back RM1,499. Bear in mind, these prices were before the implementation of GST and the falling ringgit. Of course, there are other good smartphones at this price bracket as well, such as the OnePlus X, the Sony Xperia M5 Dual and the honor 7. So the question is, do you buy into Samsung’s idea of a premium mid-range device?We’re pretty keen on these devices, what do you guys think? Let us know in the comments below.[SOURCE, 2]"

Alexander Wong,BlackBerry PRIV: Can an Android smartphone with a physical keyboard save the day?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/03/blackberry-priv-first-impressions-malaysia/,"android,blackberry,blackberry android smart phone,blackberry priv,blackberry priv first impressions,blackberry priv hands-on,blackberry priv malaysia,blackberry priv malaysia launch,first impressions,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,BlackBerry,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-03,"A BlackBerry running Android? Several years ago, the idea would be laughable, but today an Android smartphone could actually make or break this once dominate mobile brand. As BlackBerry continues to lose ground in smartphone market, they are pinning their hopes on the BlackBerry PRIV. Their first Android device that comes with a slider keyboard. The PRIV will be launched in Malaysia next week and we’re lucky enough to get a brief hands-on with this new slider device. At 5.4 inches, the PRIV is the largest smartphone BlackBerry has ever produced and the display features a double curve screen that’s very much like the S6 edge. Though the phone is not wrapped in metal, it does look premium enough for the business-centric user. The back has a grippy texture to it which gives it an assuring feel in the hands, but it took a little while to get used to.When held in the hands, it does have a nice heft to it and despite having a larger screen plus a sliding keyboard mechanism, it is lighter by a couple of grams than the BlackBerry Passport. The sliding QWERTY keyboard is the main highlight of the PRIV, and the mechanism and the design are much improved from the old BlackBerry Torch. When sliding out, the PRIV feels slightly top heavy but it didn’t really bother us while typing. Having used a BlackBerry Bold previously, I found the keyboard to be enjoyable to use. Yes, you do type faster with on-screen keyboards with advance prediction technology but it doesn’t give the same tactile satisfaction as the real deal. Another advantage of using a slider keyboard is that you’ll have an unobstructed display to view your stuff since there’s no on-screen keyboard occupying half of the screen.Like the BlackBerry Passport, the keyboard has a couple of neat tricks. It also functions as a touchpad for scrolling and it makes text selection quicker and accurate.  There’s also a text prediction feature that was introduced on BlackBerry 10 and it lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard. In terms of single-handed use, the width of the device is just right and you won’t struggle as much as the BlackBerry Passport that’s super wide. If you’re not using a physical keyboard, the stock BlackBerry keyboard works just fine and you probably could install 3rd party ones like Swype or SwiftKey. I can imagine myself using the virtual keyboard more frequently for quick social updates, replies or while hooked up to a holder while driving. In terms of performance, the PRIV that runs on Android 5.1.1 felt quite smooth and I didn’t experience any noticeable lags in the short time using it. The UI is very stock like and they do integrated a couple of native BlackBerry Apps including the unified BlackBerry Hub. If you’re using an Android device currently, you should feel quite at home but BB10 users might take a while to get used to it as demonstrated by their CEO John Chen.So is the BlackBerry PRIV the device to get? Probably the one and the only reason to consider is its physical keyboard. I love the feel of it, I really do and it is something that I find myself using regularly for writing stories or replying emails. But for other things when you just need to shoot a quick reply, the on-screen keyboard does the job just fine. Knowing BlackBerry will definitely price this at a premium, we struggle to justify why anyone should get it over the Galaxy Note5. In terms of hardware, the Quad HD display, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is pretty much mainstream. You could get that on the LG G4 that’s currently going for about RM2,299. Of course, specs is just one factor to consider and the PRIV is also focused on privacy, which they are claiming to be the most if not one of the most secure Android smartphones in the market. Admittedly, I didn’t manage to explore other features such as the 18MP OIS-equipped camera and the DTEK security monitoring tool. Hopefully, we get to do so during the official local launch that’s happening on 8th December.Unless you’re getting this as a company phone, it is quite hard to justify paying more just the keyboard alone. Is there a genuine need for a physical QWERTY keyboard? Several Android brands have tried with the HTC Desire Z, HTC ChaCha and the Motorola Milestone, but most of them have ceased to exist. The recent attempt is by Samsung with its Keyboard Cover accessory for the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+, but with a less ideal implementation. Could BlackBerry stay relevant in the Android world with the PRIV? Let us know in the comments below."

While this is good news for UniFi subscribers, this collaboration seems to directly impede the growth of TM’s own, HyppTV’s video on demand (VOD) offers, though TM markets this iflix free subscription as an add-on to the existing IPTV service.What’s peculiar is that this iflix subscription service doesn’t require a login account. Starting mid-December of this year, UniFi subscribers only need to launch iflix on their preferred device while connected to their UniFi connection and the streaming service will “tag” the device, allowing users access to all its content. iflix will allow you to pair up to 5 devices per connection and will support concurrent streaming on up to 2 devices. If you want to register a sixth device, simply remove a previously registered device in iflix’s settings and register the new one. This is is pretty timely especially since iflix now also supports offline viewing on both iOS and Android devices.Before all you Streamyx subscribers start protesting, TM has also announced that they are working to bring these same benefits to their 4Mbps and 8Mbps Streamyx subscribers at a later date. Unfortunately, this service is not available for UniFi BIZ Advance Plan subscribers.This collaboration between TM and iflix is the first of its kind in the ASEAN region and is supposed to be part of fulfilling TM’s motto “Life Made Easier”."

The purpose is to allow users to try out the application before deciding whether or not they want to download it. According to Google, one in four applications downloaded is never even used because of the shortening mobile attention span of the average user.Trial Run Ads attempts to curb that by letting users really get a feel of an application before downloading them, thus benefiting both the user and the app developer. This application is only in its beta stage though, but Google has unveiled this to app developers so the ball is in their court now and it is up to them to decide how to best utilise this feature. With proper and effective implementation, this looks like it could be a very interesting feature.Besides this nifty app Harry Potter-y, Google is also starting the beta for Interactive Interstitial ads that utilises HTML5 to create interactive mobile advertisements. It will let advertisers completely customise the advertisement to their liking and give them the freedom they need to use HTML5 instead of standard templates and pull data dynamically.

To recap, the Nexus 6P is a more upmarket Nexus device with 5.7″ Quad HD screen wrapped under a full metal unibody chassis. Powering the pure Android experience device is a 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM and it gets 64GB of storage which isn’t expandable. You get a 12.3MP f/2.0 main camera with Laser AutoFocus while the front gets an 8MP f/2.4 shooter.For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P gets a fingerprint sensor which unlocks on a single touch and it uses the new USB Type-C standard that’s reversible. Keeping this flagship device running for long is a generous 3,450mAh capacity battery which is charged with a 3Amp Fast Charger. At RM2,689, it is very closely priced with other Android flagship contenders including the Galaxy Note5, Xperia Z5 Dual and Huawei Mate S. Of course, getting the Nexus 6P isn’t just about the hardware. It runs on the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow in its purest form, the way Android is intended to be experienced. Another plus point is that it will always be among the first devices to receive the latest Android updates. The Nexus 6P will be launched next Tuesday, 8th December. Sales on Lazada hasn’t started yet and it is likely to be available for purchase after the event. Keep it locked on to SoyaCincau.com for the latest Nexus 6P stories.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

While it isn’t the game changer we’re looking for, the expensive price tag didn’t seem to stop it from becoming a hot seller.  According to the latest IDC report, Apple has already sold 7.5 million Watches between April and October. You can’t deny that’s pretty impressive considering Samsung only sold over a million Gear smart watches for the whole of 2014. Even Android Wear has managed to ship 720,000 units, with Moto 360 leading the pack.Despite the impressive figures for Apple, they are still not number 1 when it comes to wearable devices.  Holding on to its #1 spot is Fitbit with its line of dedicated fitness trackers. In the face of heighten competition from its affordable Chinese rivals, they are continuing to grow from 3.9 million units shipped in Q1 this year to 4.7 million shipped in the last quarter. Driving the sales is their popular Charge and Surge, as they continue to increase its presence worldwide. According to IDC, the increase for Fitbit was also attributed to the rise of corporate wellness programs with large corporations providing Fitbit trackers for their staff. With the entry of Apple Watch, the Cupertino company has managed to catapult itself to 2nd place, putting a dent to the market share of current wearable brands. In Q3, Apple has shipped 3.9 Watches, an increase of 300,000 over Q2 as it increased its availability to more market. Strangely Malaysians are still not getting the Watch, while it is already on sale officially in Singapore, Thailand and most recently Indonesia starting yesterday.At number 3 for Q3 2015 is Xiaomi with its super affordable Mi Band. So far they have shipped out 9.6 million units for 2015 and they are expected to close the year higher after its recent Single’s Day sale. To revive its popularity, the Chinese company had also announced an upgraded Mi Band 1S that comes with a heart rate sensor while maintaining a low 99 CNY (about RM68) price tag. Meanwhile, Garmin is still persistent in 4th place with 900,000 wearables shipped, but the real shocker is Samsung as it gets knocked off the Top 5 list for the first time this year. The new entry is a YTC Y01 children watch by BBK with 700,000 sold last quarter. The Chinese based company had sold 100,000 more than Samsung, thus pushing them down to 6th place. With the introduction of its Gear S2, Samsung might just bounce back especially with the current year-end shopping season. In terms of looks, we’d say Samsung has finally nailed it with the Gear S2, but they had cut down the number of features compared to its earlier Gear models.   [ SOURCE 2 ]"

This is the BlackBerry’s first flagship to run on Android and it comes with its BlackBerry Torch-like slider keyboard. Available in retail stores and telcos from 12th December, the PRIV is priced at S$1,098 which converts to RM3,296. That’s slightly more than the Galaxy Note5 which was launched in the island state at S$1,088.Catching up since the BlackBerry Passport, the PRIV aims to stay relevant with updated hardware and a fresh user experience. It gets a 5.4″ AMOLED Quad HD screen with double curved edges and it runs on a more current Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. For storage it has 32GB on-board which is expandable with microSD. Running on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with the possibility of being upgraded to Marshmallow early next year, the PRIV eliminates the concern of having limited apps with full access to the Google Play Store. With virtually all Android players adopting a full touch screen display, BlackBerry hopes to fulfill the needs of consumers that desire the tactile feel of a physical keyboard. Given its retail price, the PRIV will face a tough challenge from likes of the Galaxy Note5, Xperia Z5 and even the Nexus 6P. After all, existing Android users will be their key focus group according to their Senior Director for Asia Pacific Product Management. The main deciding factor of course the slider keyboard. With the advancements of virtual keyboards such as SwiftKey and Swype, do you really need a physical keyboard in this day and age? Given a choice between a BlackBerry PRIV and a Galaxy Note5, which smartphone would you get? The PRIV has passed our local SIRIM certification a while back and it shouldn’t take too long for BlackBerry to launch it in Malaysia. [ SOURCE 2 ]"

This do or die device will be the brand’s pivotal move to see if it can still play the mobile game or close down for good.The QWERTY physical keyboard returns, this time on the brand that has (tried) kept it alive. This symbiotic relationship is close to becoming an old script, with users preferring the regularly used touch-based screens.They’re final market place would be business users that deal with highly classified information: trade secrets, medical related and anything else that falls under the same sun. At one point, even the Secret Service’s most important asset aka President Barack Obama, once used a BlackBerry smartphone.So what’s so appealing about their soon to be released device? Well for one it’ll boast a 5.4-inch AMOLED display that is capable of QHD (2144 x 1980) resolution. The glass on the device features a tapering dual edged screen, that doubles as a battery level indicator when plugged in (on one side).Multitasking shouldn’t be a hitch on the smartphone that carries 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage. Camera-wise, there are two lenses, as expected: an Schneider-Kreuznach 18-megapixel rear shutter with OIS and dual LEDs, while the front gets a lowly 2-megapixel lens.Other than the usual suspects, the PRIV will also have a slew of connectivity options as listed below:Bluetooth 4.1
Wi-Fi 802.11ac (along with other bands)
NFC
Packing a punch, the PRIV hides a 3,410 mAh battery underneath its lower half, as Android 5.1.1 Lollipop will work as its brains. Uniquely to the PRIV, their manufacturer has outed some of its apps on the Google Play Store, adding a little signature touch to the whole experience.Those thinking of picking up the PRIV should take a look at how it handles durability, since it has the security aspect on lock down. Users will have to wait for the device to launch first before knowing the pricing but look for it to be roughly RM 2,966 (converted from US pricing) and our neighbours in Singapore have to fork out S$ 1,098 which converts to RM 3,296.If you haven’t seen it yet, check out our BlackBerry PRIV First Impressions.[ IMAGE SOURCE ]"

What are we talking about? Well, the folks at OnePlus have decided it was a good idea to poke the metaphorical bear that is Apple, with their latest advert for an iPhone 6/6s Sandstone back case.Mmm, we love the smell of napalm in the morning.In their cheeky video – which looks like a parody of what we like to call the “swelling-music-advert” – OnePlus have painted themselves (or their users at least) as that guy who has got it “covered”, always ready and willing to help out their friends in need. In this case (ha ha), it would be OnePlus’ new friends over at Cupertino. As fun as this is, we certainly do hope OnePlus doesn’t think ALL its users dress like the guy in the video (that hat, really?).Just yesterday, OnePlus also posted a teaser on their Facebook page about their latest product, which I’m sure must’ve irked many an iPhone user now that the cat’s out of the bag.There is yet more evidence of this “friendly ribbing” on their product page as they strive to give iPhone 6/6s users the “Never Settle” feel, adding that its “sturdy, polycarbonate construction” adds both “grippiness and protection”. Apparently it’s one of those things “you won’t understand until you try it”.To sweeten the deal, OnePlus is throwing in a physical OnePlus X invite with every purchase of this back case. That’s not all, the invites aren’t only invitations to buy the regular phone, but there is also a chance that you could get an invite to purchase the OnePlus X Ceramic or better yet, a free device. Now that sounds dandy and all but when we tried to purchase the case from their online store, a pop-up informed us that the case was currently out of stock, despite it being listed as in stock on the page itself.Maybe this is some kind of elaborate April fools prank in December. December Dummies perhaps? Of course, this isn’t the first time OnePlus has done something most people deem ridiculous to generate buzz, just a few months back their co-founder applied to be an intern at Samsung. If you’re interested in the case, head on over to their product page or website to check it out for yourselves. See? We’ve got you covered too.[SOURCE]"
Rory Lee,The 3x optical zoom ASUS ZenFone Zoom is now on sale in Taiwan,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/02/the-3x-optical-zoom-asus-zenfone-zoom-on-sale-in-taiwan/,"android,asus,asus malaysia,asus zenfone,asus zenfone zoom,asus zenfone zoom launch,camera,lumia 1020,optical zoom,smart phone,smart phone camera,smartphone,smartphone camera,smartphone with optical zoom,zenfone zoom,zenfone zoom launch,zenfone zoom launch taiwan,zoom lens,mobile devices,mobile os","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-02,"According to a report published in 2013, over 90% of people who have ever taken a photo in their life have only done so on a phone, not a traditional or standalone camera. That is a staggering number of people if you think about it, especially taking into consideration the keyword in that phrase is ‘ever’. Which means that, even two years ago, when smartphone cameras were arguably worse than they are now, people still defaulted to them for that snapshotting needs. This is completely understandable simply because a smartphone is more portable, usually cheaper and are just generally more convenient.Well, ASUS hopes to add to that statistic with their latest ZenFone Zoom, which officially goes on sale in Taiwan today.One of the biggest problems was that most smartphones relied on a digital zoom, which is more like a fancy way to crop your photos if you think about it. The one you want to go for when zooming is the optical zoom, which adjusts the glass positioned in a camera/lens unit to reposition the light hitting the sensor, which brings the image closer but maintains its quality. Most smartphones shy away from using this because having multiple pieces of glass in the camera unit means having more space which in turn translates to a bigger camera hump.The supposedly brilliant thing about the ZenFone Zoom though is that it is the “world’s thinnest 3x-optical zoom smartphone”. How thin is thin? Well ASUS states that the ZenFone Zoom only has a 5mm edge. Bear in mind, this is the edge, and as the ZenFone line of devices have usually been curved at the back, this looks to be no exception. From the looks of it, the device’s camera unit does take up an enormous amount of space on the back panel ala-Lumia 1020, but it doesn’t seem to protrude as much as the Lumia.In a device that is designed to take photographs, most of the actual photography will be taken by the primary 13-megapixel rear shooter while selfies and video chats will be handled by the device’s 5MP front facing unit. Other primary camera goodies include a dual-LED flash, laser autofocus, optical image stabilisation (OIS) and ASUS’ PixelMaster 2.0 camera technology that is designed to greatly improve low light photography, granting up to a 400% increase in brightness. For those curious about the PixelMaster 2.0 technology, we’ve already put it through its paces in our Zenfone 2 Laser review. The ZenFone Zoom will also feature a dedicated shutter button, record button as well as a zoom rocker.Then again, we already expected most of this as the device was announced almost a year ago. What we do know now for sure now is that the device will come in 64GB and 128GB variants. Internal specs include an Intel Atom Z3580 quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz for the 64GB variant while the 128GB variant will be powered by a 2.5GHz Intel Atom Z3590 quad-core processor. Based on the website, it appears that the device will also come with 4GB of RAM and be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS’ BoostMaster quick charging technology. The devices will also come running Android Lollipop out of the box.Display wise, the smartphone will come with a 5.5-inch full HD display with a pixel density of 403 ppi tucked away under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The body will also be of an aluminium unibody construction with what looks like a faux leather back to help with grip and texture as well as a ridge at the bottom of the phone to help with one handed photography. But we all know what a unibody means: no removable battery. It does have what looks like a lanyard port and appears to come bundled with a camera strap.The 64GB device retails in Taiwan for TWD13,990 (around RM1,806) while the 128GB will go for TWD15,990 (around RM2,065). While ASUS did not announce when this device will be available in other markets, ASUS Malaysia has hinted at an end-of-2015 release, which means it could be any time now. The odd thing is that this device was announced a long time ago, and between its announcement and today ASUS has launched several devices already.This begs the question, what took them so long? Was there a massive kink in the device that delayed its launch this long? Let’s hope they’ve worked out whatever problems they had with it (if they had any problems) lest we have a repeat of LG’s little disaster.We suspect this device will appeal to some camera enthusiasts who were interested in the Lumia 1020 but not the Windows Mobile platform. While it does seem that this device is a worthy Android equivalent, its sensor is but a measly 13-megapixels versus the Lumia 1020’s 41-megapixel monstrosity. Then again, megapixel isn’t the be-all and end-all of camera quality, so we will just have to wait and see.[SOURCE, 2, VIA]"

By making his own smartphone. An engineer by occupation, Andy Rubin has been around; he’s graced Car Zeiss, Apple, MSN, Google and of course, Android Inc. Interestingly, a report from The Information has the long lost granddaddy of all things Android calling for a recruitment drive for individuals to join his revisited escapade.A year plus after taking his leave from Google, it’s apparent that his brainchild Playground Global will finally start giving back to his own causes. The aforementioned start-up by Rubin serves as a tech hatchery of sorts; enabling those wanting to start their own thing but don’t have the resources, mentorship and funding to make it happen.The Fund itself, managed to raise roughly US$ 300 million from investments by Google (no duh), Hewlett-Packard aka HP, Seagate and others. Leveraging on his venture capital experiences with Redpoint Ventures (where he is a partner), as for now, his cash flow has been streaming to artificial intelligence and smart home segments. Though the aforementioned report states that Rubin still sees the opportunity to enter the Android smartphone market.Folks at the Verge seems to think that the dynamics of the low to midrange market is too volatile to enter, with manufactures popping up every now and then. Thus, maybe his best bet is to make a premium device that’ll hope to take a slice away from the Apple pie.The inhibitors of Mountain View might have something to say about that, since Google themselves have been reported to be working on their own hardware; all the pieces seem to be lining up quite well for the former head of Android Inc. And a possible return to the smartphone scene might amount to a foreseeable re-entry at Google.Jumping at any opportunity to make something great, Rubin has touched the lives of many, even if we fail to realise it. As the master of surprises and all things Android, should we expect anything less from him?[ SOURCE, VIA ]"
Alexander Wong,Speedtest reveals Malaysia’s fastest Broadband ISP and Mobile Networks,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/01/speedtest-reveals-malaysias-fastest-broadband-isp-and-mobile-network/,"4g,4g lte,fastest isp,fastest mobile network,lte,malaysia,malaysia\'s fastest mobile network,ookla,speedtest,speedtest fastest network,speedtest.net,tm,tm unifi,u mobile,u mobile 3g,u mobile 4g,unifi,celcom,digi,industry in general,maxis,players on the field,yes","Celcom,DiGi,Industry in General,Maxis,Players on the Field,TM,U Mobile,Yes",2015-12-01,"A few days ago, U Mobile claims the title of Malaysia’s Fastest Mobile Network as awarded by Ookla’s Speedtest.net. As a gesture of appreciation to its subscribers, they are giving out 1GB of free data for the month of December.So how fast is the fastest? Speedtest has finally revealed the numbers along with the rank of our current fixed and mobile operators in the country. Full details after the break. Starting with mobile networks that are running on 4G LTE, U Mobile is ranked #1 with an average download speed of 22.58Mbps with uploads of 10.34Mbps. Following in 2nd place is Celcom with 19.46Mbps downloads and Maxis holding on to third place at 18.20Mbps. Meanwhile, Digi takes the last place at 17.49Mbps.  For fixed broadband, TM takes up the Top 3 which is a mixture of various identifiers that lead back to Telekom Malaysia. Looking at the speeds, it is safe to assume that all 3 listings are predominantly Unifi subscribers on the highest 20Mbps Unifi plan. This is then followed by Maxis and YTL Communications, that operates Yes 4G WiMAX. Surprisingly Time Broadband didn’t make the list and we feel they could be among the Top 5 if it wasn’t for TM’s duplicated entries. To recap on the methodology, Speedtest measures the average performance of each telco based on the fastest technology possible which is 4G LTE. So in theory, this wouldn’t take into account of speedtests conducted on 3G and on older non-LTE enabled devices. For fixed broadband ISP, the performance is calculated based on the top 10% of each network’s speedtest results. This according to Speedtest is to accurate represent customers that subscribe to the highest tier/package offered by the ISP. While 4G telcos are self proclaiming the widest, fastest and best network, Speedtest is probably the best independent indicator for now. Another glaring difference between Malaysia versus other countries is that our mobile telcos are delivering faster speeds than our fixed broadband providers. In most cases, the fixed broadband providers in US, Canada, UK and Australia are clocking around 100Mbps or at least 2-3X faster than their fastest 4G operators. So what do you guys think of the verdict? [ SOURCE ]"

The colours on offer are Champagne gold and Dark grey. Jogging your memory on this tablet, it has a 7.9-inch screen plastered onto its metal build, the screen itself has a resolution of 2048 x 1536 (326 ppi).Lighter, thinner and overall smaller than its predecessor, it maintains the same screen size but shrinks down the bezels all around the screen. The Mi Pad 2, ditches the plastic yet weighs in at 322grams, when the model it replaces tips in at 360grams.The upgrades continue with an Intel chipset now at the helm, a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 to be precise. Its 16GB internal storage might set off some alarms with the omission of a microSD slot, especially those inclined to have most of their media with them on the go.For photography (if you’re seriously going to consider that with a tablet), it’ll get an 8-megapixel f/2.0 aperture lens on the rear, that will get you up to FHD video recording. As the front has a 5-megapixel lens, in case of those video calling moments or selfies (again, if you’re seriously considering doing that with a tablet).Two speaker grills will be found on the bottom rear and underneath its backing, there’s a 6190 mAh battery, smaller than before. Xiaomi however, promises it’ll get you 100 hours of music listening and almost 12 and a half hours of video watching.Charging the aforementioned battery will be the USB Type-C port and connector, while other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi; sadly, no 4G LTE support makes its way on this device.In terms of software, you’ll find MIUI 7 OS skin, as per usual. Xiaomi has plans on releasing a Windows 10 model soon, but we have no idea when it’ll be announced.Comparing prices abroad in the brand’s domestic market (China), the 16GB sells for roughly RM 662, that’s a RM 200+ premium, that you’re paying for. At the same time, the higher 64GB model retails for about RM 861, so think about that for a second.You pay for what you get it seems and DirectD has the ball in their court, whether or not it’ll be received well, that depends on you guys.[ SOURCE, VIA, IMAGE SOURCE ]"

I completely understand this desire to milk every last drop out of your prized cow simply because money is hard to make in this world where piracy is rampant.Generally, many of these spin-offs tend to fall flat and the way I see it, there are two big reasons why this happens. The first is that the show doesn’t live up to the hype. It’s hard to follow in the footsteps of something as big as, say, Friends for example (we’re looking at you Joey). Secondly, it doesn’t eventually break off from the original and find and identity of its own, or that special niche that makes a show special.In the world of smartphones, it seems, that there exists this same desire to spin off into various other versions of an OEM’s flagship or popular device.Some spin-offs are designed to make their flagship devices more accessible with lower price points by omitting one or two key features but keeping the feel the same. Others try to incorporate one new key feature that’s absent from the main device.The latter is where ASUS’s Zenfone 2 Laser comes in. In case you haven’t realised it yet, the keyword here is “laser”, which means that this spin-off device’s camera comes with a laser autofocus.

The folks at Microsoft Malaysia are throwing a launch party on the 15th of December and you can stand a chance to win passes to the event. There are 20 pairs of passes up for grabs and all you’ll need to do is to tell them why you love the Lumia 950 by completing the following sentence: “I love the Lumia 950 and 950 XL as much as…”. You can try your luck over at their Facebook post and as usual, don’t forget to read the T&Cs.To refresh your memory, the new Lumia 950/950 XL are Microsoft’s newest high-end smart phones since the launch of the Nokia Lumia 930. Announced back in October, these two smart phones are designed to deliver an integrated experince with its Windows 10 family of products. Apart from having the latest OS, both the Lumia 950 and 950 XL offers a high resolution Quad HD display in 5.2″ and 5.7″ screen sizes respectively. Under the hood, the larger Lumia 950 XL runs on a 2GHz Snapdragon 810 processor while the compact Lumia 950 gets a respectable 1.8GHz Snapdragon 808 unit. Both models come equipped with 3GB of RAM and has 32GB of storage as standard. If that’s not enough, you can easily pop-in a microSD card up to 2TB. Photography should be one of its killer features with a 20MP f/1.9 PureView camera that’s assisted with triple-LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation. It shoots videos in 4K with audio being captured by a 4 microphone set up. For selfies, both models get a 5MP f/2.4 wide angle camera upfront that supports Full HD video recording. Keeping up with times, Microsoft is putting a USB Type-C port on both models and it supports Qi Wireless Charging and Fast Charge. The Lumia 950 gets a 3,000mAh battery while the bigger sibling gets a larger 3,340mAh capacity unit. In the connectivity department, it ticks all the essential boxes including 4G LTE, NFC, Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac WiFi. While it may not have a fingerprint scanner like its high-end rivals, the new flagship Lumias support Windows Hello biometric authentication feature, which unlocks at a glance.The biggest feature to look forward to is Windows Continuum. With an optional Display Dock, the Lumia 950/950 XL can be turned into a full PC experience. Just hook up a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and you can check emails and work on MS Office documents like you do on a desktop.

We’d still think that driving an automobile is an experience best felt by being fully in control but they’re obviously perks to being able to have the ability to control your vehicle autonomously or through a remote.
Pushing the boundaries of driving autonomously, the multi-talented UK based research team from Land Rover have been prototyping technology that allows you to move around your huge SUV or off-road beast, through fiddling with on-screen controls on your smartphone.
Usher your Multi-point turn enabled Range Rover in a relatively controlled environment at a max speed of 4mph and manoeuvre your way through tight situations. Handing you controls for steering, breaks and accelerator, you’ll be able to be outside your car as you carefully move it around challenging terrain or hard to see parking situations – taking bad viewing angles out of the equation.
Land Rover researchers also programmed the Multi-point turn technology to give those manning the virtual wheels the controls to adjust high and low range, angling the car in just the right manner to get around.It doesn’t stop there, as these in-built sensors on the car will apparently work in all weather conditions and environments, always enabling you to get yourself out of a tight spot, if need be. There are some limitations, such as range, when considering that you’ll only be able to “command” the car from a distance of 10 metres, all while your smartphone and smart keys are in close proximity.
The team of researchers have also developed technology that allows you to turn your car a full 180-degrees in a tight spot; basically conducting a three-point turn. A much dreaded manoeuvre for anyone’s that has been in the driver seat of a large vehicle.Although other carmakers have already started implementing some of these options, it’ll be interesting to see how the idea of controlling your car from your smartphone’s will run along. It won’t please any motorheads but given the notion, it might be pretty cool.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

According to the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), this update was not initiated by the app maker and has been infecting Android devices in Singapore over the past few months.After the “update” has been downloaded, the malware will prompt the user to enter confidential information, such as credit card details. Then the malware would take over the affected device and intercepts the one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS to the phone for committing fraudulent transactions.“Criminals have been targeting computer users, but now criminals have turned to targeting Android phone users as banks are pushing out more banking apps for user convenience,” said ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon. It turns out convenience really is becoming the downfall of humanity as we continuously rely on our devices to carry out daily activities.According to Channel NewsAsia, this vulnerability extends beyond just WhatsApp as they claim the malware is disguising itself as an operating system update as well. They reported that about 50 smartphone users have been hit by malware targeting mobile banking customers in the last three months. Besides disguising itself as a WhatsApp update, it also reportedly masquerades as an operating system update for the battery management module.Channel NewsAsia also reports that ABS estimates the average amounts lost by the victims who are customers of major retail banks in Singapore were “a couple of hundred of dollars”, although some victims could have lost several thousand dollars through multiple transactions. The source of these fraudulent transactions appear to originate from Eastern Europe and includes purchases of budget airline tickets.“Jailbroken iPhones or rooted Android [devices] are vulnerable…and in particular Android, because that phone system involves easier download of third-party apps,” said Ong-Ang. The silver lining is that ABS states that banks may refund victims on a case-by-case basis depending on whether or not the victim took the necessary precautions to protect themselves from such attacks.Singapore is awfully close to our home soil of Malaysia, so please be warned and double check your updates before installing them. At the time that this article was written, there has been no official announcement on this matter posted on WhatsApp’s Facebook page, Twitter or Blog. So the moral of the story here is, please make sure that your application updates come directly from the Google Play Store.[SOURCE, 2]"

Well, they certainly weren’t kidding when they said it was designed specifically for the 4G LTE user.Hotlink FAST’s starter pack is priced at RM15 and it comes with RM5 preloaded airtime, 300MB preloaded high-speed Internet and offers users a choice of three internet passes. The first plan gives users a 2GB quota for 30 days, then the second plan doubles that up to 4GB and finally the third plan is sort of a “lite” version where it gives users 500MB for 7 days. Call rates are the same across all plans at 6sen/30sec to your ACTIV10 (10 Hotlink/Maxis numbers) and 12sen/30sec to all local networks. SMS is rated at 1sen/SMS to your ACTIV10 contacts and 12sen/SMS to all local networks.Users can also apply for an add-on of either 1GB (RM12), 500MB (RM8), or 300MB (RM5) that will last the duration of your quota cycle. On the website, it states that there will be “No credit drain” and that the “Internet will stop its service once the FAST Internet pass expires.” However, Hotlink informs us that one the quota has been finished, you can still surf the Internet, but at a throttled speed of 64kbps.They explained that although the quota was split between 4G LTE and non-4G LTE speeds, once a user depletes their designated 4G quota, they can continue surfing at 4G speeds but this time it will draw from their “All Networks” quota instead. Unfortunately, the inverse is not true. This means that if you were in a location without 4G LTE coverage, you can only use the “All Networks” quota, which is half of what you are actually paying for.Now we understand that to create a “competitive” plan, compromises have to be made, but surely this doesn’t make any sense. Why would Hotlink want to segregate quota by network type? This just seems like a major inconvenience to the consumer.Perhaps this is a testament to how confident Maxis is in their 4G LTE coverage, but even that seems like a stretch to try and justify their actions. In any case the plans themselves, if you ignore the split quota, is quite reasonable. So, if you have faith in Maxis’ network coverage and would like to sign up for this plan, existing Hotlink users can do so via the Hotlink RED app by going to ‘My Account’ and selecting ‘Change’ next to ‘Rateplan’. Alternatively they can dial *100*6*1# from their mobile devices.Non-Hotlink members can simply proceed to the nearest Hotlink Dealer or Maxis Centre. For more information, head on over to their website."

Making inlays into the higher-end market by imploring classier materials like metal, as seen by Huawei and Xiaomi, Vivo hasn’t been left in the dust, releasing the X6 and X6 Plus in light of the current trend. Specs are king though the new duo might have something to say about that, taking a look under their hoods.Let’s start with the smaller X6, that carries a 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display. Under that screen, sits a 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6752 Octa-core processor, mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory. It is made from anodised aluminium and going through 57 steps before getting laser engraved and well deserved polish.Other stock internals include the 13-megapixel sensor on the rear, while sitting under it, is a square cut out, where you’ll find the fingerprint scanner. The rear lenses on both devices will be equip with Phase Detection auto-focus, HDR and a f/2.2 aperture sensor.As a quick flip to the front will reveal the 8-megapixel shutter on the top of the screen. It’ll also natively support a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot, that allows you to swap up the second SIM for a microSD card. The two devices are quite similar, only altering by screen size, internal storage and battery size.That said, the larger X6 Plus has a 5.7-inch screen of the same resolution, while its internal memory gets bumped up to 64GBs. The smaller of the two will carry a 2,400 mAh battery and the vivo X6 Plus will don a 3,000 mAh battery. Vivo’s X6 has a footprint of 147.9 x 73.8 x 6.6mm, as its larger sibling doesn’t pay heed to its dimensions on vivo’s website.Both devices will fun Funtouch OS on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop and retail for the following prices: 2,600 RMB (RM 1,721) – vivo X6 and 3,200 RMB – vivo X6 Plus (RM 2,118). We’re not entirely convinced that people will pick up the device, considering other household names that sell their mid-range devices for roughly the same price.For now this Apple look-alike will only be exclusively sold in China beginning the 7th of December. Then again, all smartphones pretty much have some form of resemblances with one another – or maybe that’s just our opinion.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

Its recently introduced Piston V3 in-ear headphones is pretty decent for a mere RM69 and if you’re looking for on-ear headphones, the more premium Mi Headphone is currently going for RM369.Now a newer Mi In-Ear headphones Pro version is coming and you can stand a chance to own one in Malaysia this coming weekend.  The new In-Ear Headphones Pro claims to be a hybrid unit with a dynamic driver accompanied by a two-way balanced-armature (BA) driver. This apparently is one of the smallest three-way headphones in the market that offers true reference quality audio. For a better audio experience, they have gotten help of Sound Engineer and Grammy/Latin Grammy Awards winner Luca Bignardi to tune the latest headphones. In terms of build, it gets a diamond cut metal body with fine textures like its former Piston series. Designed for smart phone use, there’s also a built-in microphone with 3 dedicated buttons for volume and audio playback controls. For better durability, the Mi In-ear Headphones Pro uses kevlar for its cables for better durability in the long run. In terms of specs, the new Pro headphones has a speaker impedance of 32Ω, similar to the V3 Pistons, but it is more sensitive at 101dB (V3 Pistons: 98dB). It weighs 14grams, which is the same as the current V3 but slightly heavier than the former V2.1 Pistons (12g). In China, the pair is going for 99 CNY (about RM66) but do expect a slight markup to buffer for potential currency fluctuation. This coming Sunday (6th December), Xiaomi is organising an experiential event with 1 More’s Director of Product Marketing as their key speaker.

To check up if you’ve actually received the data, you can refer to your UMB, SMS and U Mobile app.It’s no question that the orange telco learnt a thing or two from Digi’s offer that required customers to “activate” their free data, after their network outage – so kudos U Mobile for making it easier for your customers.Please head over to U Mobile’s FAQ here for further clarification.[ SOURCE ]"

So how does Thunderbolt 3 come into play?Well, utilisation of USB Type-C protocols and Thunderbolt 3 technology will in theory allow data transfers up to 40Gbps (giga bits per second), doubling what we’ve seen on Thunderbolt 2 ports, and quadrupling speeds on USB 3.1. That roughly translates to an uncompressed RAW 4K video (1 hour long) sizing in at 158.2GB transferring around 30 seconds – working out to 5GBps.Talking about driving pixels on screen, it’ll also be capable of displaying two 4K-resolution screens up to a 60Hz refresh rate at the same time and quicken charging for notebooks up to 100 watts.Setting a platform for other types of protocols like DisplayPort, Super Speed USB and PCIExpress, Intel will bank on Thunderbolt to gain traction, as it hasn’t really caught on for most users; except those tech-centric folks out there needing more from their ports.Already realised on smartphones like the OnePlus Two (but don’t use their cables, read about that here), Xiaomi’s Mi 4c, Lumia 950 series, latest Nexuses, PCs and tablets, we hope that USB Type-C catches on quickly.

Now invitations have gone out setting the date for the Google x Huawei collaborative device and by the looks of it, some gift boxes might include them just in time for Christmas.Early adopters might already have the device in their hands, since DirectD began importing the units last week. They’ve been milking eager fans by a pretty margin but all is fair when it comes to grey importers, we suppose. The aforementioned page that went up on vmall.my listed the device will be on sale for RM 2,698 (w/ GST) for the 64GB model; which is equally stacked against another Huawei device, the Mate S (64GB). Easily pointing to the manufacturer not wanting to bite themselves in the butt by selling the Nexus at a lower price, to keep some emphasis on their other smartphones.Playing down the state of our currency, it’s likely the heighten pricing is to leave some leeway for the Ringgit to continue to fluctuate. Taking into consideration that the 32GB Nexus 6P sells for US$ 499 (RM 2,128) and the 64GB model goes for US$ 549 (RM 2,341) in the US.The collaborative effort will bring about the latest version of Android, with Marshmallow finally coming into the horizon. Sizing in at 5.7-inches, you’ll get a QHD display (2560 x 1440), with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 under the hood. Internal memory options were listed above, while it’ll carry 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM for multitasking and app switching.In terms of photography, there will be a 12.3-megapixel sensor on the rear that’s equip with 1.55 micron pixels and an aperture of f/2.0 for those low light situations. Accompanying the camera module will be a dual-tone LED and laser auto focus as well. Taking a look at the front, an 8-megapixel f2.4 shutter will greet you near the top; this sensor will carry a 1.4-micron pixel size.For audio, it’ll boast dual front facing stereo speakers on the top and bottom, while Huawei also deploys USB Type-C for data and charging utilisation. The port itself, will help charge up the 3,450mAh battery that’s inside, while quick charge 2.0 the future-proof port will help bring it up to speed, just a little quicker – only on particular chargers though; nope those Quick Charge 2.0 charging heads won’t be of any use.The last bell and whistle would be the Nexus Imprint finger print sensor, that sits below the rear camera lens. A feature that pretty much lined up with Google’s vision to make native fingerprint scanning a thing on Android M.The announcement couldn’t come any sooner, since they’ve been consumers who are itching to get their own units after DirectD started offering the smartphone. Local warranty and a cheaper price seems like a no-brainer but we hope you waited."

From skin makers like dbrand and Slickwraps, to pimped out editions with diamonds and just overall expensive devices from brands like Vertu; seems a powerful smartphone isn’t enough anymore for the rich. Those with a large net-worth need a little more from their smartphones and Priv owners can now join the upper class – as if adding gold to your smartphone elevates your status.While production quality of the video posted by Karalux seems to be subpar, they showcase the Priv with other devices that they’ve pimped out before. Basically the 24K gold replaces any metal accents that you’d find on the BlackBerry’s first Android device – which isn’t a lot to begin with, mainly on the back of the slide out, the rear camera and the top and bottom of the smartphone.As talked about earlier, existing Priv owners in Vietnam, will get to deck their units out for a cool US$ 350 (RM 1,491), though if you’re in the country and want the gold-plated Priv, it’ll cost you US$ 1,100 (RM 4,687). International buyers, it’ll cost you US$ 1,300 (RM 5,540), if you want the same thing shipped to you.Malaysians haven’t been too lucky, for no official information has come up on when the BlackBerry Priv will hit our shores. A spotting on SIRIM however, point towards an eventual release but still that’s pretty bare bones, as often these certifications don’t necessarily equate to being sold in our markets.Karalux’s services extend to other devices too, as they have listings for iPhones, Samsung and Nokia. Vietnam isn’t that far away for us Malaysians, so do tell us if you make the trip up North.  Here’s their page if you’re already planning your excursion.[ SOURCE, VIA ]"

When it comes to actual usage, speed is probably more important in our current connected age. So who is the fastest? A popular internet speed testing tool has just named Malaysia’s fastest mobile network and the winner might surprise you.
U Mobile, Malaysia’s youngest mobile telco was just awarded the Fastest Mobile Network in the country by Ookla’s Speedtest. An impressive feat considering U Mobile is the last among the 4 telcos to roll out 4G LTE. Despite not having extensive 4G coverage, U Mobile is capable of delivering high-speeds up to 42Mbps with its 3G HSPA+ network. We’ve mentioned several times that the current 4G coverage race is getting rather silly. Any telco can throw numbers but ultimately what does it mean to the average consumer? For example, when Digi reclaimed the widest 4G LTE title, they mentioned that customers can expect 5Mbps speeds on 4G and more than 15Mbps on 4G LTE-A. Those numbers are low for 4G standards and they are already achievable with current 3G technologies. After all, it is not what you have, but what you do with it. At the moment, Ookla has yet to publish the full Malaysian report on their Speedtest Award page but we assume that they used the same methodology here as other countries. The results are derived from the average performance recorded on the fastest technology possible which is 4G. Each test are aggregated by averaging each user’s test result at several locations each day. This prevents manipulation of repeated speedtests by a handful of users from affecting the overall result. You can read up how Ookla determine who’s the fastest over here. So U Mobile subscribers, do you agree with this verdict?[ SOURCE ]"

The front-facing camera has also been upgraded to an 8-megapixel 84-degree wide angle lens to help with those we-fies. Powering these hardware components will be a 2,420 mAh battery rated at 12 hours of talktime and 630 hours of standby time.Acer Liquid Z630At the top of the Liquid Z food chain sits the Liquid Z630 which comes with a huge 4,000 mAh replaceable battery. That massive battery will be powering a 5.5″ HD IPS display (1280×720 pixels) which brings it to a pixel density of 267 ppi. Under the hood, the top-of-the-range device will feature the same processor, RAM and internal storage as the Liquid Z530.

The top-of-the-range Liquid Z630 will be priced at RM659. These three phones are available right now at all authorised Acer dealers.Acer Liquid X2As a little surprise, Acer also announced the Liquid X2, which will sport a 5.5″ HD IPS screen, powered by a 64bit octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.

Acer announces that the device will come in two colours, black and gold, and is set to be available January 2016.
