Alexander Wong,Meet Pebble’s latest smartwatches with 24/7 heart rate monitoring,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/25/meet-pebbles-latest-smartwatches-with-247-heart-rate-monitoring/,"Kickstarter,Pebble,Pebble 2,Pebble Core,Pebble Core Hacker,Pebble smartwatch,Pebble Time 2,SmartWatch",Smart Watch,2016-05-25,"In the face of modern smart watches, Pebble is making a comeback with its new wearables for 2016. Sticking to its core of making simple, functional and long lasting smartwatches, they have just introduced its new Pebble 2 and Time 2. These are the successors of the original Pebble smartwatch and their current Pebble Time.   In addition, they have also announced the Pebble Core, which is a tiny keychain device that does a lot more than just activity tracking.   The current Pebble smartwatches are already capable of activity and sleep tracking. To take fitness up to the next level, the new Pebble 2 and Time 2 now comes with heart rate monitoring along with its new updated health tools.  This includes a new Adaptive Goals feature that creates actionable goals to keep you motivated. Pebble Health also syncs with your calendar and will automatically reschedule your fitness activities if there are sudden changes to your schedule. Also new is a revamped mobile graph that displays your activity, sleep and heart rate throughout the day.  The Pebble 2 is their base smartwatch model that’s priced from US$99 (about RM406.50). Like the original, it gets a black and white e-paper display with an awesome battery life up to 7 days. It’s also water resistant up to 30 metres and there’s also a built-in mic for voice replies.  In terms of design, it still features a plastic body with a rubber strap. If you’ve used a Pebble before, the usability appears to be unchanged with a left mounted back button along with the typical up/down and select buttons on the right. Colour wise, the Pebble 2 comes in Flame, Aqua, Black, White and Lime. If you pledge the Pebble 2 now, it is expected to ship sometime in September this year.  If you’re looking for something better, the Pebble Time 2 gets a colour E-paper display and it’s 53% larger than its predecessor giving you twice the amount of text viewable on-screen. The Pebble Time 2 is more premium with marine grade stainless steel and it comes with a longer 10-day battery life on a single charge. In terms of features, the Time 2 also gets the same fitness and sleep tracking, 24/7 heart rate monitoring, 30M water resistance and a built-in microphone. Available in Gold, Black and Silver, the Pebble Time 2 can be yours from US$169 (about RM693.92) and it will start shipping in November 2016. The Core is probably the most interesting device announced by Pebble today. In a nutshell, this is a tiny smart device that tracks your activity, plays streaming music and it even gets GPS and 3G connectivity.  So if you’re going for a jog, not only it tracks your pace but you can also stream Spotify music from the internet without carrying a smartphone with you. You can also store offline music onto its built-in 4GB of storage. In case of an emergency, the Pebble Core can send out an SMS with your current GPS location at a push of a button.  The Core connects via WiFi and 3G via a microSIM slot. For music playback, you can either plug in a wired headphone or pair it with a bluetooth headset. Despite its small size, the Core can last up to a week and you can charge it via USB or with a wireless charging that’s sold separately.  For the adventurous, the Core is also a hackable tiny computer that you can customise to your heart’s desire. Since it has GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, 3G and a microphone, you can possibly turn it into a pet tracker, a walkie-talkie, a remote switch or even program one of its buttons to request an Uber with a single tap. All these will be made possible with an SDK that Pebble is releasing soon. The Pebble Core is scheduled to be shipped by January 2017 and you can back this device from $69 (about RM283.32). At time of writing, Pebble has already smashed its US$1,000,000 goal target by almost 200%. Want to support these new wearables? You can start pledging over at  . They do ship to Malaysia but you’ll need to pay for international shipping."

There isn’t much else revealed about the actual device yet, but we’re expecting it to come with lots of extra goodies like the Iron Man one, and it will probably cost just as much. No idea when it might become official either, but they’re likely to drop more hints on the phone as it nears launch. But it does at least seem to have a really swanky box with Batman’s logo on it."

If you wanted to pick up a solid drone that can shoot 4K you will have to be prepared to pony up. So, if we want more accessible drones, who could we possibly turn to who has a track record for producing some seriously awesome products at incredibly affordable prices? Yep, Xiaomi, and the great news is that they’re doing drones now. Meet the Xiaomi Mi Drone. It’s the company’s first stab at creating these unmanned aerial cameras and it honestly doesn’t look too bad. Sure, it may not be as good looking as something like the sexy DJI Inspire One, but it’s sleek enough to not be ugly. There are two specifications to the Mi Drone. The first one shoots in 1080p via a 16-megapixel Sony backside illuminated CMOS camera with a 104-degree angle lens. If you want a higher resolution, the Mi Drone also has a variant that’s equipped with a 12-megapixel camera that shoots 4K video and can shoot stills in RAW format. Xiaomi’s Mi Drone also has a host of sophisticated features to make sure it is as easy to fly as possible. These include a number of smart flight controls, autopilot, automatic take-off, landing and return home functions. The Mi Drone also has built-in GPS and GLONASS support to allow for accurate positioning and safer flights. In the absence of a satellite connection, the drone can use vision positioning instead. This allows the drone to hover by itself at low altitudes (below 2.5m). To make sure you fly safe and area in control of your drone, the Mi Drone has four layers of security: Xiaomi is quoting the drone’s flight time (with its 5,200 mAh battery) to be 27 minutes on a single charge. That’s pretty good even when compared to the more expensive DJI Phantom 4 which has a quoted flight time of 28 minutes. The 1080p variant of the Xiaomi Mi Drone will be crowd funded on the Mi Home app beginning tomorrow (26th May 2016) for RMB2,499 (around RM1,561). For RMB2,999 (around RM1,873), you can pick up the 4K Mi Drone instead, but that won’t be going on sale yet. Instead, Xiaomi will be putting the drone up for an open beta test programme come late July."

Hot on the heels of another  , is the rather portable Hello Kitty Grace 10 Light, which looks like a Surface but is much, much cuter. The Grace 10 Light is home to a pastel pink outer shell and is accompanied by a similarly pink Hello Kitty Pigo keyboard that acts as both a cover and as a stand. The device itself is a 10.1 inch, 2-in-one convertible tablet with the keyboard being detachable; weighing in at 600g. As for specs, you’ll have an Intel Atom Z8300 processor mated to 2GB RAM and 32GB internal memory under the hood, with an additional 15GB OneDrive cloud storage that’s free for a year. The screen is a 10.1-inch touch panel with a 1280 x 800 resolution. Last but not least is a 6,600 mAh battery powering it all, rating at about 5 hours of continuous use.

Rory Lee,U Mobile’s WiFi Calling is official and it’s pretty awesome,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/26/u-mobile-wifi-calling-malaysia/,"U Mobile,WiFi Calling,WiFi Calling Malaysia","Apple,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-05-26,"is officially the first telco in Malaysia to roll out WiFi Calling — the service that lets you make phone calls even when you have no signal bars. WiFi Calling or VoWiFi basically a service that lets you make phone calls and receive SMS over a WiFi connection instead of your mobile line. This means that even in highly congested areas or high-rise buildings where mobile connectivity is poor, you can still enjoy seamless phone call connections as long as WiFi is available. U Mobile will be charging their standard domestic rates to all calls made to a Malaysian number while calls to a non-Malaysian number will be subjected to the telco’s standard IDD rates. That means, even if you’re travelling overseas, all calls you make to a Malaysian number will be charged standard domestic rates. So, if you’re on a U Mobile P70 plan, all your calls to Malaysian numbers — regardless of where you are — will be free, provided you’re on WiFi. If you want to know more about WiFi Calling, you can check out our detailed post about it  . For now, U Mobile’s WiFi Calling service is only available for the iPhone 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus smartphones on iOS 9.3 and above. However, the orange telco has said that they’re planning to roll out this service for Android users in Q3 of 2016. The good news is that this service will be available for both prepaid and postpaid lines. WiFi Calling is off by default so you will have to switch it on yourselves in the settings menu. Don’t know how to do that? Check out our step-by-step   on how to switch it on. U Mobile’s WiFi Calling service will also be on High Definition Voice. As long as both parties’ smartphones have support for HD Voice, you will be able to enjoy crisp call audio too. We honestly think that this is a fantastic move by U Mobile. One of their biggest weaknesses in the past was limited network coverage (compared to the other telcos) especially in locations outside of city centres. With WiFi Calling, they’ve not only shored up that weakness but they’ve also gained an advantage over the other telcos especially in high-rise buildings, offices, commercial areas and in underground locations as long as they have WiFi connectivity."
Sponsored,5 reasons why the Wiko Robby is an attractive buy under RM500,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/26/5-reasons-why-the-wiko-robby-is-an-attractive-buy-under-rm500/,"best smartphone under RM500,budget smartphone,Sponsored,Wiko,Wiko Robby","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sponsored,Wiko",2016-05-26,"is still pretty new in Malaysia but they are definitely not new when it comes to smartphones. For those looking for affordable smartphone alternative, they have just introduced the Wiko Robby, which aims to shake up the budget phablet segment. If you’ve got less than RM500 to spend, read on for the top 5 reasons why you should get the Wiko Robby. The Robby is home to a pretty decent 5.5-inch IPS screen that’s larger than most smartphones in its class. The bright and colourful display pushes a HD 720p resolution that’s great for watching your favourite videos on demand. There aren’t many phones that can attest to having two front facing speakers, and even fewer that can actually perform when it comes to playing your music aloud. The Robby comes with a pair of front facing stereo speakers and you won’t even need to crank it up to maximum to hear it loud and clear. This makes it perfect for video playback with your friends watching all at once. Truth be told, we were quite surprised to find that the Robby sports a rather pleasant looking (and feeling) metal back, something rather uncommon for budget devices. The back is also removable, allowing you to replace the 2,500mAh battery if needed. Equipped with two speakers and two microphones, you can use the Robby in any orientation. No worries if you answer a voice call the “wrong side” up. With its dual-mic setup, your voice conversations are made clearer with its noise cancellation. If you’re getting a smartphone, you probably want to be running on the current version of Android. The Wiko Robby runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box and it comes with a couple of tools and features to keep your phone optimised at all times. The elaborate further on the specs, the Wiko Robby is powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core processor mated to 1GB RAM. For storage, it has 16GB onboard which you can expand it further with a microSD card. You’ll get a 5MP front selfie shooter with flash while the rear gets an 8MP camera that does HDR and shoots videos in 1080p. If you’re looking for a phone that’s big on screen and sound, the Wiko Robby at RM449 is quite an attractive buy. You’ll probably be hard pressed to find a device that offers front stereo speakers and a 5.5” screen at this price point."

It looked absolutely magnificent with its gloriously thin profile and slick shiny keyboard. Unfortunately, the smartphone has made it so that there is no place in this world for a Motorola Razr anymore… Or is there? Motorola recently dropped a bomb of a teaser video which features a trifecta of nostalgic music (Boys Like Girls in their heyday), high school and of course the iconic Motorola Razr. Check it out! Ending on a simple TTYL just sells it for me. The question now is, what does this mean? Sure, Motorola has had some success with their Moto X smartphones but they never really had the impact a Razr did. The trailer seems to suggest that the Lenovo-owned brand is trying to revive their legendary Motorola Razr in some form. Perhaps it could be a smartphone in a flip phone’s body (sort of like the Samsung Galaxy Golden) or a new line of smartphones under the Razr branding. One big hint is the way the video’s end title appeared on the screen. Will we see a return of the T9 Numpad to Motorola’s next smartphone? At this point, all of this is just speculation. The good news is that we have a date, 9th June 2016. That’s about two weeks from now, so I guess we’ll find out then. I don’t know about you, but I’m super hyped for this."
Rory Lee,Flash Plus 2 — Have we found the Redmi Note 3 killer?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/24/flash-plus-2-have-we-found-the-redmi-note-3-killer/,"Alcatel,Alcatel Flash,Android,Android Marshmallow,budget smartphone,Flash Plus 2,Flash Plus 2 Malaysia,OneTouch,smartphone,Smartphone below RM1000","Alcatel,Alcatel OneTouch,Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-05-24,"is a fantastic device. It is one of the best smartphones under RM1,000 that you can buy in Malaysia right now. A deadly combination of a premium metal construction and killer specs makes this a formidable device at its low price point. Challengers for the Redmi Note 3 were hard to come by because of the sheer value this device offered. However, we were rather impressed when Flash   their new   budget smartphone that seemed to bank on that same formula. It has finally been officially launched in Malaysia, so the only question left is: Can it stand up to the Redmi Note 3? Well, we had a brief hands-on with the device to try and find out. One of the Flash Plus 2’s biggest selling point is the fact that it comes with a metal body. On the surface, it looks really good and has a rather premium finish. The back plate is shiny and has a hairline brushed look and feel to it that is very reminiscent to the more expensive honor 5X. It feels pretty good in the hand as the subtle chamfers and curves at the back allow the phone to sit in your palm effortlessly. However, once you pry open the removable metal back, you will be greeted by more plastic than you would probably like. In order to make the back removable, Flash had to wrap the edges of their metal back plate in plastic. We suspect that’s because metal isn’t as flexible or snappy as plastic so having a metal frame that pries open wouldn’t be very practical. Honestly, I think Flash should have just stuck with a metal unibody design as the removable back doesn’t really serve a major purpose aside from letting you swap between the two available covers. You can’t replace the battery and trays can be made for the microSD and dual-SIM cards. Instead, their decision has left nothing but a chink in the armour of their solid build. But, that’s not all. I have one last issue with the Flash Plus 2’s exterior and that’s with the power button placement. It perplexes me that Flash decided to place their power button near the top of the 5.5-inch smartphone instead of towards the middle of the device. My fingers aren’t particularly long so reaching that button was definitely a stretch. Let’s talk about performance now. When it comes to specs, the device sports a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS panel on the front with a MediaTek Helio P10 processor mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage running on the inside. The good news is that you can expand that storage with the dedicated microSD card slot. From what I could tell, performance was smooth, but not particularly snappy. I think that could be down to the Flash Plus 2’s relatively stock Android Marshmallow experience. The lack of bloatware was a welcomed sight and I’ve always been a sucker for vanilla’s clean good looks. In terms of the camera, the Flash Plus 2 comes with a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear shooter with Mixed Autofocus and a RealTone LED flash. On the front, it’s got a 5-megapixel selfie with a dedicated front-facing LED flash to help out in low light. Camera performance in the poorly lit venue was far from impressive as images turned out grainy without much detail even in the well-lit portions of the photo. Not its strongest feature then. What the Flash Plus 2 does well, though, is its battery. Inside, keeping the lights on is a 3,000 mAh battery with support for fast charging. The best part is that Flash includes a 9V/1.67A fast-charging brick out of the box too, so you won’t have to purchase an additional one from them. The Flash Plus 2 also features a front-mounted fingerprint sensor that sits beneath its rather stiff home button. This sensor comes with 360-degree fingerprint detection and can supposedly unlock the device in just 0.5 seconds. We were unable to test this feature, however. Flash has also included an NXP9890 audio amplifier and AKM4375 Decoding chips for clean and loud audio. For all of that, the Flash Plus 2 will retail at RM599 and can be   in one of two colours — Luna Silver or Venus Gold. There is also a higher spec version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage that retails at RM729, but that device will not be available until mid-June. The short answer? No. Not for me at least. There are certain aspects of the Flash Plus 2 that I really like over the Redmi Note 3, like a proper fast-charger, the lower price tag and most importantly the stock Android Marshmallow experience. But, all things considered, I would rather pony up the extra to get what I think is the better phone overall. Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 3 simply has a much snappier smartphone experience thanks to a more powerful Snapdragon 650 processor and although I gave the Redmi Note 3   for their mediocre camera performance, it’s noticeably better than the Flash Plus 2’s. The Redmi Note 3 is also built better thanks to its unibody design. It’s more robust and feels nicer in the hand. I really feel that Flash shot themselves in the foot when going with a removable cover because they compromised what could have been a phone with a great build quality."

Doze, on the other hand, is a battery saving mode that puts your smartphone in a low-power state when it’s idle to dramatically reduce battery consumption.

Cheryl Bates,Google wants to nix password logins for Android Apps,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/24/google-wants-to-nix-password-logins-for-android-apps/,"Android,android security,google,Google I/O,google security",Others,2016-05-24,"That’s right,  wants to get rid of traditional password protection completely on Android. How you ask? with something called Trust API. Simply having a strong password isn’t even enough these days, when all an unwanted visitor needs is the key (in this case, the numbers and symbols that make up your password) to get access to all your information. Trust API hopes to eliminate that by only allowing your phone to function at its fullest only if it recognises you as the owner. How Trust API works is that it uses a variety of metrics to calculate a “Trust Score” from information collected from the phone. After all, a phone is full of different sensors, and Trust API intends to use them. The collected information will include things like proximity to familiar WiFi hotspots, Bluetooth devices, facial recognition, location, typing speed and even vocal patterns. Low risk apps like games and basic tools wouldn’t need a high trust score, but banking apps would need a pretty high trust score allow you access. So in practice, if your phone “recognises you” only then will you be able to use it in its entirety. Which means you probably won’t be able to lend your device to a friend Google hopes that Trust API will be rolled out by the end of 2016, and passwords might become a thing of the past. But the question is, how effective do you think this would be if compared to say, fingerprint recognition? let us know in the comments."

The retail cost of all those goodies? RM21,999, but, you can now get it for only a cool RM19,999.

Well, you can pick up the 55-inch curved UHD TV, which normally retails for RM6,799, for RM4,999 instead. Regardless of which TV you decide to go for, odds are, you would probably want to get a decent soundbar to go along with it. There’s no point in spending almost RM20,000 on a crisp SUHD TV only to be disappointed by the audio right?

Huawei’s P9 has been the talk of the town for quite some time because of its Leica certified camera optics. The smartphone comes with a 5.2-inch Full HD display that’s tucked under 2.5D glass. Inside, it’s packing a homegrown Kirin 955 octa-core processor mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage. But, the star of the show lies in the dual 12-megapixel f/2.2 cameras, co-engineered with Leica, mounted on the back of the smartphone. What makes this dual-camera setup special is the fact that one has an RGB sensor while the other is monochrome. This gives the P9 a better low-light performance thanks to the monochrome sensor’s high sensitivity to light. But that’s not all. Besides improving low-light performance and providing better contrast in regular images, the dedicated monochrome sensor also allows for fantastic black and white images that are rich in detail and have stunning contrast. Of course, a partnership with one of the most recognisable names in photography doesn’t just stop there. The Huawei P9’s dual-cameras also get a pair of Leica Summarit H 1:2.2/27 lenses (f/2.2 with a 27mm focal length). On the front, the P9 also sports an 8MP selfie shooter that’s very similar to the Nexus 6P. To find out more about Huawei’s P9 and its cameras, check out our   with some of the best smartphone cameras in the world right now. Keeping the lights on in the Huawei P9 is a 3,000 mAh battery that charges up via a USB Type-C port. Huawei isn’t just bringing in the P9, though, they’re also bringing in the lower-spec Huawei P9 Lite which packs a Kirin 650 processor mated to 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. It also loses the fancy Leica dual-camera setup, opting for a 13MP/8MP primary and selfie camera combo instead. it also loses the USB Type-C port, opting instead for a microUSB one. However, it does still get the 3,000 mAh battery and 5.2-inch Full HD display only, this time, it’s encased in a plastic body, opposed to the metal one that the P9 has. Both smartphones will still come running Android Marshmallow with Huawei’s EMUI 4.1 running on top. For now, there is no information on when the P9 Plus will be making it to Malaysia. The Huawei P9 will go on sale for RM2,099 while the P9 Lite will retail for RM1,099. Both the smartphones will be available on the 28th of May 2016, but Huawei is letting you pre-order the P9 on   on the 23rd of May. If you’re planning to pre-order, be sure to hurry as the first 10 customers who order and fulfill the payment from the 23-27 of May will receive a free honor Band Z1 worth RM269.

Alexander Wong,Here’s how to activate WiFi calling on your iPhone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/23/heres-how-to-activate-wifi-calling-on-your-iphone/,"iPhone,U Mobile,U Mobile WiFi Calling,voice over wifi,VoWiFi,Wi-Fi Calling,WiFi Calling,WiFi Calling iPhone,WiFi Calling Malaysia","iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-05-23,"U Mobile is going to be the first telco to introduce   in Malaysia. Ahead of its launch happening this week, U Mobile users can start enjoying WiFi Calling on their iPhones and here’s how you can activate it today.  According to Apple, WiFi Calling is   on the iPhone 5C and above. This should cover your iPhone 5s, iPhone 6/6 Plus, iPhone 6s/6s Plus and iPhone SE.  For now, U Mobile is the only telco   WiFi calling and other telcos are expected to introduce the feature later this year. To enable WiFi Calling, you would need to download a small update and enable it under your phone’s settings.  If you haven’t received an update notification, just head over to Settings > General > Software Update. You should see a “Carrier Settings Update” pop-up as shown above. Once you’ve done that, you should be getting a new “Wi-Fi Calling” option under Settings > Phone. Tap on the “Wi-Fi- Calling on this iPhone” switch and select “Enable”. If your telco label is showing “WiFi” (e.g. “U Mobile WiFi”), that means Wi-Fi Calling is currently enabled. You would need a working and fixed WiFi in order for this to work. Once enabled, you can use WiFi Calling as if you’re making a normal call. This is great for dead zones in your home or office where signal strength is weak. When connected to our office WiFi, we immediately get “U Mobile WiFi” on our iPhone SE. When we tried to make a call, the connection seems quick and we find the call quality to be pretty good. Next, we tried to test if WiFi calling is able to handle a wonky WiFi connection. We connected our phone to a WiFi hotspot and then turn it off while we’re in a conversation half way. Immediately, the phone call was disconnected while the other party is still on the call in total silence.  After that, we tried making a WiFi call while walking further away from our WiFi hotspot. When we got too far, both parties couldn’t hear each other but surprising when we got closer in range, we managed to resume our voice conversation without disconnecting. From what we’ve experienced, this works best when you’re stationary with a stable WiFi connection. The voice call doesn’t switch seamlessly from WiFi to cellular, so you may get cut off if you’re moving out of range."

As the renders are based on technical drawings, all the functional elements like buttons and camera placement are where they should be. For starters, the cutouts for the antennas at the back look a little different, and the camera still isn’t going to be flush with the device. Sorry guys, there’s still gonna be a bump for now. Another thing that’s interesting to note that there are two grilles at the bottom of the iPhone 7, much like on the  . The return of the grilles might signify stereo speakers, but that’s anyone’s guess at this point. On top of that, it seems that the 3.5mm audio jack has gone missing.

Alexander Wong,U Mobile will let you make phone calls even when you have no signal bars,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/21/u-mobile-is-launching-wifi-calling-in-malaysia/,,,2016-05-21,"Do you always rush to a specific spot in your home just to make phone calls? If you’re a U Mobile customer, those days could soon be over as they are introducing WiFi Calling next week. As the name suggests, WiFi Calling or VoWiFi (Voice over WiFi) lets you make and receive phone calls as well as SMS through a WiFi connection. This allows you to stay connected in places where there’s poor mobile connectivity. It could be in a basement, in a dense high-rise building or even at underground subway stations where WiFi is available. You can watch Vodafone’s video above for a better idea.  To use WiFi Calling, you would need a compatible device and a WiFi connection. Most high-end smartphones from the Samsung Galaxy S5 or   and above are already supported. Once available, you would need to enable WiFi calling under your phone settings and for iOS users, you might need to download a carrier software update to have that option.  There’s no difference in terms of usage and your call charges should remain the same. What should be noticeable is that you won’t need to hunt for signal strength whenever you make a phone call at home. Apart from U Mobile, Digi too   to roll out VoWiFi this year. U Mobile’s WiFi Calling launch event is happening next Thursday, 26 May so stay tuned for more details."

This is part of what most companies think is the gaming brand and that all gamers want to stand out from the sea of sleek business laptops. The thing is, that’s not always the case. There are many gamers who want all the power of a gaming laptop but without the seizure-inducing flashing lights. Well, if you’re one of those people, meet the   Pavilion Gaming Notebook. Sometimes, you just want to unwind. You want to spend an unhealthy number of hours killing zombies or other players on a video game. Well, the HP Pavilion Gaming Notebook is here for all your virtual slaying needs. On the outside, the powerful laptop features a matte black coating that just oozes stealthiness. Apart from the HP logo on the top lid, the rest of the laptop sports a clean look that just adds to its mysterious and menacing look. The Pavilion Gaming notebook is the best of both worlds. With the lid shut, the 15.6-inch laptop looks sleek, elegant and discreet but once you pop the lid open, you’ll be greeted by an aggressive colour scheme that reminds you that this laptop means business.

They’re pretty cool and nifty, given the right circumstances, but for most of us, it’s more of a want than a need. Lenovo recently launched their Pocket Projector here in Malaysia and it’s exactly as the name suggests — a pocket-sized projector. So, if you want/need a pico projector, is this the one you get? Well, I spent a weekend with it high in the mountains to find out. When I first saw this little projector, I was quite taken with it. It looked adorable, sort of like an old-school video game controller from the future. Picking it up, I noticed the fairly good build quality with its robust hinge plus interesting colour combination. The device is split into two parts: The projection half which is black and textured to the touch and the base half which is smooth and houses a D-pad as well as buttons to switch it on and off at the back. Still, it remains fairly light and portable. That said, when Lenovo called this a Pocket Projector, I really wonder what kind of pocket they were thinking of because this thing did not fit into my jeans pockets. Army standard issue cargo pants perhaps? Nevertheless, this is a handsome looking device. Leave it on a table and people will definitely ask you about it even before you turn it on. Once you do turn it on, you’ll be greeted with a screen that shows you a whole bunch of connectivity options which you can navigate to via the D-pad. You can also adjust where you want to project by raising or lowering the projection half and the screen will orient itself automatically. Setting up is easy as the Pocket Projector supports WiFi connectivity and is compatible with Android, Windows 10 and iOS/Mac operating systems. When I brought it with me, I streamed video via Miracast which worked pretty well. There were occasional stutters and I would sometimes get a laggy playback, but for the most part it worked fine. I mean that in the most literal of senses. A couple of minutes into the stream, the projector can build up a lot of heat in its little body. It does have a dedicated fan to try and keep it cool, but if you’re one episode into your Game of Thrones marathon, I wouldn’t advise that you touch the metallic side panels."

How it works is the shoes are Bluetooth enabled and will connect to your smartphone. When you crank open a navigation app, small motors embedded in each shoe will vibrate to steer you the right way; your left shoe will buzz when you need to turn left and vice versa. It will also warn you when you’re heading off course or when you’ve arrived at your end point. We’re not sure how accurate they are though, like if you were facing the wrong direction or trying to navigate indoors; especially when location tracking indoors tends to be kinda wonky. But it definitely seems like EasyJet is onto something as this would allow travellers to easily traverse without too much danger of getting lost. EasyJet is still working on making the battery life go beyond three hours and researching into the development of an insole that can be placed in your existing shoes.

It is a fully voice controlled hub that lets you enjoy music and entertainment throughout your entire house, manage everyday tasks and ask Google what you want to know. Essentially, it’s Google’s own take on home voice assistants like Amazon’s Echo. Much like the Echo, Google Home also takes the form of a little cylindrical device that kind of looks like an air humidifier. Google says that the Home is essentially a WiFi speaker that builds on the experiences that the search engine giant has gained with their Chromecast Audio and voice recognition software. It will also allow users to communicate with it from anywhere in the home simply by using your voice. This means, in addition to asking Google Home to play music, you can also cast your music to Home via the Google Cast app. Google Cast support also allows you to hook up and control multiple speakers or televisions in your home without a complicated setup. So, for example, if you wanted to play music to your living room speakers, just tell Google Home that and it will do it for you. Google Home also brings Google’s assistant into your home, allowing you to manage daily tasks like setting the thermostat, setting an alarm, and even control switches. In the future, Google also wants to work with developers to allow Google Home to do much more like ordering a car or having dinner delivered to your doorstep. Additionally, it also has Google Search built-in. This means that you can ask Google anything from anywhere in your home much like you would with your Android smartphone. The only difference is that Google Home will not only search, it is also supposed to understand context and give more depth in conversations allowing you to ask follow-up questions in a more natural manner. Google says that Home will also learn from you, with your permission, allowing it to improve the way it helps you over time. Google says that this Home assistant is set to launch by the end of this year though they didn’t mention when exactly it would arrive. It looks mighty impressive in their video demo, but that’s just a demo and demos usually look impressive. We’re definitely interested to see how well this would perform in real-world scenarios."

If your company has a need for speed, Maxis has revamped its Business Fibre offering with speeds up to 100Mbps. For greater reliability, it’s also backed by a zero downtime proposition.   To ensure 24/7 uptime, Maxis is including a wireless backup connection which you can use when your fixed connectivity is unavailable. The Business Fibre plans are available in either dynamic or fixed IP, but the zero downtime feature is only available on the dynamic IP package. Similar to its home fibre broadband plans, speeds on Maxis are symmetrical, so you get the same upload speeds as your downloads.  Depending on your business requirements, Business Fibre on dynamic IP starts from 8Mbps at RM196.20/month and it goes all the way up to RM788/month for its highest 100Mbps plan.  For those requiring fixed IP, the plan starts at RM188/month for 4Mbps and it tops off at RM971.60/month for 100Mbps. If you need more IP addresses, it will cost you RM500 per year for five. For greater value, Maxis is offering a slight discount on your broadband fees if you sign up together with MaxisONE Business or FlexiShare postpaid plans that comes with unlimited free calls within Malaysia. All plans are tied with a 24-month contract and there’s a one-time installation cost of RM200 which will be charged to your first bill.  : Maxis has reached out to us to clarify that users no longer need to call 1512 to activate the wireless broadband. This means the backup wireless connectivity will kick in automatically for a true zero downtime experience. They have also rounded up the monthly subscription to the next ringgit.  The new Maxis Business Fibre 100Mbps plan is cheaper than their previous highest offering at 32Mbps. The 32Mbps fibre broadband option used to cost RM498/month for dynamic IP and RM988/month for fixed IP. The backup wireless broadband service is a nice add-on to ensure business continuity  .

For the past year, Universal App Campaigns have doubled ad-based app installs with over 2 billion downloads to date. Initially released for Android, Google is now expanding Universal App Campaigns for iOS devices.  Apart from expanding reach onto the iOS platform, Google wants to help developers create a sustainable app business. According to a recent study, only 17% of app users drive 85% of app revenue. For developers, driving downloads is just one of their success metrics and ultimately they would want to acquire users that offer a higher lifetime value (LTV).

While that can be useful, it also means that your smartwatches are often nothing more than watches when you leave your smartphone behind.  wants to change that with   2.0, giving smartwatches more independence to be smart. Android Wear was never the best watch operating system in the market as it had many limitations and relies heavily on your smartphone to do the heavy lifting. With Android Wear 2.0, Google is putting that power back in the watch, giving it more customisability and freedom than ever before. Perhaps the biggest update isthat Android Wear 2.0 now supports standalone apps. In other words, the apps on your smartwatch can have direct access to the cloud and will not need a smartphone to function properly. This eliminates one of Android Wear’s biggest weaknesses and should allow for a much better smartwatch experience. Google also focused on three key aspects during the development of Android Wear 2.0. The first is Android Wear’s watch face, followed by messaging and finally fitness. The   as we know and love has always been one that gave you the freedom to customise your device the way you see fit. With Android Wear, that meant you could choose from thousands of watch faces and make your Android Wear watch look exactly the way you wanted. One big limitation was the fact that information that could be displayed on each watch face was decided by the creator of that watch face, not the end user. With Android Wear 2.0, Google is letting any watch face show any data from any app so you can mix and match as you see fit. Next, Google tries their hand at tackling smartwatch messaging, or the biggest problem with smartwatch messaging — typing on that tiny screen. The end result? Well, Google is giving you three different input modes, powered by Google’s machine learning, so you can pick the one that best suits you. The first of these inputs is the Smart Reply. This input method understands the context of your message and prepares several appropriate responses. Handwriting, on the other hand, lets you scribble on your smartwatch’s display (like you would with a stylus) with your finger to write out specific replies. Finally, there’s a more conventional keyboard with swipe support that gets better the more you use it. Last, but certainly not least, we arrive at fitness. Fitness tracking is growing increasingly important when it comes to smart wearables, evident by the popularity of devices from manufacturers like FitBit. Android Wear 2.0, has far greater support for fitness which includes a new automatic activity recognition feature. Automatic activity recognition on Android Wear 2.0 works very similarly to what we’ve seen from FitBit where the watch automatically detects if you’re in a workout and starts tracking it without any input from the user. The Google Fit app also supports data exchange with other fitness apps via its API, allowing data to sync across applications. So, information like calories consumed in one nutrition app can sync with calories burnt in another fitness app. But the thing that will probably get the most people excited is that now, thanks to Android Wear 2.0’s support for standalone apps, you can stream music from your watch with an app like Spotify without needing to bring your smartphone with you. These improvements in Android Wear 2.0 will undoubtedly benefit smartwatches with cellular support (like the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE) as it can turn your smartwatch into a capable secondary device by itself. This could be the sign manufacturers need to put more effort into developing smartwatches with cellular connectivity to take full advantage of what Android Wear 2.0 has to offer."

The OS will also be home to  native split-screen capabilities that will allow you to run two apps side by side, as well as picture-in-picture modes so you can watch videos without having to jump between apps. We can’t wait to try this out on a tablet. The updates also include more human looking Emoji Unicode 9 support. Of course, there’s also performance updates so your device will run better, but it won’t be visible on the surface level as Google’s focus for Android N is towards seamlessness as opposed to raw power. Last but not least, you will also be able to reply messages directly from notifications and Google has finally made a “Clear All” button available to clear everything at a go, to further streamline the process. In an unexpected move, Google is leaving the name for Android N in the hands of the internet, letting netizens   for the upcoming OS.

In fact, Google has come up with an entirely new support platform and it’s called Daydream. Daydream is basically Google’s platform for high quality, mobile virtual reality, and the best part is that it comes with Google-designed headset and controller. Yup, apparently everyone has been doing VR headsets and controllers wrong so Google is stepping in. The search engine giant has released what they’re calling a reference design for both the headset and the controller which they will use to work closely with their partners across the Android ecosystem. The best part? The first of these headsets and controllers will be arriving this fall and they will work seamlessly with what Google calls “Daydream-ready smartphones”. Google’s VR controller looks impressive if you can look past its TV remote looks. It seems to work like a sophisticated Wii controller allowing users to point, gesture, flick and move stuff within virtual reality. That aside, what is a Daydream-ready smartphone? With Android N, Google is baking in more support for VR than ever before, including a dedicated VR Mode that lets notifications appear more naturally within a VR UI as well as a greatly reduced latency (under 20 milliseconds). So, smartphones that are Daydream-ready are smartphones that have sensors that are powerful enough for accurate head-tracking, displays have fast response times to minimise blur and powerful mobile processors. Think of Steam and their VR-ready PCs and you’ll get a general idea. According to Google, several smartphone manufacturers including Samsung, Huawei, ZTE, ASUS, Alcatel, Xiaomi and HTC will have Daydream-ready smartphones and many of which will be available this fall. But VR is only as good as their apps, so Google is working with sites like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, HBO and IMAX to bring their libraries and news to Daydream so you can experience their content like never before. Google are also working with game developers like Ubisoft, EA, CCP and more to create games that can take advantage of all the new juicy VR features Google has placed into Android N. Google has also optimised many of their apps for VR including a special Google Play app store. They’ve also rebuilt the YouTube app to allow users to experience VR on the video streaming site like never before, including spatial audio and improved VR video streaming. Google Photos and Google Play Movies have also been tweaked to give users unique VR experiences."

BOXiT, is here to help fix that. In a nutshell, BOXiT is a parcel locker service that allows you to pick up your parcel at your own leisure, and not have to worry about the postman arriving when there’s no one at home. How BOXiT works, is you buy an item online (from selected online merchants) and the parcel will be delivered to one of the BOXiT storage spaces in one of the participating 7-Eleven outlets in the Klang Valley. When your parcel arrives and is stored in the locker, you will receive an SMS with your locker pin code. All you need to do after that is head on over to the locker and pick up your goodies. And since 7-Eleven is open 24/7, you can pick up the items whenever you’re free to do so (within a certain preset timeframe of course). Merchants can also rent the storage to store goods beforehand so that customers can immediately collect it from the lockers on purchase. The same system can be used for refunds and returns as well. Currently, BOXiT has 20 lockers and locations set to begin service, with plans to increase it up to 100 by the end of Q4. At the moment, the lockers are only available to online merchants like Lazada and can be rented out by said e-Commerce sites as collection points for their customers. There’s also plans for a consumer based platform called BOXiT2Me, where users can subscribe to it as a service where people can use it as an alternative PO box for the collection of parcels. Doesn’t look like you can store large items in it though, as the majority of drawers look reasonably small. BOXiT will launch in the first week of June, with full deployment of the lockers to occur over the next 3-4 months."

As far as the bag is concerned, it’s a 31-litre smart suitcase that is fully made from aluminium-magnesium alloy. This sophisticated metal construction gives it “super strength and durability” so it looks like the bag can take a beating. Weighing in at 4.4kg (dimensions 550x375x215mm), the 90 Points Smart Suitcase is pretty similar to   from Rimowa. However, as it’s being priced at only CNY1,999 (around RM1,240) it’s significantly cheaper than the GBP560 (around RM3,300) Rimowa. It’s also smarter as this bag has support for Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity. This means that you can connect your suitcase to your Android 4.4+ or iOS 7.0+ device and remotely lock or unlock it with an app. The lock is also TSA approved so you can rest easy if you’re travelling to the United States. What’s more, the Smart Suitcase has a 4 stage adjustable handle made of ultra-quiet aircraft-grade aluminum alloy rods.

On the back, we see the OnePlus logo plastered on what looks like a full metal back case. What’s interesting is that this design looks eerily similar to that of an HTC One M9 from the antenna lines to the square camera module. Our guess of a fully metallic OnePlus 3 seems to be confirmed by this next set of live images from @KJuma. Here the smartphone looks to have a gently curved back which is likely for ergonomics as well as a Samsung-esque camera bump. One notable feature that is missing from the back of the smartphone is a laser autofocus module. Around the bottom, we see a single speaker grille and asymmetrical design similar to that of a Samsung Galaxy S7, iPhone 6s and HTC One A9. That’s honestly a nice departure from their dummy grille design from the bottom of the OnePlus 2. In the dummy grille’s place sits a headphone jack and what looks like microphone ports along with a USB Type-C port. It is worth pointing out that in this image, the fingerprint sensor looks a lot more like a button (similar to the OPPO R9/F1 Plus) rather than a recessed dimple. Around the side, we find what has become OnePlus’ signature alert slider. As a whole, it looks like a really handsome device. Knowing OnePlus, this smartphone will likely pack the best specs you can get this year, with even   that there will be a version with 6GB of RAM to go along with the lower specced 4GB variant. At the heart of the device, reports have indicated that it will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and will go on sale for a slightly lower price than the OnePlus 2. Unfortunately, if Evan Blass’ words are to be believed, it seems that the OnePlus 3 will only be packing a 3,000 mAh battery. Then again, it will come with an AMOLED display (like the OnePlus X) which should mean that the device is more frugal with its power consumption."

The biggest problem I have when travelling, though, is staying connected. While our local telcos are having an all out war in an attempt to come up with the best roaming plans, they’re still teetering on the pricey side.

Here’s an amazing Shake Shack burger to make up for my horrible selfie: Oops, I may have gone off a little bit of a tangent here, let’s back to the Travel Recommends router and the question that’s burning itself into the back of your mind (probably): Well, yes and no. One big yes is that Travel Recommends gives you a complete package of the wireless router, a charging cable, an international adapter and a bunch of quick-start guides that are all packed neatly into a bag the size of my face. Just bring that little bag along and you’re good to go. It’s also incredibly easy to set up, as the included quick-start guide in my pack only needed three simple steps before I was connected and ready to go online. However, here’s when I hit my first snag: The connection isn’t particularly fantastic. The speeds and network stability definitely left a lot to be desired. I stayed at The Westin in Times Square which is located pretty much at the heart of the large city, and here’s a screenshot of the speed test I was able to run on my first day there: Not particularly impressive if I may say so myself. Definitely not as impressive as these guys cosplaying characters from the Ghostbusters: Nice! Anyway, there could, of course, be many reasons the connectivity was so poor. The first being that my location in the heart of the city isn’t particularly ideal for network connectivity, what with all the tall concrete buildings towering over me. However, the most likely cause for this poor result would be the network I was connected to — AT&T. A quick Google search of AT&T in New York reveals many articles that don’t exactly inspire confidence when it comes to network strength. My friend, on the other hand, who bought a local T-Mobile SIM had no problems with her data connection whatsoever, even achieving rather quick speeds. Even my colleague from TheSkop who had a review unit when he went on his trip to Australia reported fast download speeds of around 25Mbps and good network coverage overall. Things didn’t improve during the second half of my trip, when I moved towards the suburbs near Queens and Brooklyn, either. I had more consistency (and speed) connected to the various free WiFi hotspots in town. There are other inconveniences with having an extra device with you too. The first being that you need to bring it around with you all the time so that adds weight to your pack. You also have to constantly keep it charged throughout the day as the battery life on that portable wireless router is good for a day at most. Despite the hiccups and poor network connectivity, I was not left with a bitter taste in my mouth. All things considered, I think Travel Recommends’ biggest problem was their choice in network partner (in New York at least) which resulted in a rather mediocre experience for me. However, I am very hopeful for the growth of this type of service. This is a service that offers a simple way to have unlimited data connection for an affordable price. Apple once said that the “most powerful technology should deliver incredible capability without the complexity”. I may not agree with much of what Cupertino does, but this is a statement I completely agree with. There is a lot of ambiguity surrounding roaming that I’m sure many are hesitant to jump on board, especially with all the horror stories of bill shock stemming from roaming on the wrong network floating around. Buying a local SIM may be the best choice for those who are willing to put in the time and effort to research the best deal, but not everyone is willing to do that. Simplicity, then, is Travel Recommends’ biggest strength. If only they’d improve their choice of network partner so I wouldn’t have to wait until I was back in Malaysia before uploading photos from my trip. Before I sign off, I will leave you with a picture of a squirrel climbing up a fence:"

It also has a rather phablety 6-inch 1080p display, with some of the hugest cameras on a mobile device. The Xperia XA Ultra has a 16MP front camera with OIS, with the rear shooter being a 21.5MP camera with hybrid autofocus.

But now, it seems   wants to take it a step further by introducing a smartphone with a foldable display. Yes, the future is now. Well, sort of. Large screens are awesome for videos, games and even more mundane stuff like browsing and picture taking. The problem with large displays is that they’re very hard to carry around and operate especially for people with smaller hands. Ideally, we’d want a smartphone that can be both small and portable but have an enormous display. Making smartphones thinner and lighter helps somewhat, but what if we could shrink the display size altogether? Well, if these recent rumours are to be believed, it seems Samsung is working on exactly that with their purported Galaxy X handset set to go on display in 2017. The Galaxy X will be part of Samsung’s rumoured five flagships next year which will likely be the Galaxy S8, S8 edge, Galaxy Note 7 and Note 7 edge. According to more rumours, the foldable Galaxy X will feature a 4K (3840×2160) panel that folds out like one of those three part velcro wallets — shrinking something that is about the size of a tablet to the size of a smartphone. This would clearly be a big challenge for the South Korean electronics giant as they’re taking their flexible OLED panels to the next level. They will also need to come up with a much stronger material that can withstand the constant folding and unfolding than the plastic backplane they’re using on their flexible panels. The display is also said to use a   subpixel like they’re currently using with several Galaxy smartphones. Either way, it will be interesting to see how (and if) they accomplish this feat and would probably mark a new chapter in the smartphone story. Until we see some concrete evidence, do keep in mind that these are merely rumours so take them with the appropriate amount of salt."

Rory Lee,ZTE Blade V7 series hands-on: Is this truly premium for the masses?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/13/zte-blade-v7-series-hands-on-is-this-truly-premium-for-the-masses/,,,2016-05-13,"recently launched two new devices to add to their Blade series lineup. The new   and   is the company’s attempt at letting everyone own a metal smartphone. This means that they’re bringing the full-metal experience to an even lower price point than before. Have they succeeded? The ZTE Blade V7 Lite is powered by a 1.3GHz MediaTek MT6735P quad-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. The 5-inch device also packs an HD 720p display on the front with a 2.5D curved edge glass panel on top. The interesting thing to note here is that the smartphone comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which until this day still isn’t all that common. Granted, it’s a heavily skinned version of Android, but it still has all of 6.0’s goodies. The key feature here, though, is the metal build and ZTE’s round design language. It was supposed to help ergonomics and to an extent it does, as the rounded edges feel pretty good in the hand. However, the metal itself doesn’t feel particularly premium, but I suppose that’s to be expected considering the price point. In terms of optics, the Blade V7 Lite comes with a 13-megapixel rear camera, but it was kind of hard to judge how good it was considering the poor lighting conditions in the venue. It also packs an 8MP front-facing selfie camera with a dedicated LED flash and smile shutter for easy selfie snaps. Keeping the lights on is a 2,500 mAh battery. As a whole, the device is pretty decent, though admittedly the performance leaves a lot to be desired. Then again, it’s feature packed but a lot of the execution isn’t as smooth as it could have been.   ZTE has since updated us that there is an option within the fingerprint settings to enable fingerprint-unlock when the screen is off. ZTE have also packed a bunch of gimmicky features to “help” you launch apps/tasks faster and easier, but when the product guy was demoing them to me, they seemed more like some inconvenience instead. It definitely takes a lot less effort to just launch the app normally. That said, at RM669, the Blade V7 Lite isn’t too bad value for money. If you factor in the RM499 promotional price that ZTE are selling the V7 Lite for right now, you’d really be hard-pressed to find something that has a more premium build for less. Still, I don’t know if build is the biggest concern when it comes to phones at this price range. ZTE are also having an event this Sunday (15 May 2016 at 12.30pm) at their ZTE Concept Kiosk in Low Yat Plaza where you will get the chance to pick up the Blade V7 Lite at 50% off (RM335.

The P series is Huawei’s flagship line that focuses on a premium build as well as camera photography. On the latest  , it gets a pair of cameras at the back that are co-engineered with the German optics company.  To have Leica branding on a smartphone is a respectable stamp of approval but how does it fare in actual usage? To find out, we’ve pitted the P9 against other top end contenders such as the  ,   and the current champion, the  .  To recap on the specs, the Huawei P9 gets a pair of 12MP sensors that are assisted with dual-tone LED flash and Laser Auto Focus. Unlike the P8, the new P9 lacks optical image stabilisation (OIS) which puts it at a disadvantage against the other 3 contenders. While the aperture is smaller at f/2.2, it gets a pixel size of 1.25 microns for better low light performance.  In most dual-camera set-ups, the second camera usually plays a minor role for depth of field, however on the P9, the second unit shoots 12MP images in monochrome. This according to Huawei helps to capture greater detail when combined with its RGB colour sensor. For the front, it gets an 8MP f/2.4 selfie camera which is quite similar to the Nexus 6P. If you have’t seen it yet, you can check out our hands-on of the device  . The iPhone 6s Plus gets a 12MP f/2.2 iSight camera that’s assisted with dual-tone LED flash. There’s also optical image stabilisation and a respectable 1.22-micron pixel size. For the front, there’s a 5MP FaceTime HD and it lets you illuminate your selfies using the screen’s Retina Flash.  For the Lumia 950, its 20MP PureView camera is a formidable rival for the P9. It gets a large f/1.9 aperture size and it is assisted by not two, but 3 LED flash. While it has the highest resolution camera for this comparison, the pixel size is the smallest at 1.12 micron. For selfies, it features a 5MP shooter with a f/2.4 aperture.   The Galaxy S7 edge is still our favourite camera smartphone. Starting the 12MP dual-pixel camera is just a double tap away and it is super quick to focus. For brighter photos, it gets a f/1.7 lens for both front and back. The main 12MP camera gets optical image stabilisation and it boasts a larger 1.4-micron pixel size. For the front, it gets a 5MP sensor and it also gets a screen flash for better-lit selfies in low light."

As such, Sony is cancelling the  and  series (the same fate that befell the   series) in favour of exclusively focusing on the Xperia X as a single brand. This might also mean that the  we’ve been seeing might instead be the Xperia X Ultra at launch. Sony Mobile presentations show that the Xperia X series is just the start of Sony’s “Chapter 3”, with the theme of “Xperia for new communication” which will run till 2018; marking the beginning of the Xperia X as a new visual identity for the brand. The new X logo branding will also be used on promotional material, as well as merchandise. Chapter 1 happened between 2010-2012 which was about “Open OS for web communication” with the Xperia X10 as its highlight, and Chapter 2 ran over 2013-2015 and focused on the “best of Sony” highlighting the Xperia Z series. Sony is still committed to producing a flagship device, just that future phones will be under the Xperia X range irrespective of the specs.

Rory Lee,Winnergear MicFlip reversible MicroUSB cable review: The cable you never knew you needed,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/16/winnergear-micflip-reversible-microusb-cable-review-the-cable-you-never-knew-you-needed/,"accessories,Fully reversible microUSB cable,MicFlip,MicroUSB cable,product review,reversible MicroUSB cable,smartphone,USB Cable,USB cable review,Winnergear,Winnergear MicFlip,Winnergear MicFlip review","Cool stuff,Mobile Accessories,Others,Product review",2016-05-16,"I love instant noodles. When I was much younger, instant noodles were a breakfast treat and the mornings where I got to have a packet were the only mornings I would wake up early. The thing is, in the past, I only ever had Cintan’s Perisa Asli noodles and I never thought of trying the other flavours because Perisa Asli was already so good. That was until I tried one of the super spicy kari berapi type noodles. One slurp and I was hooked, I could never go back to good ol’ Perisa Asli. In a way, this is the same case for me and USB cables. I’ve always only used the USB cables that came out of the box because I figured they’d work the best with their device. I never thought I’d need anything else. Well, that was until I got my hands on the gold-coated Winnergear MicFlip Fully Reversible MicroUSB cable. A mouthful, but this is essentially the kari berapi of USB cables and it’s awesome. If you want a spec sheet for this cable, a lot of it is in the name. So let’s break it down and allow me to answer all of your pressing questions. Well, when USB Type-C devices first came out, one of their biggest selling points was that you didn’t have to fumble around when you want to plug your cable into your smartphone. This was because Type-C cables were reversible, something Type-A and MicroUSB cables weren’t. The MicFlip solves this with a complicated hexagonal shape that looks sort of like two MicroUSB ports glued back to back. At first, it took some effort to get it plugged into our Galaxy S7 edge, but after the first time, it was a whole lot easier to stick it in. I didn’t think it’d make much of a difference at first, but once I went back to a regular MicroUSB cable, I kept forgetting and getting it wrong. It’s not something you immediately notice, but it definitely makes a difference. On Winnergear’s site, they say that the gold helps keep the USB plugs corrosion resistant. That makes sense because gold is the least reactive of all metals, existing in a state that’s benign to the environment. In case you didn’t already know, corrosion is a natural process that reduces a refined metal into a more stable form such as oxide, hydroxide or sulfide. It is basically the gradual destruction of the metal (or sometimes other materials) via a chemical reaction to its surrounding environment. Science lesson over, since gold is so stable and non-reactive, it doesn’t undergo this process (do correct me if I’m wrong) and as a result, will not corrode naturally even on a geological time scale. Theoretically, this means that your cables won’t corrode as easily or as quickly as the regular cables that come with your smartphone. Does it work? Well, so far our gold-coated USB tips are still as shiny and golden as they were when they first arrived about a month ago. Good stuff. I feel you. One of my biggest problems with rubber cables is the rubber breaking. I’ve killed many a USB cable by tripping over them, rolling my chair over them, using the cable to fish for my phone, using them in tug-of-war competitions… Okay maybe I’m just a cable abuser, but the point is that I’ve killed plenty of out-of-the-box cables. With the MicFlip though, this isn’t that easy. The cable is braided (so not your usual rubber cable) and wound really tight. This makes the cable rather firm and that might take some getting used to if you’re coming from a flimsy rubberised one. But, that tight winding pays off in terms of build. This cable feels so solid you could probably jump rope with it. Actually, you can totally jump rope with it, we’ve tested it. That said, it will take some getting used to as it’s not as easy to bunch up or wind as regular cables. But, the good thing about that is that your cable won’t get tangled so easily. I keep all my charging cables and power bricks in a tiny bag (I know, I know, that’s a disaster in the making) and often times the MicFlip is the only cable that doesn’t get tangled into a knot. Well, I definitely didn’t notice any difference between the MicFlip and a regular cable. Our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge got its adaptive fast charging just as it would with a regular cable. Data transfer speeds were the same between the MicFlip and a regular cable too. It took about 5 seconds to copy a 100MB file from my PC into a smartphone and 6 seconds to copy it out. Now here’s where it gets tricky. The way I see it, the MicFlip has two things going against it: The price and the fact that it’s still MicroUSB. MicroUSB isn’t a bad thing by any means if you’re looking at smartphones being launched this year. It probably won’t be a big deal next year either. But this cable is marketed to last a really long time — that means several years down the line — and that’s where MicroUSB will probably end up hindering its value. Smartphones and other devices are slowly but surely moving on to USB Type-C ports so why on earth would you blow a considerable amount of money on a cable that will probably be obsolete two years down the line? When I say a considerable amount of money, I suppose that’s relative to the individual. It costs USD19.90 (around RM80) which if you compare it to the cable that comes with your smartphone, that’s USD19.90 extra. This then brings us to the conclusion.

Rory Lee,Acer’s answer to the Surface Pro 4 lands in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/16/acers-answer-to-the-surface-pro-4-lands-in-malaysia/,,,2016-05-16,"Revealed earlier at their   in New York,   has finally brought the new Switch Alpha 12 and Aspire S 13 laptops to Malaysia. The good news? They’re pretty good value. Leading the pack is the   — an impressive liquid-cooled 2-in-1 laptop that is powered by a 6th generation Intel Core i Processor. It’s also got a beautiful 12-inch QHD (2160x1440p) touch-sensitive display. I was quite impressed with this particular device when I first saw it in New York. It had a great build, an excellent keyboard and a reasonable price which made it a great challenger to the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. The fact that it had a fanless liquid cooling is also a plus because it makes the tablet completely silent and more resistant to dust build-up over time. Acer has brought three variants of this tablet to Malaysia and the prices are as follows: That’s incredible value considering the price includes a keyboard and an Acer Active Stylus. An entry-level   (Intel Core M3 processor) with a keyboard  . On the other hand, if you choose to pick up an Acer Switch Alpha 12, you can get an Intel Core i7 processor with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for only RM4,499 — that’s only RM230 more for a whole lot more power. However, it’s worth noting that only the bundled keyboard with the i7 model will come with backlight. The others will not. Next up is the ultra-portable, ultra-slim 13-inch   laptop. It’s designed to be a great workstation on the go, weighing in at only 1.3kg, with a thin 14.58mm edge. In terms of performance, you get a 6th Generation Intel Core i5-6200U processor and a choice of either 4GB or 8GB of RAM. The Aspire S 13 also comes with a 13.3-inch full-HD IPS panel that performs incredibly well under sunlight thanks to its matte finish. It’s mostly constructed of plastic but has a nice textured finish to the top of the laptop. Acer’s Aspire 13 comes in two specifications: 4GB of DDR3L RAM, 128GB SSD —  
8GB of DDR3L RAM, 256GB SSD —  For more information on these two devices, check out our   with them.

We travel from place to place using GPS navigation apps like   and  , take photos, check our social media feed, watch videos and play games. It’s pretty insane how much we rely on our smartphones but many of them can barely keep up with us, needing to be constantly recharged. As a result, power banks have become a mainstay in our bags or clutches.  wants to change that with the  , claiming that you can leave your power bank at home. Well, we’re going to put that to the test. For this battery stress test, we’ve identified four different aspects of rather heavy daily usage and devised four tests to really find out what this 4,000 mAh battery in the Huawei Mate 8 can do. First, we will look at charging speeds, then video playback, followed by gaming and finally we’ll use the Mate 8 to charge an iPhone SE. Huawei’s Mate 8 has a massive 4,000 mAh battery which by normal standards would take quite long to charge. The Redmi Note 3’s comparable 4,050 mAh cell takes a whopping two and a half hours to get from 0-100% on the bundled charger. Let’s find out how long the Mate 8 takes. With the bundled 9V/2A fast charger, here are the charging statistics for the Mate 8 from 0% charge: 30 minutes: 35% 
60 minutes: 70% 
90 minutes: 94% 
110 minutes: 100% In just under two hours, the Mate 8 is fully charged. What’s more, with a mere 30 minutes on the plug, the resulting 35% charge should be more than enough to last you a working day as it gave us 9 hours of time on battery with about 1.5 hours of screen on time. On your typical working day, we figured the average person would spend about 1 hour in total consuming video. A couple of minutes during transit, a couple of minutes while waiting in the bank and even a couple of minutes during one’s lunch break. Of course, usage habits vary with the individual but 1 hour seems like a decent baseline to begin testing. With that established, we wanted to find out how much battery the Mate 8 would consume after 1 hour of video playback. So, we fired up a movie on iflix and spent an hour watching it at full brightness and maximum volume. The result? Our Mate 8 only dropped 17% of charge with data on, GPS on, max brightness and video streaming. You could probably do better if you set the brightness to auto. Following the same principle, we figured the average person on the average day also spends about 1 hour in total playing video games on their smartphone. Hence, we set out and launched into an intense gaming session with Asphalt 8 running at full brightness with full volume for one hour straight. The device did get a little warm under the load, but once the dust had settled, the smartphone only consumed 21% of battery charge — keep in mind this is also with GPS, data, and WiFi running in the background. Pretty impressive that after one solid hour of gaming and one solid hour of video streaming, the Mate 8 still has 62% of battery left for your lighter and less battery intensive tasks. Now, for the ultimate test. Huawei boasts that the Mate 8 can become one’s saviour by giving devices that have run low on battery a charge via OTG in the case of an emergency. Well, it so happens our iPhone SE with a 1,624 mAh battery, completely ran out of juice so we thought we’d let the Mate 8 save the day. Hooking up the OTG cable to the Mate 8 and the iPhone, the iPhone immediately started charging. However, it is worth noting that this isn’t the most efficient way to charge a smartphone and if you have the option, hooking it up to a wall socket is much better. Nevertheless, we were able to give the iPhone SE a quarter charge while only depleting 15% of the Mate 8’s battery reserves."

Originally the devices were slated to launch at the end of this month, but CEO Jerry Shen stated that the launch has to be delayed. But considering that they’re pushing the date by just a month, it’s still not too large of a move. The new Zenfones are to come in three flavours, the Asus Zenfone 3, Zenfone 3 Deluxe and Zenfone 3 Max, all of which are to enter the mid-range market. Prices are expected to be a wee bit higher than the Zenfone 2 series of phones though, as the brand is going back to MediaTek and Qualcomm chips due to Intel rethinking their mobile chip strategy. The brand is expecting sales to be rather flat as the new phones fit into their market segment, but they’re heading in toe to toe with brands like Huawei and Oppo when it comes to price-point. We’ll see what Asus has in store for us with the new Zenfones when the launch rolls around next month."

The product of a successful Indiegogo campaign, the AfterShokz Trekz Titanium is a Bluetooth headset that vibrates music straight through your skull by ways of bone conduction technology. Bone conduction technology originally was developed for the military, but has since filtered into commercial products due to its uses. How it works is, instead of producing sound the way most audio devices do, these bypass the eardrums and transmit audio waves straight to your inner ears. This leaves your ears open to the environment so you can keep alert and aware. The Trekz Titanium headset features an OpenFit design with comfort and uncompromised  situational awareness in mind as well as PremiumPitch+ Sound to optimise the delivery of sound to where it needs to be. In terms of battery life, the headset can run for a good 6 hours continuously and it sports a IP55 rating against sweat, dust and moisture, so its perfect to take on your evening jog. You can even make calls with it via Bluetooth as it has a noise cancelling mic mounted on it. Combined with a Titanium frame, you’ve got a tough, albeit slightly unconventional pair of headphones."

Rory Lee,Google adds some awesome new features to the Translate app,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/13/google-adds-some-awesome-new-features-to-the-translate-app/,"Android,apple,google,Google Translate,Google Translate new,iOS,iPhone,new features,smartphone","Android,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-05-13,"does some pretty awesome things with the internet to helps us learn more about the world around us. There’s stuff like Maps, Analytics and of course, who could forget,  . Not only is Google Translate a crucial source for people like me, it can also spawn a whole bunch of absolutely hilarious content for people to get creative with. Now, Google’s making Translate even better on the mobile device than ever before. What Google have done for Translate on Android is add a new feature called Tap to Translate. It’s basically a pop-up extension of the Translate app that appears whenever you copy text that might need translating. Once the popup appears, simply hit it and you can paste your text directly into Translate and get the translation. This eliminates the need to minimise your current app window, launch a new one, copy-paste the text…you get the idea. This new feature basically makes it easier for us to have almost instantaneous access to Translate all the time. Think Facebook Messanger and you sort of get the idea. Being a   (born a Chinese but is unable to speak/read/write the language), Google Translate is one of the most useful apps for me during the festive season. When Chinese New Year rolls around, I usually get bombarded with a whole bunch of season greetings in a language that looks about as legible to me as stray hair on the bathroom floor. It’s not that I don’t appreciate all the well-meaning (probably) messages from my relatives/friends, it’s just that I simply can’t understand them. As a result, my replies usually go along the lines of a thumbs up emoji…or three. Sometimes the big grinning face one. Gooogle Translate helps me with this problem. True, the app’s translations probably aren’t 100% reliable (actually they’re probably only 30% reliable for complex sentences), but it gets enough of the sentence right that you can sort of infer the meaning of the message. So, anything that makes it easier for me to translate long messages on WhatsApp is a welcomed improvement. But that’s not all, Google is also improving Offline Mode on iOS. It now works on Apple’s operating system and it joins Android in using small offline packages so that they don’t take up too much space on your smartphone. The best part is, Offline Mode also works with Tap to Translate. Google have also added support for the Chinese language in Word Lens. With this, Google will have 29 languages that you can instantly translate with the camera in Google Translate."

The brainchild of ex-premier Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Proton was conceptualised to boost Malaysia’s industrial capabilities, in addition to stimulating the local economy. For those of you who don’t know, the Proton name is an acronym derived from Bahasa Malaysia:  , which roughly translates to national automotive enterprise/company. Its infancy was spurred by a joint venture with Japanese industrial giant Mitsubishi, which birthed the venerable Saga. From then, the national carmaker has progressed through, offering many firsts in the local industry. Over the years, Proton has had many opportunities to acquire, research and develop world-class technology seen their cars today. Here is a look at the top ten technological milestones that Proton has given us through the years. Perhaps the most obvious in this list, the Saga, which was rolled out in September, 1985, is Proton’s first car, automatically making it Malaysia’s first car model. The Saga, derived from Mitsubishi’s Lancer Fiore saloon, has all the basic functions of a late 20th century vehicle, which simply means that it does not have any of the luxuries we are accustomed to now: no ABS, no airbags, no automatic air-conditioning, no daytime running lights, and definitely no uppity in-car entertainment."

Inside, the smartphone is powered by a home-grown Kirin 950 processor — a half-step below the Kirin 955 chip found on Huawei’s P9 flagship. In terms of memory, the full-HD variant will come with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage while the higher-spec QHD variant ups the storage to 64GB.

These cameras seem   to those on the Huawei P9 with one notable difference — the missing Leica badging. There is also no mention about whether the dual cameras differ in specifications from each other (the P9, for example, has one monochrome sensor and one RGB sensor) but they do have large 1.76-micron pixels which are rather large. This should translate to better imaging in low-light conditions. The full-metal smartphone also sports a fingerprint sensor on the backplate which covers a large 3,500 mAh battery which charges via a USB Type-C connector. As far as connectivity is concerned, all models will support LTE connectivity, ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS. However, support for NFC will vary depending on the model.

Sponsored,Here’s why Captain America chooses a vivo smartphone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/11/heres-why-captain-america-chooses-a-vivo-smartphone/,"Captain America,comics,Marvel,metal smartphone,movies,smartphone,Sponsored,Vivo,Vivo smartphone,Vivo V3 Max,Vivo V3Max","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sponsored,vivo",2016-05-11,"Have you guys checked out the latest Captain America: Civil War movie yet? No? Well, it’s awesome and you should totally watch it. Those of you tech enthusiasts who have watched it, you would have undoubtedly noticed some of the cool gadgets they featured on set, including Captain Steve Roger’s   smartphone. Oops, uh, spoiler alert? The thing is, out of all the smartphones in the world, why do you think the Captain picked a vivo smartphone? Well, we believe we have some ideas. Let’s take the   as an example. If you’re at all familiar with the Cap, you’d probably have noticed that the he has an affinity for cold hard steel. Look at his trusty shield that the flings around (defying the laws of physics) at bad guys, I doubt he ever leaves home without it. So, it would make sense that he would want that same reassuring feeling for what is probably the Cap’s second most held object — his smartphone. With the V3Max, Steve can feel right at home gripping the handset’s full-metal unibody and be confident that it’ll survive a clash with Tony Stark. And you know what they say, confidence is the key to victory. The battery is usually a smartphone’s biggest kryptonite. What’s the point of having all those amazing features if your device runs out of juice every two hours? Not even the mighty Captain America can fix that, which is where the V3Max can come into play. The vivo V3Max has a large 3,000 mAh cell that will easily last an entire day on a single charge. What’s more, it comes with vivo’s Dual-Charge Circuits fast charging technology which can top the phone up in only 1.5 hours. That’s really important for Steve because he can’t be worrying about his phone dying on him while he’s punching Hydra (or RDJ’s perfect jawline) in the face. And even if it does die on him, the fast charging will get him back up to speed in a jiffy. When you’re an Avenger, being able to multitask is super important. It’s one of the strengths you need to list down in your CV when applying (probably). So, naturally the Captain would need a smartphone that can keep up with him. With the vivo V3Max’s Smart Split, he can have two windows open simultaneously which saves the Cap time and we all know every second matters when you’re trying to save the world. So, with the V3Max Captain America can, for example, use one window to look at security footage of a criminal while he uses the other window to Google the identity and location of the criminal. Y’know, just the usual stuff the Cap does when he’s off camera. High quality audio isn’t just eargasmically good for listening to music, it’s also important when you need to pick up the little nuances in, say, a secret message being transmitted by the forces of evil to their minions. Well, the AK4375 Hi-Fi chip located in the V3Max provides some of the highest quality smartphone audio you can find right now — SNR 105dB and a distortion rate of -97dB. That’s not all, the V3Max can also produce some truly impressive audio from its onboard speakers. That Hi-Fi chip isn’t messing around. It’s almost as amazing as Captain America himself when he’s giving orders and explaining tactics to his fellow teammates — crisp and crystal clear. Much like Steve Rogers himself, the V3Max is no slouch, as it packs a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor mated to 4GB of RAM. So, the Captain can run fast? Well, so can the vivo V3Max and it’s even faster with vivo’s intuitive FunTouch OS UI. It’ll definitely be able to keep up with ol’ Stevie. Captain America is famous for his Vibranium shield. He’s the protector of the weak, defender of the innocent, guardian of the galax–wait, wrong show, but, you get the idea. The question is, while he’s so busy protecting everyone else, who’s going to protect him? Well, the vivo V3Max of course! This sophisticated smartphone comes with fingerprint biometric security that not only keeps the phone and all his data safe, but it also unlocks the smartphone in a single touch — 0.2 seconds in fact. This means that the Cap doesn’t have to fumble around with passwords or pin numbers when he needs to unlock his smartphone. Just one tap will do — super handy for when he wants to grab a quick selfie to update his Instagram feed during a covert operation. Or maybe while he’s hopping from rooftop to rooftop. Or maybe even when he’s pursuing bad guys in a high-speed car chase and needs Waze to help him find the fastest route. To the regular mortals though, please don’t use your smartphone while you drive — that’s dangerous….unless you’re Captain America."

Of course, a flagship device must have a smooth performance and good specifications, but we’ve come to a point where performance alone isn’t really enough to set you apart from the pack of existing devices. A flagship device needs to unique, one of a kind…somewhat special. ’s flagship, the  , is an interesting device. Although its specs in terms of hardware and camera optics may be rather similar to the other flagship devices in the market, the handset does have something rather special up its sleeve. Trying their hand at the immersive world of virtual reality, Lenovo set out to make the Vibe X3 unique and what they came up with was TheaterMax — Lenovo’s stab at giving you the most immersive smartphone viewing experience of any device. In a nutshell, TheaterMax converts everything on your smartphone’s display into content viewable in a VR headset. It duplicates the screen — much like YouTube’s VR video content — so that when both images are combined with a VR headset, like the RM99 ANTVR headset for example, it transforms into what looks like a 60-inch television screen mounted inches from your face. It’s magnificent. When watching videos, you get the sense that you’re incredibly close to the action, something you don’t really get with other smartphones or even tablets. Pair that with the Vibe X3’s excellent front-facing Dolby Atmos stereo speakers and you’re in for one amazing ride. It’s a mish-mash of native software enhancements in the Vibe X3 plus the hardware lenses of a virtual reality headset that allows this device to to do what it does. True, it may not be the ultimate exercise in a virtual reality experience, but there’s no denying the level of immersion this smartphone affords. The unique thing is that basically everything you do daily — watching youtube videos, using the camera app — becomes incredibly immersive. This opens up a bunch of interesting ways to use the smartphone features, one of the ones we did was record a first person video with the camera app in VR mode strapped to our face. That way, the camera could literally record everything we set our eyes one. TheaterMax is merely one of Lenovo’s innovations, if you’re not into that there is already an entire world of VR content ready and waiting for you to give it a shot. Some of our personal favourites include Hardcode, Germbuster and InCell. If you’re willing to pony up a little bit, some other awesome titles like End Space and Bandit Six put you in the pilot’s seat for some dope flying and air-to-air combat."

Back then I downloaded an APK to try the program out early, but now it’s finally rolling out, for real, globally. Driving Mode is, in a way, Google’s method of telling you that they know exactly where you’re going all the time. I jest, of course, the true purpose of this is to help you get to where you’re going as fast as possible with as little effort as possible. In a nutshell, once you “Start driving”, Google will guess where you’re going based on the time of day and your travel history, and suggest the fastest route to that destination. You can then just leave the timer to run down and Google Maps will kick in and navigate you to your desired destination. If you don’t want to, you can just hit the tiny “x” and just drive. Driving Mode will continue to show you which roads are congested with a colour scheme (green for good, orange for heavy, red for congested). To access this, simply fire up the app and pull out the hamburger menu. Then, hit “Start driving” and you’re good to go. Maps will ask you if you want to add a Driving Mode shortcut to your home screen for added convenience. I was honestly a little disappointed in Driving Mode because I expected more. I wanted a more passive navigation system, rather than have it set a route then kick into the regular Maps turn-by-turn navigation that often beeps at me for not sticking to their pre-planned route. Instead, I would rather have them find out where I’m going, suggest a fast route and then as I’m driving along whatever route I chose, passively detect if there is congestion ahead. Should there be congestion ahead, I would have liked it if Maps prompted me and informed me of a faster route indicating how much time I would save and ask me if I would want to deviate instead. Of course, this is probably just me getting wrapped up in my own selfish fantasies of what technology should do. Driving Mode, I’m sure, will please a whole bunch of people who are tired after a long day at work and want their navigation app to guide them home. Though I can’t help but feel that it, in its current iteration, is a little more like a gimmick than a useful standalone feature. What do you guys think of Driving Mode?

Or smart wearables, whichever you prefer. For people like us at SoyaCincau.com, smartwatches may not be the “latest” in terms of tech, but for everyone else who doesn’t blow all their money on gadgets, this is a relatively new concept. And oh boy what a concept. I mean, you have to charge your watch every  ? When I think of smartwatches, one of the OG smartwatches to really revolutionised the smartwatch industry — especially in terms of looks — has to be the  . When I first laid eyes on it, I was stunned. I didn’t mind the flat tyre or the fact that it runs Android Wear (which, btw, is mighty confusing to use), it just looked right. It reminded the world that the smartwatch doesn’t need to look radically different from the regular watch. I yearned for one of these, so imagine my excitement when I finally got my hands on a brand new Moto 360. Not just any Moto 360, mind you, it was the   edition. Unfortunately, the saying “don’t meet your idols for they will disappoint you” rings painfully true. Having never used a piece of wearable tech before the Moto 360, this was the most jarring change I had to adapt to. On average, watches can go on for ages on a single charge. I even have a digital watch from when I was in primary school which — until this day — still beeps me occasionally to remind me that a new hour had begun. With the Moto 360 Sport, you don’t get that luxury. Charging each day is a necessity. It doesn’t matter if the quoted battery life is 1.5 days, you really don’t want your watch running out of juice in the middle of the day do you? The good news is that Motorola gives you a nice little charging cradle that you can dock your watch into. Once it’s docked, it turns into a little desk clock that dims and brightens depending on the brightness of the surrounding light. It sits quite elegantly perched on the side of your bed. What’s more, when you charge it each night, how fast it charges doesn’t really matter (about 2 hours if you’re curious) anymore. Getting used to this will take some time, and at the end of those long tiring days where you forget to charge your watch, you’ll just have to manage the next day without a smartwatch. Alternatively, you could bring your charging cradle along to your office. Well, it’s supposed to be sportier than the classic Moto 360. To achieve that, Motorola has augmented this 360 Sport with built-in GPS functionality. They’ve also given the watch a more rugged and weather resistant look with a case encased in the same rubberised material that the strap is made from. The only problem with that is the strap then becomes a proprietary piece of hardware that doesn’t seem very user-swappable — and that’s a problem since the strap is rather fragile. First thing’s first, I really dislike this Sport band. Not only does every single fleck of dust/particle/fibre/hair stick to it, it also isn’t very durable. By the end of my review session (about 2 weeks) the top layer of the rubberised band started peeling. It also doesn’t look particularly pretty — especially when compared to its classier brothers. In fact, I think the Gear S2 pulls off that sporty look even better. The worst part? This watch isn’t even very sporty because the only sport this thing can track is running. The Moto 360 Sport does track running rather well with Motorola’s Moto Body app and the built-in GPS is incredibly accurate, but can you really call it a “Sport” watch? Perhaps they should have called it the Moto 360 Run instead. If you’re a die-hard sports enthusiast looking for the perfect fitness tracker smartwatch, this isn’t the one for you. A Garmin Forerunner or Fitbit would definitely suit you better. That said, this watch isn’t completely pointless as there are things to like about it."

Their custom ROM not only looks more colourful than its predecessor but it gets a bunch of new features on top of performance fixes and brand new looks. Read on to find out what’s new with MIUI 8. The entirety of the interface has been updated to look more colourful, with an attractive array of colours The interface will even change colour according to the weather forecast. If you happened to forget your powerbank, the new Power Saving mode will keep your battery alive for that little bit longer by freezing background app activity and other background tasks and updates to keep the phone’s primary functions running. Not a new feature for a lot of devices, but having a dedicated function will make a difference for battery life. The OS will also limit chain start-ups automatically, to help keep your battery frosty and reduce lag. The gallery has received quite an update, letting you draw on images and add fun stickers to your creations. They’ve also made the gallery more space efficient, and its also now possible to select multiple images, edit them with filters and then share them with your friends. MIUI 8 also supports video editing capabilities, letting you put in captions, music, crop and even add filters to your videos before posting them online. The new Notes allows you to view items in a grid format, and allows you the use of templates to snazz it up. It also includes some added security, letting you secure your private notes with either a password or with fingerprint. For the avid multi-tasker, MIUI 8 now features multi-window management so you can go about your tasks without having to close any apps you currently need open just to navigate to another. Their selection of lock screens have been updated as well, with over 12 categories of high quality images to choose from for the Wallpaper Carousel to cycle though. If you already liked their previous selection on MIUI 7, you’ll like this one even more."

The Moto X4 also appeared in the flesh December last year, and has been confirmed by tipster Evan Blass that its the real deal. The Motorola Moto X4 is expected to be announced August 24th, according to Hemmerstoffer; based on the date displayed on the screens of the renders.  Apparently, manufacturers sometimes put the date of launch on renders or photographs on unreleased phones and both devices are sporting said date.

The reason this device is highly anticipated is because it sports a similar dual-camera setup to the one on the Huawei P9 and P9 Plus flagship device. It doesn’t seem to have Leica certified Summarit lenses, unfortunately. We don’t get a shot of the dual 12MP sensors in action, but there is a leaked gif demonstrating what this dual-camera setup can do. Some are calling it a 360-degree video, but we don’t think so. As far as specs are concerned, the V8 will likely pack a 2.3GHz Kirin 950 processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Keeping the lights on is a 3,400 mAh battery and will come out-of-the-box with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. There is also set to be a higher-spec variant sporting a 2.5GHz processor (possibly Kirin 955) with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage.

Cheryl Bates,Lenovo’s CES offerings are finally hitting the Malaysian market,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/06/lenovos-ces-offerings-are-finally-hitting-the-malaysian-market/,"CES,Lenovo,lenovo CES,Lenovo Malaysia,lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon,lenovo thinkpad x1 tablet,lenovo yoga 900s",Lenovo,2016-05-06,"launched quite a few devices over   this year, and a bunch of them are now available for purchase locally. This includes the Lenovo Yoga 900s, ThinkPad X1 Tablet and the 3rd gen ThinkPad X1 Carbon. The launch is also accompanied by a refresher on how they will be marketing their products from here on out; based around different themes; namely Enpower, Engage and Experience; with different products in said categories. Those in the Empower theme revolve around enterprise offerings and security, those in the Engage line are for people who are always on the go and the Experience line are where the all-rounder devices reside. Among those launched today were the Yoga 900s ultra-light convertible laptop, the ultra light ThinkPad X1 Carbon and finally the ThinkPad X1 Tablet, which is the only tablet that supports a protector module. Made for those who need a bit of versatility, Lenovo’s Yoga 900s is capable of four usage modes and is capable of transforming on the fly thanks to its watchband hinge. So if you want to just watch stuff on it like on a tablet, just flip it and you’re good to go. The ultra-light ThinkPad X1 Carbon on the other hand, gets its name from its carbon-reinforced chassis and the fact it weighs just 1.18kg, just about as light as it gets. This is the   4th gen of the device so you get the choice of an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 4GB/8GB RAM and an optional touchscreen display. Last but not least, the ThinkPad X1 Tablet is specially made for those looking for a mobile workhorse which they can take anywhere. It even has an optional projector module out back that allows you to make presentations without having to fumble with hooking your laptop up to a big, old school projector. The keyboard is also detachable, so it can be a notebook one moment and transform into a tablet when you need it. All the devices will be available starting now at Lenovo authorized dealers and retailers. Pricing are as follows:"
Rory Lee,Lenovo’s funky concoctions make it to our shores and they’re pretty awesome,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/06/hands-on-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-tablet-yoga-tab-3-pro-yoga-900s/,"2-in-1,Android,convertible,Laptop,Lenovo,Lenovo Malaysia,Lenovo ThinkPad X1,lenovo thinkpad x1 tablet,Lenovo Yoga,lenovo yoga 900s,Lenovo YOGA Tab 3 Pro,Tab 3 Pro,Tablet","Android,Cool stuff,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-05-06,"launched a massive roster of devices today. These products come in from all across the range from entry-level to high-end plus a bunch of funky new items. While time was rather limited, I did get to spend time with some of the more interesting items at the launch. First up is the Lenovo  . This is the same one we saw at CES earlier this year and it honestly feels pretty good. I like new approaches that disrupt the way everyone builds devices, which is probably why I love modular devices so much. The ThinkPad X1 Tablet isn’t exactly modular, however, as it functions a lot like the LG G5 when it comes to how modules work. The G5 is a solid smartphone by itself and will probably work just as well regardless of whether it has a special module in it. Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Tablet is pretty much the same story. This device has three modules — a RealSense camera module, a battery module, and a projector module — that attaches to the bottom of the tablet. At the demo, the tablet only had the battery module — which gives it an extra 5 hours of battery life on top of its 10 hour quoted life. The battery module snapped on pretty easily (and securely) plus it’s hotswapable so you don’t have to power down the tablet before hooking it up. Lenovo calls it a productivity module and I can sort of see that as it does come with a HDMI, OneLink+ and a full sized USB port plus it raises the tablet to a nice height for typing. Speaking of typing, the ThinkPad X1 Tablet has a pretty awesome keyboard, but it has a peculiar Fn key placement that I keep accidentally pressing when I want to hit Ctrl instead. In terms of build, the ThinkPad X1 Tablet feels pretty solid and I rather like the rear kickstand’s rigidity. The only qualm I have with it is the way you need to pop it out from it’s latch. I guess that would eliminate accidental kickstand releases, but I would’ve prefered a nice strong magnet instead. I’ll be frank, the   is gorgeous. It’s Lenovo’s super-light super-portable convertible laptop with their signature watchband hinge. TL;DR? Well, it’s super light, weighing in at only 999g and the hinge works like a marvel. When it comes to the hinge, it’s really fun to flip it into laptop and tablet mode thanks to that watchband design, but because of how light it is, don’t expect to be able to do the one-handed flip open. It’s display is pretty good too, packing up to a 12.5-inch QHD IPS panel that’s touch sensitive. The only thorn in its side is the mushy keyboard. Compared to the one on the ThinkPad X1 Tablet, the YOGA  900s just feels incredibly dissatisfying. Key presses were nowhere near as tactile or as satisfying and that’s a pretty big deal to me since I’m eyeing this as a productivity device. Still, if lightness and portability are your thing, then the YOGA 900s is a pretty solid device in my books. Regarding performance, I can’t really judge because of my limited time with it, but it does come with up to a 6th generation Core i7 processor and a 265GB PCIe SSD. The third and final product that really caught my eye was this 10.1-inch Android tablet with a built-in pico projector. Yup, located inside the hinge-like end of this tablet is a 50 lumens 480p pico projector that lets you project what’s on your screen to the nearest wall. Lenovo says that this can project a screen up to 70-inches but I figure that has to be in a rather dark room because even on the show floor’s tiny demo, I was rather disappointed with the brightness and resolution of the projected display. Nevertheless, this is a really cool piece of technology because you don’t have to worry about lugging around an extra accessory around for presentations or sharing funny cat videos with your friends. That said, the hinge area is rather thick and gets quite hot once the projector gets up and running. Then again, since it’s a projector, this really isn’t surprising as even Lenovo’s Pocket Projector get’s super hot (almost too hot to touch) after awhile. This   is designed to be the ultimate “video tablet” thanks to its 10.1-inch QHD display and its Dolby Atmos enabled 4-JBL speaker sound bar. Unfortunately, I couldn’t see how well this actually performs as a “video tablet”, so I won’t pass judgement on that claim yet. It does look promising, though."

The details have yet to be finalised, but those on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 who don’t want to make the jump will be able to breathe a sigh of relief, assuming they don’t decide to extend the promo. The disabling of the “Get Windows 10” popup won’t be hitting all PCs at once though, as it’ll need some time to roll out, just as it did when the promo started up.

Social media is taking over human lives and Malaysians are at the forefront of this revolution. Facebook recently   here in Malaysia but the fact that they did isn’t that important. What is important is why, and the why is that Malaysians spend more time on Facebook than almost any other country in the world. By percentage alone, Facebook reveals that 80% of all Malaysians who have access to the internet are also on Facebook. That brings the number to 18 million users — that’s more than half of our entire population. What’s more, Malaysians also have 1.6 times more friends than the global average. We also spend a whole lot of time consuming video content on Facebook as their statistics reveal that we spend on average 159 minutes watching videos on the social media site. That’s 55% more than the global average of 102 minutes. We also spend more time watching videos on our smartphones (66 minutes) than we do watching live television (59 minutes) This places our tiny country in the top 10 in the world for video consumption (time spent watching) on Facebook. That is higher than any other country in the Southeast Asian region — a region that has more than 241 million Facebook users! We also find out about most of our stuff from Facebook. According to statistics provided by Facebook, 94% of Malaysians discover products and brands on Facebook and 62% of them makes a purchase after the discovery."
Cheryl Bates,YouTube’s working on a new streaming service called YouTube Unplugged,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/06/youtubes-working-on-a-new-streaming-service-called-youtube-unplugged/,,,2016-05-06,"Looks like   is going to try getting in on the streaming bandwagon with a new service called YouTube Unplugged.

There isn’t much info on the service yet, aside from the fact that Google has apparently discussed with CBS, Viacom, NBCUNiversal and Twenty-First Century Fox to get their content on stream, but nothing concrete has been planned just yet. YouTube is planning on keeping the service below $35; but we have no idea if it will be running on a video-on-demand platform or it would be like Astro. There’s also plans to make bundles available so it should be interesting to see what they have to offer.

Alexander Wong,A closer look at the Huawei P9 trio,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/05/hands-on-with-the-huawei-p9-p9-plus-p9-lite/,,,2016-05-05,"Huawei has started the year on a high note. According to IDC, they currently  , propelled by their focus on making premium smartphones. It all began with the Huawei P8, followed by the Mate S, Nexus 6P and the Mate 8. If you’re looking for a new flagship, they have just   the   series during their South Pacific region event in Bali. The trio includes the standard P9 along with its P9 lite and P9 Plus variants. Read on for our first impressions. If you liked the Huawei P8, you would feel right at home with the P9. It retains the same 5.2” display size with full HD resolution and they have also kept the same placements for its buttons. The build of the P9 is noticeably refined compared to its predecessor. It has rounded corners around the edges, while the screen uses a curved 2.5D glass, making it super slick to swipe your fingers from the sides. The P9 at 6.95mm is slightly thicker than the P8 (6.4mm) but it retains the same weight of 144 grams.  Moving towards the back, it gets a familiar matte metal feel as the Huawei P8. What’s noticeably different is a camera visor at the top, like the Nexus 6P. Aligned towards the left are two 12MP f/2.2 cameras that boast a pixel size of 1.25 micron. The two sensors play a different role, with one taking in RGB colours while the second unit takes images in monochrome, which is combined by its own picture algorithm for greater detail. There’s also laser focus that helps when dealing with closer subjects. Like the P8, the camera module is flush without any protruding camera bumps.  On Leica’s involvement, Huawei explains that Leica has been instrumental in the development of both software and hardware. While the camera components are not made by Leica, the German optics company were deeply involved when developing P9’s picture quality algorithm. For a unique experience, the camera interface uses a custom Leica UI with their official fonts and shutter sound. After all, the Leica stamp is only given if a product meets its stringent standards.  During our hands on, the interface takes a while to get used to as it is different from other Huawei devices we’ve tried before. Taking photos are snappy but it isn’t as fast compared to a Galaxy S7 edge. We will be posting a camera comparison soon to compare the results with other flagship smartphones. For the front, it gets an 8MP f/2.4 shooter for all your selfie needs.  For security, Huawei makes one of the best fingerprint scanners in the market. The P9 takes bio-metric security up a notch with a forth layer that detects 3D ridges on your fingertips. It is still easy to set up with a couple of taps and it unlocks instantly on a single touch.  Browsing through the P9, it feels rather smooth with no lag or performance issues to report. Huawei is still using its in-house developed Kirin processor and the P9 runs on their new Kirin 955 64-bit octa-core unit (4x 2.5GHz A72 x 4x 1.8GHz A53). There will be 2 specs coming to Malaysia – a higher end 4GB RAM + 64GB storage and a standard 3GB RAM + 32GB storage option. As usual, you can expect dual-SIM support with expandable microSD storage on its hybrid SIM tray.  The P9 also has finally joined the reversible USB Type-C bandwagon and it gets a 3,000mAh capacity battery, which is larger than the P8’s 2,680mAh unit. It currently runs on EMUI 4.1 with Android 6.0, and Huawei says that it will stay buttery smooth after pro-longed use thanks to its built-in software optimiser. If you’re interested in getting one, expect to pay more than the RM1,799 launch price for the Huawei P8."

 The Xperia C6 Ultra will have an octa-core MediaTek MT6755 processor clocking 1.9GHz under the hood, alongside what might be 2GB RAM as well as 16GB expandable storage. As for the display, it will be a rather phablety 6″ full-HD screen, with a 16 MP camera parked out front with an LED flash and a 20 MP camera on the rear. It definitely looks like it will be carrying on the tradition of being a selfie centric phone with the rest of its innards being pretty mid-range. Aside from this, there’s no news whether or not the Xperia C6 and the Xperia C6 Ultra are the same smartphone, nor is there any info as to when the phone might be announced. As with all leaks, there’s still quite a bit that’s possibly subject to change so take it with a pinch of salt and hope that Sony says something soon."

Internet Sharing with Digi Postpaid is a nifty new service for Digi postpaid plans that allow users to share their quota with up to six supplementary lines by simply adding RM10 to their existing bill. This service is available for all existing Digi Postpaid plans with the only requirement being that the plan must have unlimited voice calls to all networks. That means, if you, for example, wanted to commit the bare minimum for an Internet Sharing activated plan, you can go for Digi’s lowest Postpaid 28 plan. With this, simply add RM10 for unlimited voice calls and an additional RM10 to activate the sharing feature within the plan which brings the total up to RM48/month excluding the cost of your supplementary lines. From there, you can choose (if you want) to purchase any of the three new internet top up booster packs that can be purchased with an Internet Sharing activated plan. These internet top up boosters offer a choice of either an additional 0.5GB of quota for RM5, 7GB of quota for RM35 or 12GB for RM50. This additional data is valid for 30 days from the date of purchase. In addition to this new service, Digi also introduced two new ways you can share your internet quota. The first is via an RM10/month “gadget SIM” which you can use to share your Digi Postpaid internet quota with your other devices like your tablet. This SIM is not capable of making calls, however. If you want to share between family members, Digi’s new Share with Family supplementary line gives you unlimited calls to all networks for RM38/month. This line does not have data, however, as its data quota comes from the shared quota of the principal line. To avoid unnecessary confusion, all the controls — including data allocation between supplementary lines — have been baked into the MyDigi app. This lets you easily manage the amount of data each supplementary line gets on the fly. The only caveat is that when you activate Internet Sharing on your principal line, you lose the ability to rollover your Internet data to the next month. But, all supplementary lines (should they come with their own data quota) will be able to roll over their own internet quota to the next month.

After all, the end goal is the same destination, and it makes sense to travel in one vehicle where possible, right? This is the same mentality that a local startup has looked into providing for their users. With that in mind, ride-sharing platform Grab has just introduced GrabHitch, an affordable door-to-door service which caters to commuters who are traveling to and from a specific location. It covers the cost by picking up those who are heading to the same location in the first place. It’s easy to see how carpooling will make sense, it’s one of the most efficient ways to travel, its simply people matching two people going into the same direction and that is exactly what GrabHitch will do. By riding together, both drivers and passengers will be able to save cost together, meet new people and laugh together and both drivers and passengers will be able to save on cost of travel. 
 Since the advent of ride sharing apps, commuters in the Klang Valley have slowly started to embrace the idea of leaving their cars at home. However, most are still accustomed to having the flexibility and freedom of driving. Happily Grab has now introduced a very local solution that will enable drivers to cover the cost of owning a car all at their own convenience. Enter GrabHitch, a carpooling service available via the Grab app that allows drivers to pick up passengers going along the same way on their daily commute. “This latest service caters to both drivers and passengers who are cost-conscious. Drivers with extra space in their vehicles have the option of picking up passengers who are going the same way to offset the cost of his/her journey, whilst passengers only need to pay for a fraction of the cost compared to other option of transportation,” said  . In essence, GrabHitch addresses the very uniquely Malaysian problem of single occupancy vehicles (SOVs) on the road. According a study conducted by Nielsen, Malaysia has the 3rd highest car ownership globally whereby 93% of Malaysian households own at least a car whilst 54% have more than one car. To add to that, 6 million trips are made in the Klang Valley alone on a daily basis via private cars, most of which are SOVs, that’s 83% of all travel on a daily basis. “Therefore, there is a significant pool of vehicles with extra seats for more passengers. Every car has the potential to play a part in improving Malaysia’s public transport network and meet the growing demand of rides each day,” said  . In addition to the convenience and price factor, GrabHitch is a welcomed alternative for various other reasons.   GrabHitch is now open for the driver signup. Drivers can download or update their Grab App to the latest version which is available for free on Google Play or App Store. To sign-up, just click on the “GrabHitch” icon, select the “Drive” button and follow the instructions. For commuters, they can start scheduling rides GrabHitch effective May 15, 2016. In fact, to kick off this new service, on May 16, our GrabHitch pioneers, consisting of staff of   and our very first batch of GrabHitch drivers, will be on the road offering free rides to passengers.

Alexander Wong,Huawei P9 series now official for South Pacific. To be available at the end of May,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/05/huawei-p9-series-now-official-for-south-pacific-to-be-available-at-the-end-of-may/,"bali,Huawei P9,Huawei P9 Lite,Huawei P9 Malaysia,Huawei P9 Plus,huawei smartphone,leica","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-05-05,"‘s latest pride and joy, the   is officially launched for the South Pacific region which includes Malaysia. This replaces the Huawei P8 and it retains the same compact 5.2″ display as before. The design of the P9 is more refined with rounded corners and the use of 2.5D glass for the front as well as its rear camera visor. Underneath its unibody metal design is an Octa-Core Kirin 955 processor that’s mated to either 3GB or 4GB RAM along with a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of onboard storage. The display is a 5.2″ IPS unit that pushes full HD 1080p resolution. Photography is the main focus for the Huawei P9 which carries a twin 12MP f/2.2 camera set up that’s co-engineered with Leica. It is further assisted with dual tone LED flash and a hybrid AF system with laser auto focus. Unlike other dual camera smartphones we’ve seen before, one sensor shoots in colour while the other in monochrome to capture more details, contrast and light information. Photos are enhanced further with Leica’s Picture Quality Algorithm. For selfies, the P9 shoots 8MP pics from the front that’s enhanced with a host of beautification features. As you would expect from a flagship smartphone, the P9 gets a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner at the back which unlocks in a single tap. Powering the P9 is a 3,000mAh battery that charges up with USB Type-C. The headphone jack, this time, is also repositioned to the bottom. Out of the box, it runs on Android Marshmallow with Huawei’s EMUI 4.1 on top. For those who prefer a larger screen experience, Huawei has also announced the P9 Plus with a larger 5.5″ Full HD AMOLED display. The specs are similar with a Kirin 955 processor and it comes in a 4GB RAM and 64GB storage option. The same Leica co-engineered cameras are retained and since it is a larger device, it packs a higher 3,400mAh battery. The P9 Plus also has another trick up its sleeve with Hi Fidelity audio playback from its speakers. It operates a lot like the new HTC 10 where the audio is separated into two portions — the treble from the top earpiece and bass from the bottom-firing speaker. 
 Also announced is the P9 Lite which aims to bring a premium smartphone experience at a lower price point. It also carries a 5.2″ Full HD display similar to the P9 but under the hood, it gets a lower Kirin 650 processor mated with 2GB or 3GB RAM along with 16GB of storage. For imaging, it packs a 13MP f/2.0 main camera along with a 8MP f/2.0 front shooter. Despite being a Lite model, it also gets a 3,000mAh battery that charges via micro USB. 
 For now, there is no pricing information on any of these devices yet, but those details will be revealed at our local Malaysian launch which should be happening soon as these devices are set to roll out in our region starting the end of May."

The app, originally spotted by the folks over at  , exists specifically for getting your rides setup in advance. Aside from letting you do advance bookings, it also lets you select the kind of Uber you want, location for pickup and the time you want it to come. The app will also check if you’re willing to pay extra if surge pricing is in effect when your request comes in. There is a caveat of course, as there’s no guarantee that an Uber driver will accept your request when you make it just because it was pre-scheduled. The rides are still subject to rider availability at the time. The app seems to only be   as of the moment, so it’s a no-go for Android users for now. Perhaps this will encourage Uber to eventually implement the feature for themselves?"

If you’ve ever been lost or utterly befuddled by travel or credit card insurance plans, then GoBear is here to help you. GoBear calls their service an insurance Meta Search engine. What this means is that it’s like Google or TripAdvisor but for insurance/finance policies and plans. One of the things GoBear prides themselves on is their unbiased comparisons. The company accomplishes this by not taking any incentive or payments from insurance companies. In other words, they do not do paid content (banner ads, etc) on their website so that frees them from any bias stemming from financial sources. Besides that, GoBear also claims to make the process of comparing insurance plans simple and easy to understand by stripping the plans down to their “bear” essentials. Take travel insurance plans, for example. GoBear has identified five major categories — Personal Accident, Medical Expenses, Loss of Baggage, Trip Cancellation and Emergency Medical Evacuation — that they think consumers will value most. To search for a plan, simply enter your destination, type of trip, the number of people travelling, duration of travel and hit “search plans”. The results can then be filtered appropriately according to your needs. Users can also pick up to 4 plans to do a detailed comparison between them. Once they’ve decided on a plan, simply hit “Go to provider” and GoBear will transfer the user to the provider’s site. It’s a pretty slick interface and the fact that there are no ads or pop-up banners makes the overall experience that much smoother. For now, GoBear Malaysia can only compare travel insurance and credit card finance plans, but the company plans to add personal loan, car insurance and life insurance by the end of the year. Currently, GoBear has records for over 40 travel insurance plans, 196 credit cards and 37 Islamic cards."

Step counters are usually limited numbers on a screen. Sometimes, they have a pair of shoes next to the numbers, other times they’ve got feet. Now, you can have the wonderful world of Super Mario as a visual gauge of how far you’ve walked today. Previously, website Mental Floss   Mario had to run and swim in Super Mario Bros before he could rescue the princess. That came up to a total distance of 3.4 miles (about 5.47 km). Now, developer Steve Cicco has come up with a   watchface that places you in the Mushroom Kingdom and tracks your steps to see how far you would make it in a day. Called Steps with Mario, this watchface isn’t a Mario game for your smartphone/smartwatch, however, it’s just a fun way to track your steps throughout the day. The watchface progresses through screenshots for each level of Super Mario Bros the more you walk and it also includes the date, time and battery percentage (represented by the coin count). Once you’ve hit 3.4 miles, you would have theoretically completed the game and the end screen will pop up only for it to be reset back to level 1-1 the next day. For now, this only works for Pebble smartwatches, but there is the off chance that someone might make something similar (or better) for Android Wear watches soon. Until then, if you have a Pebble smartwatch and you want to check this out, head on over  . The peculiar Time Round formatting has been updated. I have to say, it definitely looks better."

With the limited time I got to spend with the devices, I was rather impressed. The Aspire S 13 promised quite a lot. I expected it to be an HP Spectre 13 killer considering both devices were designed to be ultra-thin ultra-portable laptops. But, that’s not what the S 13 is and I’ll be honest, I was a little disappointed going into this. However, this doesn’t mean that the Aspire S 13 is a bad laptop. During the brief amount of time I spent with the laptop, it does appear to fulfil a lot of what Acer wants it to be. One of the core foundations of Acer’s approach to tackling this year’s markets (and future growth) is their 2-in-1 and ultra-portable laptop/tablet devices. Alongside the Switch Alpha 12, the S 13 is supposed to be able to hit a section of the market that no other laptop in this form factor can. Priced at USD699 (around RM2,730), the Aspire S 13 is quite the steal considering the specs and just how thin this laptop is. But, at that price tag, some compromises were made and that’s evident when you pick the laptop up. It feels…cheap, for lack of a better word. The keyboard isn’t particularly impressive either as it feels rather mushy and unsatisfying. What was great, though, was the sunlight visibility from that 13-inch full-HD panel. The S 13’s screen has a matte finish to it — similar to that on the Predator 15/17 laptops — which does a great job of masking reflection and remaining visible even under the bright sunlight pouring in from the venue’s windows. It’s light too, coming in at a mere 1.3kg for the non-touch and 1.36kg for the touch variant. One benefit it has over the Spectre 13 is that this comes in a variant with a 10-point touch sensitive display. Some like it, some don’t, but I know after using one, it’s really hard for me to go back to using a non-touch display. I’ll be honest, I wasn’t expecting too much from Acer’s Switch Alpha 12. There are already so many 2-in-1 Windows laptop hybrids that have failed in their attempt to copy Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 that I wrote this device off before I even saw it. Once I did see it, though, I was pleasantly surprised because it was a Surface Pro 4 clone done right. Possibly done better. There is a common saying in many competitive sports and e-sports where if you can’t beat the best, copy them. And Acer has done that rather well. The first thing I noticed about Acer’s new 2-in-1 was how awesome the attached keyboard was — it was almost Surface Type Cover-like. In fact, it gave me the exact same typing experience the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover (so that’s great). Acer also borrowed a design cue from the Surface when it came to the rear mounted kickstand. The Switch Alpha 12’s kickstand works in pretty much the same way as the Surface Pro 4’s only that it takes the form of a handle instead of a flat panel. One improvement Acer made was to add a rubberised strip to the bottom of the kickstand which gives it nice grip when on a flat surface. In terms of build, the Surface Pro 4 wins out a little here, but the Switch Alpha 12 feels a lot more premium than Acer’s other portable workstation Aspire S 13 thanks to its anodised aluminium chassis. What does set it apart from the Surface Pro 4 (besides its much lower price tag of USD599 — around RM2,335), is that it’s the industry’s first fanless 2-in-1 laptop with a 6th Generation Intel Core i processor. Yup, even the base model comes with at least a Core i3U processor. Acer keeps everything cool and fanless with their new LiquidLoop technology. This uses a heat pipe to dissipate the heat through a continuous process of evaporation and condensation of the liquid stored within. A fanless solution is great for small devices because it means that Acer can seal the laptop up to prevent (or at least reduce) dust from getting in. It also means that the Switch Alpha 12 is completely silent even under heavy load. Pair that with a beautiful quad HD panel and the Switch Alpha 12 can really be an excellent workhorse that can last up to 8 hours on a single charge."

Securing your phone is made easier without the hassles of entering pins or troublesome pattern unlock.   The   5X has one at the back and it does more than just keeping your phone safe. It does have a couple of interesting features to make this 5.5-inch smartphone a whole lot better to use. Read on to find out what you can do with the honor 5x’s fingerprint sensor.  
The honor 5X uses their newer Fingerprint Identification 2.0 that offers better performance, accuracy and it unlocks in just 0.5 seconds. Unlike other smartphones, setting it up requires only 6 taps.  Unlocking the honor 5x with your finger is incredibly quick and it works with partial touches or with damp fingertips. On top of that, it constantly learns more about your fingerprint and it gets more accurate each time you use it.  
For a 5.5” smartphone, the honor 5X can be big for those with smaller hands. For those who love to take selfies, you can take the shot using the fingerprint sensor. There’s no need to stretch your thumb, just hold the device securely and tap the sensor gently with your index finger. 
Your favourite contacts is just one touch away. The honor 5X allows you to preset a contact number to a specific fingerprint. Once registered, you can call your friends instantly even while the screen is locked. 
Always find yourself launching Facebook or WhatsApp often? Similar to contacts, you can register specific apps to your desired finger. Regardless of which screen you’re on, you can launch your favourite app instantly with a single tap. 
Need to check what’s going on? The honor 5x fingerprint sensor also doubles up as a mini touchpad. On any screen, you can slide downwards to pull down the notification panel. In addition, you can slide up on the sensor to view all your running/recent apps.  To recap, the honor 5X is a premium looking mid-range smartphone that comes in a beautifully crafted all metal body. The front gets a 5.5” Full HD display and it is powered by a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core Processor with 2GB of RAM.  It also gets a 13MP f/2.0 main camera and a front facing 5MP f/2.4 unit that has a wide 88 degree angle. For uncompromised connectivity and expansion, the honor 5X supports dual-SIMs with 4G support along with a dedicated microSD slot. Powering the device is a 3,000mAh battery which is capable to last a whole day."

The watch is compatible with phones on Android 4.4 Kitkat and up.

Rory Lee,Google Keyboard’s new update brings awesome new features,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/03/google-keyboards-new-update-brings-awesome-new-features/,"Android,google,Google Apps,Google Keyboard,smartphone",Mobile Apps,2016-05-03,"Google Keyboard is by far my favourite keyboard app. It’s clean, minimalist and unobtrusive but perhaps the thing I like most about it is that it’s familiar. The keys are where I need them to be. The only thing is that the Google Keyboard is a little behind its competitors if we’re looking at functionality. Well, Google is looking to rectify that with a massive update to their Keyboard app. Version 5.0 is Google’s latest update to the Keyboard app and it comes with a whole host of new features. Stuff like one-handed mode, adjustable keyboard height in settings, and even improved gesture typing. One-handed mode will undoubtedly be welcomed by those who have large smartphones but want to use them with one hand. With this new update, simply hold the comma key and swipe your hand right to activate one-handed mode. Once there, you can switch which side you want the keyboard to be as well as hit a button to bring it back to full size. You can also now adjust the keyboard height in the settings menu. I don’t know about you but I prefer a shorter keyboard so that there’s more space for me to look at what I’m typing, plus I don’t have to reach too far to hit the top row of keys.   Among my favourite quality of life improvements that came with the keyboard is the fact that you can now slide your finger on the spacebar to move the text cursor which does wonders for precise text selection. You can also swipe your finger on the backspace button to delete multiple words at a time. I liked the Google Keyboard for how barebones and minimalistic it was, but I have to admit, being able to slide your finger on the spacebar to move the cursor for individual text selection is something I definitely wanted to have. Maybe more features is a good thing, just as long as they keep the feel the same. I’d hate to have to start searching for a new keyboard app again. Keep in mind that these updates will roll out in stages so if you haven’t received it yet be patient. If you’d like to have a more detailed look at all the changes, check out Android Police’s   on it. If you’ve gotten the update already, what do you think about the new features?"

Rory Lee,Research says that e-cigarettes will help smokers quit tobacco for good,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/29/research-says-that-e-cigarettes-will-help-smokers-quit-tobacco-for-good/,"e-cig,e-cigarette,Health,smoking,vape,Vaping",Others,2016-04-29,"“Vaping” has taken the nation by storm. Where you used to see people chilling on their motorbikes or at a   stall taking a puff of their cigarette, now you see them inhaling questionable liquid through an unregulated electronic device. Why? Well, the argument was that vaping, or smoking an e-cigarette, was much healthier than a regular tobacco cigarette. In fact, the UK recently encouraged cigarette smokers to switch to e-cigs because it could “help them quit all tobacco use forever”. According to an article published by the New York Times, the Royal College of Physicians found that many of the earlier apprehensions people had with vaping and how it could potentially become a gateway into smoking traditional cigarettes were entirely false. In fact, they claimed that by making the switch to e-cigs, it could actually help people stop smoking entirely and urged smokers to make the switch. This contradicts the stand taken by many other countries including Malaysia. While our national government will not ban vaping outright on a national level, many states — like Terengganu, Kedah, Negri Sembilan, Johor and Kelantan — have done so on a state level. Last year, the National Fatwa Council of Malaysia also declared vaping as haram (forbidden). The rationale behind this apprehension is pretty straightforward: Although an e-cig is less harmful to the human body than a traditional cigarette (by up to 95% less) they’re still harmful. To make matters worse, these e-cigs (and the chemicals in liquid) are unregulated. This means that there is no set rule or guideline manufacturers have to follow when manufacturing vaping chemicals. Who knows what these manufacturers are willing to bake into their products to give it that extra kick. A while back, Wired did a piece on vaping and e-cigs to explore exactly how hazardous it was to a person’s health and wellbeing. Their findings leaned towards the unhealthy side of the fence. In fact, one of their interviewees even said that if accidentally ingested, the chemicals found in “vape juice” (the liquid that gets vapourised) could kill a child in  . To the average smoker, the appeal of e-cigs is pretty apparent. The e-cig serves as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes because they deliver nicotine without the cancer-causing substances like tar. However, I’m not convinced that vaping will eventually lead to someone quitting tobacco entirely, and for one simple reason: If there is a healthier way to do something I love, why on earth would I stop doing it? I know that if I could eat Big Macs every day without getting sick or fat, I definitely wouldn’t be in any hurry to stop."

Rory Lee,Here’s why you should pick up the Galaxy S7 over the S7 edge,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/28/heres-why-you-should-pick-up-the-galaxy-s7-over-the-s7-edge/,"Android,Galaxy S7,Galaxy S7 better,Galaxy S7 Malaysia,Malaysia,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S7 Price,Samsung Galaxy S7 vs S7 edge,smartphone,Why buy the Galaxy S7","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-04-28,"I feel like a broken record when I say this, but the   is without a shadow of a doubt one of the   you can buy in Malaysia now. Mostly because when it came to Samsung’s two new flagship devices, only one made its way onto our shores… . But, why would you want to pick up the “little brother”   smartphone instead of just going the extra mile for the bigger, more prestigious S7 edge? Well, now we’re going to tell you. Sure, when I say “go the extra mile” it sounds like an insignificant amount, but if you really do the math (there isn’t actually that much math, it just sounds more dramatic like this), picking up the Galaxy S7 over the edge variant will save you RM400. That’s a lot of dough no matter how you slice it. Let’s say you have RM3,099 to spend on a smartphone, you could just pick up the Galaxy S7 edge and that will be the end of it. But, if you were to opt for the Galaxy S7 (RM2,699) instead, you would have enough money to pick up a 128GB microSD card and still have about RM150-RM170 leftover to splurge on a case and screen protector of your choice. You’ve probably heard of the Galaxy S7 edge’s problems with palm rejection and accidental presses due to the dual-edge screen. Well, the Galaxy S7 doesn’t have any of those problems plus it comes in a smaller form factor so that makes one-handed usage all the easier. What’s more, the smartphone loses none of the power packed into its larger sibling. It still has that magnificent Exynos 8890 octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM and that gorgeous quad-HD SuperAMOLED display. In fact, the display looks even better because the same amount of pixels are placed on a smaller 5.1-inch panel which translates to a higher pixel density of 577ppi. The higher pixel density doesn’t only mean a better viewing experience in normal circumstances, it is also better for VR content consumption. Sure, you must be thinking: “But wait, the S7 has a smaller battery, shouldn’t that impact battery life?”. Well, yes, but it also has a smaller display which allows the device to be more frugal than its larger sibling so we should see roughly the same battery performance despite the smaller 3.000 mAh cell. Yup, all 12-megapixels of Dual Pixel glory. Easily one of the strongest highlights of Samsung’s new flagship smartphones comes mounted to the back of their devices. The primary camera is something absolutely remarkable not only because of how well it takes photos but also how easy and snappy it is to just point and shoot. The Dual Pixel technology allows near instantaneous focusing in almost all lighting conditions and the larger 1.4micron pixels paired with a super fast f/1.7 aperture lens translates to an epic low light performance. What’s more, with the smaller footprint, it makes one-handed snapshots that much easier. People often complain that smartphones don’t come in small sizes anymore. I agree with that, but I’m someone who likes big smartphones so that really doesn’t bother me at all. I do know that there are many people with small hands who really want a smaller smartphone. While I don’t think   is reasonable enough to use on the daily, the Galaxy S7’s 5.1-inch form factor hits a sweet spot. You get a large enough display to enjoy all the awesome things a smartphone has to give but it’s small enough to fit in one hand. The S7 also has a much more noticeable curve on the back (think Note5) so that makes it even easier and more comfortable to hold in the hand."

It is powered by Apple’s 64-bit A7 chip mated to 1GB of RAM and it features an 8MP camera with dual-tone LED flash at the back while the front gets a 1.2MP FaceTime HD camera.  The iPhone SE, on the other hand gets their latest A9 chip, similar to its current iPhone 6s and it features a better 12MP main camera that shoots 4K videos.

Out of the three, OPPO was the fastest growing with a 153.2% growth in the first quarter.

For Apple, IDC reported that iPhone 6 owners may not be compelled to switch to the newer iPhone 6s/6s Plus. On the other hand, Apple hopes to tap into emerging markets with the iPhone SE. However, for the price, it faces more stiffer competition with more powerful and affordable Android devices in China and India. Huawei is still dominant in their home ground China market and they are aggressively growing their presence out of China to clinch the top 3 spot. The Chinese brand takes a two-pronged approach with great focus on premium models like the P9, Mate and Nexus 6 as well as entry-level models from its honor line up.

Rory Lee,Acer’s new Predators keeps things simple and focuses on what “gamers want”,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/28/acer-predator-17x-predator-g1-gaming-pc-vr/,"Acer,acer gaming,Acer Global Press Conference New York,Acer Predator,gaming,gaming desktop,gaming laptop,Next at Acer,next@acer,portable gaming,Predator gaming laptop","Acer,Windows 10",2016-04-28,"Predator. A menacing word that describes a creature that preys on others in its specific food chain. In gaming, it refers to Acer’s line of hardcore gaming gear designed, no doubt, with a similar concept in mind: To dominate the competition. But, with  ‘s latest   launches at their Global Press Conference event last week in New York, the gaming line seems to have taken a peculiar turn. A turn that might cause some to question if the Predator was starting to become the prey. At their global event, dubbed  , the company   two new Predator machines — the   gaming laptop and the   mini-tower desktop. Both of these devices are behemoths when it comes to performance, packing top-of-the-line specifications into incredibly portable form-factors. Acer also utilises their “expertise” in thermal management to ensure that despite the small cases (which are notorious for poor airflow and cooling) the devices will still run at acceptable temperatures. So, why this focus on portability? Well, when I had a chat with Acer IT Products Business president Jerry Kao, he was very passionate in explaining their direction when it came to these two new Predators. The gist? It was what gamers  . Take the Predator 17X for example. On the surface, it looks (and feels) a lot like the older Predator 17 laptop with its nice soft touch finish and red LED accents. That’s because what’s new with this is on the inside. Along with the Predator G1, the new Predator 17X is “VR Ready”. Virtual Reality is likely going to be the “next big thing” when it comes to gaming because it offers immersion like no other medium has before this. The problem with that level of immersion is that it requires a whole lot of high-end hardware to run smoothly. In fact, a recent article by BBC News suggests that   of all PCs out there right now are VR Ready. With the new Predators, though, you can join that exclusive 1%. What’s more, the Predator 17X is one of the few gaming laptops in the world that is capable of performing this feat and a lot of that is down to the full desktop-grade NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 graphics card with 8GB of GDDR5 memory. That means, when you hook this laptop up to VR headsets like HTC’s Vive and the Oculus Rift, you can be confident that there will be no stuttering or performance issues during your gaming sessions. That’s pretty darn awesome for a laptop. Sure, it hasn’t got a water-cooling unit like   or a mechanical keyboard like the  , but it sticks to the roots of what makes it a gaming laptop — maximum power that still manages to be portable. Well, portable in the most literal of senses because the Predator 17X weighs a massive 4.55kg. But, at least it doesn’t have a gigantic optional water-cooling dock mounted on the back. Instead, Acer opts for a new triple-fan solution that sucks in cool air from the front of the laptop (not the bottom) and shoots it out the back. The Predator 17X, according to Acer, isn’t an exercise in pushing the boundaries of what you can feasibly add to a gaming laptop like the GX700 and GT80 Titan. Instead, it is an innovation that Acer says stems from giving gamers what they want. This means that while these new Predators may not have the flashy fangs of their competition, it doesn’t mean that they have lost any of their edge or lethality. They’re honed to accomplish one purpose and one purpose alone and on the surface, Acer seems to have done a pretty good job. What do you guys think of the new Predators? Are they really what you want when it comes to gaming?"

Right off the bat, it comes with unlimited voice calls to all Celcom/Xpax numbers if you perform a M4GIC Reload. For a worry free experience, they are still offering Free Basic internet which includes free access to WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook Messenger.  Also comes as standard is the ability to carry forward unused internet (half of base data plan) to the following month. The free unlimited Internet “burung hantu” between 1AM to 7AM is no more but you can enjoy that as an optional top up of RM2 for 2GB or RM5 for 10GB.  The biggest highlight, of course, is its data plans dubbed as M4GIC Reload. You can top up 1GB data at RM8/day or enjoy a whopping 7GB monthly data at RM68/month. Do note that the monthly plan quotas are split between all time and weekend data, similar to its current FIRST Postpaid offering.  All reload plans come with unlimited calls within Celcom’s network but only the XL and 2XL plans give you extra calls to other network. The XL reload comes with 30 minutes of calls to other networks while the 2XL reload comes with 60 minutes. Free unlimited music with Yonder Music is also included when you reload.  Celcom also pointed out that the new M4GIC Reload offers a more seamless experience. No longer you need to top up your credit and activate a plan by SMS as you can reload your credit, internet, unlimited voice and free music instantly in a single step. When compared to its   data options, it looks like you have to top up more than RM30 for a monthly data plan. We are told that you can continue to top up its previous data plans as shown below but you won’t get to enjoy free unlimited calls within Celcom’s network:"

Not only is it  ’s latest and greatest phablet, it’s also one of the most powerful ones in the market. Powered by Huawei’s homegrown Kirin 950 processor mated to 3GB/4GB of RAM and 32GB/64GB of internal storage, the Mate 8 has got more than enough horsepower to run with the big boys. What’s more, it’s got a much bigger display than a lot of this year’s flagships which puts it at #1 on the list for many who like to consume a lot of video content, browse web pages and play mobile games. But, it is up against some pretty amazing smartphones too. That said, the Mate 8 does have some tricks up its sleeve that you probably won’t be able to find on many of this year’s flagship smartphones, not even on the mighty  . The Mate 8 has a massive 4,000 mAh battery. It gives the device a day and a half of time-on-battery with about six to seven hours of screen on time. That’s a pretty amazing battery performance especially from a smartphone that large. What’s more, you can also help a friend out who is running low on battery by giving them a quick charge via an OTG cable and still have enough battery power to last an entire day. First up is Knuckle Sense. Knuckle Sense is a feature on the Mate 8 that allows you to use Knuckle Gestures to get some additional functionality out of your device. There are many different gestures for getting the phone to do different things. The first is a simple double tap with one knuckle on your screen. That takes a screenshot which you can then choose to share edit or discard. You can also choose to screenshot a specific section of the screen by drawing on it with your knuckle. This is pretty handy because you won’t have to remember any archaic button combos or perform complicated swiping to get your screenshot. A double tap with two knuckles activates a screen record function which records whatever is on your screen. It also picks up audio from the microphone so you can narrate while recording your screen at the same time. Besides that, you can also draw a line horizontally across your screen with one knuckle to activate multi-window mode. Finally, you can draw alphabets on the display to open certain specific applications that can be preset in the settings menu. Most fingerprint sensors are there for the additional layer of biometric security, but not the Mate 8’s. In addition to the improved biometric security, you can also use it to navigate around your phone, answer a call, stop an alarm or even take a photo."
Alexander Wong,Compared: Best postpaid plans with unlimited calls and lots of data for you and your family,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/05/02/malaysia-postpaid-comparison-with-supplementary-lines-digi-celcom-maxis-umobile/,,,2016-05-02,"Customers are really getting spoilt for choice when it comes to postpaid plans. After Celcom and Digi announced their  , Maxis went out to   with even more data.  On top of that, they have also upgraded their MaxisONE Share supplementary lines with a new DataPool feature. Similar to U Mobile’s Hero Postpaid Plus, DataPool lets you combine your overall data and you can share it across your supplementary accounts.  So which postpaid plan is the best for your household? Read on to find out. 
To recap Maxis’ latest offering, their MaxisONE Plan now comes with up to 20GB of data per month. On top of its unlimited voice and SMS bundling, the MaxisONE 98 still retains the last upgraded 5GB of quota, but the next MaxisONE 128 now gets 10GB of data. Meanwhile, MaxisONE 158 gets 15GB and their top of the line MaxisONE 188 gets 20GB.  What’s new is their upgraded MaxisONE Share, where you can add additional supplementary lines (RM48/month) that comes with unlimited calls, SMS and 5GB of shared data. To make sharing easier, Maxis DataPool lets you share data between principal and supplementary lines which is somewhat similar to U Mobile’s Hero Plus Postpaid.  For greater control, the principal line can manage how much data quota each supplementary line gets from the Maxis App. As an added bonus, Maxis is throwing extra 5GB/month of data video streaming quota for the principal line which is usable for iflix, viu, Eros now and hopster.  
For Digi, nothing much has changed since the  . Following Maxis’ latest upgrade, Digi has increased its Digi Postpaid 238 (More Internet) data quota from 20GB to 30GB. Hitting the sweet spot is still their Postpaid 80 (More Calls & SMS) that offers 7GB (Anytime) + 3GB (Weekend) data and unlimited calls for RM80/month. Unlike the rest, Digi seems to have done away with dedicated supplementary plans.  Instead, principal subscribers of Postpaid 48 and above can register additional Digi postpaid lines underneath them. The rest of the plan bundling remains unchanged and all you get is free calls and SMS between principal and supplementary lines.   
Celcom is probably having the simplest approach for postpaid. You get just 3 choices – FIRST Blue at RM45/month, FIRST Gold at RM80/month and   at RM150/month. All three FIRST Plans are now extended until 31 May 2016. For additional lines, they have their usual FIRST 1+5 supplementary plan.  At RM30/month you get 500MB of data, 50 minutes of calls and 50 SMS to all network. Also included is free calls and SMS between principal and supplementary lines. For the price, family members that need more data would be better off getting a FIRST Blue plan that offers 4GB of mobile data for RM15/month more.  
U Mobile has also   its Hero Postpaid plan extra 8GB data offer until 31 December 2016. For RM70/month, it still a bargain offering a combined 15GB of data, unlimited calls and SMS. For additional lines for sharing, each Share 50 Member line costs RM50 and that gives you unlimited calls and extra 3GB of data that’s shared with the principal line.  U Mobile also lets you watch unlimited video streaming 24/7 with no data charges with  . This covers 11 video platforms including iflix, YouTube, viu, HyppTV Everywhere, Youku and Tonton. Note that speeds on Video-Onz are capped at 1.5Mbps which is said to be enough for standard definition. If you want to stream at higher quality, there’s an option to turn Video-Onz off. The Video-Onz promo is offered until 31 July 2016."

But what if you’ve got a drone with both capabilities and the added bonus of being super safe? then you’ve got ‘s Hover Camera drone. The Hover Camera drone, is obviously built for taking photos and video from the air. But this is one you can safely snag out of the sky whenever you feel like it, because the propellers are completely enclosed within its foldable carbon fiber frame and thus making it essentially impossible for you to   on its four blades. Coming in at just 238g, the little drone is quite compact. When folded its about the size of a cassette tape and relies on your smartphone to work as its controller. The app it runs on not just controls the drone’s camera but it also lets you live stream video from the drone or copy a downgraded version of the video to your phone. Downloading the videos in their native 4K resolution will need you to plug it in to your computer via a USB 3.0 Type B cable. Other specs for the drone include a 13MP camera with dual tone flash, 32GB internal memory alongside a downward facing 3MP camera which serves to stabilize the drone. It also makes use of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Flight platform to run. However, the battery is fairly small, capable to last about eight minutes per charge. The drone will be capable of roughly smartphone camera quality images and video; but might be a bit better as its still getting its image stabilisation fine-tuned by the company. The Hover Camera is still undergoing beta trials but the company says they’re aiming for a price tag below $600, to be released sometime this Summer. Probably won’t be seeing the drone anywhere locally but its still a nice (and safe) drone concept we can get behind."

If you can take steps to be more environmentally conscious in your daily activities, you’re quite literally saving the world and I don’t think you need me to tell you that saving the world is incredibly cool. Since going green is cool, there probably isn’t a cooler way to charge your smartphone than with the Bioo Lite. Hint: It’s with a potted plant. In the most literal iteration of a power plant, Bioo has come up with a flowerpot that lets your plants generate power to charge your devices. In a nutshell, this pot basically turns the leaves on your plants into solar panels by harnessing the energy from photosynthesis. The resulting compounds generated by this organic process then react with embedded bacteria in the pot to create electrons which are subsequently gathered by a nanowire network and fed to an accumulator. The energy stored in the accumulator is then sent up via a USB cable to the top of the flowerpot which you can then plug your phone in and charge. If all of that sounds a little too complicated, check out Bioo’s video explaining this process: It’s pretty cool that from this natural organic process, the folks at Bioo were able to harness and generate 5V/1A of electrical current without damaging either the plant or the environment. Sure, this may be a pot now, but imagine the possibilities of this could be expanded to say an entire park or forest reserve. The biggest foreseeable problem with this flowerpot charger is the fact that it’s a crowdfunded project. Crowdfunding products are often fabulous on paper but have frequently run into problems when it comes to meeting production requirements and how well the actual retail device will perform. Either way, this is a cool product and I hope that Bioo can pull through with this piece of tech. They’ve already smashed their crowdfunding goal of EUR15,000 and are expecting to ship the pots by the end of this year. If you’re interested in learning more, check out their   or  ."

Inside, the smartphone is powered by a MediaTek 64-bit Octa-Core MediaTek MT6753 processor mated to 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable (up to 128GB via microSD) storage. By far the smartphone’s biggest selling point is its massive 6,300 mAh battery that supports Pump Express Flash Charge technology. This quick-charging technology pumps up 9V/3A and can give users a full day of use after only 30 minutes on the plug. A full charge should last moderate users up to 3.5 days and heavy users up to 2 days.

The smartphone also sports a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which can unlock your smartphone in 0.39 seconds.

Now, this highly anticipated laptop has finally made its way to Malaysia. In the past, water cooling had always been a desktop-only affair for a multitude of reasons, one of them being the space required to run the liquid coolants. With the ROG GX700VO, ASUS opted for a slightly different approach. Instead of finding a way to cram all the gear necessary for a water cooling solution, ASUS has decided to opt for a water cooling dock which you can hook the GX700VO up to. With this plug-and-play solution, ASUS has managed to keep the GX700VO itself portable — at least by gaming laptop standards — when you just want to bring it to Starbucks with you for some lighter productivity work. Without the water cooling dock, the laptop weighs in at about 3.6kg (almost 1kg less than the  ) but that weight gets bumped up by 4.8kg if you attach the dock (total weight: 8.4kg).

What’s more staggering is that this is their   in 13 years and another decline is also expected in the next quarter.

In an interview with  , Tim Cook said this was “a challenging quarter,” but denied that Apple was in decline.

Powering the device is their in-house developed Kirin 955 processor that’s mated to either 3GB or 4GB of RAM along with storage options of either 32GB or 64GB on board. The key highlight, of course, is its dual-lens set up that’s co-engineered with Leica. Both are 12MP shooters with one taking images in colour while the other in monochrome. Low light shots are assisted by its 1.25 micron pixel size and it focuses quicker with its hybrid focus technology. For selfies, it gets a front facing 8MP shooter that comes with a host of beautification features."
Cheryl Bates,New YouTube ad format will bring unskippable “Bumper ads”,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/27/new-youtube-ad-format-will-bring-unskippable-ads/,"youtube,youtube ads,YouTube Red","Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-04-27,"is planning a new ad format for their videos, and the new format, called “Bumpers” will feature unskippable 6-second ads in front of videos in the place of the longer, skippable ads we’re used to. The new ad format was announced through an Adwords blog where they will be replacing the current style of full-length ads. The good news is, the Bumper ads will only run for six seconds tops (sort of like a Vine), which means the people making them will have to get creative in squeezing in content in those tiny ads. They haven’t announced when exactly they will be rolling out the feature though, but they said that the short form Bumper ads are coming to mobile and tablets users soon. If you wish to opt out you can pick up either a Google Play Music or YouTube Red subscription which would remove the ads entirely. What do you think about this change? let us know in the comments."

The BBG will provide an alternative route to Europe for TM’s IP traffic, allowing for more reliable traffic and help mitigate potential congestion while extending broadband connectivity to wider audiences. The BBG is also unique in the sense that it rides on TM’s protected terrestrial network from Penang all the way to Singapore to avoid the more cable cut prone and busier areas up and around the Malacca Straits. The cable systems will also provide connectivity between our region and Africa and Europe though the Indian and Middle East links; and possibly more in the future as the BBG adopts the state-of-the-art 100Gbps tech in order to provide for future upgrades."

Similar in looks to the  , what it shares in common on the outside certainly doesn’t hold true for the inside. Under the hood you’ll find a 6th Gen Intel Core i7 processor that can be overlocked to 4.0GHz, up to a whopping 64GB of memory, and features a full sized GeForce GTX 980 GPU. Now that’s power. Keeping all of that cool is the Aeroblade custom triple-fan cooling system that sucks in air from the front grille and shoots it out the back to keep a steady flow of air. The Predator 17X also features a water cooling system after a sense, with a vapour chamber helping to remove heat. As for the display, you have a choice between a 17.3 inch FHD IPS (1920 x 1080) or UHD IPS (4K 3840 x 2160) display, both of which use NVIDIA G-Sync to match the refresh rate of the GPU, minimizing stuttering and screen tearing. Of course, the keyboard is supported by Acer PredatorSense to allow you to program in macros, and customise your backlighting to suit your taste.   This 4.55kg behemoth will retail for $2,799 (about RM 10,948) when it debuts this June in the US. Acer’s smallest portable gaming rig yet, the Predator G1 is all power in a small form factor. The reason why they made it so small is because its geared both towards regular users as well as those who are into e-Sports. The idea is to let you take it with you if you’re headed to a tourney or just headed to a friend’s place for a friendly game over LAN. They’ve also somehow managed to cram in a full sized NVIDIA GTX Titan X under the hood, alongside an 6th Gen Intel Core processor and up to 64GB worth of RAM. It will also support G-SYNC and 4K2K Ultra High Definition visuals for smooth graphics while a Creative Soundblaster X-Fi MB5 handles 7.1 channel surround sound. For storage you will have the choice between a huge 4TB hard drive or 512GB SSD, with a USB 3.1 Type-C Gen.2 port for fast data transfer. Like the Predator 17X the Predator G1 is customiseable via Acer’s PredatorSense where you can fiddle with the PC’s front chassis lights. The Predator G1 will initially roll out in 13 countries, starting with Canada, Belgium, the UK, France, Spain, Finland, Germany, Poland, Austria, Italy, Taiwan, Singapore and the Phillipines. The first 1000 customers who pick up the desktop will get a custom designed carrier case for the Predator G1 for free. For those looking for accessories, there will be a mechanical keyboard, headset and wheeled carrying case available at a later date."

More clarification below. Two Malaysian students recently won a gold medal and  . What did they create you ask? a power bank that can produce its own power from within. The International Exhibition of Invention is the world’s biggest innovation exhibition in the world, with this year being the 44th year running with over 695 exhibitors from 40 different countries converging to show their very best. And this invention of theirs managed to beat the innovations of over a thousand other contestants. The power bank, named the “Power Bank: Exieco PB” was invented by the two form 5 students from Maktab Rendah Sains Mara (MRSM) Kuala Terengganu, Ahmad Ashraf Aqil and Ahmad Luqmanul Hakim Ariffin Ahmad Tirmizi. The idea for this power pack came to them when flooding ravaged their hometown and caused a loss of electricity. Regular power banks store electricity from outside sources to be used later, but this one generates its own power though the oxidization of the fuel cell within. The cell produces energy through chemical reactions of the materials within; namely coal compounds, aluminium and a salt solution to generate electricity. The team is currently seeking approval from SIRIM for the “Power Bank: Exieco PB” for the purpose of marketing the innovation under MARA. If they succeed, its quite possible the Exieco: PB might become a great power source in times of emergency. Malaysia could use more young innovators like these two fellows; and hopefully they inspire even more. ==== As it turns out, the two (among many others) are just one of many who returned to their home countries with the said gold medals. The special award to them was, in fact, from Egypt’s science committee, as they were interested in their project. The teacher who accompanied the duo, Anuar Ghani,   that the gold medal was given to any team that scored enough points to quality and it didn’t indicate that they won the best invention award. He added they did win the gold medal but it is based on merits if it scored enough points.

Cheaper, third party (or dubiously sourced) accessories can seem like they’re a better alternative to the original item. When a charger is just a charger why should you pay more for the original, right? Because that cheap China-made piece of junk could cost you your life. The fact is, very often these third-party accessories do not meet the required safety standard set by authorities such as SIRIM. This is especially so in cheap third-party replacement batteries and chargers. These accessories rarely have the appropriate protection mechanisms put in to ensure that they don’t suddenly explode or leak electricity. There’s very little stopping you from getting seriously hurt by electrical discharge or in a worst case scenario, a ruptured battery exploding in your face. Always use certified, original chargers when charging up your devices. This incredibly tragic incident need not repeat itself just because you tried to save a few bucks."

Since both brands started collaborating earlier this year, people were more or less expecting a smartphone camera from Leica on the back of a Huawei device and this is the result.

The lenses themselves are in fact produced by Sunny Optical Technology of China, and the new information hasn’t got people very happy about the phone. However, recently Huawei issued an official statement on the matter stating that the P9 phones may not be certified by Leica but they were co-engineered by the two brands.

What the render shows us isn’t something we haven’t seen before, however, as the details are still largely the same. @evleaks tends to be right on the button when it comes to phone leaks so this is very likely what the finalised phone will indeed look like. Motorola is also apparently working on a Moto G4 Plus, which could be a larger variant of the Moto G4 with similar specs. There isn’t much other information on the phone yet, but we’re expecting them to be launching the Moto G4 later this year."

If RM3,099 is too much to pay for a smartphone, you’ll be happy to know that the G5 is slightly affordable at RM2,999. To recap, the LG G5 is probably the most customisable flagship smartphone at the moment. Underneath its metal body design, the G5 has a removable slot at the bottom which allows you to swap batteries and   accessories.  Up front it gets a 5.3″ Quad HD display and underneath it runs on Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM.

The main camera is a 16MP shooter with OIS, while the secondary shooter uses an 8MP sensor. For selfies, it also gets an 8MP shooter up front.  Powering the device is a 2800mAh battery and it charges using USB Type C supporting QuickCharge 3.0. Like the Galaxy S7/S7 edge, the G5 also has an always-on display which LG claims to drain just 0.8% per hour. Out of the box, it runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.  DirectD’s listing indicates that Titan and Pink colours are ready to be shipped in 2-3 days, while the Gold colour version will be ready in 1-2 weeks time. Since this is an import set, it comes with a 1-year warranty from DirectD.  Other LG G5 modular accessories are also available and they are priced as follows:

  – RM1,399 Since LG Malaysia has been quiet in the smartphone business, DirectD is probably your best bet for now.

For start, the display would be one of the first HDR displays in the mobile world, with a 120Hz refresh rate, 2,000:1 contrast ratio alongside being able to output 1,000 nits of brightness though its said it could possibly output up to 1,300. That is more than double that of the Samsung Galaxy S7 which outputs about 539 nits of brightness. Also a HDR display on the phone would mean that it could display up to 1.07 billion colours, as opposed to the 16.8 million colour depth on most other flagship devices. The Xperia X Performance uses a 5.5″ Whitemagic LCD display that pushes a standard Full HD resolution. The full specs isn’t known yet and it should be a notch above its the current Xperia X Performance. The X Performance has a Snapdragon 820 under the hood, mated to 3GB RAM with the choice between 32/64GB storage. The phone will be sporting a 5-inch Full HD display alongside a USB Type-C port.

Not exactly a brilliant way of concealing info from the public eye. Read on for more details.  To check it out yourself, just view the   page and hit  . If you search for “Pioneer Plan”, you’ll be able to read more details of its current offering.  For starters, the Webe Pioneer Plan is open to selected individuals and they will be able to register for the plan between 31st March until 6th May 2016. After 31st July, all users will be converted to the normal commercial plan. It comes bundled with 20GB of domestic mobile internet, 1,000 minutes of domestic voice and 1,000 SMS. Priced at RM10.60 (as opposed to the RM8 on the mockup) the plan does have some limits. For one, you cannot tether your device as a WiFi hotspot. To do so, you would have to buy a Personal Wi-Fi Pass that will cost RM6.36 for 2 hours. This is probably the first time a Malaysian telco restricts your mobile data from WiFi hotspot use. Also, once you have used up your 20GB, you can still surf for free but your speed will be throttled to 128kbps, which is double the standard 64kbps speed offered by other telcos. Oddly enough, its been mentioned that Webe users are allowed to download P2P files but at throttled 64kbps speeds and they cannot carry forwards their unused data. For  , it seems that they’ve got most major towns and cities covered, even in East Malaysia which is likely the same footprint as  . What’s interesting to note though, is that its 4G network runs on the 850MHz spectrum instead of the usual 1800MHz/2600MHz that are being used by other telcos.

This new chip is supposed to be more efficient and has some features from Intel’s Skylake architecture baked in; namely hardware based 4K video capabilities and better visual performance. Its also a tad bit cheaper, which allows the funds to be dedicated to RAM and other upgrades, like the display for example.

The   among the telcos in Malaysia has been heating up recently with new offerings from  ,  and even   adding a little spice to their existing lineup. One big problem with that price war is that these postpaid plans all hover around the RM70-RM80 mark which isn’t an insignificant amount to pay for a plan. What if you want something basic that won’t burn a hole in your pocket? Besides the four ( ) telco companies in Malaysia, there are also mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) who operate by piggybacking on an existing telco’s network — so wherever that telco has coverage, the MVNO will too. red ONE is one such company (piggybacking on Celcom’s network) and they’ve just introduced a back-to-basics postpaid plan that starts from as low as RM8/month. What do you get for RM8/month? Well, for starters, you get 500MB of data for free. However, once you’ve depleted your quota, you will be charged at a Pay Per Use (PPU) rate of 10sen/1MB, capping off at RM250. After 10GB of usage, your speeds will be capped at 64kbps. To avoid expensive to PPU rates, red ONE offers data bundles which you can purchase to add on to your postpaid plan. These bundles are RM20 for 1GB, RM30 for 2GB, RM40 for 3GB, and RM60 for 5GB. There is a caveat according to red ONE’s Facebook page. red ONE says that data speeds will depend on which data bundle you purchase. For example, if you were to pick up the RM20 for 1GB of quota, your speeds will be limited to 7.2Mbps (3G speeds). If you want to enjoy 4G LTE speeds, you will need to subscribe to a data bundle of at least 2GB (RM30). Besides data and internet quotas, red ONE’s Data8 plan also offers users free calls to all red ONE mobile numbers, limited to 100 hours/month. Calls to other mobile networks will cost you 15sen/min while SMSes are priced at 10 sen/SMS to other networks and 5sen/SMS to red ONE users. If you’re interested in signing up for the Data8 postpaid plan, you will have to commit to a contract of 6 months. The good thing about red ONE is that they will even allow users who have been blacklisted by other telcos to sign up, though they will have to make an upfront payment and deposit before registering.

Not only that, there is also a permissions warning related to the VR service that states “[App name] will be able to run when you are using applications in virtual reality mode”. This not only hints that Android N might have some kind of VR Mode (perhaps like  ?), but there will be certain helper apps that will be able to pop up within that Android VR Mode.

If you do spend RM225 and above, Celcom will grant you 1GB of extra data and 2GB if you spend RM500 and above. Note that roaming charges don’t count for this usage accumulation. Since domestic calls and SMS are already unlimited, the only possible way is probably through making more IDD calls.  As a FIRST Platinum member, Celcom is also offering free 1-year iflix and 1 year of Zip-it-chat service, along with unlimited access to Yonder Music.

At the launch event of   international roaming plans earlier today, we tried to push them for some information about the plan, but they wouldn’t budge. Unfortunately for them, it looks like their dealers weren’t so reluctant to divulge information as pictures of what looks like briefing slides were posted on, not one but two, Facebook pages. Sticking to Celcom’s hierarchy of colours, the Celcom FIRST Platinum is supposedly designed for the “heavy user” and as a result, it offers a combined data quota of 18GB/month. The caveat is, like the other plans in Celcom’s FIRST roster, the monthly data quota is split between two buckets. This means you get 9GB of data that can be used anytime while the remaining 9GB is spread out over the weekends. If the current FIRST postpaid plans are anything to go off, this should mean that you will get 2.25GB/weekend. Celcom also allows you to carry forward unused quota up to 9GB to the next month. You also get unlimited calls and SMS plus 9GB of complimentary Celcom WiFi all for RM150/month. However, based on the slides, this price of RM150 is a promotional price that is will be available for users who subscribe from 15th of April to 31st of May 2016.

Sporting five rows of keys as opposed to the original’s four, the new Rolly 2 not only has its own dedicated numeral keys but also a little tab at the bottom that makes unravelling the keyboard much easier. On top of that, the Rolly 2 can connect to a total of 3 devices as opposed to the two of its original iteration. Thanks to the extra row of keys it also rolls up into a neat pentagon. The Rolly Keyboard 2 retails at around $110 (about RM 427) and unfortunately will only be available in South Korea as for now. We don’t know if there’s plans to export it internationally but its a cool piece of kit we’d like to see on our shelves someday."
Rory Lee,Digi’s new Postpaid 80 plan gives 10GB of data for RM80/month,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/15/digis-new-postpaid-80-plan-gives-10gb-of-data-for-rm80month/,"DiGi,Digi new postpaid plan,Digi Postpaid 80,Digi postpaid plan,Digi weekend data,new postpaid plan Malaysia","DiGi,Players on the Field,Promotions",2016-04-15,"Hot on the heels of  ‘s latest postpaid plan announcement,   has come up with their own new plan — the Digi Postpaid 80 (More Calls & SMS) — which offers a 10GB of data quota for RM80/month plus unlimited calls and unlimited SMS to 3 Digi Friends. Sound familiar? No matter how you spin it, 10GB of quota for RM80/month isn’t too shabby as we have seen a similar offering from Celcom with their   plan. The problem with Celcom’s plan is that they split your quota between data that you can use anytime and data that is reserved for weekends. Unfortunately, Digi’s new postpaid plan operates under this same mechanic — the only difference being how they split it. With Digi’s Postpaid 80 plan, the telco is offering 7GB of anytime data with 3GB of weekend data. On the surface, it seems like a better split compared to the 5GB+5GB that Celcom gives because it offers you more flexibility. Unlike Celcom, who splits your weekend quota evenly between each weekend, Digi gives you all 3GB upfront, leaving it up to you to decide how to manage your weekend data usage. But which is really better? Well, the good thing about Digi’s weekend data solution is that it is up to you to manage your weekend data. Say, you were connected to your home’s WiFi network for an entire weekend, you still have all your quota to split between the remaining weekends. With Celcom’s split, if you happen to spend a weekend in an area devoid of coverage or if you don’t switch on your data, you immediately lose one weekend worth of data quota. However, the good thing about that is if a month has 5 weekends, you get an extra weekend worth of data. Digi’s Postpaid 80 also comes with unlimited calls to all networks and unlimited SMS to 3 Digi Friends (standard SMS rates are 10sen/SMS). However, you won’t be able to sign up for a device contract with this plan. Looking through Digi’s website, we noticed that this new postpaid plan is essentially Digi’s old Postpaid 78 plan plus Digi’s new RM2 for 3GB of weekend data add-on service. This weekend data add-on service is also applicable for customers on Digi Postpaid 98 More Internet and above, as well as Digi Postpaid 78 More Calls & SMS and above. Digi already has the most postpaid plans of any telco in Malaysia, did they really need to add another one? What do you guys think of this plan? Let us know in the comments below.

Rory Lee,Huawei joins the VR race with an oddly familiar headset,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/15/huawei-joins-the-vr-race-with-an-oddly-familiar-headset/,"huawei,Huawei Mate 8,Huawei P9,Huawei P9 Plus,Huawei virtual reality,Huawei VR,VR headset","huawei,Mobile Accessories",2016-04-15,"All aboard the VR hype train! Huawei just unveiled three brand new VR headsets for their flagship P9, P9 Plus and Mate 8 smartphones. They look…oddly familiar if you ask me. Dubbed the Huawei VR, these VR headsets bear a striking resemblance to Samsung’s Gear VR, from the dials to the touch sensitive navigation buttons and back key. The three variants are separated based on which Huawei flagship you’re using, which means that at least two of the variants will be USB Type-C capable. It mounts your smartphone the same way too, by popping off the front visor, plugging your device into the port at one end (with the VR app running) and snapping the smartphone in with the clip at the other end. This headset also supports 360-degree sound field, but you will need to have the right content loaded and your own specialised headphones that can support this audio format. One way the Huawei VR might fall short of the Gear VR is that Huawei’s smartphones are all running at a 1080p full-HD resolution compared to Samsung’s Quad HD panels on the supported Samsung devices. The Huawei VR headsets receive 20ms low latency and 95-degree field of view specifications but with an added bluelight filter which should translate to less tired eyes. You won’t be able to wear your glasses with the headset, but the lenses are adjustable and will accommodate myopia of down to -7.00. At launch, Huawei will offer over 4,000 free movies, over 40 games, over 350 panoramic images and over 150 panoramic tours with the Huawei VR. Unfortunately, Huawei has not revealed any pricing or availability."

It got even better when the orange telco   which bumped the original 7GB quota to a whopping 15GB of monthly quota for only RM70/month. Well, things are rosier than ever now as U Mobile has extended the duration of the bonus data promo to the end of this year. U Mobile outed one of the most competitive data plans ever when they launched their Hero Postpaid P70 plan promo which offered customers 15GB of data for only RM70/month. This was far and away the best value-for-money postpaid data plan in the market. What many people didn’t know was that this 15GB quota was not a permanent thing. In fact, it was due to expire on 30th June 2016, after which the quota would return to its original 7GB. The good news is that U Mobile has now extended their Hero Postpaid P70 promo to the 31st of December 2016. This means that you now get an extra 6 months of bonus quota.

Celcom has announced an even higher postpaid plan with larger quota while Digi has introduced a new plan (sort of) with more data for the weekends. Not to be left out, U Mobile has also   its P70 Hero postpaid’s extra 8GB promo until the end of 2016. So how do the new plans stack up? Read on for our full comparison. 
Just to recap, the new   at RM150/month offers 18GB of data which is split with 9GB for all time use and 9GB for the weekends. It also gets unlimited calls and SMS, along with additional perks including 1 year iflix subscription and a one-time access to Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge. Like the rest of its FIRST postpaid offering,  you can also carry forward unused data up to 9GB to the following month.  
For Digi, the new   appears to be a direct hit on Celcom’s FIRST Gold postpaid plans that offers 10GB of data at RM80/month. Unlike Celcom’s 50-50 split, the Digi plan offers 7GB for all time use and 3GB for the weekends. On the plus side, Digi does not segregate your weekend data further so you are free to use the full 3GB quota on a single weekend. Essentially, the Postpaid 80 plan is the same old Postpaid 78 (More Voice & SMS) with the RM2 for 3GB weekend data add-on. Calls are also unlimited while SMS is unlimited only to 3 numbers on Digi.  For a detailed postpaid comparison against other telcos, check out the tables below. We’ve also added Maxis SurfMore50 and MaxisGO plans into the mix."
Rory Lee,DJI’s Osmo and Phantom drones officially land in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/13/djis-osmo-and-phantom-drones-officially-land-in-malaysia/,"Buy DJI Malaysia,DJI,DJI Drone,DJI Malaysia,DJI Osmo,DJI Osmo Malaysia,DJI Phantom,DJI Phantom 4,DJI Phantom 4 Malaysia,Drone,drone camera,Malaysia","Cool stuff,Others",2016-04-13,"have changed the landscape of photo and videography. Shots that previously required massive cranes and even helicopters can now be accomplished by virtually anyone anywhere in the world. At the forefront of drone development is none other than Chinese company   and they’ve just brought their iconic Phantom drones into Malaysia. The Phantom series of drones have to be one of the most iconic drones in the world, making appearances in movies and cartoons around the world. It has become difficult to think of a drone without the image of the Phantom’s iconic design popping into your head. DJI’s brand new Phantom 4 keeps to that same look plus a few added improvements. The arms that hold the propellers are slimmer and thinner to help the drone be more aerodynamic. Its camera also gets a new gimbal and even the propeller blades can be mounted more easily. The Phantom 4 is designed to make flying a drone easy and from what I could tell based on their brief demonstration — it does. One of the most astounding things the Phantom 4 brings is its obstacle avoidance function. Thanks to two front mounted optical sensors, the drone can “see” obstacles when it’s flying and will stop when it thinks it’s going to crash. This works both when the drone is flying on autopilot and when you’re flying it via the controller. On autopilot, when the drone detects an obstacle, it will make one decision: Can it fly over the obstacle? If the answer is yes, then it will do just that, otherwise the drone will stop and beep your controller. If you’re the one behind the wheel (controller?) and you mindlessly run into an obstacle, the drone will stop and beep your controller to let you know you’re being a bit of a tool. Not into using a controller? You can also tap on your connected (via the DJI app) smartphone’s display to tell the drone to “Go” to a particular location. The Phantom 4 also has an active track function that allows the drone to autonomously track a subject of choice. Simply select the subject on your smartphone’s display and the drone will scan it, recognise its shape and features. then proceed to track the target. This gives pilots the freedom to move their drone without worrying about losing their subject in the frame — an awesome feature for new pilots who aren’t that good with the controls yet. DJI’s Phantom 4 shoots crisp 4K video at 30fps and full-HD 1080p at 120fps. What’s more, the camera gets a new 8-element aspherical lens that eliminates unwanted fisheye distortion and reduces chromatic aberration in its footage. The drone’s battery gets a boost too, allowing DJI to rate flight time at 28 minutes per charge. The Osmo is an interesting piece of tech. It’s sort of like a drone’s camera and camera mount without the drone. DJI are calling it a stabilised handheld 4K camera — and it’s exactly that. A Zenmuse X3 camera mounted on a stick allows DJI to bring their drone’s video stabilisation to the ground. It’s fairly simple to operate with only two buttons and a trigger. The video stabilisation is pretty awesome but I believe its portability and light weight are the Osmo’s strongest features. Camera stabilisation rigs usually weigh a tonne, but the Osmo shoots crisp 4K video while weighing about the same as a 500ml water bottle. This is the first time DJI are bringing their drones into Malaysia officially. Partnering with ECS Malaysia, these drones will make their way into all ECS retailers like All IT hypermarket and online at sites like Lazada. If you want to pick a Phantom 4 up, be prepared to pony up as the drone will be priced at RM6,199. However, if you’re on a tight budget, ECS have also brought in three different variants of the older Phantom 3 (priced at RM2,129 for the Standard, RM3,499 for the Advanced and RM4,499 for the Professional). The Osmo OM 160, on the other hand, costs RM2,499. For now, ECS Malaysia is only bringing in these three models. However, they did say that if there is a demand for the other drones in DJI’s extensive lineup, ECS Malaysia will bring put them up for sale as well."

Last month they had rolled out cash payments in  , followed by   and   two weeks later. The cash payment option is rolled out in stages and you can make the selection when confirming your pickup location. Just tap on your credit/debit card number and you should see a cash option if it’s available to you. Do note that if you don’t have exact change, Uber will round up your fare to the closest ringgit. This means if your trip costs RM10.20, you would need to pay RM11.  Is cash the way to go? According to Uber, cash will allow more people to experience their ride-sharing service which was previously limited to electronic payment. As  , we prefer cashless transactions by card as it saves time and the hassle of finding small change. It would be more efficient for drivers as well since they can drive off immediately after dropping a passenger. With the latest change, we foresee Uber drivers being more vulnerable to   from taxi drivers as they would need to make longer stops when dropping passengers.  For Uber, each trip is calculated based on time and distance, so you wouldn’t know your final fare until you’ve arrived at your destination. Meanwhile, Grab has a better implementation as they will tell you upfront of how much your trip would cost. This is possible as Grab calculates based on distance, allowing passengers to prepare the exact change even before they start the trip."

The problem with streaming content on mobile/data plans is that they take up a lot of your quota, leaving mobile users hesitant to expend valuable quota to watch videos or stream movies. Well,   plans to solve that with what they call “bite-sized video passes” that let customers enjoy streaming content without worrying about using up their internet quota. Meet Digi Video Freedom. Much like   pass, Digi Video Freedom allows users to purchase value-add passes to stream content without having to tap into their existing quota. Digi is offering two passes for Digi Video Freedom — an hourly pass that costs RM1/hour and a daily pass that costs RM5/day (24 hours). Both of these passes lets you freely stream content from popular host sites like YouTube, iflix, Astro on the Go, Viu, tonton, Dailymotion and HyppTV. Of course, these passes are subjected to a fair use policy which limits the hourly pass to a quota of 3GB/hour and the daily pass to 10GB/day. If your quota ends up running out, you can always re-purchase the pass to refresh your quota. These video passes cover quite an extensive number of video streaming platforms and content which should delight users, however, there are several big streaming sites that have not been included. Twitch, for example, has been left out in this initial launch, but at least you get access to YouTube Gaming. The good news is, much like the Digi Music Freedom pass, the telco will continue to update and expand its roster of supported platforms in the future. Digi subscribers who are interested in these video passes can purchase them via the MyDigi app (  and  ) starting 15 April 2016."

While this is technically the third developer preview released for Android N (Dev Preview 1 launched a month-ish back) its got some new API changes baked in that should make Android N better for everyone. For starters, there is a new 3D rendering API to help smoothen out performance for “draw-call heavy applications” that’s called Vulkan. Its likely designed to make heavy duty games run better, and there’s also a handful of bug fixes going with the update. Apps will also be able to define intent shortcuts, which can then be added to the launcher for ease of access. For example you could have a shortcut that immediately starts you on the way home using Waze or a shortcut that would let you message a particular contact at a click. Last but not least, you will get Emoji Unicode 9 support out of the box for more “human looking” emoji with more skin tone variation and Unicode 9 glyphs.

Under WONDEROAM, users get to choose from a range of daily and weekly roaming plans. WONDEROAM comes in three forms — the WONDEROAM 1 DAY SOCIAL RM10, WONDEROAM 1 DAY INTERNET RM38 and WONDEROAM 1 WEEK RM138. WONDEROAM 1 DAY SOCIAL is pretty self-explanatory as it gives users 1GB of quota per day for Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp along with 50MB of high-speed internet and 50MB of basic internet for RM10/day. Unfortunately for postpaid subscribers, this plan is only available for XPAX prepaid users. To subscribe simply key in *118# then navigate to Wonderoam > Wonderoam 1 Day Social RM 10 > Subscribe. On the other hand, the WONDEROAM 1 DAY plan is available for both postpaid and prepaid customers. It gives users quota allocations ranging from 50MB onwards (depending on country) for RM38/day. Postpaid subscribers will automatically be charged upon using the Internet service while connected to preferred networks when roaming while prepaid subscribers will have their credit balance deducted upon purchase via the *118# USSD. The big benefit of this WONDEROAM daily plan is that there will be no bill shock as Celcom doesn’t offer any pay-per-use plans with it. Additionally, you won’t be able to connect to data if you’re not connected to one of Celcom’s preferred roaming partners. What’s more, if you have finished your internet quota, you can still surf but at throttled speeds. Celcom also offers a WONDEROAM 1 WEEK that’s available exclusively for Celcom FIRST Gold and the new FIRST Platinum subscribers. This plan will cost RM138/week and will give subscribers unlimited calls, unlimited SMS and 3GB of internet. If you finish your allocated 3GB of quota, data connection stops and you will have to resubscribe for another 3GB of data. Calls and SMS remain unlimited though. Celcom boasts that with WONDEROAM 1 DAY RM38, you can take advantage of their extensive roaming network that extends to 165 countries (which Celcom claims is the most of any local telco). They also say that there will be at least two roaming partners in each country which should mean much better accessibility. Unfortunately, WONDEROAM 1 DAY SOCIAL RM10 and WONDEROAM 1 WEEK RM138 are only available in 10 selected countries: Singapore, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos and Macau. Another tidbit Celcom revealed during the WONDEROAM launch is that they will be rolling out a brand new plan to add to their FIRST line of postpaid plans — the FIRST Platinum. According to Celcom, details on this new plan will be revealed tomorrow (15 April)."

Does it stack up? Well, on paper, it definitely doesn’t skimp on power. On the front, the HTC 10 has got a beautiful 5.2-inch quad-HD Super LCD5 display being powered by a 2.2GHz Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor on the inside mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB/64GB of expandable (via microSD up to 2TB) internal storage. For its “World First, World Class” camera, HTC is putting its money on a 12-megapixel UltraPixel 2 primary camera on the back with a fast f/1.8 aperture lens, OIS, laser autofocus and a dual-tone LED flash. It uses the same fewer megapixels with larger pixels (1.55µm, same as the Nexus 6P) formula found on a lot of the newer flagship smartphones. On the front, it’s got a 5MP UltraSelfie camera also packing a fast f/1.8 aperture lens, OIS and a wide 23mm focal length. What’s more, it also supports autofocus and full-HD 1080p video recording. The 10 has got BoomSound too. Yep, HTC are calling the speakers on the 10 re-engineered BoomSound Hi-Fi edition which is supposed to be the best BoomSound speakers to date. Encased in its full-metal unibody is one of the largest batteries HTC has ever fitted on a smartphone — a 3,000 mAh unit. It sounds small by modern-day standards but HTC has often been one to shy away from larger batteries so this is a pretty big move for them. HTC’s 10 will be running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with the latest HTC Sense running on top of it. One interesting thing is that HTC says the 10 is doing away with the conventional icon-grid layout, giving users more opportunity to get creative with the Freestyle Layout. It apparently lets you drag icons, stickers and widgets anywhere you like across the UI. The walls are closing in on the Taiwanese company that used to be at the forefront of Android smartphone development. We all remember their heyday, but that time has long past and now it’s time to look towards the future, but that future is a little muddy for HTC. I love HTC’s smartphones. My first smartphone ever was an HTC so it really pains me to see this company crumble beneath the weight of its own hubris. Refusing to adapt despite a lackluster performance was one of the biggest factors that put HTC in the position they’re in right now. For that very reason, the 10 has to be magnificent. It has to be the best smartphone HTC has ever made. It’s crunch time for the Taiwanese company and while the 10 looks pretty good on paper, it’s how it stacks up against the competition that will be the deciding factor on whether this phone can bring HTC back to their glory days. According to  , the HTC 10 will start shipping next month in the US and will be priced at USD699 (RM2,720)."

While we can’t say for certain that this smartphone will live up to all the hype it has claimed, there are several interesting things that HTC has done with their latest flagship. Everyone can say they have a world class smartphone camera. HTC claims that they’re obsessed with providing the best camera experience ever. What they went with was a 12-megapixel UltraPixel 2 primary camera on the back. This unit has large 1.55µm pixels (same as the Nexus 6P) with a fast f/1.8 aperture lens, OIS and laser autofocus. An impressive spec sheet, but that’s not all. The front-facing UltraSelfie camera looks pretty good on paper too. It comes with OIS (which is very rare for a selfie snapper) and autofocus. What’s more, it’s got pretty large 1.34µm pixels which should make for good low-light performance. Well, on paper at least. This is the first time HTC has placed 4GB of RAM into their flagship smartphone. Pair that with Qualcomm’s super-fast Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor clocked at 2.2GHz and this smartphone should do   when it comes to performance. BoomSound was one of the most iconic features associated with HTC’s flagship smartphones. They were fantastic sounding dual front-facing stereo speakers that blew almost every other smartphone speaker out of the water. HTC claims that the HTC 10’s BoomSound Hi-Fi Edition with Dolby Audio is the best BoomSound speaker ever. It no longer uses the twin front-facing stereo speakers, though, instead opting for a new setup that utilises a bottom firing speaker and the earpiece to project sound. If you’ve ever used an HTC smartphone, you would’ve probably have noticed that they don’t like to place big batteries in their smartphones. This time, HTC has broken a norm and placed a large (by HTC standards) 3,000 mAh battery in the 10 which HTC claims can last you two days on a single charge. Not only that, HTC has also included support for Quick Charge 3.0 which gives the 10 a 50% charge from dead in just 30 minutes. Customisability has been Android’s calling card. HTC takes this to a whole new level with their new Freestyle Theme. This theme essentially allows users to place apps and icons wherever they please, creating a UI look and feel that is unique to each individual. This theme does away with the grid layout found on your regular smartphone and that lets users get creative with app placements and app icons among others."

Unfortunately, there aren’t much details on the phone coming out with the leak aside from the images, except that the phone will apparently be 6 inches in size and that it has a pretty big camera sensor out front with what looks like an LED flash. The features are pretty typical of an Xperia C series device, of which a new member of the series was supposed to be launched at MWC 2016 but instead Sony introduced the  phones instead. The phone also has a curved back and front panel as well as relatively slim side panels. The Xperia C6 is also rumoured to sport a 5.5″ full HD display up front, with a 2.0GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor running on the inside.

The devices are the product of a collaboration between  ,   and Thundermatch (one of Malaysia’s biggest IT chain stores) to produce the 2-in-1 device and PC stick. While the Spectrum i100 is pretty explanatory (its like a slate in some ways) the PC Stick on the other hand is a teeny thing that will allow you to make any screen (with a keyboard and mouse of course) into a PC just by plugging it in. Under the hood, the Spectrum i100 is home to an Intel Atom z3735F chip at 1.33GHz, 2GB RAM, alongside 64GB internal memory. It also runs off Intel HD graphics and a large 8900mAh battery. The device also sports a 2 megapixel front and 5 megapixel rear camera combo and a 10.6 inch 1080p IPS screen. The Spectrum i100 doesn’t look like a Surface killer but with the bundled keyboard and Windows 10 on board it could make for a decent work machine if you don’t want to lug around a heavy notebook. As for the PC Stick, it has an Intel Atom z3735F, quad-core SOC on board mated to 2GB RAM, 32GB storage (expandable via microSD slot) and Intel HD 2D/3D graphics capabilities as well as Windows 10.

The most extreme fanatics turn their nose up at digital photography because, to many of them, people who look at a screen after each shot to see how well their photos turn out are akin to a monkey playing with a toy they do not understand. I am one such monkey. I never saw the appeal in film or instant film photography…that is until I saw Impossible Project’s absolutely gorgeous I-1 instant film camera. The I-1 is a nod to classic Polaroid cameras of old, bringing much of the original’s analogue features into a sleek and modern matte black body. It looks absolutely stunning from almost any angle. Impossible Project calls their new-old camera the “only new camera for the original Polaroid format” and it is designed to shoot on their type 600 film. This particular film has been painstakingly reverse engineered from Polaroid’s discontinued 600-type film, but if you happen to have any of that original film lying around, the I-1 will also accept that. It’s classic with what it shoots on, but completely modern with how you shoot with it. The I-1 is designed for simplicity with very few buttons, no knobs and an auto-adjusting LED flash that compensates for ambient light and distance. The camera also connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth. Install the companion app and it will give you a lot more control over this camera. Users can adjust aperture, shutter speed, flash settings and even remote trigger the camera. The app also provides users with several preset effects like double exposures and open-shutter long exposure shots. What’s more, you can also charge it via a microUSB cable which means it should hook up to your powerbank/wall socket without a problem. No more pesky batteries to worry about."

The best part? This is applicable to both new and existing MaxisONE customers. During Maxis’   at 3pm today, CEO Morten Lundal and Consumer Business head Dushyan announced that the telco will be launching its upgraded plans later this month. The new plans will offer customers much higher data quotas at the same price. In Dushyan’s examples, plans that are currently offering 1GB (RM98/month) of quota will now offer 5GB of quota while plans that are offering 3GB (RM128/month) of quota will be upgraded to 8GB of quota. What’s more, all existing MaxisONE Plan customers will also be receiving these upgrades for free.

Check out the latest postpaid comparison  . Maxis has   to the recent   by upgrading all MaxisONE plans with up to 9GB of extra data. These new upgraded plans will be rolled out to all new and existing subscribers by the end of this month. While waiting for that to kick in, Maxis is giving 3GB extra data next week to all MaxisONE plan customers. So how does Maxis’ postpaid offering compare against the rest? It’s time for another round of postpaid comparison. 
 In our previous  , Maxis looked pretty costly with a paltry 1GB of data for its base RM98 plan. Now they have bumped up their data allocation from 1GB to 5GB, 3GB to 8GB, 5GB to 12GB and 7GB to 16GB. The monthly subscription fee remains unchanged except for  , where they are offering RM30 off each month and they are offering unlimited data usage between 1AM to 7AM daily.  
For Celcom, they have extended its FIRST postpaid offering until 31st May. To recap, FIRST Blue at RM45/month comes with 4GB of data (2GB all time + 2GB weekend), 50 minutes of calls and 50 SMS. For heavy duty users, FIRST Gold offers 10GB of data (5GB all time + 5GB weekend) plus unlimited calls and SMS for RM80/month.  Digi on the other hand revamped its   last month with more data and internet rollover. As a limited time promo, they are allocating more data for its higher “More Internet” plans and a RM20/month discount for its “More Talk” options of RM98 and above. Hitting the sweet spot for Digi is probably their Postpaid 98 (More Voice), as it offers 7GB of data and unlimited calls at RM78/month.    Over at team orange, U Mobile has recently boosted its P70 Hero Postpaid plan with a whopping 15GB data for RM70/month. This plan also comes with unlimited voice calls. Note that the extra 8GB is given as a promo until 30th June 2016. So how does it all stack up? Click on our comparison table below for a clearer view.  
It is commendable for Maxis to bump up more data for their plans but the pricing is still on the high side when compared to its competitors. If you’re looking solely at cost per GB, Celcom’s FIRST Gold is likely your top pick as it offers 10GB of data at RM80/month in addition to its unlimited calls and SMS. Both U Mobile and Digi are quite generous as well by offering more than 5GB of data for RM70 and under. If you can’t finish your data quota, Celcom and Digi lets you carry forward unused data (up to a certain limit) to the following month.  Beyond the cost of data, calls and SMS, there are other factors to consider such as network quality and customer service. Each telco will perform differently depending on location, so it is best to pick one that has optimal coverage for both home and work. You can use   to get a rough idea of which network performs better in your area. After all, what’s the use of getting lots of data if you can’t use them? For those that travel, another factor to consider is their international roaming packages. Most telcos these days do have daily roaming plans but they could vary in terms of price and countries supported. Most recently U Mobile has started offering   for selected countries while Maxis has thrown additional unlimited calls and SMS with  ."

It apparently doesn’t need as much skill to fly as a regular chopper and you don’t have to keep eyeballing the controls to keep it stable and airborne. Granted the manned test flight isn’t incredibly impressive, the semi-affordable-personal transport (or so as it is marketed) is capable of a top speed of 60MPH (about 96 KPH, still pretty fast) and its relatively quiet and fuel free.

To start off, Apple will be trying to make the next iPhone even thinner than the  , meaning they are aiming to make it way thinner than 7.1mm body of the iPhone 6s, possibly somewhere in the margin of 6 to 6.5mm. That’s already ridiculously thin but that would mean impacting the capacity of the battery. Though to be perfectly honest, we’re not expecting any change in terms of design, especially not after the release of the  .

So how exactly are they going to squeeze in a bigger battery when they’re trying to make the chassis thinner? Last but not least the iPhone 7 is rumoured to have a dual camera lens. The feature has been more or less “confirmed” by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo but its too early to say that if will be implemented.

Rory Lee,Huawei P9 is official — twin Leica lenses eyeing to be the world’s best,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/06/huawei-p9-is-official-twin-leica-lenses-eyeing-to-be-the-worlds-best/,"huawei,Huawei P9,Huawei P9 Launch,Huawei P9 official,Huawei P9 reveal","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-04-06,"After making its rounds in the rumour mill,   has finally unveiled the   and its bigger sibling, the P9 Plus. Touted to reinvent smartphone photography, the twin lenses mounted on the rear of the P9 and P9 Plus are designed to emulate the human eye. Sounds promising. But while it does have Leica certification, the camera maker’s role in the development of the P9’s cameras is a little vague. On the surface of things, Huawei’s P9 seems to keep up with the rest of the flagship smartphones that have come out this year. Dominating the front of the metal-bodied P9 is a 5.2-inch full-HD IPS display boasting a pixel density of 424ppi. Being powered by the Chinese company’s own Kirin 955 processor (four Cortex-A72 cores and four A53 cores) mated to 3GB/4GB of RAM on the inside, the P9 should be a monster when it comes to performance. It’s also got a modest 3,000 mAh battery to keep the smartphone going, along with a USB Type-C port located at the bottom of the device for charging and data transfer. Apparently, storage options will vary depending on the market. In Europe, the P9 will come with 32GB of internal storage but have an option for expansion via a microSD card slot. On the other hand, China’s P9 will receive the 64GB variant of the P9 but have its microSD card slot replaced by a second SIM slot. The P9 looks like a gorgeous smartphone with a premium build. It’s pretty amazing how they’ve managed to cram a rather sizable battery and two camera modules (no camera bump!) into a device that’s only 6.95mm thick. In terms of looks, it shares many similarities to the P8 that it succeeds, but the P9 seems to be more rounded and more comfortable to hold. The P9 Plus shares many of the P9’s specifications barring a few tweaks that give the device its name. Being the bigger of the duo, the P9 Plus will pack a 5.5-inch full-HD AMOLED panel on the front, instead of the IPS LCD display found on the regular P9, which should translate to better contrast and deeper blacks. Inside, it’s also powered by the Kirin 955 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (China is also getting a 128GB variant). The P9 Plus also gets a pressure sensitive display called Press Touch (much like one of last year’s Mate S variants) and an IR blaster. It’s also got a larger 3,400 mAh battery to power the larger screen. Both the P9 and P9 Plus will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Huawei’s EMUI 4.1 running on top. The duo will also sport Huawei’s rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which history tells us should be pretty stellar. The smartphones also share an 8-megapixel front camera with AF for selfies. Much of the hype built around the P9 duo comes from Huawei’s partnership with Leica. A team-up between the legendary camera maker and one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world is the stuff of dreams when it comes to advancing smartphone photography. But, it seems that the German camera-maker may not have had such a big hand in designing the P9’s snappers. On paper, the Huawei P9 and P9 Plus sport two 12-megapixel Sony IMX286 sensors on the back mated to a pair of Leica Summarit H 1:2.2/27 lenses (f/2.2 with a 27mm focal length). But, as The Verge reveals, there is slightly more to the cameras and Leica branding than meets the eye. The biggest hint is the fact that Huawei consistently claims that the P9’s dual cameras are “Leica certified”. Not Leica engineered or Leica developed, simply Lecia certified. According to The Verge, when they pushed Huawei to define what that meant, the Chinese company said that the cameras were developed through a “co-engineering process”, which is rather vague if you’d ask me. Could it just be Leica simply stamping its brand on a smartphone? That said, the P9’s primary cameras are pretty interesting. Of the two 12MP snappers, one of them is a monochrome module. Apparently, when the monochrome unit works together with the regular camera unit, the two sensors can improve contrast in photos by 50% while tripling the light information taken by the phone. This is due to the monochrome sensor’s ability to soak up more photos because of its lack of an RGB light filter that its colour sibling requires. How this actually translates into real-world photography remains to be seen, but I can tell you that I’m more than excited to test the cameras out. The P9 Plus is said to be available in May in both Asia and Europe while the smaller P9 will go on sale in both continents by the end of this month. The P9 will be priced at EUR599 (around RM2,660) for the 3GB RAM/32GB storage version while the 4GB RAM/64GB storage variant will go for EUR649 (around RM2,882). The P9 Plus, on the other hand, will set you back EUR749 (around RM3,330) for the 4GB RAM/64GB storage model. What do you guys think of this smartphone? Are you sold yet?"

In terms of aesthetics it pretty much looks similar to the HTC One A9  but with a dual speaker setup as well as a physical home button with a fingerprint sensor. As for the specs, the HTC 10 apparently will be host to a Snapdragon 820 chipset mated to 4GB RAM, a 5.2-inch QHD display (1440 x 2560) as well as a 5 megapixel front and 12 megapixel “Ultra Pixel” rear camera with laser autofocus. Both cameras will have optical image stabilization. Last but not least it will have a big 3,000 mAh battery as well as a USB Type C port. Like many of HTC’s devices we expect it to come in black (as pictured) gold and silver at the very least as they’ve stuck to those colour schemes for the vast majority of their flagships. We’ll find out more tomorrow at 8PM.

Rory Lee,This could be the best postpaid plan in town — RM80/month for unlimited everything,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/06/webe-unlimited-postpaid-plan/,"P1,packet one,Packet One networks,Telekom,TM,TM 4G LTE,Webe,Webe mobile operator","P1,P1,Players on the Field,TM",2016-04-06,"Many of you might not have heard of  , but after today’s set of events, they’re probably going to be on everyone’s lips. We have   in the past that Webe might become the next 4G LTE operator (under   and  ) and it looks like our suspicions might have just become reality. What’s more, it also seems that Webe might just have the best mobile 4G LTE plan yet. After some digging,   came across a staging site for the aforementioned Webe. This staging site not only reveals that Webe is going to begin operations as a 4G LTE operator, but also that they’re offering ridiculously good value plans. From the looks of things, Webe’s starter plan will offer consumers 20GB of data, 1,000 minutes of calls and 1,000 SMSes from only RM8 a month. Keep in mind that the RM8/month price tag is only available for existing P1 customers who choose to pick up a device plus the plan. If someone is an existing P1 customer that doesn’t want to pick up a plan, they would have to pay RM9. For non-P1 customers, you would have to pay RM10 for the plan instead. As peculiar as it sounds, Lowyat.net also discovered that if you wanted to enable tethering for your Webe data plan, you would have to add on an additional RM10. That brings the total up to RM20/month which is still a pretty smashing deal. But that’s not all. It also seems that Webe are looking to introduce an unlimited plan for RM80/month. And when they say unlimited, they truly mean unlimited as the page indicates that users who subscribe to this plan will get unlimited 4G Internet, unlimited calls and unlimited SMS. The plan also allows for shared lines (up to 3 lines) which could mean that up to four different lines sharing one unlimited quota. Comparatively, an existing RM80 plan like Celcom’s FIRST Gold plan only gives you 10GB of data (split between weekends and weekdays). However, as this is only a test page, we do urge you to take this with a grain of salt as its seems too good to be true. These numbers could only be placeholder figures and not reflect the final plan’s pricing. Either way, this is exciting stuff and we will find out the truth of them come the 13th of April when P1 finally unveils its  . What do you guys think of these plans?"

The list of data roaming countries at RM10/day is as follows.  Meanwhile, other 15 countries are also eligible for unlimited data roaming but at their usual RM36/day rate. Before you enable data roaming, you’re advised to connect to the right telco partners as listed on their website. The manual selection is required to avoid unnecessary bill shocks but from the FAQ, you will not be able to use mobile data if you’re connected to the wrong telco. If you haven’t activated international roaming, you may do so at your nearest U Mobile outlet or by calling in at 1318.  The daily roaming is calculated by the day beginning 12:00AM to 11:59PM local time according to the country’s capital city.

Rory Lee,These stunning images were taken with a smartphone.

I love images that can freeze a perfect moment in time or tell a story or are simply breathtakingly beautiful. This is why I love how far smartphone photography has come. A space that used to be dominated by people who had access to the right equipment is now almost a level playing field for anyone with the creativity and drive to shoot. Don’t believe me? Check these photos out. These images come courtesy of a group of   from across Europe who were each given a brand new   smartphone  and told to capture their city through the eyes of the P9. Huawei has made   about its Leica certified dual 12MP primary shooters mounted on the back of its P9, but we never really got to see how it would perform in the real world — until now, that is. As you’re browsing through these stunning images (click on each one to view a larger photo), do keep in mind that these photographs were taken by people who know what they’re doing. Still, as professional as these photographers might be, it’s pretty hard to ignore just how good the image quality is. The Huawei P9 utilises two Sony IMX286 sensors mounted side by side — one monochrome sensor and one colour sensor. Both sensors are paired with Leica Summarit H 1:2.2/27 lenses. The reason for the monochrome sensor is that it can absorb more light information for each photo. Working together, the two cameras can improve contrast in photos by about 50% while also supposedly giving the P9 the best black and white photos in the market. What do you guys think of the photos?"

In terms of the interface, app shares some similarities with the web version of YouTube Gaming. This is mostly a darker theme, with game-based navigation and a live tab plus new pages to manage your games and channels. 
 So you can use these tabs to scroll through your favourite channels or find new channels to watch based on which games they have in their playlists. You can even set it to display only the games you want to watch playthroughs for or check out channels that are currently streaming it live. However, the most important feature is probably the live-streaming capabilities of the app, as you can now record and live-stream mobile gameplay from you devices using Mobile Capture. No more wrangling weird capture cards just to record; hit the Go Live button, turn on your selfie cam and record commentary straight off your phone. This is great for devs of mobile games because before this it was a bit tougher to grab gameplay footage straight off phones, maybe we’ll be having more channels dedicated to mobile gaming now?"

In terms of raw on-paper specifications, it does have a pretty good shot at it too. Also known in some markets as the  , the F1 Plus is a significant bump up in terms of specifications and build compared to the F1. The phone it succeeds has a plasticky finish that felt good at first but loses its charm after some time. On the other hand, the F1 Plus is a completely different beast. Firstly, it’s got a gorgeous metal unibody that feels awesome with its rounded edges. It’s also got a larger and more crisp 5.5-inch full-HD AMOLED display which is a treat if you’re coming from the old F1’s 5-inch 720p panel. Inside, it’s also got a little more horsepower in the form of a MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core processor mated to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable internal storage. It also has a 2,850 mAh battery (with VOOC flash charge support) and comes running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with colorOS 3.0 running on top. To beef up security, the OPPO F1 Plus features a front-mounted fingerprint scanner that also doubles as a physical home button. The handset’s party piece, though, is its selfie camera. On the front, it’s got a massive 16-megapixel f/2.0 snapper which gives it its “Selfie Expert” title. That’s nearly double the megapixel count on most of the smartphone selfie cameras currently in the market. At the back, it gets a modest 13MP snapper with PDAF and an f/2.2 aperture lens. Despite the original title belonging to the F1, the smartphone didn’t really live up to its name. It’s 8-megapixel camera was decent, but it was nowhere near good enough to be called an “expert”. We all know that megapixel count isn’t the only think that makes a camera good, so while 16MP looks good on paper, it may not automatically translate into fantastic image quality. Whether this smartphone is fit to bear the “Selfie Expert” title will require a lot of testing and a whole lot of selfies. If you are interested in this sexy device from OPPO, the F1 Plus will be priced at RM1,898 and be available in all authorised OPPO retailers starting the 11th of April. You can secure your very own OPPO F1 Plus now, though, as OPPO have put the device up on both their   and  .

If a member doesn’t have encryption enabled, an open lock icon will appear and they would need to update WhatsApp to close the loop.  To verify if the encryption is valid with a specific individual, you can check the Security code by comparing the 60 digit code or by scanning the QR code. For group chats, you’ll get a lock icon if all members are compliant.  The folks at WhatsApp have a strong desire to protect personal privacy and they believe encryption is ultimately the key for the future of personal communication. Co-Founder Jan Koum also shared about life in the former USSR where people couldn’t speak freely under communist rule. Today WhatsApp assures that more than a billion of its users can talk freely and securely."
Rory Lee,The iPhone SE has the same display as the 5s according to iFixit’s teardown,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/01/the-iphone-se-has-the-same-display-as-the-5s-according-to-ifixits-teardown/,"apple,Apple iPhone,Apple iPhone SE,ifixit,iPhone,iPhone SE,iPhone SE teardown,iPhone SE teardown iFixit,smartphone teardown","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-04-01,"When a new phone comes out, the popular thing to do these days is to tear it down to find out exactly what’s inside these devices because clearly people want to know what they’ve spent their hard-earned money on. While Chipworks had their go at prying open the  , now it’s iFixit’s turn to have their way with  ‘s latest and what they reveal is actually rather interesting. It doesn’t take a genius to guess what smartphone the iPhone SE was based on, one look will tell you that it’s the spitting image of Apple’s older iPhone 5s. The question is, what’s new? Well, not the display apparently. In iFixit’s comprehensive teardown, one of the first things they noticed was that the iPhone SE had the exact same display as the older iPhone 5s. So similar, in fact, that they’re practically interchangeable. Yup, that means not only are the guides already available for those who want to DIY swap their broken iPhone SE displays for a new one, but you could theoretically use an old iPhone 5s’s panel too. The best part is that the display is plug and play between the two devices, so once you hook up the necessary connectors, the panel fires right up. Many have labeled the iPhone SE as an iPhone 5s stuffed full of iPhone 6s parts but that may not actually be entirely accurate. The 12-megapixel iSight camera, for example, may theoretically be the same as the one on the iPhone 6s, they’re not interchangeable. It is, however, quite different from the old iPhone 5s’s snapper (note the number of connectors) on the left, which is to be expected. You’d be happy to know that the iPhone SE also comes with a bigger 1,624 mAh battery, up from the iPhone 5s’s 1,560 mAh. Not a major upgrade, but coupled with improved battery optimisations, users should see an improvement in battery life over the iPhone 5s. Unfortunately, unlike the apparently interchangeable displays, the battery connectors on the iPhone SE differs from the 5s’s so no supercharging your old 5s. Another interesting thing that iFixit discovered was the waterproofing seals. Apple placed foamy silicone seals surrounding some but not all of the logic board connections. Curious. Wouldn’t Apple have wanted to maximise water protection throughout their device? I guess some corners had to be cut after all, but then again you shouldn’t be too disappointed as Apple   the iPhone SE as a waterproof device anyway. Be sure to check out iFixit’s   of the device if you want to learn more. What do you guys think of the iPhone SE’s internals? Is it worth the money?"

The new Mi 20,000mAh power bank is hitting their online store at only RM99 while its updated Mi Band Pulse with heart rate monitoring is going for just RM79. The largest Mi Power Bank packs fantastic value and it is only RM10 more than its current 16,000mAh Power Bank. It also gets 2x USB outputs pushing a combined 3.6A but it is lighter due to its polycarbonate construction instead of aluminium. On the plus side, the new power bank supports fast charging inputs supporting various chargers including 5V/2A, 9V/2A and 12V/1.5A. Xiaomi reckons that fast charging can replenish 11,000mAh in just 3 hours.

The next product is their latest Mi Band that comes with a heart rate sensor underneath. This not only tracks your activity and sleeping patterns but also monitors your heart rate in real time. The Mi Band Pulse uses a Mi Fit app and it syncs via Bluetooth. Apart from being an activity tracker, it also works for notifications and it can be a subtle vibrating alarm on your wrist.

Available for FIRST Gold customers in the Klang Valley only. The fixed fibre broadband scene is heating up as   joins the race with their Home Broadband service offering speeds of up to 10Mbps. According to Lowyat.net, the telco’s new plan would be called the Celcom Home Broadband and will offer speeds of 10Mbps for RM145/month (excl GST). If you’re a   subscriber, you will receive a 50% discount for the first six months of your Home Broadband subscription. That means you pay RM72.50/month (excl GST) for the first six months. Lowyat.net also claims that this plan is targetted towards Celcom subscribers, but made no mention on whether non-Celcom subscribers are eligible. For calls, the Celcom Home Broadband will charge users 8sen/min to all networks, while IDD calls will follow Celcom Postpaid’s IDD rates and will be charged in 30-second blocks. The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the plan: Lowyat.net’s information came from an anonymous source, so we thought we’d call Celcom up and see if we could verify it. According to the Celcom customer service representative, the telco did indeed “launch” their plan today which lends credence to Lowyat.net’s source. The customer service rep confirms all the plan details in the table above and that it is indeed available from today onwards, however, he did not have any information regarding the coverage area. That said, he did inform us that users who wished to sign up or find out if their area was covered could simply visit a Celcom Blue Cube for more information. We have a hunch that Celcom’s fibre service will be using  ‘s High-Speed Broadband infrastructure (like Maxis Fibre) due to an   between the parties. This means if your area is covered by UniFi, you will likely be able to get Celcom Home Broadband too. Although today was supposed to be the launch, there is still no information about this plan on the Celcom website. The Celcom customer service rep ensures that you will be able to get more information on their website soon. It is worth noting that this isn’t Celcom’s first stab at a fibre broadband as they did have a   back in 2012. Looking at the plan, we’re not terribly impressed by it. It’s fine if you’re a light user that only wants to spend the bare minimum on fibre Internet connectivity, but if you’re a moderate or heavy user, you’re better off topping up a little extra for about two or three times faster speeds on   or  . You could also add RM4 more and get  ‘s 100Mbps plan — if you can find yourself within their coverage area, but that’s only slightly less difficult than finding a unicorn. The way we see it, the most attractive thing about this plan is the fact that you can get 50% off for the first six months if you’re a Celcom FIRST Gold plan subscriber. Besides that, you’re probably better off with one of the new plans from the other fibre providers. Want more information on the new fibre plans from TIME, TM and Maxis? Check out our  . Want a laugh?

Now, it seems we do have some concrete evidence that the P9 would indeed sport the twin Leica lenses as was foretold. In previous leaks and iterations of the Huawei P9 — including those from serial leakster   — the smartphone was devoid of any branding, not even Huawei’s, which left many wondering about the validity of the Leica smartphone camera claims. In new pictures and renders by both   and  , the Huawei P9 is now proudly displaying it’s Leica branding. What’s a little disappointing to me though is that Leica didn’t go for the “red dot” branding, instead opting to just print their name on the back of the familiar P9. That said, the typeface used for the branding is consistent with those found on Leica’s own camera lenses so this lends some credibility to the images. From the pictures, the camera is bearing Leica’s Summarit badge with what looks like an aperture of f/2.2 and an equivalent focal length of 27mm. The lens array could also feature an aspherical element as denoted by the “ASPH” markings (though do correct me if I’m wrong). Besides the Leica glass, the Huawei P9 is rumoured to feature a dual camera setup on the back with each sensor featuring 12-megapixels. Said to be an evolution of the one on the  , the P9’s dual snappers should sport much of the features found on the 6 Plus including post-capture refocus and simulated aperture adjustments. This is exciting stuff. If I’m being honest, one of my biggest qualms with any of the Huawei devices I’ve used was the rather lackluster camera performance. Now with the German camera maker’s help, Huawei could very well have shored up one of their big weaknesses. Huawei’s P9 is set to be   on the 6th of April — and rumoured to come in   — so we’ll get confirmation of this and everything else then. For now, these are still just rumours so do take it with a grain of salt. What do you guys think of the P9? Would Leica glass be good enough to tempt you into picking one up?"

Maxis followed soon after. Now, it’s TM’s turn to round up the trifecta of new plans with their new UniFi Pro plan that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. As an early bird promo, TM is offering RM30/month off and you can start enjoying 100Mbps from as low as RM299/month with voice calls and IPTV bundled in. On the surface, it seems like a negligible difference compared to Maxis’ 100Mbps Home Fibre (RM330/month for MaxisONE postpaid customers) but if you take all the extras that come with your UniFi Pro plan into consideration, it offers much better value for your money. The base UniFi Pro plan is supposed to offer Internet speeds of up to 100Mbps plus a base HyppTV package (Aneka, Varnam or Ruby) for RM299/month (Normal: RM329). If you want the HyppTV Jumbo pack, you will have to top up an additional RM30, bringing the total to RM329 per month (Normal: RM359).  Besides that, the UniFi Pro plan looks to offer a free Voice Pack (worth RM20) which gives you 600 minutes of calls nationwide per month. If you exceed 600 minutes, you will be charged 10sen/min for calls to other fixed lines and mobile numbers but calls to TM fixed lines remain free. What’s more, you will also be able to stream HyppTV Everywhere on 2 devices, plus receive 500MB/day for TM WiFi. In addition to that, you will also have access to other UniFi perks like a free 12-month iflix subscription (worth RM96) and 3 months of Viu access. For Business users, the 100Mbps plan is offered at RM379/month (Normal: RM399) and it also comes with voice calls worth RM70. Any excess usage for fixed line numbers are still free but calls to mobile numbers are charged at 8 sen/minute.  To be fair, this UniFi Pro plan and Maxis’ MaxisONE Home 100Mbps plan, once again, doesn’t really compete with each other. The MaxisONE Home 100Mbps plan is only available in Maxis’ own areas of coverage (that is about 75,000 ports). These ports don’t overlap with UniFi’s own 1.89 million ports so the end result for the consumer is whether you have one or the other. Another difference is speed where TM offers 100Mbps for download and 50Mbps for upload. As usual, all subscription are tied with a 24-month contract.  If we were to take those factors out of the equation, the UniFi Pro plan is far better in terms of value-for-money as you’re getting high-speed Internet connectivity as well as a bunch of other goodies like IPTV and free streaming subscriptions. Another point against Maxis’ favour is that you have to be a MaxisONE Plan 158 and above subscriber to be eligible for the 100Mbps MaxisONE Home fibre Internet plan. If you were to factor that in with your monthly RM330, you’re paying RM488/month excluding GST."

That means, if you get the Broadband 145 with a MobiFi device, you will be paying a total of RM263 (RM155 upfront + RM108 device) for the MobiFi while the Broadband 185’s MobiFi device will set you back a total of RM203 (RM95 upfront + RM108 device) This means, if you’re a Digi Postpaid customer going for the Broadband 145 plan, it’s actually cheaper to buy the MobiFi device outright because you will only need to pay RM203 for it. Of course, the Broadband 145 and 185 plans will work with pretty much any mobile wireless device that is LTE-A capable, so you don’t have to splurge on Digi’s MobiFi if you already have one lying around, or can pick one up for cheaper. Digi’s Mobifi does boast Cat 6 LTE speeds with support for 802.11ac WiFi, though. Keep in mind that the 50GB and 100GB of Internet quota are split between anytime quota and off-peak quota. For the Broadband 145 plan, 20GB will be allocated as anytime quota while 30GB is filed under off-peak quota (2am-8am). Meanwhile, the Broadband 185 sees an Internet quota split of 30GB of anytime quota and 70GB of off-peak quota. Once the quota is depleted, Broadband 185 users will have their speeds throttled to 512kbps but can still continue using the plan, unlike the Broadband 145 plan that simply cuts off once your quota has been exhausted. LTE-Advanced works via Carrier Aggregation using both 1800MHz and 2600 MHz bands to give you more consistent high speeds. As of today, Digi claims that their LTE-A network is the widest in the country, covering 31% of the population. To enjoy LTE-A speeds, you will need to have a 4G SIM, at least a Cat 6 device and be within their coverage area. If you meet these three criteria, any Digi customer can enjoy 4G LTE-A speeds regardless of whether you’re on a postpaid, prepaid or broadband plan. Digi also demonstrated their 4G LTE-A capabilities, reaching speeds of 100Mbps in the Taman Bukit Jalil area. If you’d like to see a map of Digi’s LTE and LTE-A coverage, head on over to their  ."

However, at the end of last year, we reported that there would be a   entering the scene in 2016 and it seems this could be it. We received an email invitation from   regarding a “P1 secret” that was due to be unveiled on the 13th of April 2016. Now, what could it possibly be?  Well, from the looks of things, it certainly seems like they’re going to officially announce their mobile 4G service. Since  ‘s acquisition of P1 in 2014, TM has worked towards developing P1 into their mobile arm and mobility centre, initially eyeing a 2015 launch of their mobile services. That initial plan didn’t come to fruition but it looks like their revised schedule of a 2016 entry will. TM has said that their overall LTE network rollout, the core of which is being managed by P1, was proceeding as planned so being able to meet their revised target of a 2016 launch may not come as such a surprise. This isn’t TM’s first foray into LTE technology as they launched their very own 4G broadband-only service TMgo back in 2015 which runs on 850MHz. TMgo was designed to replace TM’s older Wireless Streamyx on CDMA. What does TM’s entry into the 4G operator industry mean for us as consumers? Well, many good things we hope. More competition is always welcomed because it keeps the other telcos on their toes. A firm monopoly on any industry hurts us, the consumers, the most because it means that we’re at the mercy of whoever holds all the cards in that particular industry. Competition, on the other hand, means that these companies have to keep their plans competitive and try to undercut or trump the competition to attract consumers. A good example of this can be seen in the recent . With TM’s entry, things will surely get more interesting for the current four-way horse race as TM will be bringing in all their expertise and experience that they’ve accrued over the years to shake up the scene. How effective will they be as a telco? I guess we’ll have to wait to find out."

It’s called S Bike which is a dedicated DND (Do not disturb) mode that manages your calls by priority. You can activate it with a provided NFC tag which you can stick on your bike or your helmet. Alternatively, you can activate this by switching to S Bike mode on the notification panel.  When there’s an incoming call, the caller will hear a prerecorded audio message to let them know that you’re on riding a bike. If it’s urgent, they can press “1” to continue and your phone will start to ring. For your safety, it will only let you pick up the call once you have stopped completely. Users of the S Bike will stand a chance to win special rewards from Samsung as an incentive to use it frequently.

Apart from their new  , Xiaomi Malaysia is bringing a couple of new accessories to our local market very soon. The first device as teased above is their new   that packs a huge 20,000mAh capacity.   The new   is huge on power but it is considerably light at 338 grams. As a comparison, their 16,000 mAh powerbank weighs 350 grams while two 10,000mAh power banks weigh 414 grams combined. For better grip, the body uses polycarbonate with a perforated texture. There are 2x USB outputs that push a maximum of 5.1V/3.6A combined. Replenishing this 20,000mAh brick is done quickly as it supports quick charge via 5V/2A, 9V/1.2A and 12V/1.5A. They reckon that you can charge up 11,000mAh in just 3 hours. In China, the 20,000mAh power bank is going for 149 CNY which is about RM90, but we reckon it will be priced higher when it gets here.  The 2nd device is their   which now comes with a heart rate sensor. It looks the same as before but you’ll find an optical sensor underneath. Like the current version, it also tracks your steps, sleeping pattern and you can also use it to unlock your Mi smartphone when you’re within range. It is also IP67 resistant and this could probably last up to 30 days depending on your usage. The new Mi Band is priced at 99CNY which is about RM60.  With the Redmi Note 3 going on sale next week on 6 April, we are guessing that these 2 new products could go on sale on the same day as well. The Redmi Note 3 is priced at RM749 for the 2GB RAM + 16GB storage model, while the higher spec 3GB RAM + 32GB storage version is going for RM849. We’ll let you know once we have more details."

But that’s not all, they’ve also released a budget device that is now the cheapest device in Malaysia with a fingerprint scanner. The highlight of DOOGEE’s launch has to be their Android flagship smartphone, the F7 Pro. On the front of the smartphone, you’ll find a 5.7-inch full-HD IGZO display that has slim bezels and is tucked under 2.5D glass for a more rounded finish. Encased in its metal is the world’s first deca-core processor — the MediaTek Helio X20 — mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. For photos, the F7 Pro gets a 21-megapixel Sony IMX230 sensor on the back with Phase Detection AF. Selfies are taken care of by a 13-megapixel front-facing snapper. Keeping the lights on is a generous 4,000 mAh battery that can be charged up via a USB Type-C port and the smartphone will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow. While this is DOOGEE’s flagship device, there was no mention of a price, but the company did say that the smartphone will go on sale sometime in Q2 of 2016. Having a phone with a big battery is like having big hands –some people like to tell everyone about it. If you’re this kind of person, then the DOOGEE T6 is the Android smartphone for you as it packs a massive 6,250 mAh battery. Everything else is a little underwhelming, however. On the front, it gets a 5.5-inch HD 720p display with a MediaTek MT6735 quad-core processor mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. For photos, it gets an 8-megapixel/2-megapixel camera combo. The smartphone will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop. The DOOGEE T6 is priced at RM599 and will come in Marble White and Titanium Grey. It will go on sale exclusively at   from today (31st March) onwards. Rounding up the smartphone launches is another budget friendly device — the Y200 — one of the cheapest smartphones with a fingerprint sensor in Malaysia. Coming in at RM699 it is a touch cheaper than the   and its fingerprint sensor is mounted on the front of the device, not the rear like both the Redmi Note 3 and the DOOGEE F7 Pro. In terms of specs, the Y200 gets a 5.5-inch HD 720p display and pretty much the same internals as the T6 above, except it has a 32GB of internal storage. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000 mAh battery while photos are taken care of by an 8MP/5MP camera combo. It will also come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Alongside its three smartphone reveals, DOOGEE also launched a pico projector called the Smart Cube P1 and a 3G smartwatch called the S1. The Smart Cube P1 is a funky little device that is a projector and a speaker unit rolled into a cube that can fit in the palm of your hand. The projector beam can shoot up to 3.3m to a width of 90 inches. As it has a built-in speaker, you can use it as a nifty portable media consumption device on-the-go. You won’t be getting super high-resolution projects, though, as it only projects at a resolution of 854×480 (WVGA). The Smart Cube P1 supports multiple devices with Air Play, DLNA, Miracast, Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity. The P1 offers a Texas Instrument DLP with 70 lumen/3W brightness, OSRAM LED and 30,000 hours of LED lifetime. Keeping everything running is a 4,800 mAh battery which can double as a powerbank with a 5V2A output. Priced at RM999, it isn’t a cheap device, but you do get a decent amount of features for it. The Smart Cube P1 will go on sale in Q3 of 2016. DOOGEE claims that their S1 smartwatch is a full-featured wearable and to a certain extent, it is. It’s compatible with Android and you can insert a 3G SIM card into the watch. Since it has a microphone and speaker, you can make and receive calls with the device. It’s also got a heart-rate monitor, a 5MP camera, a 1.54-inch IPS (240×240 pixel) screen and is IP67 water resistant."

Whether you’re travelling in an unfamiliar part of town, don’t want to worry about parking, or are just too tired to drive, Uber becomes your personal chauffeur. If you’ve been a little creative with your use of Uber, I’m sure you’ve probably discovered that you can have an Uber driver send stuff like a parcel or a birthday cake instead. Of course, this may come with complications as the Uber service isn’t exactly meant for stuff like this, but as there aren’t many services like that, many have had no choice but to use Uber. Well, that’s not the case anymore. Meet NeonRunner. Funky name aside, NeonRunner offers same-day delivery services for “almost anything that can fit in their waterproof 18″ x 18″ x 16″ insulated carrier box that is below 12kg”. That’s a pretty wide range of stuff, but you probably won’t be able to use them for furniture delivery. NeonRunner offers two separate services — the first being a buying service where they buy stuff and send it to you while the second is a delivery service where they pick up whatever package or parcel you have and sends it to your desired location. Within the delivery service, you also have the option to get NeonRunner to complete specific tasks for you like banking in a cheque or paying your bills. Requesting a delivery, purchase or task is fairly simple. Simply create/log in to your NeonRunner account and choose either BUY or DELIVER. Then, enter the location details, item descriptions (you can add a photo too) and contact information before hitting the “Request a runner button”. To the right of the order page you will see a floating window that gives you a total estimate fee to get the task, purchase or delivery done. In the fee breakdown, they charge an RM0.25/km Distance Fee plus a RM0.50/min Time Fee for both services. However, for the BUY service, NeonRunner charges you an RM5 + 3.5% of the purchased item Service Fee while the DELIVER option gets a flat RM3 Service Fee. This service is reminiscent of something like GoGet or MatDespatch, but the biggest difference is the method of payment. With GoGet, you will need to have cash ready when the delivery arrives while MatDespatch operates on a prepaid credit system. NeonRunner, on the other hand, is cashless (much like Uber). Simply input your card information and billing address and you’re good to go. Easy and hassle free, two things I believe are a necessity for people who require these services. Though, it is worth noting that the operation only runs from 10am to 10pm daily, so no midnight deliveries for you. NeonRunner also only operates within the Greater Kuala Lumper and Klang Valley area."

Plus, it had a metal unibody — with some models even sporting a sophisticated diamond etched design — which is very rare at that price point. Now, Xiaomi has upped the ante with the Redmi 3 Pro, bumping up the RAM to 3GB while doubling the expandable internal storage to 32GB. It’s also got a fingerprint scanner mounted on the back of the device — similar to the Redmi Note 3 — but that also means that it loses its diamond-etch pattern. Besides that, the phone keeps all of its other specs including a 13-megapixel PDAF camera with an f/2.0 aperture lens and a 5MP front facing snapper. The Redmi 3 Pro will also have dual-SIM and microSD support (up to 128GB) via a hybrid-SIM tray. Keeping the 5-inch HD screen lit is a massive 4,100 mAh battery that should easily last an entire day. The device will come running MIUI 7 out of the box and will go on sale in China starting 6th April 2016 at CNY899 (around RM551). For more information, check out the Redmi 3 Pro’s  ."
Rory Lee,Xiaomi’s smart rice cooker will cook your rice perfectly every single time,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/29/xiaomis-smart-rice-cooker-will-cook-your-rice-perfectly-every-single-time/,"connected rice cooker,Malaysia,smart rice cooker,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker,Xiaomi Rice cooker,Xiaomi smart rice cooker","Cool stuff,Others,Xiaomi",2016-03-29,"is more than just a smartphone manufacturer. They have a large catalogue products ranging from personal mobility scooters to air purifiers. Now, they’re adding a new product to their roster — a rice cooker. Together with the launch of Xiaomi’s new sub-brand, the Mi Ecosystem, the Chinese company has unveiled the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker. Now   how you name a rice cooker. Like its name suggests, the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker is a WiFi-enabled rice cooker that is designed specifically to cook your rice in the best way possible. According to Xiaomi, their rice cooker follows the three concepts applied by expensive Japanese rice cookers to cook rice perfectly: Pressure control, heating method and the cooker’s lining material. The Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker employs a magnetic relief valve to precisely control the pressure in the rice cooker while using an electromagnetic heating technology for higher thermal efficiency and to ensure even cooking of the rice. It also uses a grey cast iron that has undergone a 69-step process to maintain an even heating and ensure strong thermal performance during use. The cast iron pot is coated with PFA powder to ensure that your rice doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot. Perhaps the most amazing feature of the Xiaomi rice cooker is the fact that you can scan a pack of rice with the Mi Home app to identify the type of rice, brand and origin. Then, based on that, the rice cooker can adjust its heating methodology to best suit that brand of rice so that the end result is a perfectly cooked pot of rice. Users can also customise the cooking and have their own preset preferences to cook the rice. It currently supports over 200 brands of rice but this support will be expanded in the future. As a cherry on top of the proverbial cake, the Mi Home app also comes with recipes that you can cook using the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker like brown rice, crispy rice and even cakes."
Rory Lee,Samsung’s Galaxy J5 and J7 receive the upgrades they deserve,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/29/samsungs-galaxy-j5-and-j7-receive-the-upgrades-they-deserve/,"revealed,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy J,Samsung Galaxy J5,Samsung Galaxy J5 2016,Samsung Galaxy J7,Samsung Galaxy J7 2016","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-29,"has finally revealed their new   (2016) and   (2016) smartphones, fixing many of the issues we originally had with the devices. The duo got a bump in specs as well as a few nice new features. The Galaxy J5 was a rather underwhelming device from the get-go with a measly 1.5GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. With the Galaxy J5 (2016), Samsung has bumped the specs up by quite a bit. Now, it sports a larger 5.2-inch HD Super AMOLED panel on the front of the device with a 1.2GHz octa-core processor mated to 2GB OF RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Now with twice the storage, users start with 10.6GB of available storage compared to the old device’s 4.3GB of available storage. In the camera department, its got a 13MP f/1.9 primary camera mounted on the back plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie shooter with front-facing flash for those crucial low-light selfies. Keeping the lights on is a larger 3,100 mAh battery. Perched higher up the ladder is the bigger and more powerful Galaxy J7 (2016). Along with a larger 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel, the J7 (2016) also sports beefier internals with a 1.6GHz octa-core processor on the inside mated to 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. While the bump up in screen resolution to full-HD from the HD panel on the previous model is nice, the best part of this new model is the increased RAM — double that of the old J7’s 1.5GB. For photos, the Galaxy J7 (2016) sports the same optics as on the Galaxy J5 (2016) which should result in a similar photo-taking experience. Since it’s a bigger device, it also gets a bigger battery — rated at 3,300 mAh — which is also a bump up from the previous J7. The new Galaxy J duo also has support for microSD expansion (up to 128GB) and dual-SIM capabilities via a dedicated microSD card slot and dual-SIM slot. That means you don’t have to choose between 2 SIMs or 1 SIM and one microSD card. Besides that, these devices now have support for NFC which should mean pairing and mobile payments are now that much easier. They’ve also got a metal frame that should lend a more premium feel in your hand.   As a whole, the upgrades these devices received are definitely necessary as it helps them keep up with the other low-end good-value smartphones in the market. However, with this bump in specifications, it is likely that the duo will also be marketed at a higher price. These devices will soon see an official release in China, but there is currently no word on when the Galaxy J duo will see an international release or when they will arrive in Malaysia. With the upgraded specs on the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016), these entry-level Samsung devices actually have better internals than the South Korean company’s mid-range Galaxy A3 (2016) and Galaxy A5 (2016) smartphones. However, the Galaxy A series devices have a more premium build and finish (plus a fingerprint scanner on the A5) which does feel great in the hand. What do you think of these new Galaxy J devices?"

Rory Lee,5 things that you may not know were designed by Malaysians,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/5-things-that-you-may-not-know-were-designed-by-malaysians/,"intel,Intel Compute Stick,Intel IoT gateway,Intel Malaysia,Intel Malaysia Design Centre,Intel NUC board,Internet of Things,Malaysia,Malaysia Design centre,Malaysians,USB 1.0 microcontroller","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-03-28,"“Buatan Malaysia” often gets a bad rap even in our own country. But, the truth is, there are many Malaysians out there making some seriously awesome stuff. In tech, we’re making big strides too especially when it comes to major breakthroughs with one of the largest chipmakers in the world — Intel. Here are five awesome technological advancements Malaysians have made with the chipmaker that you probably didn’t know about. Intel has put a big emphasis on Asia to help drive its growth in recent years. They established their first facility outside of the United States   in 1972. However, as the years went by, Intel nearly shut the facility down in 1991 as the micro-controller business wasn’t profitable back then. That obviously would have put the engineers that worked there in a tough spot so rather than give up, the engineers proposed that Intel keeps the business running by adding value with design work. Since then, the relatively small team of 30 engineers has now grown to over 2,000 engineers all working under what has become the Malaysia Design Centre (MDC). This meant that Malaysia was no longer just a hub for the production of hardware, but also a contributor to the research and development of new products and technological innovations. Over the years, the MDC, working under Intel, has conceived many innovative breakthroughs in technological development but we’re here to tell you about the five biggest ones that have made a pretty significant impact on the world we live in right now. [ ] I’m sure you’ve seen this little guy making its rounds. If you haven’t, the Intel Compute Stick basically offers the full desktop experience of a computer, in something that looks like an oversized pen drive. It’s small and easy to carry around, plus the ease of being able to just plug it into any HDMI-enabled TV or display and turn it into a full-fledged PC makes it pretty nifty. Perfect for school and college use. [ ] As we develop towards the miniaturisation of the PC, Mini PCs become the next stepping stone to that of the full sized tower desktops. Stuff like the Remix Mini   are often enough for most people and their daily tasks. At the forefront of Mini PC development is Intel with its NUC (Next Unit of Computing) line of computers. These are basically computer kits that come with a custom Intel motherboard and an Intel CPU plus slots in which you can install RAM and a hard drive yourself. Super compact, totally upgradable, and designed by Malaysians. [ ] Intel’s Atom processors can be found in many netbooks, 2-in-1s and even smartphones. As a product line, the Atom processor is often associated with relatively inexpensive or portable netbooks and smart devices, but did you know that the first purpose built Low Cost Intel Architecture based System on a Chip design (codenamed Pineview Intel Atom) came out of the MDC team? Pineview processors cover the N4xx, D4xx, N5xx, and D5xx processors, all of which came with integrated graphics while boasting improved performance and a 20% drop in power consumption compared to previous generations. This particular design propelled the growth of lightweight, compact and affordable netbook market, netting seven world-class manufacturing records before it was even launched in 2009. With modern computers, simply plugging and playing your pen drives, mice and keyboards among other things into the desktop’s USB ports is practically a norm. It is this convenience and seamless peripheral connectivity that the Malaysian designed USB 1.0 micro-controller has made possible. No hassle, no fuss, just plug and play. The Internet of Things is a fascinating notion that is becoming more and more complete as each day passes. Smart TVs, smart fridges, smart air purifiers, all contribute to the connectivity of objects with each other. But what about legacy objects that were conceived and created before the IoT was a thing? Well, the MDC designed Intel IoT Gateway is one of these solutions that helps companies connect these legacy devices to the Internet. The device and sensor management application is an end-to-end IoT solution that has been successfully applied to smart agriculture systems and across a range of industries including hospitality, asset tracking and industrial automation. These are truly amazing things that this home-grown team of engineers have accomplished since their inception. So, as the MDC celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, let’s all take our hats off to these awesome technologies and the Malaysians behind their design."

Rory Lee,OPPO Malaysia CEO teases F1 Plus — looks exactly like the R9,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/oppo-malaysia-ceo-teases-f1-plus-looks-exactly-like-the-r9/,"Malaysia,Oppo,OPPO F1,OPPO F1 Plus,OPPO R9,OPPO R9 Plus,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo,Rumour Mill",2016-03-28,"has been known, especially with their recent smartphones, to stick to a similar design language when it comes to new devices. Just take a look at the   compared to the   series of smartphones — they’re nearly identical. However, the keyword here is “nearly”, as there are some noticeable physical features that separate the two smartphones. If we’re looking at the recent slew of photos shared by OPPO Malaysia CEO William Fang of the supposed  , the same distinction can’t be made because it looks   like the newly announced  . There’s no denying it, it’s identical from the rounded camera hump all the way to the front mounted fingerprint sensor. What’s peculiar here is that when the F1 Plus was   in Mumbai early this year, there was no mention of a fingerprint scanner at all. You would think that a fingerprint scanner on what should likely be a mid-range device to be a big deal, but there was no mention of it in the slides. It could then simply be a home button, but that seems unlikely. With smartphones that share a similar design, it isn’t too uncommon for companies to sometimes get them mixed up, so it is possible that William simply made a mistake. But, with each subsequent post, it seems more and more likely that this isn’t a mix-up and could indeed be the F1 Plus. If it isn’t a mix-up, what could it be then? Our guess is that the F1 Plus could be a rebranding of the R9. They line up in terms of specs with a 5.5-inch full HD display and 4GB of RAM, but we can’t say for certain as no further specifications have been revealed. Earlier, we reported that OPPO Malaysia was   the R9 to Malaysia a month after the device’s   on the 17th of March. However, with OPPO Malaysia’s latest teaser posted on their Facebook page, it seems more likely that the next device that they’re launching is the F1 Plus. So this opens up the question: Will the R9 be arriving in Malaysia as the F1 Plus? To us, the name doesn’t really matter as long as the device is solid. What do you guys think?"

As information about the device trickles out, rumours regarding the device also start to heat up and one of the more interesting ones is that there may be two processor variants of the HTC 10 — a Snapdragon 820 variant and one that’s powered by a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor. That’s a pretty shocking jump in processing power no matter how you spin it. Although manufacturers have been known to release lower-end versions of their flagship devices, these devices often featuring either lower-clocked processors or slightly less RAM. HTC, on the other hand, seems to have gone down an interesting path with its choice of smartphone variants opting for a completely different SoC. This is pretty similar to the rumoured LG G5 “Lite” which is also a Snapdragon 652-powered G5. The low-spec HTC 10 is said to pack 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage to go along with the new Snapdragon chip. That’s quite a limited amount of space for a device bearing the flagship name — especially in 2016. On the other hand, the Snapdragon 820-powered devices are said to be packing either 3GB of RAM plus 32GB of storage or 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. HTC’s 10 does seem to pack a punch though as recent AnTuTu benchmarks reveal a   of 156.091 which completely beats everything else in the market right now. Considering this incredible performance, HTC must have worked some magic on their device’s optimisation because a similarly spec-ed Xiaomi Mi 5 is only capable of scoring 142,000 points. With this optimisation, it begs the question of how well the Snapdragon 652 variant would fair. We certainly wouldn’t expect another record-breaking score, but it should be pretty interesting to see. What is a little troubling to see is the rumoured price that the HTC 10 is said to retail at. According to  , the Snapdragon 652 variant will be priced at CNY3,799 (around RM2,343) while the higher Snapdragon 820 variants will be priced at CNY4,999 (around RM3,083) and CNY5,888 (around RM3,631). Other specifications rumoured for the HTC 10 are a 5.1-inch Quad HD   display, a   camera, a large 3,000 mAh battery and a new kind of   audio experience. How many variants HTC will really launch and what will be powering each device still remains unconfirmed so take it with a grain of salt. The good news is that the wait won’t be much longer as all will be   on 12th April 2016."

Rory Lee,Compared: Fibre broadband services in Malaysia — TM vs TIME vs Maxis vs Celcom,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/compared-fibre-broadband-services-in-malaysia-tm-vs-time-vs-maxis/,"best fibre broadband malaysia,fibre broadband comparison,Fibre broadband comparison Malaysia,Malaysia,Maxis,Maxis fibre comparison,Maxis MaxisONE Home fibre,TIME,Time Fibre,TIME fibre comparison,TM,TM Unifi,TM UniFi comparison","Industry in General,Maxis,Players on the Field,Time,TM,UniFi",2016-03-28,"We’ve updated the comparison to include TM’s new  .  Celcom’s Home Broadband joins the fray. After the initial  , it seems the battle has spilt over into the realm of fixed broadband services as the big-three fibre broadband service providers in Malaysia clash. The question is, which one is the best for you? Don’t worry because, as usual, we’ve got you covered. 
 We saw strong offerings from the four major players in the fibre broadband industry, but as with most plans, there are pros and cons to each plan. Let’s dive into each one and see if we can find which is the best. TM kicked things off by upping their UniFi game to the current   which offers 30Mbps download speeds for RM179. If you desire more speed, you can opt for the upgrade to 50Mbps for RM50 extra. TM also have a new UniFi Pro plan that offers speeds up to 100Mbps. Much like the original VIP UniFi plans, you will also get a free HyppTV subscription though only for the base channels. If you’re a big TV or movie buff, TM’s UniFi also offers a 1-year free subscription to local streaming service iflix worth RM96. With iflix, you get access to a moderately large catalogue of old and some relatively new shows that you can binge, including exclusives like Mr Robot. Opting for the UniFi Pro plan gives you additional benefits on top of those that you get with the UniFi Advance plans. Firstly, the UniFi Pro plan comes with a free Voice Call voice bundle (worth RM20) that gives you 600 mins of calls, beyond which you will be charged 10sen/min to mobile and other fixed lines (calls to TM fixed lines remain free). You also get a free 3-month access pass to Viu — a streaming site that offers Korean dramas, varriety shows and other asian programs. There is a caveat, however. With UniFi Advance and Pro, your download and upload speeds are not symmetrical, meaning for the base RM179 plan, you will be getting 30Mbps download speeds but only 10Mbps upload speeds. The same goes for the 50Mbps which have its upload speed limited to 20Mbps and the 100Mbps Pro plan which has it’s upload speeds limited to 50Mbps. Do keep in mind that these prices for the UniFi Advance and Pro plans are still under a promo price (original prices: RM199 (30Mbps), RM249 (50Mbps), RM329 (100Mbps) so the original prices are a tad higher. While TM has extended the promotional period for the UniFi Advance plans in the past, it remains unclear if they will do so for the “early bird promo” price for the UniFi Pro plan. , on the other hand, released their   of broadband services with symmetrical speeds of up to 500Mbps for RM299. If you don’t want to pay the premium for 500Mbps, they also have lower tier plans rated at 100Mbps and 300Mbps that costs RM149 and RM189 respectively. With TIME, you don’t get many luxuries in terms of add-ons, just raw Internet speed. In this aspect, TIME is unmatched by the other local fibre broadband operators, but, they have their hands tied when it comes to coverage as TIME’s services only extend to 250,000 ports nationwide. Most of TIME’s ports can be found in apartments and condos so if you’re living on a landed property, odds are, you won’t be able to subscribe to TIME.  are notorious for not participating in price wars, instead, opting to improve customer service and reliability. With that in mind, Maxis launched their latest   broadband plans which focus on customer service and installation experience. What they’ve come up with is the Maxperts which, in their own words. are a “SWAT-like team of Internet experts” who specialise in optimising your Internet connection. We can see how this is useful for those who are less than tech-savvy, but if you are anything like us, the services these Maxperts provide become much less valuable as you could probably do the optimising yourself. In true Maxis fashion, their fibre plans are the most expensive in this comparison. For the base 20Mbps plan, Maxis are charging RM170/month while the 30Mbps plan is going for RM220/month. You will also have to be subscribed to a MaxisONE Plan (excluding the MaxisONE Plan Lite) before you are eligible to subscribe to the MaxisONE Home. To make matters worse, the prices mentioned above are after a special promo discount for MaxisONE Plan 128 and above customers. That means, if you’re a MaxisONE Plan 98 subscriber, you will still have to pay the full price of RM198 for 20Mbps, RM270 for 30Mbps and RM398 for 100Mbps. Speaking of the 100Mbps plan, this plan is only available within Maxis’ own area of coverage (which reaches 75,000 ports) and does not extend to the ports they share with TM. Besides that, you will have to be a MaxisONE Plan 158, 188, MaxisONE Business and MaxisONE Business Extra to be eligible for the RM330/month price. Celcom became the latest player to join the recent home fibre network race when they released their Home Broadband service. After their earlier agreement with TM, Celcom can now utilise TM’s HSBB network to provide home fibre broadband plans to their customers. Their plan offers a speed of 10Mbps for RM145/month. The caveat is that this plan is only available for Celcom FIRST Gold subscribers in the Klang Valley area. That said, the plan itself isn’t that attractive. If you’re only interested in paying the bare minimum for fibre Internet connectivity and are a Celcom FIRST Gold subscriber, then perhaps this plan could be for you. Celcom are also offering a 50% discount for the first six months of your Home Broadband subscription so that could be quite attractive for the user on a budget. However, if you’re a moderate or above user, you’d be better off topping up a little bit extra for two or three times faster speeds with Maxis Fibre or UniFi. You could also just top up RM4 for 100Mbps if you happen to find yourself within TIME’s coverage area. In all honesty, these four companies aren’t exactly direct competitors because (especially in the case of TIME) you either have one or the other. Besides Maxis, Celcom and TM, these services rarely overlap. That said, it is worth taking a look at who can provide the most well-rounded package out there. If it was up to me and I could choose between these three services, I would pick TIME. I’m a heavy Internet user so all I care about is Internet speed and stability — I don’t need all the extra goodies like IPTV bundles and calls or streaming subscriptions. But, I’m willing to bet that not many share my usage habits. So, if I were to consider the average household — including family members, guests, children, etc. — TM’s UniFi Advance and Pro plans provide the most well-rounded fibre experience. They’ve got free iflix (which my mum loves to watch old movies on), clear free-to-air TV channels (which my dad loves), and a fast enough download speed + low latency for my gaming needs. A decent compromise that will probably tick the most boxes for the average family. Which plan would you pick?"

The Galaxy S7 edge is tied with 24 months contract of Super 168 postpaid plan   at RM168/month subscription fee. The plan gives you 2,000 minutes of calls and 2,000 SMS (within Yes network via Yes Life app) plus 20GB of internet each month.  In addition, you’ll also get the Huddle XS MiFi device worth RM509 for free and an extra 32GB memory card but there’s no mention what type it is.

So that’s a total of RM2,687 you’ll need to fork out before 6% GST.  : The RM88/month subscription fee isn’t a promo. It is the price (before GST) after deducting the monthly RM1,888 rebate. In total, you will be paying RM168 for 24 months (excluding GST), which comes up to RM4,032 overall just for subscription fees. RM168 for 20GB is quite expensive considering they are currently offering   on a shorter 12-month contract."

However, thanks to a reliable source, Zinggadget got hold of the official price for the new handset, and perhaps to nobody’s surprise, the device is priced below RM1,000. The media were given a briefing last Thursday (24th March) regarding the device, as well as given some time with the smartphone, but the details for the pricing as well as which variant of the smartphone Xiaomi were bringing into Malaysia were not revealed. Instead, we were told to hang on to our hats and wait for the official launch to find out. But, in what looks like a dinner of some sort for the potential resellers of the Redmi Note 3, a slide containing the price and a fact sheet for the Malaysian Redmi Note 3 model were leaked. Based on the images posted by  , Xiaomi is bringing in the version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable (up to 32GB via microSD) storage. What’s more, the device looks to be priced at RM849, placing it right in the crosshairs of the honor 5X. Other specifications include a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display on the front, with a Snapdragon 650 hexa-core processor running on the inside. For optics, the smartphone gets 16-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with PDAF plus a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. Encasing the respectable internals is a full-metal unibody — the first for a Xiaomi device. It’s also sporting Xiaomi’s first ever rear-mounted fingerprint sensor placed right below the camera, as well as a large 4,050 mAh battery. It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box and yes, this time there might actually be a retail box. In case you didn’t pick up on it earlier, the images look to have come from a retailer’s dinner hosted by Xiaomi which means that they might actually be using physical retail stores to sell their smartphone too — not just online. Besides that, if you look at the bottom right of the spec-sheet image, you’ll see Thorus Technology listed as an authorised reseller. This is pretty rare for the Chinese company but we believe it could be because the Online market has reached its peak and Xiaomi has hit their saturation point for online sales. Even in China, Xiaomi is working with big retail brands to sell their devices on the shelf so it might not be surprising if they decided to do so here as well.

Alexander Wong,Maxis is the leading mobile network in Malaysia according to OpenSignal’s report,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/25/maxis-is-the-leading-mobile-network-in-malaysia-according-to-opensignal/,"4G LTE,4G LTE Malaysia,Celcom,Celcom 4G,DiGi,DiGi 4G,Malaysia 4G LTE,Maxis,Maxis 4G,Maxis 4G coverage,Open Signal,OpenSignal,U Mobile,U Mobile 4G","Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-03-25,"Postpaid plans in Malaysia are   with competitive telcos dishing out more data for your money. Apart from cost, another crucial factor to consider is network quality. What’s the point of getting loads of data on the cheap if you can’t use it when you needed it the most? 4G LTE was introduced in Malaysia back in 2013 and currently we have 4 major LTE telcos – Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. To find out which network is best, OpenSignal has just published a State of Mobile Networks report specifically for Malaysia. The findings were derived from a data sample size of close to 40 million that were contributed by 21,109 OpenSignal app users in Malaysia between 1 December 2015 to 29 February 2016.  According to OpenSignal, Maxis gets their top pick for having the best 4G coverage and best speed in Malaysia. From their report over a 3 month period, Maxis users are connected to 4G LTE 70% of the time. Since Maxis customers are having 4G more frequently, this also brings up the overall network speed to first place with an average of 5.20Mbps. For 4G specifically, Maxis delivers an average speed of 13Mbps. Out of the 4 telcos, Celcom is ranked the worst due to lower network speeds and higher latency on both 3G and 4G. They noted that Celcom’s performance was better around the Klang Valley area. When compared to the global average, Malaysia’s 4G LTE speed is quite close to the standard average of 13.5Mbps.   To measure 4G coverage, OpenSignal uses the time coverage methodology which calculates the proportion of time a user is connected on 4G. This gives a better measurement especially when you could be getting just 3G indoors while being in a 4G covered area.  As seen on the chart above, Maxis leads at first place at 69.98% followed by Digi at 57.60%. Celcom takes third place at 52.94%, while U Mobile is last at 44.23%. U Mobile obviously takes a beating here as it relies on Maxis for 2G/3G coverage where their network is not available.  When looking at speed, U Mobile is the fastest in both 3G and 4G specifically. However, it takes 2nd place overall as most of it users are connected to 3G most of the time. Despite that, it is worth noting that U Mobile is faster overall than Digi and Celcom which has more 4G LTE sites in comparison.  Celcom, unfortunately, ranks the slowest among the four in any given scenario.  Maxis and U Mobile are the top picks for 3G with a latency of less than 105ms. Meanwhile for 4G, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile have a 3-way draw with less than 56ms. The lower the latency indicates a more responsive network and unfortunately, Celcom trails behind for both 3G and 4G segments.  To conclude, OpenSignal’s latest report ranks Maxis as the better network for overall 4G LTE availability, speeds and latency. This is contrary to what   their website earlier on.  For this year, we can expect our telcos to push for more 4G coverage aggressively particularly Maxis and Digi. Both telcos will be refarming their 2G 1800MHz spectrum for 4G use. On top of that, both are also pushing for more LTE-A sites which provide even faster speeds with carrier aggregation.  If OpenSignal’s report is an accurate indicator, Celcom has a lot of room to improve. With its value-for-money FIRST postpaid plans, the blue telco has the pulling power to draw other subscribers to their fold. To expand and to upgrade a 4G network is a costly affair. There are concerns whether affordable plans with loads of data can sustain telcos in the long run. If you haven’t seen it yet, you can check out our   post.

It’s a sweet spot if you think about it. With how good cheap phones are getting and how cheap good phones have become, smartphones that hover around this price range can be absolutely great value for money.

Granted, most of them can’t permanently replace a dedicated laptop or computer, but they’re good enough for work that you can leave your heavy laptop at home and bring a space-aged tablet hybrid around with you. HP’s Pavilion x2 is one that fits into that hybrid laptop category and I quite like it despite some of its obvious drawbacks. There’s no denying that it’s a handsome device. Closed or open, it will look good on any dream desk as it looks very modern and fairly premium despite its plastic construction. That said, you should be extra careful with the white version because that picks up quite a bit of dirt over time. You can tell that thought was put into the construction of the device when you look at the hinge. When the device is open, the screen rolls out and elevates the keyboard, giving you better ergonomics than a flat keyboard. Plus, the magnets holding the tablet to the keyboard are quite strong, letting you lift the device without worry of either part coming off. Since we’re on the topic of the keyboard, it does give a nice typing experience. For something so small and compact, the keys are well spaced and give great travel when typing. I had no problems typing on it for a full day despite coming from a mechanical keyboard."

It’s something you can do on most navigation applications and it allows you to have quick access to your favourite destinations. In a recent update,   added a little feature that’ll add some pizzazz to your navigation experience. Google Maps now lets you put stickers on your Work and Home saved locations. These stickers range from igloos to barn houses so if you’re bored of what your current house looks like, at least, you can now change what you see on your navigation app. This is a cute personalisation gesture that I will surely mess around with at least for awhile, but pretty stickers aren’t the only thing Google added to their navigation app. Maps now also lets you add labels to your favourite destinations like the gym, school or underground bowling alley that you frequent. Again, this gives you a degree of personalisation and customisation on the experience you want to have when navigating with the app, rather than actually functionality. This is because you can simply save a location by tapping the “Save” button with the golden star and it will turn up in “Your places” when you pull out the hamburger menu. I suppose the biggest benefit is if you give a place with a complicated name a simple nickname or code via the label. All you have to do then is type label or nickname into the app’s search bar (for example, AMPM Cafe is labelled Mmm Yummy in my Maps) and the location will appear at the top of the search results. Pretty nifty quality of life changes, but nothing too radical from what we can tell. Well, except the fact that you can change your house into a flippin’ dragon whenever you want to and that’s pretty awesome if you ask me."

How else do they get away with selling everything they do as a reinvention of technology? It’s as uncanny as it is amazing and while you either hate Apple or love them, you can’t help but admire how well they get people to eat out of their hands. Take their latest device, the  , for instance. When Cupertino revealed it, I was blown away because it was the single most brilliant but dumb thing they’ve done. Apple’s March 2016 Keynote special event was by no means a large event, in fact, it was almost intimate as far as mobile launches go. Many, including us, weren’t expecting too much from them because they don’t usually make big announcements this early in the year. However, we were still holding out hope for some other kind of mobile accessory like a reinvented pair of VR goggles or a completely innovative 360-camera. Instead, what we got was a hint that Apple may be losing grip on their “world-changing” ways. All that the most valuable brand in the world had to show for their March Keynote was a  , an even   trapped in a body of a three-year-old smartphone and some  . Has one of the largest tech companies in the world nothing else to show at an internationally broadcasted event but a “new” iPad and iPhone? It honestly looked a little like Apple were shaken by how good their competitors have gotten and simply told   to throw something together out of spare parts. They could have done something as simple as tweak the design of the iPhone SE and it would have made all the difference. Instead, the only way you can tell the iPhone SE apart from the three-year-old 5s is that it weighs 1g more and comes in rose gold. It seems that Apple is resorting to rehashing an old device just to keep up with the competition. Of course, you could argue: Why fix something that isn’t broken? But that’s not what Apple does. Apple prides themselves with breaking the mould and not only improving existing tech but also “reinventing” it. With the iPhone SE, Apple had instead shown that even they can’t keep innovating. I say this because none of that matters. The main point of the iPhone SE is that now more people can buy iPhones. With the iPhone SE, not only are loyal customers who have previously hung on to old 4-inch iPhones going to have a viable upgrade, it’s also cheap. Well, cheap by Apple’s standards. But if you want an iPhone, Apple’s standards are the only standards you need to live by. So, instead of looking at a rehashed smartphone, people see an affordable and small iPhone with flagship-level performance. It doesn’t matter that it looks exactly like the iPhone 5s, or that it’s probably made using the same stuff. Nor does it matter that Apple had the audacity to put a rudimentary 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera on a 2016 smartphone that costs nearly RM2,000. What matters is that Apple found a need for a small, powerful yet affordable iPhone and are now owning that need."
Rory Lee,Fitbit Blaze and Alta have hit local shores,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/22/fitbit-blaze-and-alta-have-hit-local-shores/,"FitBit,Fitbit Alta,Fitbit Alta Malaysia,Fitbit blaze,Fitbit Blaze Malaysia,FitBit malaysia,Fitness tracker Malaysia,Harvey Norman","Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Smart Watch",2016-03-22,"has made waves in the smartwatch industry despite not being technically a smartwatch. While their wearables have not been the prettiest of devices, they’ve always offered a pretty reasonable set of functions for the price. Early this year, Fitbit was determined to shore up that weakness too, launching the   and the   — both of which look pretty good on anyone’s wrist. Now, sticking to initial launch plans, these two wearables have finally hit our shelves. What sets the Blaze apart from the highest end  ? Well, for starters, it looks a whole lot better if you ask me. It has a much sleeker and classier look to it compared to the chunky Surge, which means that it’ll go well with almost every occasion. It’s also got a colour LED touch screen — a first for the wearable maker. It also pushes notifications like call, text and calendar alerts to your wrist from your smartphone. You can also control music playback and is also sweat and water resistant though no IP rating is given. What’s more, it’ll feature Fitbit’s SmartTrack which automatically recognises and records exercises for you. You can also pop out the head and swap it with another strap if elastomer is not your thing. However, it does lack one big feature from the Surge that fitness enthusiasts will undoubtedly miss — built-in GPS. Fitbit says it has “connected GPS” but that’s just a fancy term for saying “you need your smartphone to track distance and route”. Boo. Still, that has allowed Fitbit to keep the battery life on this device to 5 days but is admittedly shorter than the 7-day Surge battery life. Nevertheless, Fitbit is also placing it at a lower price point in their food chain, with the Blaze   RM950 (incl GST) — comes in Black and Plum colours — meaning that the Fitbit Surge still sits on top as the apex predator. As far as bands go, here’s the full catalogue on Harvey Norman: The Alta is two down from the Blaze in terms of its position in the Fitbit family, slotting in right between the   and the  . As a result, it has much less functionality but gets many of the core features right. It’ll track your activity all day, remind you to move and automatically records your activities via SmartTrack. It’ll also track your sleep and double as a clock plus push notifications like call, text and calendar alerts (something the Charge HR doesn’t do). However, it does lack an altimeter and a heart-rate sensor, but there’s really only so much you can cram into such a small form-factor. It looks pretty sleek and stylish which means that this little wristband-like smart wearable should fit in any occasion.

It is a brand new model and it doesn’t even have a number on it. In the past, the cheapest iPhone you can buy is basically a rehash of an outdated model with a smaller storage option. We’ve seen this since the  /  days. That’s no longer the case with the iPhone SE. It is Apple’s most affordable new iPhone and it’s just as powerful as their current flagship. Smartphones these days are getting bigger and we’ve seen how Apple has succumbed to this trend when they introduced a larger 4.7” iPhone 6 and a phablet-sized 5.5″ Plus model. Of course not everybody wants a bigger phone. In 2015, Apple is still   over 30 million iPhones with a 4” screen which included the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. Well, it isn’t a huge chunk considering that’s only 13% of its total 231.5 million iPhones sold, but nevertheless it is still quite a significant number. Remember the ad above? It is still relevant today and there are people who are   to their old iPhone 5/5S because of the size. Try tapping the “back” button on the larger iPhones and you’ll get what I mean. The iPhone SE looks exactly like an iPhone 5S and you can even have it in Rose Gold. Underneath that familiar 4” 1136×640 Retina display, the iPhone SE is just as good as the current iPhone 6s. In fact, they are calling it the most powerful 4-incher yet. It gets the same top notch iPhone 6s performance with a 64-bit A9 chip and it also packs the same 12MP iSight camera with dual-tone LED flash, Live Photos and it also shoot videos in 4K. Over at the front, it settles for the same old 1.2MP camera as the iPhone 6/5S but it supports Retina Flash for brighter selfies. Connectivity wise, the iPhone SE will work with a wider range of LTE networks and it also comes with NFC support for Apple Pay. Our fluctuating exchange rates have made Apple products ridiculously expensive in Malaysia. You would have to fork out more than RM3,000 for the latest iPhone and that’s for the pathetic 16GB model. The iPhone SE is probably the best alternative for Apple to reach out to the mid-range segment. It packs flagship hardware at Apple’s “entry-level” price range. Make no mistake, Apple isn’t doing a Xiaomi but it is pretty much like how Sony does their Xperia Z compact line. In fact, there are rumours suggesting that Samsung will counter the SE with a compact Galaxy S7. The iPhone SE is very likely to be priced from under RM2,000 when it gets to Malaysia. This enables those on a budget to enjoy the very latest hardware from Apple. In Singapore, the iPhone SE 16GB is   at S$658 (RM1,954), which is lower than the iPhone 5S 16GB at S$728 (RM2,162). It is also the same in  , with the iPhone SE 16GB priced at A$679 (RM2,083) versus the iPhone 5S 16GB at A$749 (RM2,298). Before the iPhone 5S was removed from the Malaysian online store, the 16GB model is going for RM2,199 while the 32GB version is priced at RM2,499. The above table is our iPhone SE price estimate which shouldn’t stray too far from our southern neighbour. Let’s hope our RM doesn’t slide further against the US Dollar. Pre-orders are starting this week in first wave countries and the iPhone SE should reach Malaysia latest by end of May 2016. If you’ve been eyeing for an iPhone 6 16GB, forget that and get the iPhone SE 64GB instead. Yes, it is a smaller phone but you get better specs, better camera and most importantly 4X the storage. Trust us, you definitely need more than 16GB on an iPhone."

The Taiwanese company is in a tough spot and it looks like a lot of whether they will sink or swim is riding on their upcoming flagship device. We’ve seen some spec leaks and rumours in the past and now thanks to everyone’s favourite leakster we have even more information on the 10’s display — it’s LCD. In the past, rumours have pointed towards the HTC 10 featuring a 5.1-inch quad-HD panel mounted on the front and according to  , that panel will be Super LCD 5 instead of an AMOLED panel like the one on the One A9. Super LCD 5 is a variant of the LCD display that has no air gap between the outer glass and the actual display component. This is done to reduce glare and increase visibility. It is also supposed to be more frugal with power consumption. Speaking of power consumption, @evleaks has also revealed that the HTC 10 would have a large (for HTC’s standards) 3,000 mAh battery juicing up the device. Battery capacities upwards of 3,000 mAh is a rare sight on HTC devices, so this is definitely a welcomed addition if it proves true. On the inside, the 10 supposed to pack a powerful Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It’s also said to feature a front-facing fingerprint scanner and home button combo along with 2 capacitive buttons. Unfortunately, it looks like HTC have done away with one of their flagships biggest features — the BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers. A bummer, but at least it’s said to get a USB Type-C port with support for quick-charging. The HTC 10 has a lot to prove if it’s going to save HTC from the downward spiral that it’s caught in. Previous smartphone flagships have promised much but faltered in the delivery, especially when it came to optics. HTC are making similar promises with the 10, previously boasting “ ” cameras on both the front and back of the device. This time, the stakes are a little different though as the HTC 10 would actually have to make good on that promise if HTC wants to keep from sinking.

If you’re planning to get one on contract, it is also available from the big 4 telcos ( ,  ,   and  ) in Malaysia. So which offers the better deal? And should you also consider getting one with the Maxis Zerolution or Celcom NewPhone program?  We’ve crunched the numbers, so read on for our Galaxy S7 edge price plan comparison. 
 Across the board, all telcos are offering 24-month contracts for the Galaxy S7 edge. The only exception is Celcom, with a shorter 12-month option for its higher FIRST Gold plan. With the ongoing postpaid price war, Celcom is the most competitive of the lot. Celcom’s FIRST Blue postpaid comes with 4GB of data at RM45/month, while the FIRST Gold plan packs 10GB for only RM80/month. For Digi, they are offering the Galaxy S7 edge with their new Postpaid plans that come in either More Internet or More Voice and SMS. The new plan offers RM20 off for those who sign up with their Postpaid 98, 148 and 238 (More Talk and SMS) plans before 30th June 2016. However, this offer isn’t applicable with the Galaxy S7 edge bundle. Fortunately, they are still giving extra 2GB data quota for its More Internet option.  During registration, Digi also requires you to pay 1-month advance subscription on top of the device upfront payment. Alternatively, you can sign up for a 0% EPP via credit card to pay no cash upfront during registration.  Maxis is still the most expensive option for postpaid contract. The entry level MaxisONE Plan 98 offers unlimited calls and SMS but it comes with just 1GB of data. It simply pales in comparison to Digi and Celcom that offers 10X more data for less. On the highest MaxisONE Plan 188, they are giving 1GB extra data for the first 6 months.  U Mobile did stir up the competition with its Hero Postpaid plan. Unfortunately, you can only get the Galaxy S7 edge with their Ultimate Device Plan. The plan isn’t as value-for-money compared to Hero Postpaid but you do get a decent device subsidy as the S7 edge is being offered from as low as RM1,799. The upfront payment can be waived if you pay for the device via credit card and opt in for their auto debit billing service. Instead of getting the Galaxy S7 on Ultimate Device Plan 135, we think it is more worth it to buy the Galaxy S7 edge outright and sign on with their P70 Hero Plan. This comes out to RM4,779 (before GST) for a 24-month subscription (RM1,680) and the device (RM3,099). Are you the type that loves to switch phones every year? You might want to consider Maxis’ Zerolution or Celcom’s NewPhone. Both lets you own the device with monthly instalments and the option to swap to a newer phone every 12 months.  
 
 For the phone swap to work, you are required to return your existing device in pristine condition. So to avoid any possible penalties, the device protection program not only gives you a better peace of mind, but also ensures a seamless upgrade when the time comes.  For Maxis, Zerolution lets you pick up a device with no upfront payment plus you have the freedom to opt out from the Zerolution upgrade. For example, if you do plan to keep the device, you can choose not to pay RM30/month for the Zerolution upgrade fee. On the downside, Zerolution is only available on its MaxisONE Plans which is quite costly.  On Celcom’s NewPhone program, you have the flexibility to go with any Celcom postpaid plan of your choice including its affordable FIRST Blue postpaid plan. Unlike Maxis, you’re required to pay an upfront payment according to the plan (e.g. FIRST Blue – RM150, FIRST Gold – RM80). A downside to NewPhone is that they lump the monthly instalment and the “upgrade” fee together. So if you plan to keep your phone, there’s no option to opt out from the upgrade and you have to pay the same monthly instalment across 24 months. Another advantage for Celcom NewPhone is that you can switch phones earlier but there’s an Express NewPhone fee that can go as high as RM1,000.  For the comparison above, we compare based on the assumption that you would make an upgrade after 12 months. Note that for the second year, it all depends on whether you will keep the same phone or switch to a newer device. If you do change to another smartphone, the instalment amount would be different.  Before signing up, we recommend picking a plan that would fulfil your needs. You can study your current bill and data usage to get a better idea of how much you really need each month.  Other factors to consider is the network coverage and quality in your area. Not all networks are built the same and the experience may vary depending on location. If you’re happy with your current provider, it might be a better idea to stick with them.  As usual, if you spot any errors in the tables above, please do let us know in the comments below."
Sponsored,Battle of the Sixes: The Nexus 6P versus the Apple iPhone 6s Plus versus the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/21/battle-of-the-sixes-the-nexus-6p-versus-the-apple-iphone-6s-plus-versus-the-samsung-galaxy-s6-edge/,,,2016-03-21,"When the Nexus 6P came out, the question on everyone’s lips was: “Is it as good as the other flagships?”. Aptly named the 6P, it seems that 2015 was the year of the six-branded smartphone, as the Nexus 6P, together with the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, carved a “holy-trinity” out of the smartphone crop. With these three priced at the top of the food chain as no-nonsense, no-compromise, best-phablets-money-can-buy devices, consumers everywhere were torn. The line separating these three devices were so thin that no matter which device you chose, you would end up with a great phablet nonetheless. But, c’mon, we have to crown a winner. There is only one sport at the top of that podium, and today we fill it. These devices are monsters when it comes to performance. They’re absolutely savage, devouring applications, multitasking, gaming, media consumption and everything else you can throw at it. They are the ultimate devices after all. But, like we said, there can only be one winner so we delve into the depths of multitasking and intense usage to try and find a winner. For a full list of specifications, please refer to our last page where we have a detailed table letting you know all the nitty gritty details of each device. First up is the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. It has Samsung’s Exynos 7420 processor, powering it through daily activities. Multitasking was smooth and it had no problems munching up the slew of applications and games we threw at it. Next, we fired up the iPhone 6s Plus and gave it the beans too. Switching between apps was ridiculously quick and snappy. It did help that iOS’s animations made everything so much more fluid (like what Windows Phone does) and as if it was instantaneous. Some might call it cheating, we call it proper optimisation. Finally came the Nexus 6P. Two words: Stock Android. Fantastic multitasking experience, launching every application we could find and flipping through the multitasking card window as we wondered what application to flip between was lots of fun. It handled the switches like a champ. Android’s multitasking animation easily takes the cake. For gaming, well, is there a word to describe something that is buttery-er than buttery? In conclusion, when it comes to performance and multitasking, the iPhone 6s Plus snags the win by a hair over the Nexus 6P. The gap between the two and the Galaxy S6 edge+ though is a little further than expected. Somehow the home button on the Samsung device had a little delay when exiting applications."
Rory Lee,The Apple iPhone SE is the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/22/the-apple-iphone-se-is-the-most-powerful-4-inch-phone-ever/,"4-inch iPhone,apple,Apple iPhone SE,Apple Keynote March 2016,iOS,iPhone SE,smartphone","Apple,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-03-22,"has welcomed a new iPhone to their smartphone family — the   — and it’s a 4-inch device designed for people who simply love smaller iPhones. It’s packing a whole lot of horsepower that makes it the “most powerful 4-inch phone ever”. At the heart of the iPhone SE (pronounced “essay” apparently) sits Apple’s powerful A9 chip and M9 motion coprocessor. This means that the device has the same amount of performance as their iPhone 6s flagship device. This 4-inch smartphone also features Apple’s Retina display, boasting a pixel density of 326 ppi. That’s a mighty little device if we’ve ever seen one. What’s more, the iPhone SE will pack the excellent 12-megapixel iSight camera with Focus Pixels and a True Tone flash. To ensure the best camera experience, the iPhone SE also sports the A9’s new image signal processor which should ensure excellent photos. On the front though, things aren’t so pretty as the FaceTime HD camera is only capable of taking 1.2-megapixel images. One of the biggest complaints we’ve heard from our readers (and apparently every other iPhone 5s customer) was its terrible battery life. Well the iPhone SE is supposed to bring an improvement to battery performance, despite all that extra horsepower, which should keep you running for longer. It also has support for, faster LTE (50% faster than iPhone 5s), VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and faster 802.11ac WiFi connectivity. It’s also got Touch ID to ensure your device is secure, plus help you unlock and access your smartphone with just a tap of your finger. What is missing is Apple’s 3D Touch, which seems to have been abandoned for the iPhone SE. In terms of looks, the device does look almost exactly like the old iPhone 5s which perhaps speaks to Apple’s efforts and desire in their recycling devices. If you’re interested, the iPhone SE will go on sale on 31st March (with preorders beginning 24th March) with prices starting at USD399 (around RM1,611) for the 16GB model and USD499 (around RM2,015) for the 64GB model. In Singapore, the smartphone will go for SGD658 (around RM1,955) for the 16GB model and SGD828 for the 64GB model (around RM2,460)."
Rory Lee,Here’s how you can use two SIMs and a microSD card on your Galaxy S7 edge,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/21/heres-how-you-can-use-two-sims-and-a-microsd-card-on-your-galaxy-s7-edge/,"Android,Dual Sim,dual sim hack,dual sim mod,Galaxy S7 edge mod,hybrid SIM,microSD,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Malaysia,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-21,"brought many of the features their fans loved in old Galaxy S devices — like the microSD card slot and water resistance — back to their flagship   model. The microSD card is an important feature but Samsung decided to go with a hybrid SIM tray which meant users had to choose between two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card. What if we told you that you could have two SIMs   a microSD card slot? No Replied figured out a way to “hack” the hybrid SIM tray in the  , allowing them to use two nano SIMs and one microSD card at the same time. You must be thinking, how on earth do you “hack” hardware? Well, apparently you hack it literally because what No Replied did was chop up the secondary SIM and superglue it to the back of the microSD card. Brilliant right? The steps No Replied too seemed simple enough with the trickiest part, we reckon, to be the removal of the chip from the nano SIM. It involves heat, prying and some luck to safely get your chip out of its plastic body. Once that’s done though, the rest looks pretty simple and the result actually looks pretty slick and elegant. Clearly, if you’re going to chop up your SIM card, you should really be careful and we will not be held responsible for any damage caused by this little hack. Proceed at your own risk. If you’re interested in “hacking” your hybrid SIM tray, you can check out No Replied’s step-by-step guide  . Since it’s a mod to your SIM and microSD, it looks like this might work on any hybrid SIM tray."

In what we suspect is perparation for the launch of the new Apple Watch 2, Apple has slashed RM300 off the top of their current Apple Watch Sport bringing it to an all-time low starting price of RM1,299. This means it’s more affordable to get an entry-level Apple Watch Sport than it is to purchase many of the other smartwatches running Android Wear or even Samsung’s Tizen. However, this price cut looks like it is only applicable for the Sport edition of the Apple Watch as the prices for the other variants remain the same. Nevertheless, that’s an incredible amount of savings, but that’s not all. Apple have also introduced a whole set of new straps including new colours for the Leather and Sport bands plus a space-black Milanese loop.

Its got a lot of the stuff that makes the iPad Pro tick under the hood and Apple is marketing it as the ultimate PC replacement. Apple is quite confident that the iPad Pro could be the “PC replacement device” that people are looking for, especially since there are 600 million PCs that are over 5 years old. They’re pretty sure that these users will just jump straight to the iPad Pro 9.7. Specs wise, the iPad Pro sports quite a bit of the same specs as its bigger counterpart; featuring the same A9X processor and four speakers. However, it does have an upgraded 12MP rear camera that can shoot 4K video alongside a 5MP front snapper with Retina Flash. The display has also gotten a significant bump up, as Apple claims that the new iPad Pro is 40% less reflective than the  ‘s screen and apparently that its got the lowest reflectivity while being the brightest tablet on the market. The iPad Pro’s screen also has some new tech called “True Tone Display” which adjusts the display’s colour temperature based on the ambient light plus its got blue-light reduction for all you late night users. The new iPad Pro will come in four different colours, space grey, silver, gold and rose gold, with preorders starting 24th March with the device officially hitting the market on 31st March. The iPad Pro 9.7″ is priced at US$599 (RM2418) for 32GB, US$749 (RM3024) for 128GB and US$899 (RM3629) for 256GB for the WiFi only models. Our neighbour down south in Singapore will be among the first wave countries to get it and so far there’s no indication yet for Malaysian availability. Apple will also be selling a smaller version of the Smart Keyboard that is roughly identical to the one for the larger iPad Pro. Price and availability to be released later down the line."
Alexander Wong,Digi counters Maxis with their own East Malaysian plan,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/18/digi-postpaid-rm68-5gb-east-malaysia-plan/,"Digi new postpaid,DiGi Postpaid,Digi RM68 plan,Digi RM68 postpaid,East Malaysia,Postpaid,sabah,sarawak","DiGi,Players on the Field,Promotions",2016-03-18,"A week ago, Maxis had quietly released a   that offers 5GB of data with unlimited calls and SMS for RM68/month. Many had gotten riled up as the plan was offered exclusively to those in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan.  According to  , Digi has just rolled out a similar plan which competes directly with Maxis. The folks on the east side are really getting spoilt for choice now.  Simply called as the New Digi Postpaid 68 promo, this RM68/month postpaid is exclusive to East Malaysian customers for a limited time only. It also packs 5GB of data like the MaxisONE Plan as well as unlimited calls to all networks. SMS is unlimited but it is only for 3 of your favourite contacts. On top of that, you also get internet rollover to carry forward unused internet to the following month. As an added bonus, there’s also 1 year free iflix subscription worth RM96 plus Capture Cloud storage of 30GB.  As a comparison, Digi’s current   offers 6GB of internet with 150 minutes of calls and SMS. Alternatively, you can go for their unlimited calls and text option but it comes with 3GB of data. So if you don’t really make more calls, the   RM68 for 6GB data offer is probably better but at least, you get a peace of mind of having unlimited calls with this East Malaysia exclusive promo.

Rory Lee,OPPO R9 and R9 Plus — the real selfie expert,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/18/oppo-r9-and-r9-plus-the-real-selfie-expert/,"Android,Malaysia,Oppo,OPPO R9,OPPO R9 Malaysia,OPPO R9 official,OPPO R9 Plus,OPPO R9 Plus Malaysia,OPPO R9 Plus official,oppo smartphone,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-03-18,"By now I’m sure many of you have heard this incredibly catchy (and sometimes annoying)   from OPPO. As often as it gets stuck in your head, it does highlight one important thing — we’re taking more selfies today than we ever have in the past. If you’re a smartphone maker, you’d definitely want to cash in on this — many are — and while OPPO’s recent attempt at a “selfie expert” fell  , their new duo looks much more promising. Kicking things off, the newly announced   and   have front facing cameras that are designed to give you 16 megapixels of selfie goodness. In sheer megapixel count alone, they’re double nearly every other smartphone selfie camera out there. But we all know megapixels aren’t everything and thankfully the R9 duo also packs a fast f/2.0 lens to allow as much light as possible to hit that sensor. They’ve also got OPPO’s improved beautification plus selfie panorama modes which should go down well with selfie enthusiasts. Beyond that, the R9 is a pretty standard midrange device. It’s got all the usual suspects in a mid-level OPPO device with a 5.5-inch full HD AMOLED panel sitting on top of a 2GHz MediaTek Helio P10 processor mated to 4GB of RAM. Keeping everything running is a 2,850 mAh battery. Since it’s a camera-centric device, it does pack more internal storage as users can get 64GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). But it becomes pretty obvious which camera you’re supposed to be using when the “primary” rear-facing shooter is only a 13MP sensor with PDAF and an f/2.2 5-element lens. With the name being the biggest hint, the R9 Plus has a larger 6-inch full HD AMOLED panel on the front. Despite the larger screen, the device does have slightly wider bezels (1.76mm versus the R9’s 1.66mm) but it still has a better screen-to-body ratio of 79.3% (versus the R9’s 77.7%). Inside, OPPO has also upped the specifications to a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB (128GB version to follow) of expandable internal storage. The primary camera unit does make a little more sense here as the R9 Plus packs a 16MP Sony IMX298 sensor with PDAF and an f/2.0 lens. It has a larger 4,120 mAh battery which should give it pretty decent battery life. Design wise, the devices have a pretty sexy look with the near bezel-less screen and thin profile accentuated by nice round edges for better grip. OPPO have also abandoned the rear-facing fingerprint scanner, choosing instead to mount it on the front of the device below the display. While that does make it easier to unlock when it’s on the table, I’m still more of a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor kind of guy. The most unfortunate thing is that the Chinese company’s super-fast Super VOOC flash charge doesn’t make an appearance on the R9 duo. You’ll just have to “settle” for regular VOOC (70% charge in 30 mins), I guess. They do come in two colours though — gold and rose gold. Another bummer is that both smartphones come with colorOS 3.0 that is still built on top of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop (Android N previews are out, OPPO, c’mon) but we certainly hope it gets updated when it leaves China. Unfortunately, there is no information on global availability, but it will hit shelves in China on 12 April with the regular R9 being priced at CNY2,799 (around RM1,755) while the bigger R9 Plus will cost CNY3,299 (around RM2,068). According to OPPO Malaysia, it will be   on our shores sometime next month."

It’s been a long wait, but no doubt Windows fans will rejoice. Software updates are great, but looking at the downward spiral that Windows Phone is heading into, one really has to wonder if it’s too little too late. Following the announcement of the rollout, Microsoft released a list of supported devices, and while there are more than initially expected, it’s still a fairly limited affair — for instance, my   isn’t on the list. Here are a   of devices that can be upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile 10586.164: According to their blog post, Microsoft stated that only these devices were chosen because Windows 10 delivers “significant new innovations” that if applied to older devices might “impact customer experience”. They then continued to say that with this crop of devices, they are confident that they can continue to deliver a good customer experience. Well, good customer experience or not, that remains to be seen, but from what we could tell based on our  , it’s a tough promise to make. Updates are usually fun and if you find your device on that list, you can download the   app from the Windows Store to check if Windows 10 Mobile is available for your device (if you haven’t already received it OTA). Keep in mind that even if your device is on the list, you may not get this update today as there are other variances to account for. Stuff like your region, mobile operator or service provider among other things may factor into a delay on the update. Windows Phone as a platform has faced many problems. Poised to be an OS that should have shaken up the Android-iOS hegemony, it simply tripped over itself before it could even stand with the big boys. Recent news seems to make matters even worse for Microsoft’s operating system as one of the key selling points of the platform, their maps and navigation service HERE Maps, is   for the Windows platform. That’s like if Google Maps left the Android platform. What’s more HERE aren’t the only people stopping support for Windows Phone, even WhatsApp are   their supported devices by killing off support for Windows Phone 7.1. Things aren’t looking that good and we can’t honestly say that  ."

That means, if you’re not one of the first thousand, you will simply have to pay the full price like everyone else. Finally, the rebate isn’t knocked off immediately, its rebated into your bill over four months (RM50x4) and will begin during the second month after you receive the confirmation that you’re eligible. If you are interested in picking up the phone with Maxis, it can be yours for RM114/month (excluding GST) over a two-year period. If you want to upgrade to a new device, you will need to top up an upgrade fee of RM30/month. Since you need to keep the device in good order when you return it, Maxis are also offering an RM23/month device protection program which you can opt into — bringing it to a total of RM167/month excluding your postpaid plan."

Rory Lee,Battle of the edges — S6 edge vs S7 edge vs S6 edge+,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/17/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-vs-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-vs-galaxy-s7-edge-malaysia-comparison/,,,2016-03-17,"Dual-edge displays are a magnificent thing to behold. They look utterly unique and gives everyday smartphone tasks a little pizzaz. It’s hard to put into words what the experience is like, it’s really something you should see for yourself. Sure, you could head to a   store to play with one of the demo units, but from my experience, you fully appreciate the experience only once you start using it as your daily driver. If you’re keen, the only thing left to ask is: Which edge do you get? To date, Samsung has churned out four edge devices — the single edge  , the  , the   and the  . While the Note Edge did get the ball rolling, it didn’t have a dual-edge display and its edge functionality is slightly different from the dual-edge displays we know of today. It’s more of a one-of-a-kind smartphone. If we’re looking at dual-edge smartphones. the choice would then fall to the remaining three — the S6 edge, S6 edge+ and S7 edge — all of which are enticing choices. Logic would dictate that the latest S7 edge is the easy choice, being the latest and most powerful of the trio, but, people might take issue with the 5.5-inch panel on the S7 edge. They might, for instance, prefer the larger 5.7-inch S6 edge+ or even the smaller 5.1-inch S6 edge. But what are the trade-offs? On paper, the S7 edge definitely wins out here as it sports Samsung’s newest top-of-the-line octa-core chip in the Exynos 8890. Paired with 4GB of RAM and Android 6.0 Marshmallow and this device will zip through and remain snappy regardless of what you’re doing with the device. However, it’s not to say the other two are sluggish — Samsung’s 2015 flagships still pack a punch. Throughout our usage of both the S6 edge and S6 edge+, we didn’t encounter any problems with lag or stuttering going through daily tasks. It’s still a powerful device by today’s standards and will likely keep going strong for quite some time. Likely the biggest difference you’d notice is the heat under stress. The S6 edge and S6 edge+ gets noticeably hotter than the S7 edge though not to the extent where it gets uncomfortable. Here’s where the S7 edge nudges ahead of the other two devices too. It’s simply got a better camera, despite the drop in megapixels, as that 12MP Dual Pixel camera is one of the best smartphone snappers in the market right now."
Alexander Wong,Uber starts accepting cash payments in Johor Bahru,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/19/uber-cash-payments-johor-bahru-malaysia/,"Cash Payment,Johor Bahru,Uber,Uber Cash payment,Uber JB,Uber Malaysia,Uber Malaysia cash payment",Mobile Apps,2016-03-19,", the popular ride-sharing service on demand is testing out cash payments in Johor Bahru. Before this, Uber was running as a cashless service with your rides charged automatically thru credit or debit card. Is this a good move? The beauty of Uber is the ease of getting on and off a ride. There’s no need to worry about small change so you can get from point A to B hassle free.  Prior to this, Uber has started   at selected markets where card payments have limited reach. According to them, there are many potential customers that couldn’t experience Uber as they lack any form of electronic payment. To make clean and safe rides more accessible, they are experimenting cash as an option. This is similar to  , which initially accepts only cash and eventually they have started accept card payments.  Johor Bahru is picked as the first city to roll out cash payments for Uber rides in Malaysia. If this is successful, they could introduce this to other cities in the country. Personally, I feel that automated card payments are the way to go. Not only it provides a seamless experience, but it is also more time efficient as the drivers would not need to make longer stops to look for change.  Furthermore, you won’t want to get into the same taxi experience where the driver runs out of change for your freshly ATM-withdrawn RM100 note. For drivers, this could also pose a risk for carrying more cash at hand and possibly being caught by SPAD or taxi drivers. In terms of electronic payment accessibility, most ATM cards issued by local banks are already debit cards carrying either Mastercard or VISA. The new payment feature is rolling out in stages and customers in JB should be getting the cash option gradually in the coming weeks. To pay by cash, make sure CASH is selected before you request for a ride. When the trip ends, just pay for the amount that’s displayed in the app. Is accepting cash a good move or would you prefer Uber to stay as a cashless system?

One of the world’s most valuable companies, the pioneer of the smartphone as we know and love today, as well as a company who dares to try some truly interesting things with their devices (removing the CD drive on computers, and potentially the   on the next iPhone). Now, I’ve been called many things in the past, “Apple basher” being one of them, and much of that is because I don’t agree with many of the things the Cupertino company does. But, there has always been one thing I like that Apple gets so right — their ads. Debuting their latest piece showcasing the “Hey Siri” hands-free functionality on the iPhone 6s, Apple enlisted the help of Sesame Street’s favourite cookie-loving monster. It probably isn’t the best representation of Siri’s accuracy considering how it often struggles with strong accents (no offence Cookie, but you’ve got a pretty strong accent too), but it does leave you with a warm feeling and a smile on your face. I don’t know about you, but it’s ads that evoke this feeling that I remember best. Now I’m not one to buy something because I saw what it could do in an ad, but I know there are many who do that. Ads are really powerful and more and more companies are realising that the best ads aren’t really ads at all — they represent something special or human. Apple does this by adding a touch of humour and wit. It’s subtle and smart, and that makes all the difference. It humanises the ad. Nobody gets it right the first time, not even Apple. Just look at their old ads for the older iPhones. What they mostly did was boast about the features and it wasn’t until the iPhone 6/6 Plus commercial about Health that I started to see them get it right. They’ve almost perfected this aspect of ad-making and it’s truly awesome to see. It’s almost magical how Apple can take some of the most mundane and gimmicky smartphone features, build an ad around them, and make the audience feel like they   have it on their smartphone right now. I can tell you that the next iPhone will have killer specifications and some kick-ass features, but in all honesty, the thing I’m looking forward to the most are its ads. Not the launch one because that will probably be pompous if the   is going to be a trend, but the ones that come after. The ones like this 3D Touch ad that I absolutely love."

Not only have Samsung Malaysia brought in the South Korean electronics giant’s newest flagship handset, they’ve brought along a familiar face as well.

For storage, the device comes with 32GB of internal storage but you have the option to expand that via a microSD card slot that occupies the second SIM slot on the hybrid dual SIM tray. It’s also water and dust resistant up to IP68 which should give you peace of mind but perhaps the most magnificent thing about the smartphone is its camera. On the front, you’ll find Samsung’s usual 5MP snapper, only this time with a faster and brighter f/1.7 aperture lens, but around back is where the magic happens. Mounted nearly flush to the back of the smartphone’s glass back is Samsung’s brand new 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera with the same fast f/1.7 aperture lens that is easily one of the best smartphone cameras right now. With the new Dual Pixel technology and the fast lens, the Galaxy S7 edge promises up to 95% brighter photos as well as an uber fast focusing speed. Inside, a 3,600 mAh battery gives the device juice allowing you to make full use of the Galaxy S7 edge’s new gaming enhanced features in the Game Launcher and Game Tools options.

On to the Gear 360, Samsung has announced that the little 360-degree camera would be making its way to Malaysia later in Q2 of 2016. We got to   the cute little golf ball camera back in   and were quite impressed with it. The little device takes full 360-degree video with the help of two 195-degree lenses mounted on the front and back of the device.

If you opt for the P70 Hero Postpaid (RM135-RM70=RM65 savings each month), that comes up to RM1,560 saved across 24 months, and you’ll get unlimited calls and more data.

Although you gain freedom in usage without having to worry about running out of credits, there is a chance that when your bill arrives at the end of the month, you will be paying more than you’d expect. In the past, one of the biggest worries when switching to a postpaid plan was bill shock — the possibility of paying for something you thought you’d never use. Some horror stories have users rack up thousands of ringgit because of accidental data usage and roaming on the wrong network. To combat that,   implemented a Pay-Per-Use format where it charged users who were using data on their smartphone without a data plan. This format charged users RM10 for every block of 50MB data that they would use up to a cap of RM50/month which works out to 250MB/month. After 250MB, users could continue surfing without any extra charge but at a throttled speed. However, on 14 January 2016, they quietly revised their Pay-Per-Use conditions to increase it to 10 blocks, meaning charges now cap at RM100/month — double the previous threshold. Maxis says that this is to improve user browsing experience, and that’s true to a certain extent since users get to use up to 500MB of unrestricted speeds, but that also means users would have to pay more per month if their usage exceeds 250MB. If you’d like to find out more about this, you can head on over to their  , or view your Pay-Per-Use stats via the MyMaxis App ( / ). That said, it is a little silly to use your smartphone data these days without subscribing to an actual data plan. That means this Pay-Per-Use plan acts more like a safety net for those without a plan who accidentally turn on their data than someone who actually wants to surf. Since this is the case, I’d think that a lower cap would benefit users more since they would ultimately be paying less. What do you guys think?"

While the other internals like the RAM and storage remains the same, these two chips are quite different. The question then became: is one faster than the other? Well, according to this speed test video, the Exynos 8890 (White) unit is just a touch faster than the Snapdragon 820 (Gold) variant. It launches apps and returns to the home screen just a little bit faster than the SD820 unit, but not so much that it might be terribly noticeable in real world usage. For benchmarks, the Exynos 8890 unit also performs slightly better in the overall score. However, the breakdown does reveal that it falls behind quite significantly in terms of 3D GPU performance. This falls somewhat in line with a test ran earlier by   where they pitted both devices against each other in a series of benchmarks. In PhoneArena’s test, the Snapdragon variant scored a higher average in both the overall AnTuTu benchmark as well as in the GPU-specific tests. However, the Exynos chip edged it out when it came to browsing benchmarks. It is worth noting that they ran the test on a Galaxy S7, not an S7 edge, but the end result should be fairly representative of the larger edge model as well. You can view their findings in the table below: From their tests, they concluded that the performance difference is nearly negligible as they are very comparable systems. Comparable in performance, perhaps, but what about things like battery life? Our   (Galaxy S7 edge) on moderate usage pulled out a measly 3 hours and 40 minutes of screen-on time, giving us about 17 and a half hours of time on battery. It’s a pretty big difference if you compare it to   (Snapdragon 820) which gave him close to 6 hours of screen-on time with a day and a half on battery with moderate usage. Of course, that could be down to a number of reasons as well as what he deems moderate usage, but it beggars belief that he could pull out nearly double the SOT on similar usage.

According to OpenSignal’s latest data updated on 11 March 2016, Digi currently has the widest coverage in Malaysia. So looks like it’s a win for team yellow as it claims to currently cover   with 4G LTE.  But is this really true? When you view the  , you should see a map which plots the coverage areas of the telcos around you. To get a nationwide sample, you can key in Malaysia from the search bar.  
 If you enable all 2G, 3G and 4G, Digi is ranked #1, followed by U Mobile, Maxis and Celcom. If you look at speed alone, U Mobile does seem to offer the fastest speeds here which goes in line with its “ ” title from Speedtest.net.

When we toggle the map to 2G only, U Mobile suddenly ranks #1 while Maxis takes last position at #4. The funny thing is that U Mobile doesn’t even own a 2G network. For areas that are out of U Mobile’s coverage, it relies on Maxis 2G and 3G networks as part of their RAN sharing agreement.  
 For 4G only, Digi is ranked first, followed by Celcom then U Mobile and Maxis. U Mobile which doesn’t even cover East Malaysia is ranked higher than Maxis for coverage. Very odd indeed.  So what does this tell us? Looking at the above, it seems that OpenSignal may not be entirely accurate for Malaysia at the time being. It collects mobile quality data from their OpenSignal app that’s available for   and  . Even OpenSignal themselves urge you to install the app in order to improve the maps. Think about how many Malaysians have installed the app? Most of you would have use Speedtest.net instead. When OpenSignal published its   report, it was derived from a sample size of 325,221 users. Out of those numbers, we won’t know how many of them are from Malaysia.  Having crowd source data is good but the report is only going to be as good as the sample size itself.

When Samsung unveiled the   and  , we were stunned. At first, because it looked so much like their 2015 flagship devices, but later because of how amazing these devices were as smartphones. If perfection is something simply doing what it’s supposed to do flawlessly, then the Galaxy S7 edge that I have on review is a real contender. It has monster specs, an incredible build, a fantastic camera and the latest version of Android. Performance is absolutely buttery and for a glass-backed device, it’s really nice to hold in the hand, much nicer than something like the  .

Rory Lee,Sony’s Concept N headphones are the Google Glass for your ears,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/14/sonys-concept-n-headphones-are-the-google-glass-for-your-ears/,"Concept N,open ear earphones,Sony,Sony Concept N,Sony Concept N earphones,Sony earphones,Sony headphones,Sony Xperia Ear,SXSW,Xperia Ear","Mobile Accessories,Sony",2016-03-14,"Sony’s   at the   in Barcelona represented a shift in focus when it came to the development of mobile devices, bringing out several concepts that go beyond simply augmenting a smartphone. At SXSW (South by Southwest) they pulled back the covers of yet another futuristic device that falls in line with the experience Sony are promoting with their hands-free   device — the Concept N headphones. Concept N is the child of Sony’s R&D arm Future Lab initiative — an arm tasked with showing off early prototypes of products and gathering feedback. On the surface, the N doesn’t look all too different or radical when compared to existing headphones from other manufacturers, but it does have a trick or two up its sleeve. The first thing you’ll notice is that they’re not connected to your ear and are designed to be worn around your neck. So how do you listen to music then? The N has a set of cleverly placed speakers designed to play music to your ears in a limited range around your head so you can also listen to your surroundings and have a proper conversation. We suspect that this wouldn’t be too great for sound quality if you’re mixing in a noisy background, but the folks at The Verge and Engadget seem pretty impressed with it. If you want a more quiet experience, though, Sony has a pair of “open-ear earphones” that go along with the N, letting you clip them on your ear for what we suspect would be a more private listening experience. Since these V-shaped earphones are open-ear though, you can still listen to your surroundings while your favourite track is on. The drivers are mounted at one end of the V, feeding audio to the other end of the V that goes in your ear, resulting in a slick minimalist design. That’s not all, Sony’s Concept N has a bunch of, although very limited, augmented-reality-esque features too — though not in the generic visual AR sense. Instead, the N responds to voice commands and can tell you useful stuff like the weather, local news updates and local restaurant information all with a simple trigger phrase “Listen up Arc!” before your command. What’s most impressive is that you can tell it to take a photo too. Once the command is inputted (or shouted, depending on how loud your surroundings are), the otherwise hidden camera mounted on the right edge of the neckband opens up and takes a photo before disappearing again. It eliminates one of the Google Glass’ biggest flaws when it comes to a wearable camera — people don’t feel like you’re always taking a photo/video of them. It’s an interesting device in the way it functions and brings aural AR into our lives giving me a very distinct   vibe. Sony has always been one of the great pioneers of audio technology and it’s great to see them pull out something seriously cool. What do you think of the Concept N? Let us know in the comments below."

It is also mated with 4GB of RAM and there’s a choice of either 64GB or 128GB of storage. With a larger battery, the R9 Plus is thicker at 7.7mm and it weighs 185grams.  In the imaging department, both R9 and R9 Plus will sport a 16MP front camera for higher resolution selfies. For the rear, the R9 gets a 13MP camera while the R9 Plus gets a 16MP unit. Yup, the R9 has a higher pixelcount camera at the front than its main camera.  Both models are listed to be running on ColorOS 3.0 and we hope that it comes with at least Android 6.0 Marshmallow underneath. According to OPPO Malaysia, the new   will be available a month later, which is sometime in mid-April. Colour wise, expect the R9 to come in Gold and Rose Gold.  As mentioned previously, OPPO has yet to release a proper flagship device since the Find 7. While   the “Find 9” that we’re looking for, the Snapdragon 652 processor with 4GB of RAM should put this on par against other high-end phablet contenders."

Well, it looks like it might have an Android challenger coming out of South Korean electronics giant  , as rumours begin to sprout about a potential Galaxy S7 mini that packs a punch. The alleged 4.6-inch device from Samsung is rumoured to make an appearance with a set of fantastic features. And it would have to if it wants to take on the  . According to the rumour mill, the upcoming mini flagship is said to pack either a Snapdragon 820 or an Exynos 8890 processor, and 3GB of RAM on the inside. There is currently no information on the internal storage but judging by the processor and RAM alone, the device is looking like a worthy challenger. The only drawback, it seems, would be the 1280×720 pixel display said to adorn the front of the smartphone. But, since it’s less than 5 inches, the pixel density should still be relatively high. What’s more, the S7 mini is said to sport a 12-megapixel primary camera packed into a smartphone package that is only 9.9mm thin. Based on the megapixel count, it looks like it could be the same Dual Pixel sensor found on the regular   and   that we  . It’s not entirely surprising if Samsung does come up with a mini variant as they’ve done so in the past. One of the biggest problems with old the Galaxy S mini variants was that they always came with watered down specs. That’s kind of a bummer especially since they bore the Galaxy S flagship badge. The one company that really gets the “compact” or “mini” flagship variants right has been Sony, who packed the same flagship components into a smaller form factor. If these rumours prove true, that could mean Samsung are finally picking up on this trend. But, this also means it becomes a direct competitor for Sony’s   too. But, we don’t think that’s too fair of a comparison if we’re going off these rumoured specs as the S7 mini simply blows the Xperia Z5 Compact out of the water. The real battle royale would be with the iPhone and with the S7 mini’s price likely to be lower, this could prove to be an interesting fight. This is of course if these rumours prove true, which we can’t know for certain right now, so do take what we say here with a grain of salt."

Their latest Xiaomi Mi 5 offers a lot of phone for your money and it costs about half of what the mainstream players are selling.  The issue, of course, is availability and Xiaomi is struggling to keep up with demand even in their home ground in China. The Mi 5 flagship went on sale on 1st March and it would probably take months before they could start selling in Malaysia. If you can’t wait, you can get it now in Malaysia thanks to grey importer DirectD.  Like any brand new imported smartphones, be prepared to pay a premium for this. The Mi 5 is offered at RM1,799 and this is for the lower spec model. It gets a lower clocked 1.8GHz Snapdragon 820 processor, 3GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. In China, this specific model is going for 1,999 CNY which is about RM1,255 with our current exchange rate.

When we first saw it at MWC 2016, we couldn’t wait to get our hands on the device. Well, after a long (it wasn’t that long, but it felt long) wait, it finally came…and I pounced on it. The unboxing experience was reasonable. Samsung was never one to have elaborate unboxing experiences for their flagships, often defaulting to a generic small box you could fit in a clutch. This one was a little different, though. In terms of dimensions, the box is pretty much the same size as last year’s flagship boxes but this time instead of pulling the lid off, you unwrapped the lip of the box and watch as it rolls out to reveal the phone tucked neatly in its tray. Underneath is business as usual where you have a box with the SIM tool and the relevant paperwork separating the phone tray and the accessories that come with it. Speaking of the accessories, the Galaxy S7 doesn’t come with a whole lot of kit compared to something like the Huawei Mate 8. It’s got a pair of in-ear headphones set in a tinted box, a charging cable, a power brick and a USB OTG adapter. The power brick is Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging brick that supports two voltages with different amps — either 9V, 1.67A or 5V, 2.0A. Setting up the device was the usual affair but the included USB OTG adapter does let you access a nifty Samsung feature: Smart Switch. Or at least it should, but for some reason, the Galaxy S7 edge didn’t recognise the HTC One A9 I was copying information over from. Instead, it repeatedly reminded me that the connected smartphone needed to be “Android 4.3 and above” which is weird because the One A9 is already on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. If you’re unfamiliar with Smart Switch, it’s basically an application that lets you copy your files — apps, contacts, data, etc — over from your existing device to your new Galaxy smartphone, or in this case, the Galaxy S7 edge. Despite the fact that we couldn’t transfer the files via cable, Smart Switch supports wireless transfer as well. Odd. Simply install the app on your old device (for a list of compatible platforms head on over  ) and choose the stuff you want to transfer, then hit send. It will take awhile depending on how much information you want to transfer. Though it did take only about 10 minutes to copy files over wirelessly, we reckon a wired transfer should be faster. My first impressions of the device? It feels awesome for a glass-backed device. The rounded back really helps with grip and somehow Samsung has made the glass and metal seam even more flush than before. The camera feels excellent and focuses almost as quickly as my eye can, plus the overall performance of the device is just really, really snappy. Is it the perfect smartphone? I guess you’ll have to wait for our full review to find out. If you’d like to see more unboxing and device photos, be sure to check out our   on Facebook."

While the actual launch date is still up in the air, here’s a clearer leak of the HTC 10.  As seen on the earlier renders, the front gets a  -like design that has a fingerprint scanner underneath the screen. Interestingly there are capacitive buttons for Back and Recent app accompanying the home button, which we think is a good move. The current HTC smartphones including the HTC One A9 and One M9+ use purely on-screen buttons along with its fingerprint scanner. Of course, some would definitely point out that this is starting to look a lot like a Samsung Galaxy smartphone.  Surrounding the device is a metal frame that’s visible from the front, which is somewhat similar to the Nexus 6P. The back of the device is where the HTC 10 stands out. It gets a curve back with a polished chamfered edge. If we take a look at the camera module, it seems to protrude a bit, while next to it appears to be a dual-tone LED flash and possibly a laser AutoFocus light. According to @evleaks, the HTC 10 will come in 4 colour options – namely carbon gray, glacier silver (with either black or white coloured front) and topaz gold.  There’s still no mention of an official launch but it could be after the Galaxy S7 fever starts to fizzle out. Huawei will be   its P9 flagship next month on 6 April."

On the other camp, you have the   that’s their thinnest and lightest. During the launch of the Huawei Mate 8, they have also announced the MediaPad M2 10.0 and it isn’t just a bigger version of the  . If you’re looking for a tablet to consume your iflix and Netflix shows, this could be your cup of tea. Like the name suggests, this is a 10″ tablet (10.1″ to be exact) with a wide 16:10 display aspect ratio. The screen does 1920×1200 resolution which gives a pixel density of 224 PPI (pixels per inch). The design is nothing to shout about but it gets a metal back like most of its unibody smartphones.  At the front of the M2 10.0, there’s a fingerprint scanner that unlocks on a single tap. While it looks like a Samsung tablet, there are no capacitive keys on either side, as it uses on-screen buttons. You can, however, access the back and recent apps from the fingerprint scanner by swiping either to the left or right which isn’t as intuitive. The fingerprint unlock is super quick but setting it up require more fingerprint taps than usual.  As an “M-series” tablet, this is a multimedia-centric device. Unlike the smaller M2 8.0, this doesn’t have two but a total of four speakers (2 treble + 2 bass) enhanced by harman kardon. The speaker grills are located at the top and bottom, and the audio is output is actually quite impressive for video and music playback. On the inside, the MediaPad M2 10.0 runs on a Kirin 930 processor with either 2GB or 3GB RAM. It also comes with a choice of either 16GB or 64GB of storage but you can still expand it further with microSD. WiFi and 4G LTE variants are also available too depending on spec levels.  For those who wish to sketch, the tablet is also available with a stylus that’s called the M-Pen. It boasts 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity which is the same as the Galaxy Note5 S Pen and double of a Surface Pen with the latest Surface Pro 4. The M-Pen is like a typical ball-point clip pen and it feels just right.  There are two buttons on the side – one for selection and another for eraser. At the other end of the M-Pen is a metal clip which helps to secure itself in a shirt pocket.  In case you need to take a picture with it, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 main camera that comes with a flash light. For selfies and skype videos, it gets a 5MP front shooter. The MediaPad M2 comes with a 6,660mAh battery and it still maintains a respectable 7.35mm thickness while weighing about half a kilogram. It feels bulkier than a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 but the four-speaker set up will definitely be appreciated for watching videos on demand.

It gets a bigger battery, support microSD expansion, better camera and dust/water resistance as well. To find out what makes it tick on the inside, ifixit has teardown a unit for your viewing pleasure.  While physically it looks similar to the previous version, the new Galaxy S7 is actually harder to repair with a repairability score of just 3/10. As comparison, the Galaxy S6   4/10, while the S6 edge   just 3/10.  The Galaxy S7 like its former model use glass for front and back. There are no screws so you’ll need to remove the back panel that’s secured with glue. The internals are easily replaceable with its modular components including the battery, cameras and the headphone jack. With Galaxy S7 having IP68 water resistance, it has rubber linings to keep water out from its internals.   For longer gameplay without overheating, they have also taken a closer look at the S7’s liquid cooling. The thin copper strip is less than a milimetre thick and weighs less than half a gram. In another video, cutting this copper strip reveals   inside, but it does dissipate heat to its outer frame.  Overall, ifixit found the S7 to be a tougher device to fix. Despite its modular components, the display needs to be removed if you need to replace the microUSB port. Since it uses glass for both sides, it is more prone to cracks if you were to drop the device. Another challenge is that it’s almost impossible to replace the front glass without destroying the actual display.  While the device looks good, we suggest that you invest in a case or take up a device protection program that covers damages and theft. Since we are getting only the   in Malaysia, we can only assume that it could be harder to repair than this."

Computers back then were bulky with huge CRT monitors hooked up to desktop or tower boxes. If you could remember those things, you are likely to have experience dial-up using   or TMnet. With the current generation of touch-enabled and wireless devices, many teenagers wouldn’t know how it’s like to go online back in the days. If you think it isn’t really a big difference, check out how these teens react to a machine from 20 years ago. They used a classic Pentium computer clocked at 133MHz and it comes with 32MB of RAM. Our current smartphones today have better specs than that. Unlike the current PCs with Windows 8 or Windows 10, starting up a computer back then can really take a long time. Before there was fibre or ADSL, most people rely on the good old dial-up modem. With download speeds of 14.4Kbps to 28.8Kbps (before 56K modems), it could take minutes to load a heavy web page and that’s slower than the throttle speeds you get today when you finish your mobile data quota.

For less than RM3,000, that’s a pretty good deal considering it retails originally for RM3,199. A few days later, he had a shocking discovery as he opened the brand new box. Instead of a gold iPhone 6s, the box contained nothing but a padlock strapped in the middle as shown above. Obviously angry and frustrated, he shared his situation on   which has garnered over 2,500 shares so far.  The surprising part is the box looks legit with a full shrink-wrap and there’s even a Brightstar Distribution label at the back. How on earth did an iPhone in a sealed box turn into a padlock? Something must have happened between the distribution and the delivery.  Fortunately, the folks at 11street had   within 24 hours and they wasted no time to arrange a replacement unit. 11street says that they take fraud cases very seriously and this is obviously a criminal offence.  To protect buyers, they have an ESCROW system in place where it will not release payment to the seller until the buyer is fully satisfied with their purchase. Being happy with the recovery, the affected customer had placed another iPhone 6s order from the same seller. As for the padlock, it has been returned for further police investigation."

As demand for power on the go grows, the Chinese company has managed to make their power banks smaller and lighter.  With USB Type-C becoming a new standard, they have just announced a new 10,000mAh power bank that comes with the new reversible port. At 12.58mm thin, it is almost as compact as their current   (9.9mm). Dubbed as the Mi Powerbank Pro, this isn’t just your regular powerbank to charge up your phone and tablets. It gets a couple of tricks including a fast charge with an 18W power source that replenishes the powerbank fully in 3 hours and 30 minutes. As a comparison, a standard 5V/2A charger will take about 6 hours to charge to 100%.  Having trouble charging wearables with a powerbank? For smaller devices like the Mi Band and bluetooth headsets, you can set it to charge at low voltage mode by double tapping on the power button. In case you’re wondering, you can also charge up a USB Type-C enabled MacBook with this powerbank. The Mi Powerbank Pro is rated to charge a 3,000mAH Mi Note for 2.5 times, an iPhone 6 for 4 times or an iPad mini for 1.5 times.  Like its other popular Mi Powerbanks, it gets a 9 layer protection system for safer charging and discharging with up to 93% conversion rate. While this is thinner than the current 10,000mAh powerbank, it is actually heavier at 223g (Current 10,000mAh powerbank: 207g).  In China, it is priced at 149 CNY, which is about RM93 currently. For the same price, you can get the   that comes with 2x full USB ports. Meanwhile, the 16,000mAh powerbank is cheaper at 129 CNY (Malaysia Mi Store: RM89).

Having a second or part-time job requires a certain type of dedication and commitment that perhaps not many are in the position to do so for various reasons such as inflexibility of the current or part-time jobs.

To recap on the specs, it gets a 5.15″ Full HD display and it runs on a Snapdragon 820 processor that’s clocked at 1.8GHz or 2.15GHz depending on variant and with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. Performance should be top notch as it uses a faster LPDDR4 RAM and UFS 2.0 flash storage, which are similar to Samsung’s recent flagships.  In terms of design it looks like the Mi Note as it gets a 3D curved glass back but this time it curves smoothly into the metal frame.

For the first time for a Xiaomi, it features a front mounted fingerprint scanner and they have managed to do so while maintain a compact front appearance. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh non-removable battery and it charges up quickly with a reversible USB Type C port.  In China the Mi 5 is priced from 1,999 CNY (about RM1,295) for the base 3GB RAM + 32GB storage model and it goes all the way up to 2,699 CNY (about RM1,750) for its 4GB RAM + 128GB storage variant with a 3D ceramic back.

Rory Lee,There is no liquid in the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge’s “liquid-cooling” system,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/04/there-is-no-liquid-in-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-edges-liquid-cooling-system/,"Galaxy S7 edge liquid cooling,Galaxy S7 edge watercooling,Galaxy S7 liquid cooling,Galaxy S7 watercooling,liquid cooled,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung watercooling,water cooled smartphone","Android,Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Others,Samsung",2016-03-04,"is many things — a well built, well engineered, well spec-ed smartphone — but apparently the one thing it isn’t, is a liquid-cooled device. Well, not in the conventional sense. YouTube teardown specialist  , in his dismantling of the Galaxy S7 edge smartphone, found out that there is no visible liquid within the heat pipe. There was, however, a copper wire mesh on the inside acting as a heat sink to draw away heat from the processor. Why is there no liquid? Unlike the heat pipe used in the Galaxy S7 phones, traditional liquid cooling involves a pump that keeps tubes full of liquid flowing, allowing the coolant to bring the heat from a CPU or GPU to a radiator/heatsink to be dissipated by a fan. In contrast, heat pipes use an evaporative cooling technique which transfers thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. So, whatever or however little fluid there was in the pipe, if there even was any to begin with, becomes vapour as soon as it heats up and would likely be released when the pipe was sliced open. Heat pipes can also be found in most traditional PC heatsinks or coolers, but we don’t exactly call those “liquid-cooling” solutions. We can see how this vapour heat pipe would be more practical in a smartphone, but can we really say that it is liquid-cooled? Samsung aren’t the only ones to employ this form of “liquid cooling” as the same system is currently employed in Microsoft’s Lumia flagships as well. One notable exception when it comes to liquid-cooled smartphones, as JerryRigEverything points out, is the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. When they tore that device apart, there was visible liquid within the heat pipes. To be fair, in their presentation during Unpacked 2016, Samsung did explain their cooling system pretty well — how it had some liquid that vapourises when hot and condenses when cooled — staying away from the actual usage of “water-cooled smartphone”. In fact, I couldn’t find any mention of “water-cooling” on their product page either. Perhaps then, the term water-cooling was coined more by the media and/or misinformed product guys than anyone else. What do you guys think of this “water-cooled” smartphone? Let us know in the comments below."

It just unlocks with a gentle tap on the sensor. The fingerprint sensor also lets you do more such as taking photos including selfies, swiping down to view notification and view all running apps by swiping up.  Micro-SIM, Nano-SIM or MicroSD card, the honor 5X fits them all. With a dedicated slot for MicroSD, there’s no compromise if you’re currently a dual-SIM user. Whether you’re using Micro or Nano SIM sizes, both slots support 4G LTE which can be managed from the phone settings.  The honor 5X gets a 13MP f/2.0 main camera while selfies are taken with a 5MP f/2.4 shooter camera that has a large 1.4 micron pixel size and a 22mm wide angle lens. Whether you’re taking sceneries, selfies or food, there’s a mode for any situation.  For perfect selfies all the time, you can preset your preferred set up in beautification mode.

Based on performance, he places them next to the useless systems of yesteryear – for Rift’s virtual reality headset at least. Considering that   is about to go big in the near future, this could cause some concern to the execs at Cupertino. Well,   usually enters the race late anyway. And as usual, they’ll find a way to get vendors and developers on board when they think it’s the right time to enter the game. Initially during development, Rift headsets were friendly with Linux and Mac machines but ever since the launch a year ago, the team at Oculus (probably) guided by Mr. Palmer Luckey’s views on Mac’s GPU performance, have gone Windows only. The Oculus exec stressed that even the most pimped out Mac out there can’t keep up with the Rift’s VR hardware, making it not as enjoyable as pairing it with a PC. He added that “It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn’t prioritise high-end GPUs” and even if “You can buy a US$ 6,000 Mac Pro with the top-of-the-line AMD FirePro D700, (and) it still doesn’t match our recommended specs”. However, Luckey did mention that if Apple ever decided to change how it picks out internals, Oculus would be happy to support Mac systems in the future. Currently, we don’t buy PCs or laptops because they can handle virtual reality systems – it isn’t vastly adoptable yet but one day you can bet that almost every person will have a VR headset. For gaming and learning, virtual reality takes our senses to places that previously were never possible. An easy fix for Mac users would be having dual-boot software installed and probably upping that AMD card to a Nvidia graphics card. On the other end,   are some ready built PCs that’ll be ready to handle any VR task. Question is, are we ready for VR? On a side note, you’ve gotta love moments like these, rest in peace Steve."

Further “leaked” specifications hinted towards a flagship device too, but thanks to Chinese certification agency TENAA, we now know for certain one fact is true — the R9 is not the flagship you’re looking for. Two devices passed through TENAA — the R9 and R9 Plus — revealing their internal specifications as well as the smartphone’s overall design. There was no Snapdragon 820 SoC, no Quad HD display, which means it’s no 2016 flagship. Instead, for the smaller R9, we get a 5.5-inch full HD 1080p AMOLED panel on the front. Inside, it’s powered by a 1.95GHz octa-core processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage. Keeping everything running is a 2,850 mAh battery. Although the processor’s model name isn’t mentioned, it’s fairly obvious that this isn’t a quad-core Snapdragon 820 chip as the SoC in the R9 is an octa-core unit. Moving on to the larger R9 Plus we find a larger 6-inch 1080p full HD AMOLED panel on the front, with a 1.8GHz octa-core processor thrumming away inside. Paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage and a large 4,120 mAh battery, the R9 Plus is definitely the one with a better spec sheet — still no Snapdragon 820 in sight. Teased as a camera-centric phone, the R9 duo definitely packs the specifications to back that up as they feature two 16-megapixel cameras — one on the front and one on the back — with an LED flash. Besides that, both smartphones feature support for dual SIM 4G LTE connectivity and a rounded metal body. That’s not all, the smartphones will be sporting a front-mounted fingerprint sensor tucked under an oval home button. We can’t tell from the pictures if it is a physical button, but there is a coloured chrome frame around the button which suggests that it could. This would be the first time OPPO has mounted a fingerprint sensor on the front. Both smartphones will also come running Android Lollipop out-of-the-box.

A user states that once the smartphone hits some water if you decide to charge it without letting it dry, a warning message will tell you that the charging port is still damp. So no charging till it’s fully dry. Are you mad? Well if you’re ever in the same position, don’t be. Just be thankful the South Korean manufacturers decided to ensure that your device doesn’t go boom or bust by short circuiting. You wouldn’t be too thrilled about being phoneless now would you?

An experience people everywhere are looking for this year. An experience that will probably define the rest of this year’s technological advancements. It’s an attractive notion, being able to completely immerse yourself in whatever content it is you’re consuming — be it gaming or videos — and if you add the 360-degree element to that, you can essentially travel the world from the comfort of your home. It then comes as no surprise that 2016 is the year of Virtual Reality or VR. Put on a pair of VR goggles and boom, you’re in another world. Pop in your headphones and you can basically ignore everything that is going on outside of the virtual reality you’ve created for yourself. Now   immersion. The   pretty much set the stage for VR in 2016, with gigantic electronics developers like   and   offering VR experiences with their flagship devices. But, those devices are expensive and so are the accessories they come with — putting it out of reach for the budget-to-midrange consumer. Well,   wants to help the little guy out with their newly launched   and   — two smartphones that have been purpose built to give users the ultimate VR experience. The Vibe X3 is the better equipped of the two devices, sporting a large 5.5-inch full HD display on the front with a Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor clocked at 1.5GHz, paired with 3GB of RAM and 32 GB of expandable internal storage powering it on the inside. For optics, it gets a 21-megapixel Sony camera on the rear packing PDAF, with an 8MP front-facing selfie shooter. Giving it juice will be a large 3,500 mAh battery. It’s also got a bunch of nifty features like a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and support for 4G LTE. But perhaps the best feature is the dual Dolby Atmos front-facing stereo speakers that has support for Hi-Fi 3.0 thanks to OPA1612 amplifiers from Texas Instruments. Rounding up the duo is the more budget-friendly Vibe K4 Note. Also known as the A7010, this device features a 5.5-inch full HD IPS panel tucked under Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 on the front. Inside, it packs a modest MediaTek MT6753 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. The camera is a step down from Vibe X3, sporting a 13-megapixel sensor on the rear with PDAF and a fast f/2.2 aperture, plus a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. Perhaps the best feature of all is the dual Dolby Atmos front-facing stereo speakers tucked into the top and bottom corners of the relatively thin bezel. It’s awesome that Lenovo decided to strap a pair of front-facing stereo speakers to their mid-range device, what more a Dolby Atmos enabled one. Keeping the lights on is a modest 3,300 mAh battery. Lenovo unveiled something called TheaterMax, a feature baked into both Vibe devices launched today that is supposed to immerse their audience in a widescreen cinematic experience with the aid of the Lenovo ANTVR headset. Both Vibe devices are the first in Lenovo’s line to incorporate the Lenovo VR technology that lets users view any content — be it movies, TV shows or games — on a super-sized virtual screen. How good Lenovo’s VR tech actually is, remains to be seen — and be sure we will definitely be testing these out later. I think it’s pretty cool that they’re trying to bring a good VR experience to a lower-to-mid point in the market. That said, even without the VR component the Vibe devices are pretty attractive handsets on their own. With the Vibe X3 going for RM1,899 and the K4 Note going for RM999, they’re a pretty good deal for the specs, especially that K4 Note with front-facing speakers. Both smartphones will also come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovo’s Vibe UI running on top. The Lenovo ANTVR will be available today onwards for RM99, but you can get it bundled as a free add-on when you purchase either the Lenovo Vibe X3 or the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note at selected stores while stocks last. If you did notice, Lenovo has already   the Vibe X3 at authorised retailers, but this is the first time the K4 Note will be appearing on our shores. I think that being good value as standalone devices is a big plus for these devices as the “VR-enabled” part of Lenovo’s marketing can be treated as a nice little add-on that won’t make the device worse. In a way, it’s kind of like the   and its optional modules — the device’s success doesn’t   hinge on a single gimmicky feature."

Fortunately, the Galaxy S7 comes with a microSD expansion that supports up to 200GB. By right with Android Marshmallow, it could have supported adoptable storage, a feature that lets you “merge” both on-board and microSD card storage as a single entity. That would create more storage for apps since most applications and its data files are often restricted to on-board use.  According to Samsung, they have intentionally left out   to make file transfers using microSD card between phone and other devices possible. That’s quite true since adoptable storage will encrypt your microSD card and it will only work on your phone. Well, it’s not all that bad. Apparently the Galaxy S7 will let you move almost any application from your on-board storage to your microSD card. Droid-Life that has a working unit has   a variety of games and apps successfully onto their microSD card. To prove that this works, the apps are automatically removed when they took out the microSD card. So overall, this should be good news if we are stuck with just the 32GB storage version for the Galaxy S7 edge. In case you missed it, Samsung Malaysia is   the Galaxy S7 edge with pre-orders to start next week on 7th March. The device will be officially   on 18th March."

It seems like the World Organisation of Racing Drones (W.O.R.D.) is trying to emulate Red Bull’s Air Race on a smaller scale. The “pilots” of the drones are to fly in a “track” and in between obstacles. The racing drone will also be required to make one mandatory “pit stop”.  A drone racing team comprises of four or more members with a pilot, navigator, pit stop crew or technician and etc. Based on the video that the organizers have just outed, we can kind of put together that these drones will fly through markers – much like Red Bull’s Air Race. Sadly, there won’t be any MacLarens involved. In an extended FAQ, there’s a mention of a “Joker Lane” which would seem to add another thrilling element to it all. We’re expecting it to be something like a flying Mario Kart, with shortcuts and environmental obstacles but with proper safety measures and rules put in place. Two days’ worth of qualifying rounds of the World Drone Prix will begin on the 7  of March with 100 teams vying for the top 32 spots that’ll actually hit the “race track” on the 11  and 12  of the same month.

Well, Samsung are launching a pre-order offer for their latest flagship that will let you pick up a Galaxy S7 edge before the official launch on 18 March. Samsung really struck a home run with both their Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge flagship devices. They did such a good job with shoring up the Galaxy S6’s weaknesses that we think it’s a near perfect smartphone. Unfortunately, Malaysia is only getting the edge variant, meaning a higher price of RM3,099 — which is exactly the same price as the Galaxy S6 edge when it first launched. However, if you’re one of the first 1,000 customers to pre-order the device from 7-11 March 2016, Samsung will be throwing in a 20% discount, bringing the price down to RM2,479.20, plus a free 128GB microSD card and an additional year’s extended warranty. If you’re interested in this deal: Upon order confirmation, buyers can collect their Galaxy S7 edge on 17th of March, one day before the offical device launch date of 18th March. Among the duo, the Galaxy S7 edge definitely has the more attractive feature set. Edging out its little brother, the Galaxy S7, the edge variant bundles all the goodies that come with the standard model plus that sexy dual-edge screen and all the features that come with it. To recap, the Galaxy S7 edge proudly displays its 5.5-inch Quad HD (2560×1440 pixels) SuperAMOLED dual-edge curved panel on the front, right above the fingerprint sensor cum home button. Inside, this monster flagship is powered by Samsung’s latest and greatest Exynos 8890 octa-core processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage via a hybrid SIM tray. Imaging is perhaps the Galaxy S7 edge’s greatest asset with Samsungs brand new Dual Pixel 12-megapixel f/1.7 primary camera unit mounted on the back. It boasts up to 95% brighter photos and a near instantaneous focusing speed in any lighting condition. On the front, the selfie shooter is maintained at 5MP but the camera now gets a faster f/1.7 aperture lens. Other improvements include an IP68 water resistant rating and an always-on display that can that show useful information like your calendar, the time and personalised notifications.

For an aspirational brand like Apple, they aren’t really that active especially on Twitter. Sure they have a few accounts like   and  , but they are mostly one way channels to promote their products and services.  With Apple continuing to break sales records for every release of its new product, the Cupertino company appears to be openning its doors for better customer interaction. Finally they have just created a new   twitter account to directly address customer questions as soon as possible. The account will be used to share tips and tricks for your iDevice from time to time. So whether you have a software or hardware problem, you can send a tweet to @AppleSupport and you’ll get a response almost immediately. From the looks of it, they are   to various questions on Twitter. It is almost like having an Apple Store Genius Bar on twitter 24/7. Of course, most brands have been doing this across their respective markets but it’s still better late than never.  The Cupertino company is certainly stepping up its customer service. Apart from having an online customer support, they are also in the process of   its Genius Bar appointment system. Instead of walking in and setting a specific time, the Apple Stores in the US will adopt a new “Concierge” service where they will prioritise your request by urgency. For example, a repair for a cracked screen will be attended before a customer having minor software issues.  After registering with the system, they will send a text on estimated wait times and they will text you again once your turn is coming up next. Finally they will text you that your technician is ready and where you can locate them in the store. This is faster than the current appointment system and you can walk around the mall while waiting for your turn.

Josh and Peter from YouTube’s   have built a remote-controlled version of that very flying balloon house. Okay, granted, you won’t be able to fit anyone into that tiny lighter-than-air remote-controlled balloon house, but it is a working, flying, miniature replica of that very house from Up. In fact, they printed the paper cutout from   and strapped some salvaged propellers from a previous X-Wing flying toy to allow it to be controlled. Then, they hooked everything up to a set of helium balloons and voila a house big enough to carry the little kid inside you to an imaginary Paradise Falls. Although this RC house is pretty cool, unless you’ve got some spare RC propellers lying around, it’s going to be rather hard for the average person to build this themselves. So, someone please come up with a pre-made kit? Besides the flying balloon house, FliteTest also featured a pair of remote-controlled gliders carved out of balsa wood and controlled by some salvaged RC parts from other planes. The gliders fly remarkably well, even getting up to a pretty decent speed while maintaining a stable glide. Very impressive considering both the planes were constructed  by a 15-year-old out of leftover parts from old toys. Pretty cool that what some people consider broken toys, others can reuse to build their own flying machines. One man’s trash is another’s treasure?

The new update to Maps adds two new features. The first is the ability to add stops to your existing journey, for example, if you need to top up on some fuel or head to a shop for a spot of grocery shopping on your way home from work. To do so simply hit the search icon (magnifying glass) during your navigation and it will bring up several suggestions like gas stations, restaurants, coffee shops, among others, as well as an option to search for more places. If you select one of the categories, let’s say gas stations, Maps will look for petrol stations along or close to your route and bring them up for you to choose from. They’ve even indicated how much time the detour would add to your total journey. Once you’ve decided, tap the location and hit “Add stop” and Maps will navigate you accordingly. Pretty nifty if that fuel warning light suddenly pops on. Next, Google incorporated some handy 3D Touch shortcuts to the Maps app as well. By hard-pressing on the Maps icon, it will let you either navigate to “Home” or navigate to “Work”. Not nearly as extensive as the 3D Touch features on the Apple Maps app, but useful nonetheless.

With  , though, this process is slightly less jarring as the quirky company’s selection of wearables boasts battery lives of up to 10 days. To make the switch even easier, two of their newest wearable devices just got a pretty significant price cut. Pebble announced on their blog that the   and P  will both be receiving USD50 price cuts, bringing their price down to USD149.99 (around RM620) and USD199.99 (around RM828) respectively. If you have placed an order at pebble.com on or after 21st January 2016 for a watch affected by the new pricing, Pebble will adjust the charge to match the new price. Simply drop them an email at order@pebble.com with the subject line “Price Adjustment” before 1st April 2016 and include the original order number or the email you ordered with, in your request. That’s a pretty good bargain especially if you take into consideration how fully featured these smartwatches are. But, one of their stand-out features has to be their battery lives. The super thin Pebble Time Round can last a good 2 days on a single charge while the much beefier Pebble Time can achieve about 7 days (realistically 5). This is thanks to the e-Paper display that the Pebble watches use, which is a much more power efficient display technology. Perhaps a dealbreaker for many when it comes to the Pebble line is the lack of a touch-capable display — resorting to buttons to navigate the watch’s UI. Nevertheless, it isn’t enough to pull focus from the other awesome features you get with a Pebble device, like the standard 22mm or 14mm bands that you can interchange with any other standard band of the same size.

Following its time limited   promo, Digi has announced its new postpaid plan that’s now simply called Digi postpaid.  You still get the choice between more internet or more calls and text, but they have enhanced their plans with more internet up to 20GB per month. On top of that, they have also introduced internet rollover, which allows you to carry forward unused internet quota to the following month.  
 For internet-centric users, you have a choice of 6 plans ranging from 1GB per month and all the way up to 20GB a month. For its entry RM28/month plan, it is slightly more expensive than the current SmartPlan 25 that comes with 1GB of internet, but you get 50mins of calls and 50 SMS bundled in, plus the ability to carry forward 500MB of data. Hitting the middle sweet spot is the RM68/month plan that comes with 6GB of data, 150 mins calls, 150 SMS and you’re allowed to carry forward up to 2GB of internet per month.  For the ultimate data quota, the highest plan at RM238/month offers 20GB of internet, 1000 minutes of calls and 1000 SMS per month. It also allows you to carry forward up to 9GB per month. At the same price, the current SmartPlan 238 offers 12GB of internet (inclusive of 2GB promo) but it comes with unlimited phone calls and SMS.  
 For those who love to talk and text a lot, the “more calls” option is skewed towards unlimited phone calls for its RM68/month plan and above. Similar to its current SmartPlan 75 offering, the RM78/month new Postpaid option also gives you 7GB of data per month (rollover up to 2GB) and unlimited phone calls. For free flow of calls and the most internet, the most expensive RM218/month option gives you unlimited calls, unlimited SMS and 13GB of data.  Like most good things, the highest 3 options are only available for a limited time only. So if you’re interested, you would need to sign up before 30th June 2016.  
 For international travellers, you now have a cheaper option to stay connected. For the “budget traveller”, you can enjoy unlimited instant messaging at RM10/day via selected operators. If you need unrestricted internet access, the “frequent traveller” option at RM36/day gives you unlimited internet usage for a fixed price. Similar to Maxis, you can enable roaming without manual operator selection and you don’t have to worry about bill shocks for connecting to the wrong network partner. It is funny that they are calling it budget and frequent traveller respectively as your travel habits don’t necessary reflect your data consumption. Note that these new offering are only available for Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, China, Hongkong, Taiwan, South Korea and Australia."

Rory Lee,P9 to be the first Huawei device with Leica lenses?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/02/p9-to-be-the-first-huawei-device-with-leica-lenses/,"Android,Evan Blass,evleaks,huawei,Huawei P9,Huawei P9 hands on,Huawei P9 leak,Huawei P9 Leica lens,P9 dual camera,smartphone","Android,huawei,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-03-02,"‘s upcoming   flagship has been a hot topic in the rumour mill with previous rumours suggesting that the device could feature up at least   ranging from a budget “Lite” to a high end “performance” device and even a larger “Plus” variant. There were even rumours of a dual camera setup adorning the back of the device. Thanks to serial leakster  , who shared several hands-on pictures of the upcoming device on VentureBeat, we have confirmation of at least one of those rumours. Care to guess which one? According to the  , the images are that of the standard P9 variant and are courtesy of an unnamed individual who was given some hands-on time with the smartphone. Although the individual refused to be named, @evleaks has been rather accurate in the past with his leaks obtained from anonymous sources. Either way, if the images are really that of the P9, they confirm that the upcoming flagship device will indeed sport a dual-camera setup at the back of the device. From the looks of things, both cameras seem to be sporting the same sensor, which lends credence to an   stating that it would have two 12-megapixel shooters. The overall look and placement of flash plus laser autofocus also lines up with earlier leaked renders of the device, though the smartphone’s design, in general, looks a lot more polished than in the renders. Huawei first debuted their dual-camera setup on the honor 6 Plus — of which the dual-sensors offered useful features like post-capture refocus and simulated aperture adjustment — and are looking to refine that with the P9. Dubbed the second-generation of the honor 6 Plus’ dual camera setup, the P9’s snappers are two 12-megapixel sensors paired with   lenses that should enable even more unique capabilities. It is rather curious, that if those lenses are indeed Leica-made, why the P9 doesn’t feature any Leica branding at all. You’d think that Huawei would want to highlight that as a big feature considering their high profile   with the camera-maker. That said, this may not be the final product as it is completely devoid of any branding, not even Huawei’s own, or markings at all. Worth noting is that these images do line up with a previous leak on   where the P9 was also caught on camera, only that time there was a case over it to mask any design features. They did reveal the placement of key features such as the camera module and fingerprint scanner. As they line up rather perfectly, it is very likely that this leak by VentureBeat is the real deal. Besides images, the source also revealed some specifications of the device. Apparently, the smartphone will feature a 5.2-inch full HD display on the front and be powered by Huawei’s Kirin 950 processor mated with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Giving the smartphone juice is a large 3,900 mAh battery — a rare sight especially in such a thin smartphone with a small screen size. The handset is also said to come with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box, which is unsurprising considering the   also comes with Marshmallow with an EMUI 4.0 skin on top. Pictures also reveal that the P9 will be Huawei’s first flagship that isn’t a Nexus to sport a reversible USB Type-C port. Other goodies include a fingerprint sensor mounted on the back, something that has become a staple on Huawei flagships."

The 6 fibre pair and 7,500 KM long Asia Submarine Cable Express (ASE) located off Singapore is currently identified as the culprit and it affects 2 fibre pairs of TM’s own  . The remaining 4 pairs belong to NTT, StarHub and PLDT.  The repair will require collaborative efforts from consortium members and it is only scheduled to commence on 25th March with expected completion on 31st March.

A simple feature, but a feature WhatsApp has not supported before this. In the past, if you wanted to send a document, a simple “hack” many employed was to change the extension of the file to a supported file type, send it over via WhatsApp and have the other person change the extension back. Now, a simple tap on the paperclip icon would bring up a the option to send docs. But, WhatsApp didn’t just add the option to the existing 6 types of shareable media, instead, they removed the “Video” option to make way for “Document”. This is a great addition as it brings WhatsApp in line with other apps like Telegram that support sending and receiving documents via chat. However, the biggest difference in WhatsApp’s implementation is that you can only send PDF files. Yep, no .docx for you yet, unfortunately. Another little ding in WhatsApp’s new addition is the fact that   devices don’t seem to be supported yet. Our   can receive PDF files sent from   devices, but it can’t send PDF files of its own. The same is also true for our   running  , but that’s less surprising since WhatsApp already   that support for BB10 would stop at the end of 2016. You will still be able to send video via the “Gallery” option as usual, so the only thing you’re missing is the option to record a video directly from the app and share it. WhatsApp didn’t include this particular update in their changelog but this isn’t the first time they’ve “ninja-released” a new feature either. Backup to Google Drive was also a feature that was quietly rolled out before finally being included in the app’s latest changelog as a feature. Then again, seeing how limited and incomplete the feature still seems to be so far, it isn’t too surprising then that WhatsApp decided to keep it off their changelog in the meantime.

At 12.9 inches, it can be a little tricky to hold and use in one hand which may have turned some off it. Still, that didn’t stop it from   Microsoft’s entire Surface lineup in Q4 of 2015. If the only thing stopping you from picking one up yourself is the size, we have good news for you because it looks like Apple has plans to launch a 9.7-inch iPad Pro. What everyone thought was going to be the  , may actually turn out to be a smaller iPad Pro as 9to5Mac  . It is said to come with the same monstrous A9X processor, quad speakers and compatibility with the   and   which should translate to pretty stellar performance figures. Despite what seems like a bump up the   hierarchy, 9to5Mac says that the smaller iPad Pro will be priced closer to the  ‘s line of products. If this turns out to be true, it looks like Apple could be replacing the iPad Air line with this tablet, thus tightening and streamlining its iPad lineup. We like this move as it only brings less confusion to buyers, it also usually means that each product would be more focused and precise, allowing it to be clearly differentiated from others in the line. It is also said that Apple could discontinue the first-generation iPad Air and   when this new mini iPad Pro supposedly launches in Apple’s March event. Other things to look out for during that event is the unveiling of the purported smaller 4-inch   plus new   band options. As mentioned earlier, performance should be unaffected, and since they’re bringing over the iPad Pro’s excellent quad speakers and display, media consumption and gaming should be better than ever now that it’s in a more portable form factor. That said, shrinking the size down to 9.7 inches seems like it would go against the design philosophy Apple had for their iPad Pro line where Tim Cook himself said would be a   2-in-1 device. A smaller screen means less real estate for multitasking and productivity tasks, thus hampering its capability as a workhorse. It seems to be an interesting turn of events then, but keep in mind that these aren’t officially confirmed specifications though 9to5Mac has a reputation for being fairly reliable with such information. Nevertheless, do take this with a pinch of salt. What do you think about this move from Apple? Were you anxiously waiting for the iPad Air 3? Drop us a comment down below."

Simple but painful decisions must be made to keep with the times and it looks like Leica have bitten the proverbial bait and taken their first step into the new world. Leica needs no introduction. Anyone who has even a remote interest in photography or cameras would have probably heard of this legendary brand.

Well, we hope, better smartphone cameras. Huawei has proven that they can build premium devices, but I’ve always felt that their cameras leave some to be desired. Now with Leica though, they might have just shored up one of their bigger weaknesses with one of the biggest names in photography. That said, I find it a little much to think that they would be able to “reinvent” something that has almost been perfected by manufacturers like   and  .

Xiaomi’s formidable Redmi starlet is equipped with a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor (renamed from the 618). It’s six cores that are 64-bit enabled run at 1.8GHz while it matches up with an Adreno 510 GPU. The latter allows the Redmi Note 3 to support VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and its functionality is to improve call quality to unprecedented levels. Brimming gloriously while being surrounded by its metal back, a 16-megapixel rear sensor sits on top. On paper, it has an aperture of f/2.0 and PDAF (Phase Detection Autofocus). Just below the dual-LED flash module, you’ll locate a rounded fingerprint sensor that handles any biometric security requests. Meanwhile, the front gets a decent 5-megapixel shutter. In its homeland China, the Redmi Note 3 comes in two versions: a 2GB/16GB model and a 3GB/32GB model. The differences only lie in the smartphone’s RAM and internal storage, otherwise, you’ll find a 4,050mAh battery and MIUI 7 running the show as well. Folks in mainland China pay 999 Yuan (RM 641.50) for the 2GB/16GB variant while the main branch has yet to announce pricing on the top end model. We’ve got our fingers crossed that the larger RAM and storage model heads our way. Drop us a comment to share with us what you think of the Redmi Note 3 Pro, is it worth the wait?"

From the looks of it, Samsung might be sticking to a single model approach by bringing only the Galaxy S7 edge to Malaysia. It is the higher spec of the two as it comes with a larger 5.5″ Quad HD double curved display and has a bigger 3,600mAh battery. We are surprised that Samsung is dropping the standard Galaxy S7 for Malaysia but it isn’t the first time the Korean electronics giant has done this. For example, the   isn’t available in Europe and the UK, leaving them with just the Galaxy S6 edge+. Who knows, they might release the standard S7 in Malaysia at a later phase.  So what could this mean for us? If you want the latest Samsung flagship, you probably need to fork out a bit more since the Galaxy S7 edge is the more premium sibling of the two. To refresh your memory, the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge was   in Malaysia at RM2,599 and RM3,099 respectively. We reckon the S7 edge is likely to be priced lower than the S6 edge previously, but it will be definitely above the RM2,500 mark.  Which S7 would you choose? Leave your comments down below."

As posted in their ASUS  , the following devices will be updated very soon: Generally, if you’re using the higher end ZenFone 2 (ZE550ML/ZE551ML) or newer, you should be eligible to upgrade. Strangely the entry-level 5″ ZenFone 2 (ZE500CL) isn’t listed while the older Snapdragon 801 powered   (PF500KL) is in line to receive the software update. Once you’ve made the switch to Marshmallow, the OS will make Google Messenger, Calendar and Gmail as the default application. If you perform a factory reset, the previous ASUS Messenger, ASUS Mail and ASUS Calendar is still available from the Google Play store.

Well, two and a half, if we’re being real here. If it wasn’t clear before it will be now as popular messaging application   is stopping support for several older operating systems, including one that had its latest phone launch in Malaysia less than a year ago. WhatsApp’s official blog reveals that as part of keeping with the times and to give them an easier time to implement more features, the Facebook-owned messaging application will be sticking to Android, iOS and Windows Phone operating systems moving forward. That means that they will be stopping support for Nokia’s S40 and S60 Symbian platforms, old Android 2.1 (Eclair) and Android 2.2 (Froyo), Windows Phone 7.1, and finally   — including   — by the end of this year (2016). This must be disheartening for BlackBerry fans to hear, especially those who decided to pick up the   that was   May of last year. If you couple that with the fact that even BlackBerry themselves seem to be abandoning their proprietary OS with a shift towards Android, things aren’t looking up for BB fans. WhatsApp is one of the most used applications — and the most used instant messaging application based on   — in Malaysia, so terminating support for relatively new devices that run on BlackBerry 10 must be painful for those on the OS. Nevertheless, this is potentially good news for the rest of us who use Android, iOS or Windows Phone devices because since WhatsApp are streamlining their support, we can expect a more focused approach to development. Without the worry of compatibility or limitation across too many platforms, more features can be added to the messaging system. This move by WhatsApp is definitely understandable, as they explain that 99.5% of mobile sales are of devices that run either Google, Apple or Microsoft’s operating systems. It wouldn’t make sense to keep supporting operating systems that almost nobody buys anymore, but couldn’t they held off on the BlackBerry 10 cut at least for awhile longer?"

Despite the decline in  , Samsung is still continuing to push more tablets with a 2016 refresh of its   and   series. The Galaxy Tab A is their productivity tablet with an S-Pen while the Galaxy Tab E is their affordable tablet offering. 
 From the pictures leaked by @evleaks, the design is pretty much the same slab like any other Galaxy Tablets. The only noticable change is the texture of the back which appears to be having a fine dotted grain for the Tab A while the Tab E goes for a faux leather look. Spec-wise, Sammobile mentions that it will likely get a modest 7″ display with a quad-core 1.3GHz processor with just 1.5GB RAM to go.  We hope this time Samsung will give the display a bump as the   is doing a very low 1024×768 pixels resolution. It will also get an S Pen, at least 8GB of storage with microSD expansion, 5MP + 2MP camera combos and a 4,000mAh battery.   
 For the affordable Galaxy Tab E, there’s no details of its specs yet but don’t expect anything spectular from this entry-level tablet. At the moment, Samsung is taking 13.7% market share in the tablet segment at No. 2, right behind Apple with 24.5% market share. As smartphones are getting bigger, the next growth of tablets are convertibles like the iPad Pro, Microsoft Surface Pro and most recently the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S.

However, if you did subscribe to Netflix locally, there is no doubt that you would have noticed how  . To gain access to more of Netflix’s catalogue, people defaulted to using a VPN (Virtual Private Network), but Netflix wasn’t too happy about that. In fact, they vowed to   on VPN usage, a vow they have apparently made solid on. If a recent thread on Reddit is to be believed, Netflix is already flexing its VPN-blocking muscles as users in several countries in Europe and even the United States are running into an error when they try to access the streaming service via a VPN. According to user  , when accessing the site with a VPN, users will trigger a streaming error (M7111-1331-5059), which blocks them from accessing the content. A report by GHacks.net also   that they’re experiencing the same problem when accessing Netflix via a VPN, though curiously their error code begins with an H, not the letter M described by u/eduazy, as can be seen in this screenshot. In a world of strict licensing rules and regulations, this move by Netflix stems from their desire to keep their content locked based on geographical location. This makes sense from a business standpoint because if you’re a local broadcaster who as the rights to publish a show, you wouldn’t want some foreign streaming service butting in and taking a cut out of your audience. However, this seems to be an outdated notion. As the world becomes more connected, it doesn’t make much sense to force users to maintain multiple subscriptions just so they can watch a particular TV series. By enforcing such strict licensing rules, broadcasters may have just forced users into pirating something many would gladly pay for if it was in a more accessible medium, as user  : And that’s just one side of the coin. US citizens are also forced to use a VPN to access their local Netflix content simply because many ISPs there throttle their connection speeds when they access the streaming site. Why? All of this is part of a long discussion about Net Neutrality which you can find out more about from Last Week Tonight’s episode about it  , or this informative comic drawn by TheOatmeal  . In a nutshell, Net Neutrality is the idea that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally by ISPs — something they haven’t been doing in the first place. Instead, some ISPs throttle user’s connection speeds to streaming sites like Netflix to save bandwidth. US netizens who are victims of such throttling use a VPN to disguise their traffic, hiding the fact that it is a video stream from the ISP’s filters, or as  : That way, they can actually use the speed they paid for to view the content that they also paid for — something they can’t do now, thank’s to Netflix’s VPN ban hammer. Granted, it isn’t Netflix’s fault that ISPs are intentionally throttling connection speeds, plus Netflix is only doing what is required in the licensing laws. That said, it is through their actions that many paying customers who have legally (almost) been enjoying the content they paid for may now have to resort to piracy to get their entertainment fix."

Wait, so it isn’t going to be a new OPPO flagship? It is said that the device will sport a flagship Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor mated to either 3GB or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable (up to 128GB via microSD) internal storage. Those are mighty high-end specs for a device that is supposed to be in the midrange category. What’s more, it is purported to sport a massive 6-inch Quad HD display (2560×1440 pixels) plus a fingerprint scanner. For optics, the device is supposed to pack a 21-megapixel sensor at the back with a 13-megapixel front-facing selfie snapper. Keeping everything running will be a large 3,700 mAh battery. Being a new device, the R9 is rumoured to come with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box though there have been rumours that the device could come with Android Lollipop instead. OPPO had a fairly quiet showing at the recent   in Barcelona, not opting to reveal any devices. Instead, they showcased two technological innovations, the first   — which can fully charge a smartphone in 15 minutes — and a new   with 3-axis image stabilisation. With such a tame MWC, one would think that they would want to come out swinging with a brand new flagship device, not an R series smartphone. An incredibly powerful R device, but an R line smartphone nonetheless. To make matters worse, an R line smartphone would likely mean the same design cues (which have even spread to the  ) — a design which we think everyone has had more than enough of. However, a curious entry on our SIRIM database reveals something rather interesting. The entry, bearing the model number X9009, hit the certification centre awhile back and if we’re looking at the previous Find 7’s model number (X9007) this entry would indicate that this phone is the Find 9, not the R9. This could mean one of two things. First, that OPPO are tightening their product line, cutting off the Find series smartphones and bundling them together with the R series, or OPPO are planning to launch two phones in close succession and only one of those devices will be coming to Malaysia at a time. The former seems to be the more reasonable of the two as the rumoured specifications on the R9 are definitely high end enough to be called a flagship device. But, that also seems unlikely as smartphone manufacturers rarely kill off their flagship line. It would be as if   axed the  series in favour of their   line. Then again, Sony did just axe their Xperia Z line, so I guess anything is possible? Either way, this is all still speculation so take it with the appropriate amount of salt.

For the  , Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store have at least 1.2 million apps each – Windows? Only 300,000. Redmond wanted to solve this, by introducing a Windows Bridge platform aka Project Astoria. Through the project, app developers could easily just port over the same Android code that they used to make apps for the Google Play Store for Windows Phone devices. Then, last year rumours flared up that Project Astoria was going bust and now Microsoft has confirmed it themselves. Their statement follows: Acquiring Xamarin is a shortcut but a painful one, considering all the hours spent trying to make Astoria come to life. Microsoft acquisition by default makes Astoria an overkill, as Xamarin does the same thing across not one but three platforms. That kills coding problems associated with porting from Android and iOS in one shot. So sharing the same common code makes a cross-platform app release be a much easier task.

Malaysian MVNO TuneTalk has sprung out of nowhere to announce “TuneTalk 8G” at  . So what is this 8G TuneTalk is shouting about? Is it a network breakthrough or just a marketing gimmick?  The enabler of Tune Talk 8G is based on a technology by Malaysian-based company called SWAG. That’s short for Super WiFi Anywhere you Go. Their solution is to provide the best and fastest internet connectivity possible from the current 4G LTE networks around you. This sounds similar to   on 4G LTE-Advance but it cuts across different telcos. Imagine surfing mobile internet utilising bandwidth from several 4G connections at the same time.  Obviously, you’ll need a special MiFi-like device and the   showed a compact device that has 2 LAN ports at the back. It looks better than the “Tune Talk 8G” device at the top, which looks like a bulky tumbler. In terms of speed, Tune Talk claims it could deliver up to 160Mbps and an average of 66Mbps during congested peak-hour situations. This was tested around KL Sentral in Malaysia.  To prove its capability, they have uploaded a video speedtest with four 4G LTE connections on Digi, Tune Talk (Celcom), Maxis and U Mobile. We suggest viewing it at full screen at Full HD. While the idea is great, this is far from “8G speeds”, if there’s one defined in the first place. At 160Mbps, that’s faster than what   on LTE-A in Malaysia but it still falls under 4G speeds. Even Qualcomm is making   possible with its latest LTE modem. For TuneTalk to claim 8G is just a marketing gimmick and it is quite misleading since there’s no explanation of what 8G stands for? 4G + 4G = 8G perhaps? Another question mark would be the cost of utilising 4 different telcos. Tune Talk might be able to strike a deal for bulk data access but we doubt Maxis, Digi and U Mobile would let their competitor utilise their LTE bandwidth for cheap."

Here are the seven things you need to know about the Xiaomi Mi 5. Since its a flagship, it isn’t surprising that Xiaomi has loaded the new Mi 5 with as much of the cutting edge tech that they could and their efforts have yielded what looks like the most powerful Xiaomi device ever. This 5.15-inch full HD device packs the new Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with up to 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 128 GB of UFS 2.0 flash storage. Xiaomi claims that the Mi 5 posted a blistering AnTuTu benchmark of 142,084 which completely   anything produced by last year’s flagships. It looks like a seriously fast phone, however, it is worth noting that the base model Mi 5’s processor is clocked at a lower 1.8GHz as opposed to the other two’s 2.15GHz. With their premium flagship, Xiaomi have also introduced an advanced 4-axis optical image stabiliser (OIS) to help the Mi 5’s 16MP f/2.0 primary camera eliminate handshake blur. In their demo video above, they compared it to the unstabilised iPhone 6S and the OIS-enabled iPhone 6S Plus, revealing stunning results. This may well be the best smartphone camera Xiaomi have ever produced. Despite the  ,   and  ‘s excellent build quality, when people think of Xiaomi, they still associate its phones with the kind of cheap plasticky finish that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  Well, Xiaomi is hoping to completely shed that belief with the Mi 5 because it sports a truly impressive build quality."

Apparently folks in seven countries have been  ’s lab rats, testing the extended “reactions” with positive feedback going all around.  It took Facebook a good year but at least, there will be less misplaced positive vibes and more emotionally appropriate reactions as it launches across Android, iOS and browsers. How will you get to see these new reactions? Just hover over the “Like” button and it’ll expand to show the other reactions, that includes: Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry. Notifications coming in too will change, with it stating someone has “reacted” to a post rather than just “liked” a post. The research that went into fundamentally deciding which reactions would make the cut went as far as looking at people’s one-word reactions on posts (yes, Facebook was spying on us). They also looked at the feelings most displays through their sticker options. Launching a feature across all 1.44 billion active users will take more than a couple of days but be on the lookout for a new update for those on Android and iOS. Users on browsers will just have to patiently wait, as the desktop updates usually just happen gradually. When Engadget asked why “dislike” wasn’t on the list Facebook’s Product Manager had this to say “It would have been too binary”. He adds that the whole point of adding reactions was to make expressions multi-dimensional. We all would appreciate a “dislike” button would we not? Here’s one just for the sake of it!"

When the Siri button is clicked, a dark, transparent Siri interface will appear at the top right corner. The colourful sound waves like those on the iPhone, indicating speech input, will also appear on the interface. Another interesting feature is that the “Hey Siri” command will also be available on OS X. When your device is plugged into power, it will work much like it does on the current iPhone and iPad models.

Both showed off their flagship smartphones vying for your attention and, of course, your hard earned cash. But between the two devices, I think the LG G5 is a bigger deal than the Galaxy S7, and here’s why. LG’s G5 showcases a seriously attractive alternative to current smartphone conventions. It is the most innovative product I’ve seen at this year’s Mobile World Congress. The G5 is, essentially, the pioneer in a new breed of smartphones — one that could very well change the way manufacturers make phones and change the expectations we, the consumers, have for smartphones. It blew my mind because of one simple reason: It is, in essence, a modular smartphone and it is because of this that I think the G5 has the edge over the Galaxy S7. I won’t deny that the   and   are absolutely fantastic smartphones —  , even — but, in building the Galaxy S7, Samsung went down a familiar path. Samsung took a successful formula — the Galaxy S6 — and improved virtually every aspect of it. As a result, you get a phone that’s immensely capable but one that does very little to change the game. LG, on the other hand, went all out with their brand new G5. They went with a completely redesigned form from the older  , while at the same time, rewriting the smartphone playbook with its modular design. The modular smartphone, a concept introduced by   in 2013, is still some time away and while the actual vision of a smartphone that you build, customise and upgrade like a Lego set is far from the G5’s modular capabilities, this is a starting point. LG can only improve on this modular idea in future releases. While the LG G5 isn’t completely modular, thanks to its removable bottom panel, you can change the capabilities of the device. On launch day, LG showed two modules — a dedicated camera control module and a Hi-Fi DAC (Digital-to-Analog Controller) plus amp — which demonstrate some of the features you can add to your smartphone."

It is an automatic roaming package that activates once you make or receive a call overseas with your local number. In addition to the unlimited calls and SMS, Maxis are also throwing in 500MB of roaming data per day on top of your existing data quota. If this isn’t enough or if you run out of quota, you can purchase additional data at the same rate as it would be in Malaysia. Keep in mind that this plan automatically activates once you have international roaming charges that exceed RM10. Otherwise, you will be charged accordingly. From the looks of it, this is a one-of-a-kind plan by Maxis, bundling unlimited calls and SMS when roaming plus the ability to use your existing local data quota overseas. Comparatively, the other telcos are only offering unlimited daily data roaming for about the same price. Perhaps the best part is that all of this is done automatically, even the selection of roaming networks. Simply turn on data roaming and Maxis will connect to their preferred roaming partners saving you the headache of manually choosing the operators and accidental exorbitant charges when you connect to the wrong network. This definitely eliminates a lot of potential headaches, something you don’t need more of when travelling. The only drawback is that this is exclusive to MaxisONE postpaid plan subscribers, so others on the Maxis network, even MaxisONE Business (but more roaming offers are coming soon), who are not under the MaxisONE postpaid plan banner aren’t eligible for this. As icing on the cake, Maxis are also providing a travel insurance plan to all subscribers of the MaxisONE World plan. Once your plan has been activated, you will be eligible for the Travel Protection Plan which covers benefits like medical and accidental plus travel inconveniences like loss of travel documents, baggage and even baggage delay.

It’s simple and straight to the point while also giving potential job applicants a glimpse into the working environment and culture at the Maxis office. Based on the video, we learn that Maxis operates on a free-seating and open office layout — so no tiny cubicles that make you feel cut off from the world — with plenty of large open windows that let in a lot of natural light. With this free-seating arrangement, Marcus the app guy says you can sit next to a different person (or we’re guessing the same person as well) every single day if you wanted “even next to the CEO”.

Rory Lee,Xiaomi’s latest flagship smartphone is a stunning piece of kit,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/24/xiaomi-mi-5-official-launch-mwc-2016/,"Mi 5 MWC 2016,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016,Xiaomi,Xiaomi launch,Xiaomi launch MWC 2016,Xiaomi Mi 5,Xiaomi Mi 5 Launch","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2016-02-24,"The final flagship from MWC 2016 has dropped and it is from Chinese smartphone makers   with their brand new   — and it’s a beautiful beast. Several days before the official announcement, Xiaomi has been teasing the capabilities of the Mi 5,   where they posted pictures that their president Bin Lin had taken with the Mi 5 on his Lunar New Year holiday. They also launched a series of videos featuring record holders blitzing through tasks like jumping rope and solving a Rubik’s cube, emphasising the Mi 5’s speed. We also have the failed attempts from Hugo Barra, but I don’t think that has anything to do with the smartphone’s speed — at least I hope not. But now, we finally get to see if the Mi 5 really lives up to the expectations Xiaomi has set for it. For starters, the Mi 5 will sport a 5.15-inch full-HD near-bezel less Sunlight display on the front which Xiaomi seems to think makes a big difference over the 5.1-inch and 4.7-inch displays on both the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6S. On the inside, it will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest next-gen Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor paired with either 3GB or 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and a choice of 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of internal UFS 2.0 flash storage which Xiaomi says posts a blistering AnTuTu score of 142,084. The key point here is it doesn’t sport a microSD expansion slot, but with a 128GB option, things aren’t so bad. For optics, the device gets a 16MP rear-facing f/2.0 Sony IMX298 camera that sits flush at the back with PDAF, while a 4-megapixel 2 micron large pixel selfie shooter graces the front. The primary camera features a 4-axis OIS, which you can check out in this video: Other features include a front fingerprint scanner, dual-SIM, LTE-Advanced and VoLTE support, Bluetooth 4.0 and support for NFC with MIUI 7 running on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow preinstalled. Keeping everything running is a moderate 3,000 mAh battery with Quick-Charge 3.0 via USB Type-C. 
 One unique thing about the Xiaomi Mi 5 is the fact that it sports what Xiaomi calls “3D ceramic glass” which forms the back of the phone. At the front it’s glass as usual with a metal frame holding both panels together. It also has a slight curve on the back much like the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy Note 5 including Xiaomi’s own  . The device will come in three colours — Black, White and Gold (which has an exclusive back etched design) — and prices are as follows: These devices will be available in China starting 1st March with global availability coming soon."

Our photos live in many ways across many illustrations and the way we capture them have now moved to the little sensors that occasionally give our smartphones a camera hump and  . Now that our cameras are handheld and no longer require tripods, the image stabilisers that live within these lenses are all we require. They’re very important these stabilisers, without them our photos would be a blurry mess. The SmartSensor that   just announced is the first of its kind. Collaborating with MEMS Drive, the duo now has upped the smartphone camera game. Putting all three-axes of stabilisation with their new image stabiliser could mean that OPPO smartphones could be as steady as an SLR camera. In the past, this wasn’t possible as smartphone cameras were usually too small to have a lens-based image stabiliser. Using a lens-based sensor has limitations – only two axes of motion instead of three. Sensor-based stabilisation goes for the full three and is possible with advancements in MEMS tech. The sensor itself is as thin as a couple of sheets of paper and makes quick adjustments with monocrystalline silicon. Image stabilisation in just 15 milliseconds. Another plus point is that the SmartSensor doesn’t suck up much power and the lens doesn’t heat up as much.   could probably make use of this since their smartphones heat up like a hotcake when taking photos but their amazing SteadyShot stabilisation makes up for that – you can see it in action  . Lens-based stabilisation is also 10 times more pinpoint when compared to its alternative. Why does this all matter? Simple – OPPO smartphones will now produce less jittery images on their cameras. As an afternote, Malaysia made its way onto the projector at Barcelona when OPPO looked at some market research. The study by Nielsen aimed to prove that we Malaysians prioritised camera functions the most in OPPO smartphones."

It’s taken just three years for OPPO to announce Super VOOC that charges a smartphone from 5% to full in 15 minutes. Yup, during the presentation they plugged in a smartphone with a 2500mAh battery and by the end of it, it was all topped up. In the past their fast charging technology was capable of charging a device for five minutes and have it last for 2 hours of talk time to now, charging for five minutes will have it lasting 5 times longer. Low voltage makes all the difference for OPPO’s Super VOOC fast charging, doing away with the need for a voltage converter. They claim that their 5V charge is delivered at a lower rate than Qualcomm and MediaTek’s alternatives with big advantages being that your phone stays cooler, improves efficiency and prevents any sort of battery damage. Seemingly, when you keep the charging temperatures at a minimum, your battery’s longevity will last a lot longer, so fewer worries about old worn out batteries. Faster, safer and cooler. Sounds good to us. It isn’t just all about the charger as the battery has to be a “Super Battery”, utilising some sort of military grade material and there’s some software involved as well.

Rory Lee,It turns out Bill Gates isn’t exactly #TeamFBI in the Apple vs FBI security debacle after all,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/23/it-turns-out-bill-gates-isnt-exactly-teamfbi-in-the-apple-vs-fbi-security-debacle-after-all/,"apple,Apple backdoor,Apple encryption,Apple iPhone,Apple San Bernardino,Apple vs FBI,Apple vs FBI San Bernardino,Bill Gates,Facebook,iPhone backdoor,Jack Dorsey,John McAfee,Mark Zuckerberg,microsoft,Privacy,safety,smartphone privacy,terror attacks,Twitter","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-23,"The case of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) forcing   to install a backdoor into their   has been raging on for some time. While Apple is adamant that they don’t want to do so — based on   from Tim Cook to their customers — the FBI are pretty persistent in trying to get them to comply. With two opposing views, people will start to take sides and the most recent high-profile tech person to choose a side is Bill Gates and while it seemed like he was with the FBI in this case, recent reports indicate a more moderate stance. Privacy and security matters to us because there are plenty of things we want to be kept to ourselves. That much is reasonable, but when an act of terror like the  , that cost the lives of 14 people, happens and the data vital to the investigation is encrypted in the terrorist’s smartphone, we have to wonder at what cost does privacy come? The   was simple: Apple was to provide the FBI with a system to overcome the iPhone’s built-in security features — specifically the one that erases all the data on the iPhone after a certain number of failed login attempts. By doing so, the FBI could then brute force their way in (inputting all the possible variations of the password with a computer) and crack the encryption. Apple’s   was that by doing so, it would risk every iPhone out there as they would have to install a “backdoor” into the system, a backdoor which Apple says could be abused and used to open other iPhones as well. This was a risk Cupertino was not willing to make. The feds assured everyone that this “backdoor” was not going to be abused but many have pointed out that all it takes is one rotten apple to leak it into the world and suddenly every iPhone becomes vulnerable. Clearly something Apple wants to avoid. Here is where Bill comes in. The founder of Microsoft said that all the FBI wants is access into ONE smartphone, which is something Apple should be able to do without undermining all their encryption. He also says that there should be safeguards in place (by Apple) when the government accesses such information. While many reported that due to his earlier statement, it meant Bill was siding with the FBI on this matter, but he has since come out and taken a more…moderate stance. Reports indicate that he isn’t fully backing the FBI, calling instead, for a broader discussion as he believes that a balance is important. When asked specifically on his stance, he said that the “courts are going to decide” and also that these “issues will be decided in Congress”. Am I the only one sensing a cop out here? That said, Bill did raise some valid concerns earlier. But if you look at Tim Cook’s open letter, he claims that Apple has put so much effort into their encryption that they’ve put access into their phones out of even Apple’s own hands. That’s why even they can’t crack the terrorists’ iPhone. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but what is also interesting is the fact that Apple decided to make their resistance to this court order so public. It does make us wonder whether Apple is using this wave of controversy as a publicity stunt. In fact, the only way Tim could have made his open letter more patriotic is by replacing his periods with bald eagles. Either way, it’s working because this case is on everyone’s lips. Several high profile opinion leaders in the tech industry have spoken up about this issue, among which are Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey. While Mark  ‘s predicament, Jack openly declared his   to #TeamApple. Even eccentric millionaire John McAfee (no points for guessing what he is the founder of) has   the problematic iPhone himself. In fact, John says that he can do so in just three weeks because his crack team is made up of “prodigies” that he believes the FBI simply “would not hire” because they have “mohawk haircuts, ear piercings, tattooed faces and a person who has to smoke weed while working and won’t work for less than a half-million dollars a year”. He’s so confident that not only will he do this for free, he also said that he would eat his shoe on the   (an American television anchor) show if he fails. Seems like a tempting offer? So how important   privacy? The FBI seems to be arguing that it is important up until the point it stops them from saving lives, whereas Apple is sticking to their guns in keeping their customers’ information private. That said, it doesn’t seem like the FBI is asking for that much, after all, it’s just one smartphone right? Well, according to   reported by the Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is now asking Apple to extract data from another 12 iPhones throughout the US. Are Apple’s concerns validated now? The space between privacy and safety is a tricky line to tread on. On one hand, without privacy, we won’t be able to rest properly with the knowledge that someone could be sifting through all our private information right now. But on the other hand, what if this potentially harmless backdoor into the encryption of our smartphones could save lives? Let us know what you think in the comments section below."
Rory Lee,"I’m sorry, this smartphone has how much RAM?",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/23/vivo-xplay-5-6gb-ram/,"Android,Vivo,Vivo 6GB RAM,Vivo smartphone,Vivo Xplay 5,Xplay 5,Xplay 5 6GB RAM","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,vivo",2016-02-23,"Faster, bigger, lighter, stronger…as technology gets better and better at a faster and faster rate, we expect faster processors in our mobile devices, more memory, a bigger battery, a better camera, more of everything but surely we’ll come to a point where you start to wonder when is enough, enough. It seems Chinese company   believes that there shouldn’t be a limit. The company has announced the Vivo Xplay 5 — a smartphone that will be packing a whopping 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM! That’s the biggest RAM ever integrated into a smartphone. The Xplay 5, running Qualcomm’s next-gen Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor, will be packing more RAM than most computers. But, do you   6GB of RAM? RAM, (Random Access Memory), can be thought of as a computer/device’s short term memory. It’s called random-access because this memory is volatile and will not stay saved in a system — it “forgets” as soon as you switch off the power. In a traditional computer, RAM helps with multitasking and the more RAM there is, the more (and more complex) processes a computer can handle. On a desktop/laptop system, a lot of RAM is needed to keep everything running smoothly because we usually use our PCs like workhorses — having multiple applications and browser tabs open at the same time uses RAM. The more RAM you use, your PC will start to slow down and the easiest way to speed things back up again is to either close some tasks to free up memory or completely reboot the computer. This is very much the same case with your smartphone (which is basically a computer that can fit in your palm) so the more RAM your device has, the more processes it can do at one time making it faster and smoother. It will also be able to handle more apps running simultaneously, whether it be in the foreground or the background. By that logic, more RAM is always better and this is true…to a certain extent. You see, to run the current applications that are available for smartphones — even the most intensive games and apps — 3GB of RAM will, in most cases, be more than enough. Even the highest of high-end smartphones today come with 4GB of RAM because that is more than enough to run anything you can throw at it in most cases. 6GB in a smartphone though is bordering on the excess. Would your smartphone be better with 6GB of RAM? Sure! Do you really   6GB of RAM to keep your phone running smoothly? Maybe not. If anything, I think Vivo are cramming 6GB of RAM into their smartphone for nothing more than bragging rights — after all, when the Xplay 5 launches, it will likely be the first smartphone ever to sport 6GB of RAM. And who doesn’t like to be first? That said, having the most RAM does not necessarily equate having the best performance. The key is optimisation. A good example would be  ‘s   which, we found out recently,   pretty much every high-powered smartphone out there on AnTuTu. And the iPhone 6S Plus did so with only 2GB of RAM. In fact, too much RAM could potentially be worse for you as a customer because more RAM usually equates a higher price. That means you will likely have to pay   more than necessary just so you can tell your drinking buddies that you have a phone with 6GB of RAM. Also, more RAM means your phone will using more battery. In fact, battery drain has been a limiting factor to why phones don’t come with bigger RAM already. That means you’ll need a bigger battery to run bigger RAM, which also means additional cost and bulk. So, do you   6GB of RAM? Let us know in the comments."

This led to wild speculation that Sony could be replacing their   series, speculation, that if this recent post by   is to be believed, could prove true. Can’t read German? Well, neither can I but thankfully someone on Reddit does and according to user  , the message translates to: “There will be no Z6”. The plot thickens. Can we believe this piece of information? Well, before deciding, it is worth pointing out several key factors in said comment. The first is the fact that when they said that there would be no Z6, they did not specify a time frame. For example, they didn’t say that there would be no Z6  . Without the time quantifier, it becomes hard to take what they say with absolute certainty because for all we know, they could have simply meant to say that there would be no Z6 launched here at the Mobile World Congress — which opens up the possibility of a Z6 further down the road. Secondly, they mentioned that the new X series is a “modified concept that meets the needs of our users more”. Note the keyword “modified” and the absence of any indication that Sony was “replacing” the Xperia Z series. Finally, when we spoke to a Sony Mobile representative during the launch of the Xperia X series yesterday, he said that it wasn’t a replacement, but a product that focuses on different consumers. Possibly a regurgitated scripted answer, but we thought was worth mentioning anyway. But, for the sake of covering our bases, let’s assume that yes, Sony did replace the Xperia Z with the Xperia X series, would that be such a bad thing? Well, from our hands-on, we don’t think so. The Xperia X is a series of handsome looking devices — all of which feature a robust and curvier design language, departing from the sharp and prickly edges of the  . The Xperia X Performance felt exceptionally good with its premium brushed metal finish which is refreshing compared to the tired glass backs on the Xperia Zs of old. If performance is what you’re worried about, we’ve got nothing to complain as the top end Xperia X Performance packs a wallop with the all new Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with 3GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of expandable storage. It’s got a whole bunch of other flagship-worthy goodies too including a reasonable 5-inch full HD display (no 4K, sorry). It’s also got a top-of-the-line 23-megapixel primary snapper packing the 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS mobile sensor, 5x- Clear Image Zoom and a Sony f/2.0 G Lens that runs up to a mind-boggling 12,800 ISO. What’s more, you get a 13-megapixel selfie camera with a wide 22mm lens on the front. Not a slouch at all then. In fact, we think it’s a pretty worthy successor to the old   that we weren’t  . That said, do keep in mind that this can’t really count as an official statement as there is the off chance that the person who replied to the comment is a rogue social media handler, so take it with a pinch of salt until we get a proper word from someone more credible.

Apart from the glam devices launched at MWC 2016, the big yellow company has also released the world’s first thermal imaging smartphone with the CAT S60. Not only it gives you cool predator vision, it is built to last exceeding military spec. The main highlight of course is its FLIR Thermal Camera. With a live thermal imaging, it can show heat sources as indicated in red on the screen. You’ll also get real-time temperature reading in real time. The camera is so sensitive that it could pick up heat marks left behind by my palms on a flat surface. Some of the real life application include checking for leaks in the house, finding heat sources and spotting for people in life rescue situations. For security guards, they could use it to see intruders in the dark even through thick smoke. The possibility is endless and it works effectively with a range up to 100 feet (30 metres). The CAT S60 just screams rugged all over with a strengthened die cast frame and it gets a carbon-fibre look back. Designed like a power tool, it feels chunky in the hands and it is built to withstand drops onto concrete surfaces from up to 1.8 metre high. I wanted to put their claims to the test but was told to try that on production units since the one I’m holding is one of the 6 working prototypes in the world. Over at the front, it gets extra protection with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and the display also supports glove and wet finger tracking. Looking for the best waterproof smartphone? It can’t get better than this. While the CAT S60 has the same ingress protection rating of IP68, it is able to submerge under water up to 5 metres deep for a full hour. Move aside Sony, this is the world’s most waterproof smartphone. CAT isn’t holding back on its waterproofing capability, so you can confidently take this to take photos and videos underwater. The underwater camera (yes, that’s how they are calling it) is a 13MP shooter with dual-LED flash, while the front gets a 5MP camera. If you plan on taking this beyond 2 metres deep, just remember to shut off its speaker and microphone grill by flipping the tiny switches with your fingernail. As a smartphone, the CAT S60 is no slouch. While the front gets a modest 4.7” HD 720p display, it is powered by a decent Snapdragon 617 Octa-Core processor with 3GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. Keeping the lights on is a huge 3,800mAh capacity battery, which should be more than enough to last overtime shifts. Being a 2016 device, it runs on Android Marshmallow out of the box. The CAT S60 will be available later in the year and it will be priced at US$599, which is around RM2,524. Come hell or high water, this phone is built to survive anything. This is no doubt the Chuck Norris of phones."

Humans develop computers and systems so advanced, we lose control over them…which eventually leads to them rising up against us, ending humanity as we know it. Why? Well, it’s probably because of these tests Boston Dynamics carries out on their robots, where it seems like the only requirement is to be a jerk to this poor bot. What a douche! While it does look like they’re just being complete jerks to these robots, all of this is done with a purpose because machines have historically been terrible at adapting to changing circumstances. Give them a set task to carry out and they’ll do fine, but if you alter one of the variables in the task, the machine will often not be able to figure out what happened. So, while on the surface it seems like the guy is simply bullying the robot, this form of exercise is vital to teach the robot how to adapt to extenuating circumstances, which will help develop more reliable bots in the future. Bots that won’t fail just because they fell over or got stuck in a corner. In this particular case, Boston Dynamics sets the new version of their Atlas robot through multiple scenarios, interrupting it as many times as possible to find out how well it copes with changing variables. What is equal parts cool and scary is that in the demonstration, the robot does extremely well in recovering, which really speaks to the effectiveness of these tests. That said, did he really have to do this to the poor guy?"
Arif Lee,Sony updates its smartphone lineup for 2016 with the Xperia X series,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/sony-xperia-series-xa-x-performance-mwc-2016-launch/,"Android,Exmor,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016,Predictive Hybrid Autofocus,Sony,Sony Camera,Sony imaging,Sony Mobile,Sony Mobile World Congress 2016,Sony MWC 2016,sony xperia,sony xperia X,Sony Xperia X Performance,Sony xperia XA,Xperia X,Xperia X Performance,Xperia XA","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2016-02-22,"In recent times,   has failed to capture the magic of their glory days when the Xperia brand is seen as a leader in the smartphone market. Today, the brand struggles to produce phones than are on par with its competitors. Sony needs to do something drastic and start making devices that consumers can look forward to if they want to stay relevant. Their Marshmallow concept is the first step in the right direction but the devices that Sony come up with have to be really special. However, if the three new Xperia phones Sony revealed at MWC16 is anything to go by, the brand still has a long way to go. Let’s see what the new-for-2016 Xperia X range has to offer and you tell us if these three devices are capable contenders against the competitors. 
 At the top of the range, we have the Xperia X performance. The device features a 5-inch TRILUMINOS Full HD (1920 x 1080) display complete with Sony’s propriety, and very good, X-Reality and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement image enhancement technology on board. The Xperia Performance boasts a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 3GB RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage that’s expandable with microSD up to 200GB. Interesting to note here is that the 64GB option will be a dual-SIM variant while the 32GB unit will have a single SIM slot. The Xperia Performance also includes a fingerprint scanner that’s integrated with the side mounted power button and support for high-res front facing stereo speakers with a dedicated dedicated DAC (Digital Audio Converter). For taking pictures, there’s a 23-megapixel camera with an 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS for mobile sensor, 5x Clear Image Zoom, Sony F2.0 G Lens and a mind-numbing 12800 ISO. On the front, you get a 13-megapixel camera with a 22mm wide-angle lens. Powering the Xperia X Performance is a 2,700mAh battery with a claimed two-day run time. The Xperia X Performance also gets Sony’s trademark water and dust resistant capabilities with an IP68 rating. The Xperia X shares many of the specs of the Xperia Performance including the same screen size and resolution, the same front and rear cameras, as well as the same 3GB RAM and 32GB and 64GB storage options. The major difference is in the processor and the battery. The Xperia X comes with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 650 processor and a slightly smaller 2,620mAh battery. Unlike the Xperia X Performance, the Xperia X does away with Sony’s legendary water and dust-resistance capabilities and front-facing stereo speakers. The Xperia XA is Sony’s entry level X-series smartphone. It has a 5-inch HD (1280 x 720) display and a budget 64-bit MediaTek MT6755 processor with 2GB of RAM and only 16GB of internal storage. Fortunately, the memory is expandable with microSD up tp 200GB. In the camera department, the Xperia XA gets a 1/3-inch 13-megapixel rear camera while at the front, you get an 8-megapixel wide-angle shooter. The battery is the smallest of the range as well, at only 2,300mAh but Sony still claims a 2-day run time thanks to smart power management. Let this prices serve as a mere indication as Europe pricing has always been higher when compared to local pricing in Malaysia. Even so, what do you guys think would be an appropriate price range for these three devices? Also, pleases share with us any other thoughts on Sony’s new range. Let us know in the comments."

Bearing the more premium Mi badge, the Mi 4S isn’t exactly a slouch. On the inside, the 5-inch device with a full HD 1080p screen will be powered by a Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor — the same chip powering the LG G4 — mated with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, doing away with the depressing 16GB storage that usually plagues Xiaomi smartphones. For optics, it gets a 13-megapixel primary camera with Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) plus a dual LED flash to help out in those tricky low-light conditions. On the front, it is a downgrade from the Mi 4 as it only sports a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. That said, keeping the lights on is a larger 3,260 mAh battery which should do pretty well especially since it is only powering a 1080p display. It will also have a fingerprint sensor at the back of the smartphone, like that on the Redmi Note 3. What’s good is that this device will be sporting a glass front and back plus rounded metal rails much like those on the newly announced Sony Xperia X series. The device will also feature dual-SIM support plus 4G with VoLTE support. Xiaomi’s new Mi 4S will come in four colours — White, Gold, Black, and Lavender — and will go on sale in China from 1st March at a price of RMB1,699 (around RM1,100). That’s a pretty good deal considering the specs and if you factor in the fact that it has a premium metal and glass build, this phone is a steal. Unfortunately, this smartphone is currently only available in China with no word on outside availability yet."

Not just your regular flagship, this new Acer smartphone features a new feature up its sleeve — over 1TB of storage. The Liquid Jade 2 sports something called a hybrid storage functionality which makes use of cloud storage to keep your phone clutter free. Ring any bells? Yep, this implementation isn’t exactly new especially if you’re familiar with the Kickstarter phone the Nextbit Robin. Much like the Robin, it seems that the Liquid Jade 2 will utilise this same functionality to upload unused apps to the cloud for archiving and mass storage, but while the Robin gives you 100GB of cloud storage, Acer is throwing out a whopping 1TB of storage. What remains to be seen is if Acer’s implementation will be as effective and practical as that on the Robin — which has received a lot of praise for their particular innovation. Besides that, the Liquid Jade 2 features decidedly average specifications for a flagship as the 5.5-inch device sports a full-HD AMOLED panel with 100% NTSC colour gamut on the front. Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 808 processor mated with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of local storage. For optics, the Liquid Jade 2 packs a 21-megapixel PDAF sensor with dual-LED flash and support for 4K video recording. Selfies are taken care of by a front facing 8-megapixel snapper. The Liquid Jade 2 will feature a new Headphone:X technology for better sound quality over headphones — tech that Acer developed with their long time partner Dolby. What’s more, the Acer Liquid Jade 2 will feature a USB Type-C port. The device will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box Alongside this flagship device, Acer also launched two budget smartphones — the Liquid Zest and Liquid Zest 4G. Besides from the fact that one has 4G connectivity and a slightly more powerful processor, these two devices are nearly identical. The Liquid Zest is powered by a 1.0GHz quad-core processor while the Liquid Zest 4G is packing a 1.3GHz quad-core processor and support for 4G LTE connectivity. Both devices sport a 5-inch 720p HD screen at the front with a 8MP main camera at the back. Helping out with selfies is a 5-megapixel front facing shooter. Being a budget smartphone, the Acer Liquid Zest will be priced at EUR109 (around RM507) while the LTE-enabled model will go for EUR149 (around RM693). However, there is no information on the pricing and availability of the Liquid Jade 2."

It’s tiny and one of the most consumer friendly 360-cameras on the market — it even has its own tripod! Looking sweet is one thing, but what most of  you are concerned with is how it performs when shooting 360-degree video. Wonder no more as Samsung have uploaded several videos demonstrating the shooting and stitching capabilities of their tiny Gear 360. It’s pretty impressive. The quality isn’t too bad for a device that small and what really shines is how well everything is stitched together — probably due to that overlapping FOV (each lens shoots in 195-degrees). It’s not perfect, as is evident from the little distortion near the skier’s arms but overall its a pretty good effort. Looking at this second video showing a bunch of ballerinas, the stitching is even better, almost eliminating distortion. The same can be said for the freestyle soccer too, but if you pay attention you can see a dark ring (almost like a black rainbow) around the area where the video overlaps. To recap, the Gear 360 utilises two 15-megapixel cameras strapped back-to-back. It has the ability to shoot just under UHD quality which is pretty high, plus it takes 30-megapixel still photos. Each lens has an f/2.0 aperture so that should help out with low-light photography."

We use our senses to navigate the world around us but are often too preoccupied and stuck on our screens to experience life. Our reliance on these screens at all times of day are disruptive (not in a business sense) – they destroy some relationships and friendships; they sometimes are a matter of   and overall is just a nasty habit. The disruption stops here with Sony Mobile’s Xperia smart products that’ll help you be more hands-free, eyes-free and voice smart when interacting with these devices. Smart assistants if you will. Sony’s first device will live in your ear and boss you around to get your life together. Going as the Xperia Ear, this Bluetooth earbud will converse with you via verbal commands; making it easier to navigate through your schedule, and go fully hands-free while checking through some of your smartphone’s typical features – weather and news. Since it’s your personal assistant, it’ll help you make calls, search the internet, put speech to text and even guide you to locations through GPS. All without looking at that darn screen of yours. The Xperia Ear is compatible with Android devices and will be controlled via a host app where you’ll be able to tweak settings based on your personal preference, it’ll also run you through a how-to the first time you use it. Made out of silicone, Sony wants you to have this in your ear throughout the day. It’s handy that it’s rated IPX2 and has a (claimed) all-day battery life. The earbud will arrive in a Graphite Black colour while you’ll charge the earpiece in its included case that doubles as a charger. Expect it to hit markets in Summer of this year. Still in an early concept stage, the Xperia Eye is a handy ultra-portable camera that’ll follow you wherever you want it to. Its size resembles an inhaler and attaches via a clip mechanism – usually to a piece of clothing. You can wear it as a necklace too. This is a deliberate showcase of Sony’s imaging technology in a small 360-degree spherical camera. Commands are conducted through voice or facial recognition – which is a bit freaky but its main purpose is to be always ready to take photos of the moments and people around you. A projector isn’t all that new but a projector that responds to touch is something that will blow many people’s minds. Not only that, it also reacts to voice and gestures – much like a smartphone. No, this isn’t Sony’s first rodeo when it comes to portable projectors as we talked about the Portable Ultra Short Throw Projector before. But this takes the cookie. More projection here but it’s more about the personal assistant side of things with the Xperia Agent. The device is essentially your personal EVE (see WALL-E), providing you with necessary info and controls to your smart home appliances. You’ll talk to it as it uses the same Sony voice technology and it takes off from there. Equip with a built-in camera and projector for screen gestures, we foresee the Xperia Agent making its way to homes around the world."

Packing a not-at-all unreasonable spec sheet, the Lenovo Vibe K5 and K5 Plus are pretty decent options in the low-end of the market. The better spec-ed Vibe K5 Plus gets a 5-inch 1080p full HD display at the front while being powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor on the inside mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage (microSD up to 32GB). Keeping everything running is a 2,750 mAh removable battery, which should delight power users. For optics, it gets a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. It will support dual SIM and be LTE enabled. On the Software side, Lenovo is streamlining their skin of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop to remove the excess and keep everything running smoothly — important when you consider they have to rely on a Snapdragon 616. It is unfortunate that it doesn’t come with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, though, but we hope that it will receive an update somewhere down the line. Other goodies include a Dolby Atmos sound software plus two rear-facing speakers and a relatively nice build with good use of metal — something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market. The lower-end K5 simply drops the processor down to an octa-core Snapdragon 415 and the full HD display goes down to an HD display. Based on its asking price of USD149 (USD129 for the regular K5), which translates to around RM625, these smartphones’ biggest competitors look to be the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 — which has prices starting from RM699 in  .

Most of us are blessed with the tools that we rely on to connect ourselves with the world. An idealistic view would be equal opportunity for everyone in the world. Who knows the unlocked potential and opportunities of these individuals that stand outside these privileged circles. The Android One program wants to realise a dream that people all over the world will have access to a smartphone and this is the highest specced smartphone yet to come out of the program. This is the GM Plus 5 and with it, people are going to be ready to take on the technological world. That’s just one reason why we’re looking at the General Mobile 5 Plus. The other is because it’s actually a smartphone that I’d consider getting for myself – anything that runs pure vanilla would warrant a second glance. Coming out of Turkey, this device pushes a Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution on its 5.5-inch screen. You’d be surprised that despite being a part of the Android One program; the manufacturer paid attention to the details. Off the bat, you’ll notice that the glass up front has a 2.5D taper all around while protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. All its internals sit in a metal chassis and the rear is encased by a textured back cover that comes in four colours. Multitasking shouldn’t be a bother with Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 Octa-core chipset mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. If you’re a memory hog, you’ll rest easy knowing that there’s a microSD slot for expandable storage. For all things photography, the primary and secondary shutters are both 13-megapixels. They’re also both equip with autofocus and flash for those low light shots: dual-flash on the rear and a single-flash on the front. General Mobile quotes that the camera sensors were tuned by the folks at DxOMark which mean they took imaging seriously. Juicing all its internals is a 3100mAh lithium ion battery which charges via a USB Type-C port. And did we mention it supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0? Some OEMs should be embarrassed by now. Being an Android One device automatically allows the GM 5 Plus to run the latest version of Android, so you can expect Marshmallow 6.0.1 on this feature pack device. The GM 5 Plus will also be guaranteed Android updates for 18 months from the time of release. Adding to its spec sheet is support for 4G LTE connectivity up to Cat7. The device will go on sale in Turkey and 15 other countries, costing roughly US$ 300 (RM 1256.71)."

The two excel at different things and are naturally used to things being a certain way. So when you design a smartphone’s software, you tend to gear your UI to certain elements that typically reflect the wants and needs of your consumer. LG says they’ve decided to change a key UI feature because they’ve done the necessary market research. After looking at the changes they’ve made in person, we can only say one thing: We want to see see those findings for ourselves – cause we’re not sure what they did was a good idea. A trend that they began with the LG V10 was a secondary ticker that gave the phablet an “Always On display” – it was small – unlike the LG G5 that uses its main display to show the “Always On” feature. Fortunately, if you’re not a fan you can turn it off in the settings on the LG G5 but a 0.8% per hour battery decrease shouldn’t hurt much. If you looked hard enough at the main photo of this post, you’d have probably picked it up. LG’s Marshmallow skin illustrates that they’re not playing small anymore and it shows with the omission of an app drawer. Say whatttttttt? Yeah, they’ve joined the ranks of other Chinese OEMs that opt to go drawer-less. It makes things simple but it’ll be unfamiliar waters for most people that love how Android typically works. That all might change with reports that Android N going drawer-less itself but we’ll see how people adapt to the LG first before passing off conclusions. Q slide is nowhere to be seen too, so your notification pulldown menu is going to much cleaner. There’s also no more multi-window. The menus are also a lot whiter, moving away from the darker themes. Removing all that allows LG’s UI to be much less bloatware-ish but if you’re getting personal, I, myself prefer to have an app drawer to keep things neat. Something that’s supposedly the aim of slimming down the UI, making it the “simplest kind of interface, and make it as intuitive as possible”. The reasoning for choosing an Android device is usually when you want an open play box but when you start changing a system and it starts “looking” a lot like iOS – by coincidence or otherwise – people are likely to flip. If you don’t know much about the LG G5, you can check out our announcement post  . One thing is for sure, LG is going big but will they going home because of it?"

Well, you would definitely have heard it because malls, stores, and even some restaurants have been playing festive songs all month long. Lively music wasn’t the only thing that came with the Year of the Monkey, red/gold decorations have also adorned every nook and cranny of nearly every building. To commemorate the new year, you will also undoubtedly want to deck yourself out in red coloured gear. But, where do you start? Well, if you’re interested in tech, here’s a list of 8 different gadgets that will surely give you that  glow. [ ]  is a classic. One of the most iconic music players of our generation. Sure their popularity has dropped somewhat with the fact that smartphones can do almost everything, but if you’re taking that into account, every piece of tech has been somewhat affected. The iPod remains an icon though, and if you pick up the touch variant you get access to Apple’s App Store too. What’s more, this red variant of the iPod is under (PRODUCT)RED, where every piece of merchandise sold under this banner will contribute to the global fight against AIDS. [ ] If you want something affordable and red for the new year, look no further than Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi. Their popular 10,000 mAh   also comes in a shade of red that will make anyone blush…if you reflect light off it onto someone’s face. It’s a capable little power bank and that has a wide capacity and a wide compatibility for large range of devices. [ ] Mice are great. Unless they’re of the pest variant, of course. The     is a capable little pointer that is compatible with Windows, Mac, Chrome OS and even Android. It’s a tiny little mouse that can fit in the palm of any hand (unless you’re baby Groot) and as a result is very easy to carry around. Plus it’s wireless and Bluetooth so all you really need is the mouse and your laptop/device. One of our favourite Bluetooth speakers yet. The   solidly built and produces a great sound. Plus, it’s water-resistant so you don’t have to worry about accidental spills damaging your precious soda can speaker. It’s so well built in fact that we reckon you could get away with a spot of bowling with it. We don’t recommend that of course, so do so at your own risk. [ ] Everyone’s (?) favourite   finally arrived in Malaysia recently and it comes in a special red colour to usher in the Lunar New Year. But as with all limited/exclusive devices, it is only available for a limited time, so if you want one of these, be sure to snatch one up before 22 February. Ah a red smartphone! The  is ASUS’s attempt at slapping a laser autofocus system on a budget/midrange smartphone. While it will get you through daily tasks perfectly fine, don’t expect to be blown away by unbelievable value for money. It’s still a solid device though, and that curved red back plate is pretty nice to hold. [ ] Perhaps the other most iconic music player after the iPod is  ’s  . What started out as a simple cassette player that is almost permanently strapped to anyone’s belt in the era before CDs and digital downloads, has eventually graduated to a full-fledged digital audio player. Here’s one that plays Hi-Res Audio looking pretty slick in red. What’s more, they come with a pair of pink in-ear headphones. What’s the point in having so many red connected devices if you can’t get connected? Well, Yes has the solution for you. Yes, the   4G Mobile Hotspot is a nifty little mobile broadband that lets you share your connection with up to 5 devices/users. What’s more, it’s tiny and discreet so you can carry it around with you with ease. It’s also got a long 6-hour battery life which will help keep you connected for longer. What’s more, Yes has an 85% population coverage nationwide, enabling Malaysians to stay connected anytime and anywhere across the country. Plus, if you sign up for their Super 88 Postpaid Plan with Huddle XS bundle that offers you a whopping 11GB of data for only RM88 a month, you can get the Huddle XS MiFi unit for free.

Rory Lee,Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge: The perfect smartphone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/samsung-galaxy-s7-and-s7-edge-official-launch-mwc-2016-the-perfect-smartphone/,"Galaxy S7 official announcement,Galaxy S7 official launch,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-22,"Technology has made leaps and bounds in terms of improvements over the years with the ultimate goal of creating the perfect piece of tech. While the development of the smartphone has somewhat slowed especially in terms of hardware specifications and features, the challenge is now in refinement. In making something good, even better, in making something great…perfect. But is perfection what we really want? There is no denying that the    /  is a beast of a smartphone with the best of everything, a great build and a fantastic camera. How do you improve on something that’s already so good? You refine it. That’s exactly what Samsung did with the S6’s successor, the   and  . The Galaxy S7 has a gorgeous 5.1-inch Quad HD (2560×1440 pixels) SuperAMOLED display panel (577ppi). The Galaxy S7 edge has the same screen resolution but on a larger 5.5-inch display. On the inside, both variants will get either the next generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor, clocked at 2.15GHz, or Samsung’s own next-gen Exynos 8890 octa-core processor, clocked at 2.3GHz, depending on the market (Malaysia will probably get the Exynos version). Both these chips will be mated to 4GB of RAM and either 32/64GB of internal storage. This translates to a 30% improvement in CPU performance and more than 60% improvement in GPU performance over the previous Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. Keeping everything looking pretty is Samsung’s TouchWiz UI skinned on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Samsung has also reintroduced microSD support in the S7 and S7 edge with a card slot that takes cards up to a whopping 200GB. For optics, both Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will get Samsung’s new Dual Pixel 12-megapixel f/1.7 camera. Dual Pixel sounds like a fancy term, but it is basically an upgrade to the Phase Detection AF found on the Galaxy S6, where thanks to this technology, every pixel is focusing on the image at the same time. Samsung says that this translates to a near instantaneous focusing speed even in low light conditions. What’s more, because this 12MP sensor uses bigger 1.4 micron pixels (up from 1.12 micron) and a faster f/1.7 lens, the Galaxy S7 is supposed to give you 95% brighter photos. The Galaxy S7 gets a 3,000 mAh battery while the Galaxy S7 edge with the larger display gets a 3,600 mAh which is a big increase from the Galaxy S6’s 2,550 mAh and S6 edge’s 2,600 mAh battery. For charging, the S7 and S7 edge supports Samsung’s fast-charging technology as well as wireless charging which also now supports fast charging. Besides that, the Galaxy S7 also has a fingerprint scanner located under its home button with support for Samsung Pay. I’m sure many will be happy about the return of the microSD card slot. This popular feature that was missing from the Galaxy S6/S6 edge is making its return in the Galaxy S7/S7 edge. However, this improvement comes in the form of a hybrid SIM tray — you will have to pick either a single SIM and microSD or dual SIM and no microSD. A bit of a bummer, but at least you have the option of expandable storage now. The Galaxy S7/S7 edge is now water-resistant up to IP68 which means that while you’re not encouraged to take it for a swim, it will survive an accidental drop in the pool. The open ports on the S7 and S7 edge have a special water-repellent coating that negates the need for fiddly flaps and port closures (a major bane for older IP-rated Samsung phones). This is nice and makes the design of the S7 and S7 edge sleek and clean. Also new is the always-on display feature that uses minimal power to show basic useful information and notifications like calendar appointments, the time, among other things. Samsung have also included some dedicated gaming features. One of which is called the “Game Launcher”. What it does is let you control how you want to play your games — better graphics and higher performance, or lower graphics and longer battery life — as well as shuts off background tasks and alerts when you’re gaming so you are not interrupted by notifications. Heat build-up is always a major issue with Samsung devices. To fix the issue, Samsung has build into the S7/S7 edge a water cooling system that consists of copper piping filled with water surrounding the processor to help disperse heat during intense usage or gaming sessions. While the Galaxy S6 edge was a novel concept, we didn’t like the limited functionality and features of the edge screen display on the S6 edge. Samsung has sorted this out and increased the function and features of the edge screen display on the Galaxy S7 edge. Among these are the increased edge screen real estate which translates to the device being able to display more information and more functionality for the edge screen. You have extensive edge features such as an updated People edge, Apps edge and Tasks edge. You also have access to a number of Quick tools like a ruler, a compass and a flashlight all from the edge screen. These improvements look to be identical to the ones bundled with the Galaxy S6 edge’s   so be sure to check that out if you want to know more. Perhaps the most significant refinement is the build. Sure, design-wise, it looks almost exactly the same as the previous Galaxy S6/S6 edge, but they did make a lot of the necessary improvements we yearned for in the old one. Remember the curved back that helped you hang on to your slippery  ? Yeah, that’s now on the Galaxy S7/S7 edge too — a welcomed improvement over the flat-backed Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Did I hear someone say camera hump? Well, thanks to that new Dual Pixel sensor, Samsung have managed to almost entirely shave it off. In many ways, although it pains me to say this because I’m far from being their fan, Samsung   how to do hardware. A quick look at their unbelievably polished flagships of last year should give you more than enough of a hint as to how good they are at building a phone, yet they’ve managed improved on it even further with the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. We tried to find faults in the S7 and S& edge, but try as we might, we couldn’t find much."

In terms of storage you’re getting a generous 64GB that’s extendable via microSD. As an added bonus, the phone uses a hybrid SIM slot, so it can support a dual-SIM setup if you need it."

LG believes that we’re still yet to reach “peak smartphone” and whilst moving forward, modules and add-on peripherals are the paths to take.

Rory Lee,Samsung’s new Gear 360 is a sweet looking 360-degree camera and I want one,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/samsungs-new-gear-360-is-a-sweet-looking-360-degree-camera-and-i-want-one/,"360 degree camera,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung 360 camera,Samsung Gear 360,Samsung Gear VR,Samsung launch,smartphone,The Next Galaxy,TheNextGalaxy","Mobile Accessories,Samsung",2016-02-22,"Besides the gargantuan launch of  ‘s new flagships, they’ve also bundled a sweet little 360 camera called the   just to spice things up. And I’m not kidding when I say sweeeeeeeet. It looks like something cute and cuddly out of a children’s novel that you just know is going to be made into a million plush toys and its own movie. The design philosophy is pretty obvious here: It’s clearly a golf ball. Okay, maybe Samsung didn’t have a golf ball in mind when they designed it (or did they?) but you can’t help but draw similarities. It’s white, round and comes perched on its own…tee… ahem, tripod, so that it can stand all by its lonesome. This ball of cuteness comes with two fisheye lenses mounted back to back — both sporting its own dedicated 15-megapixel CMOS sensor — and is designed to let users “become the creator of their own virtual reality content”. These 15MP sensors allow users to capture high-resolution 3840×1920 360-degree video at 30 frames per second and 30MP still images. If you don’t want the full 360-degrees for some reason even though you bought a 360-degree camera, you can also shoot 180-degrees using just one of the two 15MP sensors. The Gear 360 offers Bright Lens F2.0 which creates “high-resolution images even in low-light conditions” so that can be useful if you want to film, say, a sunrise from the top of the Himalayas. Although it comes with its own tripod, it doesn’t mean that you will be limited to it and it alone as the Gear 360 supports the standard tripod thread mount that is also compatible with a wider selection of accessories and mounts. It also has support for a microSD card (up to 128GB) and is IP53 certified dust and water resistant. So not really a tool to film your underwater explorations then. That said, it also has a tiny 0.5-inch 72×72 PMOLED display and a record button at the top. On one side, it has a menu and back button that doubles as a Bluetooth and power button respectively. Keeping everything running is a removable 1,350 mAh li-ion battery which brings the total weight of the entire device to 153g. The thing about Samsung’s launch during the Mobile World Congress is that they’re not only launching a smartphone or a camera, they’re launching an ecosystem. A Galaxy if you wish. They, along with several other tech giants, have realised that diversifying is the key — selling you more stuff that you might not need but you definitely want. I can’t help but want this little Gear 360 because it opens up a whole host of content creation possibilities. Just imagine GoPro cameras. Previously the niche product of extreme sports aficionados, GoPros are now a staple equipment for any creative content creator and the Gear 360 has the potential to be the next GoPro."

They have significantly improved performance, features and a whole bunch of other goodies. But the big question is: Would you get one? Well, here are 7 big reasons why you definitely should and why the S7 is a worthwhile upgrade over the S6. The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are smartphone powerhouses. Powered by either a next-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core SoC or Samsung’s very own next-gen Exynos 8890 octa-core chip (Malaysia is likely to get the Exynos version), the S7 and S7 edge surely pack a punch. Paired with 4GB of RAM and 32 or 64GB internal memory (expandable via microSD up to 200GB), the Galaxy S7 duo sees a 30% bump in CPU as well as over 60% bump in GPU performance from the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. That’s a massive amount especially if you consider how powerful the previous Galaxy already are. What’s more, the S7 and S7 edge is optimised for serious mobile gaming with dedicated features to help you maximise your smartphone gaming experience. The S7 and S7 edge has got a dedicated “Game Launcher” function that lets you decide how you want to game — maximum power and FPS or maximum battery life and lower FPS — on the fly. What’s more, the feature also lets you mute all notifications so you wont be distracted when you’re getting serious mobile game time. The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge has among the best, if not the best cameras you can get on a smartphone. The S7 and S7 edge looks o continue this tradition with a brand new 12-megapixel Dual Pixel sensor mated to a super-fast f/1.7 aperture lens. The new sensor delivers lighting-fast focusing — even in low-light. It also takes 95% brighter pictures thanks to the use of the larger 1.4 micron pixels coupled with a fast f/1.7 lens. Samsung has also increased the battery capacity over last year’s flagship. The S7 has a much larger 3,000 mAh battery for the Galaxy S7 (compared to 2,550 mAh in the S6) and an event bigger 3,600 mAh battery for the Galaxy S7 edge (compared to just 2,600 mah in the S6 edge). In addition, you get fast-charging support not only for wired charging but for wireless charging as well. Ah, the one fans lamented about when they found out the Galaxy S6/S6 edge didn’t come with it. Well, it’s back and I’m sure many of you Samsung fans are already rejoicing. But, before you bust out the confetti, the supported slot that lets you put up to a 200GB microSD card in, is shared. Yup, it’s a hybrid SIM slot which means you will have to choose between either a single SIM plus microSD setup, or a dual SIM without microSD setup. Dang it! Hey, at least you have the choice? Weather hazards are a nightmare that we simply can’t avoid sometimes. Just the other day, I got caught in one of the heaviest rainstorms I’ve ever experienced in Sunway Pyramid and it didn’t matter how big my umbrella was, I was completely drenched which obviously had me worried about my smartphone. But, if you pick up the Galaxy S7/S7 edge you won’t have to worry about such trivial matters like rain damaging your smartphone because it has a water-resistant rating of IP68. Although that doesn’t mean you can go swimming with it, it will survive the accident drop in the pool and/or rainstorm. What’s more, the open ports have been coated with a special water-repellent coating that does away with the need for inconvenient and ugly flaps that you worry could fall off. Take that Galaxy S5! One of the things I liked the most about many Windows Phone devices was their always-on display, or Glance Screen, as the marketing people would call it. Its a convenient feature that makes available basic notifications and information without the need to wake the phone. It’s great that Samsung has caught up with this as well. Samsung’s always-on display lets you choose one of three different screens to display — your calendar, the time and personalised notifications of your choosing. Pretty nifty when all you can do is glance at the screen. Since its running on the Galaxy S7/S7 edge’s SuperAMOLED panel, only the pixels that are required will be lit so this feature has minimal effect on battery life. Much like the new update that the Galaxy S6 edge received with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Galaxy S7 edge which comes with Marshmallow out of the box, also has a bunch of new edge improvements. Among which is the increased screen real estate allowing more information to be displayed on the edge screen. This extra screen space lets you do more with the Apps edge, Task edge and People edge — you won’t only have one row of apps, you will have two rows. Plus, you will get access to several Quick tools like a ruler, a compass as well as a flashlight. For more information, you can head on over  . : The Galaxy S7 edge is officially  .

In an attempt to bounce back, HTC pulled back the covers of their new midrange smartphone, the  . If you didn’t already know, the HTC One A9 is already on sale here in Malaysia via   and   for a whopping RM2,199. That’s a lot to shell out for a mid-range device and there is no denying that this is a device for the middle of the smartphone pack. For starters, it is a 5-inch smartphone with a full HD panel tucked under Corning Gorilla glass. On the inside, it’s powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 617 processor (a notch up over the usual 615/616 mid-range processors) paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable (via microSD) internal storage. Optics are taken care of with a 13-megapixel f/2.0 primary camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) located in the top center at the back of the smartphone while selfies are taken care of with HTC’s UltraPixel “UltraSelfie” front facing camera. That said, the One A9 has a bunch of goodies too, like a fingerprint scanner hiding under its home button on the front, but HTC’s signature BoomSound speakers are not on the list. The speakers do have a DAC that does Dolby Audio with 24-bit Hi-Res Audio. Keeping the lights on is a 2,150 mAh battery. It is a single-SIM smartphone, though, so if you have multiple numbers, you might have to look for another one. The One A9 then is not off to a good start. That said, here are some of the things we do like about HTC’s new baby. HTC is renown for their ability to build quality smartphones. They basically reinvented the “premium” smartphone with the One M7 back in the day, and this exquisite build finish carries on into the One A9. It comes together fantastically. Its rounded edges are awesome and the metal feels exquisite. What’s more, it’s a handsome looking device, a little too close to the Apple iPhone 6/6S for my taste but if you dig that but want an Android OS, this is the device for you. Speaking of the Android OS, this smartphone comes with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, so you don’t have to wait around and hope that it hits your device soon. Marshmallow brings a host of goodies, including the very fun and useful Now on Tap and Doze. Now on Tap is a function where you can simply hold down the home button and allow Google to “read” whatever is on your screen. Then, Google will provide you with the necessary Google Now cards related to specific information on the screen. Doze, on the other hand, puts the smartphone in a state of low power when not in use to conserve battery. Think Apple iPad. According to DxOMark that is. The renown camera testing site tests a whole bunch of smartphone and rates them according to their performance. The higher the number, the better the camera and with a respectable score of 78, the HTC One A9 is the best performing HTC smartphone camera on the list. Are you sold? Do you want to get your hands on the device? Well, in conjunction with the HTC One A9’s official launch, which is going for a recommended retail price of RM2,299, HTC are also having a Chinese New Year promotion. By shopping with HTC, customers can stand a chance to take home gold bars, shopping vouchers and limited edition merchandise. The promotion will last until 29 February and if you’d like to know more you can head on over to their website. Alongside the star of the show, the One A9, HTC are also officially launching the HTC One ME Dual SIM (RM1,599), HTC Desire 728 Dual SIM, HTC Desire 828 Dual SIM, and the HTC Desire 626 Dual SIM."

First and foremost, comes the hostility of getting caught of snapping those photos that’ll probably get you in a lot of trouble. But still companies are finding it harder to prepare for the storm of their devices getting leaked out in the open. Samsung is on top of the ant hill when it concerns their Galaxy S7 duo that’s slated to be released at MWC 2016. LG’s G5 has made a few appearances too but it seems like we’ve forgotten the darling of Taiwan –   with their  . That’s remotely because there’s no more BoomSound (as far as we can tell) and it’s starting to look a lot more Samsung than anything else. It’s like HTC did an 180-degree spin from their design language on the One M7, M8 and M9 and thought that going Samsung-esque was the best decision – way to go HTC, that’s originality for you. In the rumoured specs department, it is claimed that the One M10 will carry a 5.2-inch AMOLED display and feature a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. It’s likely that 4GB of RAM will be on this smartphone, along with at least 32GB of internal storage. There’s also the greatly welcomed 12-megapixel rear camera that’s also found on the Nexus 6P. The sensors on the rear and front (unknown megapixel) are also said to be equipped with OIS (optical image stabilisation). Our camera comparison showing what it’s capable of can be found  . To round off, apparently HTC will make use of the home button and let it double as a fingerprint sensor, as they’ve done before. The flagship will also run a Sense 8.0 skin over Android Marshmallow out of the box. We’ve said it time and time again, HTC has made phones with great builds and designs. This time (if the image holds true) they’ve dropped the ball again. Adding to the shambles is the fact that they’ve done away with BoomSound, something that always kept them ahead in the multimedia consumption side of smartphones. Say it ain’t so, HTC. Say it ain’t so. Do drop us your thoughts on the alleged HTC One M10, will it sell like hotcakes? Or will it be another dud."

That means instead of getting harassed by friends who need help with “likes” on their newly established page or participation in an assignment survey of theirs, you’ll now be getting bombarded by businesses and brands. Well, when you compare the two, it’s essentially the same thing but with “friends” you could easily just get rid of them by “unfriending” them, ads on the opposing end is more or less involuntary. The leaked document had been sent to the folks at   who’ve by journalistic virtue have chosen to leave their source anonymous but it’s quoted that businesses will soon be allowed to send ads to users who’ve previously initiated a chat with them via the Messenger app. So in the past when you’ve dropped a private message to brand or service provider complaining about an issue – it’ll haunt you. Remember folks, complaining in public always works better. It seems that the authenticity of the document has some worthy back-up as well as a URL short link that was mentioned seemed to have been quietly launched. Facebook also decided to own up to the existence of the URL short link system, allowing us to believe that this whole Messenger ad thing is the real deal. For limitations and boundaries sake, we’re lucky that Facebook isn’t just going to let any business send you spam-my messages. As mentioned earlier, it’ll only be limited to those who’ve started conversations with the brands themselves. This will be great for businesses, though, as people already engaged with them can receive further updates about products or services. TechCrunch points out that this is a big switch from Mr Zuckerberg’s stance on the subject in 2014 after acquiring WhatsApp. He’s quoted as saying “I don’t personally think ads are the right way to monetise messaging”. From pages, messaging options for businesses and even its 2015 initiative “Businesses On Messenger”, Facebook has gradually increased its efforts to be more helpful to the organisations and brands out there.

Rory Lee,Moto 360 2nd Generation: Second time’s the charm?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/20/moto-360-2nd-generation-moto-360-sport-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"hands on and first impressions,Lenovo,Malaysia,Moto 360,Moto 360 2nd gen,Moto 360 2nd gen Malaysia hands on,Moto 360 Sport,Motorola","Android,Lenovo,Mobile OS,Motorola,Smart Watch",2016-02-20,"I remember my Uber driver asking me what I thought was the next big tech trend. My answer was simple: Modular devices. It seemed obvious to me because in a world of smartphone carbon copies, who doesn’t want to stand out? Imparting personality and specified functions to devices seemed like the best way forward. He was clearly not expecting this answer and it only was after a few moments of awkward silence that he revealed what he was actually thinking of: Smartwatches. Ohhhhh. It never occurred to me that smartwatches are the “next big tech trend” because not only am I exposed to people wearing smartwatches all the time, nearly everyone in the office also has some kind of smartwatch. It’s almost as common as smartphones, so at most — to me, anyway — smartwatches are the tech trend of today. But, if you consider the general public, this is still a novelty/upcoming piece of tech. You don’t really see smartwatches that often so it would make sense that it is still considered a tech trend of tomorrow. When the smartwatch, as we know it today, first started out, many manufacturers and designers were uncertain about what it should look like. Many opted to put an ugly square on your wrist, which if you think about it, sort of makes sense because a smartwatch was essentially a smaller smartphone that fits on your wrist. I think they were, for the most part, wrong as people don’t want to wear smartphones on their wrist because that’s where watches go. One of the companies that got this formula right was   (now just Moto) with the first  . It simply had a cool factor about it and I’m happy to say that the sequel keeps to this trend. If you’re looking for a classy watch, you can’t really go wrong with the standard Moto 360. It is a thing of beauty. The 316L stainless steel case, which comes in either 42mm or 46mm sizes, is well built and feels really nice in the hand. Unlike some smartwatches, the Moto 360 sits on your wrist like it belongs there, rather than looking like a sore protrusion. It is worth noting that if you pick up the 42mm Women’s edition (which goes for RM1,499) it comes with a tiny 16mm strap and that makes the watch look downright comical. It’s like tying the head of a lollipop to your wrist with a wet noodle. You’re better off with the 20mm strap, but you won’t get Rose Gold because that’s only for the Women’s version. Quite the pickle eh? Much like the original Moto 360, the 2nd Generation watch runs on Android Wear. While Android Wear isn’t where we’d like it to be right now, it has come a long way and is slowly maturing into a well-rounded watch operating system. It’s got a whole bunch of nifty features like Google Now, alarms, calendar reminders, as well as the regular notification pushing. It also lets you reply to WhatsApp messages via speech-to-text. The Sport is the Moto 360 for the fitness enthusiast. Unlike its elegant regular brother, the Sport does not have a sexy stainless steel body. Not one you can feel anyway, as most of the case is covered in the same rubberised material that makes up the smartwatch band. Yup, that means the entire strap piece is proprietary and what I guess you could call a uni-bodied strap. As a result, if your strap cracks or breaks, you’re going to be in some amount of trouble trying to get it fixed. A big thumbs-down there then. While the classic smartwatch comes in two sizes, the Sport only comes in a 45mm case, and while that looks fine on my hairy wrists, it may seem a little bulky on more delicate wrist sizes. The biggest difference — besides the rubber strap — is the fact that it has a new “AnyLight” hybrid display that, in short, improves sunlight visibility. Does it work? Well, the short answer is yes, it does let you view it even under direct sunlight. One other thing that might turn fitness nuts onto this device is the fact that it has GPS connectivity. It’s constructed in true Moto 360 fashion, with a premium build and feel though there are a few annoying niggles. One of which is the fact that the rubber strap picks up all manner of dust. Anything that is small and speck-like just finds its way onto the strap and in your desperate (but futile) effort to get it off, more dust will settle on other parts of the strap. That’s a nightmare. Another is that little cutout for the microphone at the side of the watch. It feels so half-arsed, like they wrapped the device up in that hideous rubber condom before realising “Oops we forgot to make a hole for the mic. Let’s just cut one out”. That aside, the rest of the watch is a class act. Both the Sport and the regular versions of the Moto 360 are fantastic smartwatches to have on your wrist. They just feel right, and that isn’t always easy to find in a smartwatch. Functionality remains to be seen, but with the time I’ve spent on Android Wear, it is quite fun though not entirely practical, though that’s not the Moto 360’s fault. But, that’s a story for another time. In all honesty, I can’t say that this — with   at RM1,399 — is the best smartwatch money can buy. I can’t even say that this is the best round smartwatch money can buy because it technically isn’t even round with that dastardly flat tire that many seem to hate. But, to me, that gives the watch character and for something that you’re going to wear every single day, you’d want it to have character. Let me put it this way: In a world of generic square smartwatches trying to look smart and round smartwatches trying to look like regular watches, what’s the easiest way for someone to tell that you have a Moto 360?"
Arif Lee,The LG G5 is now a real thing with modular parts playing a big part,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/21/the-lg-g5-is-now-a-real-thing-with-modular-parts-playing-a-big-part/,"Always on,Always on display,Android,Announcement,G5,HTC legend,launch,LG,LG and Friends,LG Friends,LG G5,LG G5 Battery,LG G5 flagship,LG G5 MWC 2016,LG Mobile,LG Mobile World Congress 2016,LG MWC 2016,mobile world congress 2016,modular,modular battery,MWC 2016,removable battery,smartphone,South Korea","Android,LG,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-21,"So it looks just how it was rumoured and the majority of reactions that we saw were negative. Are we just jumping the gun and passing our views without knowing the whole picture? That was the case during the Nexus 6P by Huawei with many throwing shade at the Stormtrooper visor. In the end, we warmed up to the idea and design. Will we embrace the same scenario this time? Well, let’s take a look at what the   has to offer. Let’s first start on paper and where else better to start than the screen it has: a 5.3-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440) display. Handling all its computing is Qualcomm’s crème dela crème Snapdragon 820 processor and it gets some help with plentiful of RAM – 4GB to be exact. There’s only one storage option listed at 32GB of internal memory but that’s when the special Magic slot comes into the picture. The South Korean manufacturer has done away with its plastic removable backs and the G5 is proof that they’re warming up to the metal unibody design language – metal is the new black after all. But when companies go for metal they have to sacrifice some nifty features that had fans of Samsung devices going berserk: a removable battery and microSD card. LG could’ve taken some inspiration from  , they’ve done a much better job here as it looks a lot better. Popping the bottom chin off will allow you to swap out the battery and add some of its LG Friends accessories. They’ve also found a way to keep the microSD slot on board with expandability up to 2TB in theory. Since the pop out is on the chin now the rear has nothing to swap about but the familiar back placed fingerprint sensor is still there, also doubling as a home button. LG did away with their usual volume rockers and power button with only the volume toggles now on the left side. They’ve also decided on a horizontal camera module setup for the main camera(s) that provide a 135-degree wide angle stills. It’s possible thanks to two cameras a main 16-megapixel sensor complete with OIS and 8-megapixel secondary camera. Selfies, on the other hand, is taken care of an 8-megapixel shutter. Powering all this and charging via the port of the future (USB Type-C) is a small-ish 2800mAh lithium ion battery. We’re lucky that the G5 arrives with Quick Charge 3.0 and LG claims it’ll charge from 0% to 80% in only 35 minutes. While, the sole screen on the device has an always on display feature. Despite having the rather small battery, you’ll definitely appreciate that the always on display that only uses 0.8% of battery per hour. On the software front, as we expected it’ll run Android Marshmallow out of the box with LG’s own UI skin laid on top. Sadly the model that they showed off at MWC 2016 was a single-SIM 4G LTE model but we have our fingers crossed that they may be a Dual-SIM variant for other markets. Whenever you buy a smartphone you’re not only buying one device, it’s usually accompanied by accessories that make the experience better. We looked at the awesome add-on modules and peripherals that was called LG Friends  . LG’s latest flagship will come in four colours, Silver, Gold, Titan (Charcoal) and Pink."

The largest smartphone in the Chinese manufacturer’s repertoire already has us getting goosebumps because it boasts one of the first current-gen chipsets of 2016 – all eight cores of HiSilicon Kirin goodness. In terms of specifications, Huawei has always been on the up and up and we’re not disappointed with its spec sheet. First in line is the 6-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS-NEO panel that’s protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The majority might argue that having a screen that big should warrant a Quad HD display (2560 x 1440) but for the most part, the Mate 8’s 368ppi will suffice. On the processing side of things, you’re getting an all-star in the form of the Octa-core Kirin 950 chipset that’s clocked to 2.3GHz and accompanied by the Mali-T880 MP4 GPU. For RAM, it’ll come in two options 3GB and 4GB while internal storage will also vary – 32GB and 64GB. The determining factor will be the colour option you choose as they’ll represent different RAM and internal storage capacities. They will come in Champagne Gold, Space Grey, Mocha Brown and Moonlight Silver. Moving to its camera, there’s a 16-megapixel rear shutter complete with OIS, and phase detection autofocus while the front will don an 8-megapixel sensor. There isn’t much to say about the camera yet as we’ve yet to test it but we’re hoping that it’ll perform similarly to the other device made by them: Nexus 6P – you can check out some camera samples  . Taking a look at its rear, you’ll again find a super-quick Huawei fingerprint sensor sitting just under the rear camera module. Biometric security is something that the Chinese manufacturer has locked down to almost perfection. Powering all this is the fairly large 4,000mAh non-removable battery that’s encased in a metal unibody. Although it is still smaller than what was on its predecessor, we’re expecting its battery life to be a lot better thanks to Android Marshmallow and a more efficient processor. Possibly lasting even two days. Despite being a phablet by definition, the smartphone weighs only 185grams which is pretty light in our books. Out of the box, you’ll get Emotion UI or 4.0 that’s overlaid on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow – the skin that always leaves you without an app drawer like other Chinese-based user interfaces. The Mate 8 supports Dual-SIM 4G LTE, NFC and has a micro SD slot as well for additional storage. Unfortunately, there’s no talk yet about how much the Mate 8 go for. Though, in the scenario that our currency exchange rates don’t fluctuate any further, it might be competitively priced against the Galaxy Note5."

It looked classy and simply reminded smartwatch makers that the smartwatch doesn’t need to have a massively redesigned look — classic good looks worked just fine, if not better. While the second generation Moto 360 fixed many of the problems that existed with the original smartwatch, there just didn’t seem to be enough to set it apart from its other   rivals. Matters are made worse in Malaysia as the biggest selling point of the Moto 360 — Moto Maker — isn’t even available here. However, if you’re like me, and have coveted this watch since you first laid eyes on it, good news! It finally got its official release here in Malaysia. I can’t really put into words why I like this watch. Maybe it’s how every little detail of it’s build is just slightly more refined than its competition. Take the   for example, it’s a thing of premium beauty that just oozes elegance, but if you ask me, I think the Moto 360 is just a little more refined and put together just a little better than the Huawei Watch. And when it comes to a premium build and feel, we all know the little details matter. But, I know many of you will be disappointed by the fact that the flat tyre is still here, despite the fact that other round smartwatches have done away with it. I was a little annoyed by it at first, but at the risk of sounding like a terrible cliche, there is no exquisite beauty without some strangeness in the proportion. There are other things to like about the Moto 360 too, like Android Wear. It has come a long way since its inception, bringing it closer than ever to being a well rounded smartwatch OS. However, it would be nice to have a more user-friendly UI so you won’t have to spend an hour or two just trying to work out how to navigate the interface. Plus, just because it doesn’t stand out too much in terms of performance and functionality compared to its rivals, it doesn’t mean that the watch isn’t a good performer. It is still a pretty solid all-rounder. What’s more, if you get the standard version, you have a near endless choice of straps as they use standard 20mm, 22mm and 16mm straps. If you’re a fitness junkie, they’ve even got a Moto 360 Sport variant which comes with a new ‘AnyLight’ display that improves visibility under bright light, plus GPS connectivity. However, this variant comes with a proprietary, non-swappable rubber strap which means that if you tear the strap, you’re going to be in a pretty bad spot. Here’s a recap of the specs. The standard Moto 360 retains the same round look with a durable 316L stainless steel case. The 46mm version gets a 1.56″ 360×300 display, while the smaller 42mm unit gets a 1.37″ 360×325 display. It supports both Android and iOS smartphones and it connects via Bluetooth and WiFi. There’s also a heart rate sensor and IP67 dust and water resistance. I can’t say this is the best Android Wear smartwatch money can buy because it certainly doesn’t blow people away with a kick ass spec sheet, but I can tell you that if I were to get an Android Wear watch, this would be it. It just looks and feels   on the wrist. It’s a smartwatch you buy with the strongest muscle in your chest, not that bowl of grey noodles sitting in our heads. If you are interested, the Moto 360’s pricing is as follows: All the smartwatches will be on sale at SenQ, Urban Republic and Thunder Match stores nationwide, as well as online at  . As a little icing on the cake, if you pick up the Moto 360 at the roadshow, you will be getting a 10% discount on all models on sale. If you purchase two smartwatches, that discount goes up to 20%. There is also a special deal for the first 100 customers, the details of which can be found  . The roadshow is being held at Mid Valley and will run until this Sunday, 21st February."

Or is that just me? Watching sinking smartphone giants throw a Hail Mary to keep their company from plummeting, but also making one monumental mistake, can be quite amusing too. Just take   and the   as an example. You can argue that it is a brilliant smartphone and that the specs are fabulous, but what you simply can’t justify is that exorbitant price tag — which in this metaphor represents the teacup. Unfortunately, on the surface, for a company that has made several smartphones I quite liked,   seems to be making the same mistake with their   — you just can’t justify that price tag. That’s what I thought going into the launch event anyway. I got to spend some time with the little One that could, and while my time with the device was incredibly limited, it did leave an impression. Let’s start with the build. I sound like a broken record but ever since the first One, HTC have proven that they’re capable of making some truly fantastic smartphone builds. They just know how to do premium metal devices. This One is no exception. The One A9 is awesomely built and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that based purely on feel alone, it will easily give you a premium feel. It’s pretty thin too, which should help it slide in and out of your pocket with minimal effort. Both a good and bad thing. The buttons are excellent and clicky which is great, and I like the fact that the power button has a different texture from the volume rockers letting you differentiate them easily without looking. If you can get over the fact that it looks incredibly similar to an iPhone, the One A9 is even quite handsome. Of course, if you’re into an iPhone clone in terms of looks, you will obviously like the One A9. It even has that same camera hump! Make no mistake, this isn’t a flagship device, despite its look and feel, the One A9 is still a mid-range smartphone at best. On the front, it’s got a 5-inch full HD display, which can get quite bright. Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 617 processor (slightly upscaled from the usual SD 615/616 mid-range processors) paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. On the demo unit, performance was snappy. It had no problems switching between tasks and HTC’s Sense UI was pretty easy on the eyes. While I’m not sure how this device would perform under a heavy load, had I not known that this device was running a mid-range processor, I might have been fooled into thinking that it had flagship level specs. That said, my time with the device was incredibly limited so I won’t pass judgement on it until we get a full review. In fact, my time was so limited that I didn’t have time to play with the 13-megapixel camera, so unfortunately, I won’t be touching on that in this first impressions. Or the front facing touch-sensitive fingerprint sensor cum home button. Need I say more? One of the most painful exclusions of any HTC smartphone is always their brilliant BoomSound front-facing speakers. They’re fantastic to listen to, often outperforming even other front-facing speakers. Instead, on the One A9, we get a downward facing  / -esque speaker. I guess if you’re going to look like an iPhone 6/6S, might as well go all out right? It does come with a DAC that does Dolby Audio with 24-bit Hi-Res Audio though. There’s no denying that HTC’s ship is sinking hard and sinking fast. People are even assigning situation-appropriate descriptions to replace HTC’s acronym. They need a saviour and unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like the One A9 is going to be it. With a recommended retail price of RM2,299, HTC are falling into the same trap BlackBerry fell into — thinking that their brand alone will be enough to push sales. We know you want to return to your glory days as soon as possible and the easiest way to do so is to overcharge for a smartphone. But, you’re no  , which means there won’t nearly be enough people who will blindly buy your product just to have your brand stamped on the back of it. The HTC One A9 then is a teacup, and a teacup — as we’ve established earlier — won’t be enough to save the sinking Taiwanese company. That said, I won’t say for certain that the One A9 isn’t worth your money (though it certainly seems that way) as I want to wait for a full review before deciding, but as of right now, HTC looks to be in dire straits."

In light of the 1970s hitting Cupertino’s darling in timely fashion, it looks like   hackers have been busy too. This time, it does a lot more damage than its Unix-based brethren. Like wiping all data on your smartphone and spreading the exploit further through random calls and texts. The malware known as “Mazar” was first discovered by Heimdal, a security firm based out of Denmark. Mazar begins its infiltration by sending a multimedia-based link in the form of a text message to unwitting users. Upon clicking the link, users will notice that their devices will begin downloading “Tor”, which then will allow Mazar to hide within the source code. You won’t have to worry if you’ve been sent the message and didn’t bother clicking on it, nothing will happen. Heimdal has only tested devices running on Android KitKat (4.4) but notes that the flaw could probably be on past versions. At the same time, it’ll be hard to know if newer versions also have this security hole as no testing was conducted on Lollipop and Marshmallow devices. Firstly, there’s one single line of defence by default on Android smartphones. That’s the ominous “Unknown sources” toggle in your security settings; an option that allows you to allow installations for apps of unknown origins. Believe us, the first thing we did was uncheck that bugger. Russians or Russian-speaking folks will also have another added wall since it apparently doesn’t affect devices with Russian as the default language. Lucky Russian speaking people."
Rory Lee,It looks like Huawei is rounding out the P9,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/17/it-looks-like-huawei-is-rounding-out-the-p9/,"Android,huawei,Huawei P9,Huawei P9 leak,leaked images,MWC 2016,smartphone","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-02-17,"Remember the “ ” about the upcoming   having four different variants, one of which is supposed to be a “feature-enhanced” version with a dual 12-megapixel camera setup? Well, if these recent rendered images hold any credibility, it looks like the rumours are true. From the rendered images, it the most eye-catching feature is obviously the dual camera with the centre flash module and what could be a laser-autofocus unit located right at the top of the smartphone — all of which is housed within a visor that is more obvious on the black, pink and gold models than the silver one. Also present on the back is  ‘s fingerprint sensor, which should be pretty snappy, located just below the camera module. The renders make it seem that the upcoming smartphone’s metal back plate has an interesting brushed texture to it, but that could also be due to poor image quality. One interesting thing to note is that Huawei seems to be doing away with the  ‘s  -esque square design, opting instead for a softer edged curve. Very  / -y in fact. Around the front of the device, there aren’t that many significant features besides what looks like a front-facing LED flash. These images come courtesy of a popular  , and when asked if these images were accurately representing the actual device, someone who has seen the device affirms it. However, a person with knowledge of the design notes that while the images were representative of the flagship device overall, its aspect ratio is slightly off. The source says that the actual device is slimmer and taller than the squat render seems to suggest. Spec-wise, the P9 is said to feature a homegrown Kirin 955 processor paired with 4GB of RAM powering a 5.2-inch full-HD display. Keeping the lights on is an average sized 2,900 mAh battery. It is worth noting that based on our previous report, the rumours say that this device will not be launched during the Mobile World Congress 2016 in Barcelona. Instead, Huawei will be focusing on their upcoming 2-in-1 device — the   — instead. What do you think of the P9?"

Hybrid tablet devices aren’t something particularly new but the fact that Huawei went ahead to produce the Matebook is what ultimately makes it special; because it represents a shift for the company away from just smartphones into the realm of ultra-mobile devices. Needless to say Huawei has put a lot of thought into building the Matebook, as its pretty sleek at just 6.9mm thick, lightweight at 640g (the iPad Pro weighs in at 713g) and has pretty good build quality. As for the device’s specs, we’re getting a 6th gen Intel Core M processor with the option of 4GB/8GB RAM, with storage options starting from 128GB to 512GB. All of this is supported by a large 4430mAh battery that will apparently give you 10 hours of usage per charge. That’s pretty much your work day right there. The screen on the other hand is a 12 inch IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 2160 x 1440. However, the Core M processor that’s running the show might be the device’s biggest Achilles heel. We’re not fans of the Core M chips and while they do run a lot cooler (and fanless) they trade off performance for the lower temperature and are generally really bad at multitasking. For a lot of devices, the accessories are barely more than afterthoughts, but this isn’t the case with the Matebook. Launching with the device is the MatePen, which surprisingly is a lot better than most pens you’ll find on the market. Not only is it balanced, it feels like you’re writing on paper as opposed to the feeling of writing on glass and has superb feedback and traction, especially since it supports up to 2048 levels of sensitivity. It comes with Autodesk Sketchbook that runs free for three months so you’ve essentially got a really powerful art tool at your disposal as well. Unfortunately the MatePen doesn’t come with the device and neither can it be stored magnetically like the one the  , and has no way to be stored on the Matebook itself at all. The optional dock that the Matebook has available with even has a USB type-C adaptor and a microUSB adaptor that’s all magnetised for easy storage. The device does come with a keyboard case though, and that already is a pretty big plus in our book. Processor aside, the pricing for the Matebook is also a bit of an issue. With a basemodel starting at $699 (that’s about  RM2,941 for us) its quite expensive for a 12 inch tablet hybrid PC with an Intel M processor. Sure, there’s plenty of extras but with pricing like that, they might find it hard to persuade people to jump on their ship. Competition is expected to be pretty stiff considering how late Huawei is coming to the laptop/tablet game. The brand does want us to view the Matebook as a productivity option but it might be a bit tough for it to stand up against the likes of the Surface and other similar devices but it might be able to considering it really has a lot going for it. Stay tuned for more   coverage as it comes. More Huawei Matebook images:"
Arif Lee,Instagram to bump up its security by introducing two-step login authentication,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/17/instagram-to-bump-up-its-security-by-introducing-two-step-login-authentication/,"Instagram,security,two-factor authentication,two-step authentication",Mobile Apps,2016-02-17,"Narcissistic behaviour has taken a hold of us humans since Twitter and Instagram came into the picture. There’s no point in arguing which of the two has a better argument to be secure, one keeps our thoughts in 140 characters while the other depicts the visuals in our lives. Twitter added two-factor authentication since 2013 and Instagram has just decided to do the same. Yeah, it might be a little annoying to get into your account if you’re signing in from a new device but, at least, no random psychopath is going to have access to your precious Instagram account. TechCrunch got in touch with an Instagram rep, confirming that they’ll begin to roll-out this added security layer. Verification will come via text message on your smartphones so bear in mind that a valid phone number is necessary. The typical routine will include an authentication code that is sent to your phone every time someone tries to access your account. Making it a little harder for hackers and stalkers to get inside your account as it’s more than just your email and password. Since Facebook snapped up the online photo/video-sharing app, it seemed like a good idea to further enhance its login system but it’s taken quite a while to finally arrive. For most of us, our Instagram accounts are no more than a photo/video album that we share with the world hoping we pass that 11 likes mark but for some it means a lot more and they’ll be sure to appreciate this news."

Adding some tongue and cheek to the whole situation is the way the spec sheet was photographed – looking more like a side dish to the rice grains in the photo. Xiaomi’s Mi 5 internal listing is pretty much all bare, aside from some exceptions. Xiaomi’s 2016 flagship smartphone is supposed to have the following specifications: Other than what’s listed on the paper, people have claimed that it’ll have 3GB or 4GB of RAM and 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The rear of the devices has been seen to come in either glass or an all metal variety, suggesting that the rear backings will dictate the low to high-end spec variants. Based on older leaks, this will the price range of the different versions: Meanwhile, what we can confirm would be the Mi 5 arriving with Dual-SIM 4G LTE and NFC – shown in an official teaser by their co-founder Lei Jun. From the sound of things, we’d like to hope that everything holds true and the device becomes Xiaomi’s best yet. ‘Cause in all honestly, we love it when Chinese manufacturers chip away at the large pieces of the pie that are dominated by Samsung and Apple."
Rory Lee,There is nothing we don’t know about the Samsung Galaxy S7 now,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/17/there-is-nothing-we-dont-know-about-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-now/,"Android Authority,Galaxy S7,hands-on video,leak,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,samsung leak","Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill",2016-02-17,"Oh dear, the   hasn’t even been unveiled yet and we already have a hands-on video. I guess some secrets simply won’t stay secret as Android Authority’s “ ” has given the some spec details as well as a couple of images plus a 14-second video of the upcoming   flagship. According to Android Authority, their source claims that the Galaxy S7 is indeed water resistant (IP68/IP67 rating) — as we found out earlier — and it will come preloaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Besides that, the device’s lights will be kept on courtesy of a 2,800 mAh battery. For optics, their source claims that the smartphone has a 12-megapixel shooter, though, despite the smaller megapixel size, it does have larger pixels similar to that on the   and 5X — or if you want to stretch the comparison,  ‘s UltraPixel unit. The current Galaxy flagships all have fantastic cameras, so we doubt that this one will be the unit to let it down, even if it uses Samsungs new and untested   technology. In fact, it is even supposed to improve the smartphone’s low-light capabilities. All that is nice and dandy but we think the spec that Samsung fans will be most excited for is the return of the microSD card slot. As shown in the image above, the tray has clear labels that one section is for the SIM card while the other is reserved for a microSD card slot. However, there is no SIM 2 option so it seems very unlikely that the Galaxy S7 will have support for a dual-SIM configuration. That said, despite the claims that the 12MP BRITECELL snapper can vastly reduce the camera hump, it appears that the S7 still has that square protruding unit that is sticking out from all the current Galaxys. That said, we can’t say for sure whether this will protrude as much as the current ones based on the angle of the shot. Finally, what seals the deal that this is very likely a legit Galaxy S7 is the curved  -esque back. We liked the curve as it helped the device fit better in our hand, something that you won’t find on the current Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Other than that, the phone is almost identical to the current  , so much so that from the front they look almost indistinguishable. Software wise, the UI looks very similar to that of the current TouchWiz, though it does look like a lighter skin. The Flipboard is still present on the left side of the screen, though. We didn’t get to take a peek at the notification quick-access, so we can’t tell what that looks like. Keep in mind that this is still not an official video or release so we won’t know exactly how accurate this leak is until the smartphone gets launched on 21st February. Keep it locked to SoyaCincau.com because we will be there covering the event live. What do you guys think of the Galaxy S7? Yay or nay? Let us know in the comments below."

Mainly that’s due to the Japanese company having great technology but bad implementation – awkwardly seen on their flailing flagship smartphones. The just announced sensor has Sony boasting about its 22.5-megapixel lens that comes feature-packed with an on-chip processor for auto-focus and image stabilisation. That isn’t all, as the Sony Exmor RS CMOS sensor will also be 1/0.2-inches smaller than its predecessor, now listed at 1/2.6-inches. It’ll also have a 1.0µm pixel size but Sony claims there’s nothing to worry about because they’ve used a special manufacturing technology that allows them to tweak light utilisation efficiency and improved the design of the circuit to maximise noise elimination. We’ll have to see how well this works in practice but knowing Sony, we’re not sure what to think just yet. In short, using a smaller sensor means that the pixel size will “suffer” to compensate for the form factor. Other add-ons also include a 3-axis video stabilisation that we talked about earlier but since it’s internal, there won’t be a need for accompanying modules like you see on the LG G4; that uses a Sony camera. We’re very familiar with Sony’s SteadyShot feature and we don’t expect them to mess up their image stabilisation feature though they’ve peaked our interest to see how much better they can improve it. Rumours indicate that Samsung will employ Sony for their upcoming flagships as they’ve done in the past and you can bet that other manufacturers are thinking of putting Sony’s IMX318 sensor on their upcoming devices. Repeated many times over, the equipment helps only so much as processing plays a big part too. Will Sony work on their image processing? Fingers crossed. While waiting, do check out our   and   to see how Sony’s current flagship sensor performs."

If either wants to come out ahead, they’ll have to pull out all the stops to draw the crowd — something Samsung is already on top of for their  / …and they’re using a llama. Ayy, llama-o. To try and edge their South Korean rivals, Samsung has launched an interesting ad campaign called the Seven Days of Unboxing, where, as the name suggests, there will be someone unboxing the new flagship device every single day for a week. On the first day, Samsung allowed Tyson — a five-year-old — into an unmarked black box, where the phone is, located in what looks like an empty warehouse. Tyson then had 30 seconds to unbox the device and take a good look at it before he was asked to draw what he saw. The resulting image looks like a bunch of flowers trapped in a box (if you can derive some meaning from this, do let us know in the comments below) which doesn’t give much of the device away. The second day though. Samsung sent a llama — yes, an actual living and breathing llama, not a guy in a llama suit — into the same unmarked black box where it had 30 seconds to “unbox” the S7/S7 edge before it had to paint what it saw. Clearly, without opposable thumbs, the llama isn’t going to be much of a painter, but using its sizable mouth, the animal left the canvas with several swaths of colours — gold, black, blue and silver — which hints at the potential colours available for the S7/S7 edge. Samsung’s new smartphones have been said to come pre-loaded with a bunch of   like waterproofing, a microSD slot and an all new camera technology.

The South Korean electronics giant said that the rollout will begin on 15th February 2016 to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge with the other Galaxy devices soon to follow suit. Samsung has also said that they will make separate announcements on details of OS updates scheduled for each market accordingly. If we refer to the earlier leaked rollout table, all Marshmallow supported Galaxy devices should receive their update latest by April of this year.

Nevertheless, if we’re sticking to the leaked schedule, we can expect the next Samsung devices to receive the Marshmallow updates to be the   and the   as those are the two remaining devices with an ETA of February 2016. Exactly when this will happen remains unclear. Android 6.0 brings a host of new features to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge devices, though the edge variant does get the better end of the deal. This is because there are specific improvements coming to the edge screen with this update. Most notable of which is that the panel is no longer limited to the 260-pixel width of the curved part of the display. In fact, it can now be expanded to 550 pixels wide, allowing even more content to be displayed. Now, users can customise up to nine Edge panels including both the People edge and Apps edge. Additionally, most of the Edge panels have also gotten a facelift — the People edge, for example, adds names under contact photos and a useful settings shortcut. Samsung are also introducing the Tasks edge where you can create action shortcuts (like create a contact, add a new note, add an alarm, etc), plus a Quick tools edge which will give you access to stuff like a ruler, flashlight or compass via handy dandy shortcuts. The Edge handle is also customisable, allowing users to control visual features like where it is, the lenght, transparency or get rid of it all together. There is no information on when this update will hit Malaysian Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge devices yet though, so do let us know if you’ve gotten your update already."

If you haven’t, what are you waiting for, go get  ! While the microsite does reveal some features, what is more interesting is the video that they’ve included in the microsite. So, is that an S7/S7 edge or is that a   in disguise? There’s no denying that the upcoming S7 looks almost identical to that of the existing Galaxy S6 series (thanks to leaks and renders), but the phone in this ad looks   identical, right down to the camera hump that the S7 is not supposed to have. But, we can’t completely dismiss the fact that this could be an S7 either because of that one scene in the rain. Sure, if you’ve ever spilt some water on a Galaxy S6 edge+, you would have noticed that it doesn’t die immediately (do not try this at home), but we doubt it’s something Sammy would advertise so openly. So, actual S7 hype? Let us know what you think in the comments below. Anyway, if you head on over to the microsite, you’ll be greeted with four separate images, each of which looks like it’s showing off one of the S7’s key features. The first of which looks like an emphasis on security and privacy. What we can deduce from this is that the upcoming S7 will have an improved form of biometric security — most likely a better fingerprint scanner. Though, there have been rumours floating around that the S7 could have an  . An improved fingerprint sensor seems like a safer bet though as even the new Galaxy A 2016 series is supposed to have an improved fingerprint scanner over the existing Galaxy S6. This one, we’re not too sure. Maybe it’s something about the design or curves or build. It’s a toss up at this point, so go ahead and let us know what you think this slide is trying to say. Couldn’t they have come up with a better word than “worry-less”? In any case, with the huge water droplets being the big hint, it looks like the they’re boasting some kind of water resistance that should be able to resist splash and rain. Finally, we have this, a sexy little macro shot of what looks like the S7’s 12-megapixel camera. This unit is supposed to come with Samsung’s latest BRITECELL camera tech that not only boasts a better low light performance (as is hinted in this picture) but also that it would significantly reduce the smartphone’s camera hump."

Sketchy name aside, the pictures look pretty legit if you’re asking us. Pretty legit and unfortunately pretty ugly as well. Based on a report by PhoneArena, who believe this phone to be the real deal, someone had allegedly got their hands on an imported LG G5 unit from the USA and has put it up for sale on Dubizzle — which is like the Craigslist of Dubai. The “G5” is on sale for AED2500 (around RM2,840) and apparently comes with a valid IMEI and is still in its original packaging. The device is listed as “brand new” and “perfect inside and out”, which is unsurprising if this device is the real deal. In fact, they should have labeled it “so new, it’s not even launched yet!”. Speaking of the camera unit, there have been rumours   around that the device will feature a rear dual-camera setup on the back. Although people were on the fence about whether this would actually be the case, if this leaked device is the real deal then we could very well have confirmation that it does indeed run on a dual-camera setup.

But, there is no way of confirming this based on the images we have. While this is all interesting, it is also a little disheartening as the LG G5 looks to be one ugly smartphone. Of course, taste differs based on the individual, but LOOK at it.

We dealt with new subjects, raging hormones and always stapling our exercise books together because we ran out of pages – either that or we started a new book altogether cause we “lost” the old ones. That’s what we told our teachers anyway. Now you’ll have a little more initiative to keep your one and only writing notebook, its reusability. This won’t come to much use in secondary school though it’ll be mighty useful if it was your personal notebook that you lug around to jot down ideas or personal notes since you can instantly upload it to the cloud through an app and your smartphone camera. Erasing comes your way when you use the Rocketbook Wave with Pilot’s Frixion pens and throw it into the microwave for a couple of minutes. The Rocketbook System utilises a special patent-pending image capture tech and 80 pages of its carefully dotted Grid+ system. Other than that, each page will also be accompanied by a particular QR code that organises pages accordingly in order. There are also seven symbols that will correspond to different apps and folders within apps like Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs and OneNote. Labelled the particular symbol on a page with a mark will instantly save that page in the applied app and folder that you’ve chosen. When you save these pages it’ll also be stored in the colour you’ve written in. The paper on Rocketbook’s Wave notebook isn’t all that special. It’s mainly the “thermochromic” ink in Pilot’s Frixion pens that react to heat and cold. However, the people behind notebook made it “microwave safe” and if you take a hairdryer to it, it’ll erase just as well just as long as it reaches 60-degrees Celsius. If you need an indicator, the notebook’s logo is thermally designed to turn white from blue when heated correctly. Rocketbook claims that the Frixion ink won’t fully evaporate when heated but these faint images won’t disturb the cloud-storage of overlaid notes. They’ve also stated to get the best out of the notebook, users can typically use them 10 times after which it might not perform to usual standards. Pledges begin at US$ 37 (RM 154.25) with shipping to Malaysia for one Rocketbook Wave and one black-coloured Pilot Frixion pen while you can pay US$ 141 (RM 587.16) for five notebooks that are each accompanied by a black pen. Adding an additional US$ 7 (RM 29.18) to your pledge will entitle you to a 3-pack of pens (black, red and blue). Delivery is expected to take place in August 2016 and it’ll come in two sizes: Standard, 8.5-inch by 9.5-inch and Executive, 5.8-inch by 8.9-inch."

This   for example. Today, we’ve got another handy piece of accessory for your smartphone that lets you hold your phone with your wrist. It’s called the TUSK, or Telephone Utility Support Kit, and is basically a support hinge that you can attach to your wrist to help hold your smartphone in place, acting as a little hands-free kit…that still requires your hands. Although it looks simple, from the demo video that its creator Derek Rieger put together, the little contraption seems to work like a charm. Not only does it strap your phone to your wrist like an Altair attaches his hidden blades, it also brings your smartphone up to you with a simple flick. What’s more, you can rotate your device on the hinge and even extend the support beam so that it holds your phone out in front of your hand for easy access and use. As demonstrated, Derek shows just some of the ways in which the wrist-mounted smartphone mount can help with daily activities — like holding your phone up as a flashlight when you need both hands to work, plus attaching your device face-up on your wrist so you can look at it like people do in sci-fi games and movies. Fallout 4 anyone? It certainly looks a lot more flexible and functional than the plastic wrist mount that comes with the Pip-Boy edition of the game. That said, there are some preliminary potential problems that the creator should probably address, like the ease of which you can attach and detach a smartphone. According to the  , it looks like you will have to stick your smartphone onto the base for it to be held in place. While he claims that it will not leave any residue on your smartphone, we don’t imagine it will be terribly easy to remove and replace your smartphone on the TUSK considering the strength of the adhesive. That said, this can be easily rectified with perhaps a twist lock plate that could be mounted on the back of your smartphone or a dedicated case. Regardless of its faults, this does seem like a pretty cool idea, but do keep in mind that this is still a crowdfunding project, and we’ve all heard the crowd-funding horror stories. If you’re interested in checking this device out, head on over to its   or Derek’s  . You can also pick one up for yourself by pledging a minimum of USD39 (around RM161).

Moving down the ladder, they have just announced 3 new processors that boasts better performance and battery life for the entry to mid-range segment.  The Snapdragon 625 is their latest mid-range processor and it uses a 14nm fab process that translates to greater power efficiency. According to Qualcomm, the 625 uses up to 35% less power compared to the Snapdragon 617 that’s currently powering the HTC One A9. It uses an Octa-Core set up with 8x ARM Cortex A53 running beyond 2.0GHz. In the graphics department, it gets an integrated Qualcom Adreno 506 GPU. The Snapdragon 625 chip will support displays up to 1900×1200 at 60fps and it is capable of capturing videos up to 4K. Connectivity wise, it gets X9 modem that does Cat 7 4G LTE (up to 300Mbps), 802.11ac WiFi and it also supports Qualcomm’s latest Quick Charge 3.0. On the current Snapdragon 600 series family, the 625 sits right below the Hexa-Core Snapdragon 650 that powers the current   and its higher end Octa-Core Snapdragon 652.  Next is their entry-level Snapdragon 435/425 offering. The 435 is pretty much an upgraded 430 processor based on 28nm process with 8 ARM Cortex A53 cores running up to 1.4GHz. and it gets an Adreno 505 GPU with support up to a 1080p display at 60fps. It is also capable of supporting cameras up to 21MP and records video up to 1080p. The only difference for the 435 is it supports X8 LTE that brings faster Cat 7 4G LTE speeds (up to 300Mbps) instead of the usual Cat 4 (up to 150Mbps). The Snapdragon 425 can be seen as the replacement of its current popular Snapdragon 410 processor. It still retains the same 4x ARM Cortex A53 cores but it runs on a higher 1.4GHz. While the display is capped at 1280×800 at 60fps, it supports cameras up to 16MP and captures video up to 1080p. WiFi connectivity is faster with 802.11ac MU-MIMO and it also supporters faster eMMC 5.1 storage. For 4G LTE, it uses its X6 LTE modem that claims to have superior battery life than its predecessor.

While being an affordable device, the Lumia 650 could be the better built smartphone from Microsoft in a while. Instead of a plasticky body that wraps around its current Lumia 950/950XL flagships, the Lumia 650 features a highly polished, diamond cut and anodized aluminum frame for a premium feel. On top of that, it is currently the thinnest Windows 10 smartphone at only 6.9mm, the same thickness as an iPhone 6. At the front, it gets a modest 5″ AMOLED display that pushes HD 720p resolution and it is toughen with Gorilla Glass 3. Under the hood, it gets a Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 Quad-Core processor that’s clocked at 1.3GHz. There’s also 1GB of RAM and 16GB of on-board storage that’s also expandable up to 200GB extra via microSD. For taking pictures, it gets a more decent 8MP f/2.2 main camera with LED flash, while the front gets a wide-angle 5MP shooter. Despite being a step above the Lumia 550, the battery on the Lumia 650 is slightly smaller at 2,000mAh. For this price range and processor, don’t expect this to support Continuum and it still charges up with a traditional microUSB cable.  
The Lumia 650 supports 4G LTE and it is also available in a dual-SIM variant. Available in either matte black or matte white, it will be first available in Europe starting on 18th February at US$199 (about RM822). As comparison, the Lumia 550 is   at RM559 in Malaysia.

According to Logitech, the keyboard is also spill-resistant, meaning it is well suited for those of you who have trouble keeping your drink in its cup/bottle. What’s more, the keyboard also features full-sized arrow keys as well as access (via a fn button) to fifteen different function keys ranging from calculator shortcuts to media controls. Logitech also claim that the keyboard comes with an “anti-fading” treatment which — according to them — means that you will “never have to worry about losing the letter from your keys”. These peripherals are fairly discreet in their stealthy black attire though the keys don’t look like they have much of a travel distance.

Well, here’s a short comparison that will hopefully give you a little clue. Both of these devices sport a 5.5-inch full-HD display, which as we know is pretty much as good of a compromise as it gets when it comes to crispiness versus battery-saving. However, these two metallic smartphones do not share the same battery size as the honor 5X gets the shorter end of that stick. While the honor 5X does have a pretty substantial 3,000 mAh battery, it simply can’t compare with the Redmi Note 3’s 4,000 mAh battery.

In another sample, Xiaomi President Bin Lin had taken a couple of shots of a moving bird in mid-flight. The sample shots turned out to be pretty sharp, demonstrating its fast autofocus speeds even in demanding situations.  Based on Hugo’s sample image with the dimension of 4608×3456, the Mi 5 is likely to be equipped with a 16MP main camera that’s likely to be assisted with Phase Detection AF. To recap on the specs, the Mi 5 is speculated to come in  , in either Quad HD and Full HD display variants. The screen is likely to be a 5-5.2 incher and it is said to be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 820 processor mated to either 3GB or 4GB of RAM.  The Mi 5 will be   on 24th February and it will be making an appearance during Mobile World Congress 2016 in Barcelona.

The One M9 is very well built but it   when compared with its flagship rivals. After the release of the  , HTC is still sticking to its polished metal unibody looks and the next flagship may not be surprisingly different. The folks at the Taiwanese smartphone brand are working on a new flagship dubbed as the “HTC Perfume” and it is likely to be the One M10 flagship when it launches. Serial leakster @evleaks has gotten a couple of juicy details of what the next HTC flagship might be. According to his source that’s close to the project, the device will get a 5.1″ Quad HD AMOLED display and it will run with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 820 processor. He is also told that it will be equipped with 4GB of RAM and a minimum of 32GB of on-board storage. Like all HTC flagships so far, the storage is still expandable via microSD.  HTC isn’t going to kill off its UltraPixel camera feature anytime soon. The main camera at the rear is said to be having a 12MP UltraPixel shooter that’s assisted with Laser AutoFocus while the front gets a 5MP shooter. What’s interesting is that both front and rear cameras are said to be assisted with Optical Image Stabilisation.  Like the One A9, the biggest letdown would be the lack of HTC’s famed Boom Sound stereo speakers. It will also get a fingerprint scanner in front that doubles up as a home button.  In terms of appearance, @evleaks had shared a front shot of the device as shown below and it somewhat looks like a  . According to another  , the One M10 will not feature HTC branding at the front and the device will be more heavily packed with camera features. He has even shared a mock-up of what it might look like as shown above.  From the design, it looks like a tweaked version of its HTC One A9 which many have mocked for   like an iPhone. In terms of availability, it could be launched towards the end of April or early May, which by that time, the Galaxy S7 would be widely available worldwide. What do you think? Is the HTC One M10 worth waiting for?"
Alexander Wong,Here’s what to expect from the Samsung Galaxy S7,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/15/heres-what-to-expect-from-the-samsung-galaxy-s7/,"Android,evleaks,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 Photos,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-15,"In just a week’s time, Samsung will be unveiling its latest flagship, the   at MWC 2016 in Barcelona. Serial leakster   have been dropping lots of leaks on their next big thing and this time we get to see its colour options. Find out what to expect from the big day after the break. 
 
Like a year ago, Samsung will be announcing two models – a Galaxy S7 and a Galaxy S7 edge that comes with a double curved display. To better differentiate the two, the Galaxy S7 edge will be a larger device (likely a 5.5″) while the “flat” Galaxy S7 will retain a more compact 5.1″ display. Both are still pushing Quad HD resolutions with its brilliant AMOLED displays.  
 Based on Evan’s latest leak, the Galaxy S7 edge will come with at least 3 colours – Gold, Black and Silver, while the standard S7 comes in Black and Silver. There are probably more to come since Samsung had introduced 4 colours for the S6/S6 edge, inclusive of one exclusive colour for each respective model.  With the use of metal and glass, expect the Galaxy S7/S7 edge to have the same “liquid metal” appearance. While it looks quite similar to the previous model, the S7/S7 edge should fit better in the hands with its more rounded corners.  
The Exynos 7420 was epic on the previous Galaxy S6/S6 edge and they had even carried it forward onto their latest Galaxy Note5 / S6 edge+ series. For 2016, Samsung will using their newest Exynos processor (Exynos 8890) which will be mated to 4GB of RAM. Samsung is also likely to have Snapdragon 820 powered variants for selected markets. In terms of performance, an earlier leaked photo of a Galaxy S7 edge was   scoring over 130,000 on Antutu, making it one of the fastest smartphones to date.  
When the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5 were launched, many were disappointed with the lack of expandable storage and the option to go bigger is either costly or non-available (in certain markets including Malaysia). To cater for power users, the   is likely to make a return on the S7 and S7 edge. For a greater peace of mind, the flagship duo might get dust and water resistance as well, which is a feature that’s nice to have. 
The cameras on the Galaxy S6/Note 5 were awesome and it was a point and shoot tool that you can rely on. Instead of a 16MP sensor, Samsung will be downsizing on pixel count for larger pixel size. Similar to the Nexus 6P, the new S7/S7 edge will be rocking a lower 12MP BRITECELL camera that should perform better in low light condition. The   apparently will be reduced significantly, making it flush with its back.  
 Samsung traditionally has been reasonably fast in rolling out its flagship smartphones to its international markets. With the announcement happening end of this month, we could be seeing it on our shores by end-March or early April. Looking at our current ringgit situation, don’t expect it to be any cheaper than its RM2,599 launch price for the Galaxy S6 in Malaysia.  VR seems to be a big deal for Samsung this year and there could be a special Gear VR bundle available on the launch day itself. Word has it that the Netherlands will   as early as next Monday with a free Gear VR headset bundle thrown in. To catch the  , mark your calendars for Monday, 22nd February at 2:00AM.

Alexander Wong,Qualcomm wants to deliver 1Gbps LTE speeds today,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/12/qualcomm-wants-to-deliver-1gbps-lte-speeds-today/,"1Gbps,1Gbps LTE,4g,4G LTE,5G,lte,LTE Modem,Qualcomm LTE Modem,Qualcomm X16,X16","LTE,Technologies",2016-02-12,"5G is still a long way go but the folks at Qualcomm wants to enable gigabit wireless connectivity today. Their new X16 LTE is the first commercially announced modem that’s designed to deliver up to fibre optic 1Gbps speeds over today’s 4G LTE networks. That’s LTE Category 16 speeds, versus the current Cat 9 (600Mbps) and Cat 6 (300Mbps) standards that are supported on current flagship smartphones.  Making 1Gbps possible is the use of multiple antennas and advanced signal processing. Through carrier aggregation, the X16 modem can receive 10 streams of LTE data simultaneously through 4 antennas. With an average throughput of 100Mbps per stream, you can get 1000Mbps download speeds combined.   Since late 2014, Qualcomm is capable of hitting 450Mbps via carrier aggregation (3x 20Hz) with up to 64-QAM on the Snapdragon 808 and 810 chipsets. Now with support for 256-QAM, the X16 modem is able to deliver more than double the speeds from the same amount of spectrum. To maximise its potential, it can also tap into LTE unlicensed spectrum such as 5GHz, that’s being used by 802.11ac WiFi. Before you get excited, the X16 modem isn’t available on their current Snapdragon lineup. Their current top-end Snapdragon 820 uses the X12 modem which goes up to 600Mbps. Even if it is available, the real life capabilities depend on the telcos themselves. Both Digi and Maxis have deployed LTE-A at selected locations but the reality is that we only managed to get slightly above 100Mbps versus its theoretical 300Mbps download speeds.  So is this 5G? Not really considering   by Huawei and NTT Docomo have already hit 3.6Gbps, with an average speed of 1.34Gbps. What can you do with it? How about watching live stream 360 VR videos at 4K resolution. We probably need to wait a year for devices to support them and a couple years extra for our telcos to catch up."
Rory Lee,"Bad news, the iPhone may not be the best phone to time travel with",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/15/apple-iphone-bug-brick-set-date-1-january-1970/,"apple,Apple iPhone,Brick,bug,how to fix iPhone brick,iOS,iOS date brick,iOS date bug,iPhone,Unix,Unix Time","Apple,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-15,"Oh dear, we have another   bug on our hands. If you haven’t been too busy with the Lunar New Year, you probably would have noticed that there is a new iPhone exploit going around that people can abuse to brick your iPhone by simply setting the date to 1st January 1970. Yup, you can brick an iPhone by changing its date. Apparently, the discovery of this bug was thanks to YouTuber  , who demonstrates in his video linked above what he thinks is the “fastest” way to brick an iPhone. All you need to do is head into your iPhone’s general settings and switch the date manually to 1st January 1970. It will take a lot of scrolling thanks to Apple’s brilliant manual date setting implementation but you’ll get there eventually. Once that’s done simply restart the device and it will be stuck in a bootloop. While   have suggested that the only way to fix this particular problem is to send your phone in for repairs/a swap,   has a simpler, more DIY solution. What he did was simply unscrew the back plate of the iPhone, lift it up and disconnect the battery powering the device. After a short 30 second wait, simply reconnect the battery and power on your phone. Disconnecting the battery resets the time and date so your iPhone should be good as new. Why does this happen? Well, the explanation is rather simple actually: Midnight on 1st January 1970 marks the start of what is known as the Unix time system — a simple system that programmers use to represent date and time based on how many seconds had elapsed since that January 1st, 1970. Here’s a video by   detailing why this problem happens and how it is related to the Unix time code. In a nutshell, setting the date to 1st January 1970 basically resets the Unix timestamp to zero, and because the phone (or somewhere in the programming code) will do a simple check upon startup (like a battery time calculation), setting the date before January 1st, 1970 (or the Unix epoch) causing an  . Since you can’t store negative numbers in this format, the number in the 64-bit processor wraps around to its maximum value — a date that is 20 times longer than the expected lifespan of the universe. As you can imagine, your little iPhone may run into some problems displaying that date. I can’t even display that date in my head. The result? A crash. It goes without saying that we do not encourage you to try this out on your iPhone and will not be responsible for any bricking of any iPhones. Do so at your own risk. We also do not encourage you to mess with your buddy’s iPhone otherwise, his/her iPhone may not be the only thing breaking. That said, it does seem rather silly that Apple allowed a bug like this to go through though it is worth mentioning that it only affects 64-bit iOS devices that are running iOS 8 and above. In any case, as JerryRigEverything suggests, the next time you want to go time travelling, bring an Android device. But hey, at least there is a fix, right?"

The front 5.5″ display pushes a high-resolution Quad HD AMOLED display and it is powered by an Octa-Core Snapdragon 652 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board it gets 16GB of storage that’s expandable via microSD. The main camera is said to be a 16MP f/2.0 shooter while the front comes with an 8MP selfie cam that’s assisted by a flash light. From the photo above, it does look like a cross-mix between a Galaxy S6 and a Sony Xperia Z3 series. It appears to be using glass and metal for its body, and there’s a protruding power button on the right side.  Combining a VR capable headset box, the overall Alcatel OneTouch Idol 4S package is expected to be priced at US$400 (about RM1658), which is able to give the   a run for its money. Also to be announced is a lower spec Idol 4 that comes with a smaller 5.2″ display with a Snapdragon 617 processor and 2GB RAM."

Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S7 still has a camera bump but it should be negligible,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/04/samsung-galaxy-s7-still-has-a-camera-bump-but-it-should-be-negligible/,"Android,Camera Bump,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 camera,Samsung Galaxy S7 Specs,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-04,"When the   and   came out, you can’t miss the protruding camera lens on the back. Fortunately, the cameras performed remarkably well but some would prefer if they could eliminate the bump for better aesthetics.  If you prefer for something more flush, the upcoming   might be close to achieving that according to serial leakster @OnLeaks.  Based on his intel, the Galaxy S7/S7 edge will still get a camera bump but it should be negligible. The current Galaxy S6 bump pops out by 1.7mm, while the new Galaxy S7 is said to be 0.8mm, which is more than 50% reduction. This is made possible with Samsung’s own   camera technology that’s designed for slimmer smartphone design.  The new cameras are said to be lower in pixel count at 12MP but it would be compensated with larger pixels for greater light sensitivity. Camera bumps or not, we are more concerned about its picture quality and we definitely expect more from Samsung after seeing the performance of its current 16MP shooters. When the Galaxy S7   went public, it looks very identical to its current S6 flagship but there are some minor design details that add more refinement. The double curve back design from the Galaxy Note5 is carried forward onto the Galaxy S7, while the section of the glass where it meets the edge is contoured slightly as shown above.  With a larger battery, purported to be a 3,000mAh unit, the Galaxy S7 will be thicker at 7.9mm (Galaxy S6: 6.8mm) but the overall width and height will be smaller thanks to its thinner bezels. So overall, you should be expecting a more compact design that’s smoother to hold in the hand. This kinda reminds us of the Galaxy S III with its Pebble like appearance. In terms of materials, Samsung will continue to use metal and glass for a premium look and feel."

Just two weeks before the launch of the  , the South Korean electronics giant decided to give their aging G4 a new lease on life. With Marshmallow, the G4 will get to reap all the benefits of the new version of Android including stuff like Doze and Now on Tap. Doze is definitely a much-needed addition to the G4’s repertoire of features because this device has, at best, had a very mediocre battery life from its 3,000 mAh unit. It is a replaceable battery though so things aren’t too bad if you’ve got one on hand. If you don’t know what Doze does, it basically puts the device into a low power state when it is not being used. Think iPad, and you will sort of get the general idea. In our experience, when we unplugged our Nexus 6P at 100% before heading to bed, once the next morning comes around, the device still has about 98-99% of its battery life left, even with WiFi on. Now on Tap is another great feature which lets you hold down the home key to let the OS scan what’s on your screen and pick out important highlights such as names, dates, and locations among other things. You also get access to App Permissions, which lets you individually change each app’s permission settings in the Settings menu. We got our update with a simple notification from our device, but if you haven’t gotten the notification, you can manually check if it has rolled out to your device yet. Simply head to Settings>General>About phone>Update Center>Software Update. If there is a pending update there will usually be a “1” in a red circle next to the Software Update button. Otherwise, just hit Software Update and hit the “Check now for update” button. If it isn’t there yet, simply wait a few days for it to roll out to you. For reference, the file size for the update is about 880MB."

Alexander Wong,"Which telco in Malaysia offers the best value for calls, SMS and data all in?",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/05/malaysia-high-quota-postpaid-plan-comparison-celcom-digi-maxis-umobile/,"Celcom,Celcom FIRST Gold,Celcom First Postpaid,Celcom Postpaid,DiGi,DiGi Postpaid,Digi smartplan 75,Malaysia Postpaid Comparison,Malaysia postpaid plan,Maxis,Maxis postpaid,MaxisONE Plan,Postpaid,postpaid plan,Postpaid Plan Comparison,U Mobile,U Mobile Hero P70 Postpaid,U Mobile Hero Postpaid,U Mobile Postpaid","Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-02-05,": Check out our   which includes supplementary lines. Malaysians are really getting spoilt for choice as the major telcos have gotten into a postpaid price war by delivering more data for less. After U Mobile introduced its   that offered 7GB of data and unlimited calls to all networks for RM70/month, the competition is seriously heating up. Digi has thrown the gauntlet by introducing its   that comes with similar offering at RM75/month for a limited time only. Just earlier this week, Celcom has responded by revamping its   plan with 10GB of data for only RM80/month.  So which is the best “Pau ka liau” (do everything) plan in town? Read on to find out.  
On the surface, Celcom offers the best value with 10GB for RM80/month. That’s equivalent to just RM8 per GB, and you also get unlimited free calls and SMS for greater peace of mind. However the only gripe is probably the way they split the data. 5GB is given for all day use and the other 5GB is only for the weekends (split at 1.25GB per weekend).  If you need more data, you can top up RM20 per GB and it is valid according to your billing cycle. Another plus for Celcom is that you can carry forward unused data up to 5GB but this is only from the all-day data bucket. On top of that, they are giving out 5GB of WiFi for free, but that’s only usable if you can find a Celcom WiFi hotspot in the first place.  
For Digi and U Mobile, both are very similar with 7GB of data and unlimited free calls. Unlike Celcom and Maxis, you would need to pay for SMS. For Digi, you can enjoy unlimited SMS but that’s only applicable to 3 numbers on their network.  If you use more than 7GB, you can top up data but both only offers a single short term option. 1GB on Digi costs RM8 and it is only valid for 2 days while U Mobile offers a booster pack of 1.5GB at RM10 that’s valid for 3 days.  : Maxis and Digi have upgraded their plans with more data. More details  . 
Meanwhile for Maxis, they are the most expensive of the lot offering just 1GB at RM98/month. While they promise a worry-free proposition with unlimited calls and SMS, it is way costly if you compare this with Celcom’s FIRST Gold plan side by side. Even if you plan to add more data, it will cost you a hefty RM30 per GB. What’s more mind boggling is that Maxis is offering 4GB of data for only RM48/month for its Hotlink prepaid users.  Of course, pricing is just one factor to consider. There are other things to take into account such as 4G LTE coverage, quality of calls, customer service, and other value added services that you may use in the future. For Celcom, they are offering unlimited music service via Yonder, while Digi offers unlimited music streaming for 120 days and free iflix for a year.  On U Mobile, you get to enjoy free   between 2AM and 10AM, plus free music streaming for radio and KKBox all day. If you travel a lot, U Mobile is also offering free 50MB data roaming daily for selected countries. As for Maxis, they do offer   with free streaming quota for its MaxisOne Plan but that’s only applicable if you opt for its higher MaxisONE 128 plan and above."

Me neither. As a consumer, I couldn’t be bothered about how well a company did in the last quarter, only that I can keep receiving the excellent service I chose. Numbers were never my thing — which explains my profession — so when people start droning on about how much they grew over the last quarter…I fall asleep. Imagine my surprise then when I sat through an entire financial report without dozing off once. All two and a half minutes of it! How do you turn one of the most boring things ever into something digestible by everyone? Make a viral video. Well, it isn’t quite viral yet, but it certainly checks a lot of the right boxes. All they need is for someone to fall down in it. We like to think that   has a couple of good ideas up their sleeves. A quick look at how they   is a good indication. They’re certainly not afraid to try new stuff out. Innovation is key, and this time, I think Maxis knocked it out of the park. They made use of modern video making tools like clever graphics and an attractive colour scheme (plus that popular off-camera-side-profile-shot) to deliver something that is usually meant for boring people in equally boring suits. No offence, but you probably see us as hippies sitting around a bonfire so that description is fair I think. What makes this video unique is that it makes the viewer feel smart. We like it when we can actually understand what a financial report is actually talking about, something that has always eluded me when it is presented in the form of a stack of dead processed trees. But, the key ingredient is that they’re building a personality. A relatable face for the company (notice he wasn’t wearing a fancy suit, only a simple shirt). Think of your favourite YouTubers, you remember them for who they are as people, right? You came for the content but stayed because you liked the individual. Otherwise, why on earth does   get so many views? (No offence Lew, I binge watch your videos all the time)"

MediaTek has finally come out and dismissed such claims, saying that the rumours are all a pile of horse dung. Okay, maybe not in those exact words, but you get the point. The Chinese SoC manufacturer has insisted on Weibo that the Helio X20 is already in mass production and there have been no instances of chip overheating observed. GSM Arena notes that while this is not too surprising, what is surprising is the way the chip stays cool. Apparently, when the higher end pair of 2.5GHz Cortex-A72 cores gets hot, they shut off, turning the chip into an octa-core Cortex-A53 processor. Basically, that means that for the most part, the fancy deca-core Helio X20 is only running on eight cores. That’s like buying a V10 car but only using all the cylinders some of the time. Actually, it’s worse because the two highest performing cores are the ones that aren’t working. That’s actually more like telling the only two grade-A scholars in your 10-man group assignment to take a break while the other average joes work on the assignment. Okay, maybe that isn’t a fair comparison, but on the surface, it sure looks like it. We’ll have to see how this chip actually pans out in daily usage because that’s the most important aspect.

Both these variants were designed to be premium alternatives to the existing Gear S2 Classic, and to be honest, they did look pretty good. Spec-wise, it’s exactly the same as the existing Gear S2 Classic with a 1.2″ circular Super AMOLED (360×360) panel that results in a 302ppi pixel density. It’s powered by a dual-core 1.0GHz processor and runs Samsung’s proprietary Tizen OS. It has 4GB of internal memory and half a GB of RAM. It’s also got other goodies like WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and a heartrate sensor. So, how much does an 18K Rose Gold or Platinum Gear S2 cost? Well, the cheapest Apple Watch Edition 18K Rose Gold costs RM47,000, so that should give you a rough estimate of how much the Gear S2 Classic would cost right? Nope. The Gear S2 Classic 18K Rose Gold and Platinum costs RM1,899, only RM300 more than the original Gear S2 Classic. Plus if you purchase it during the Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day festivities, Samsung will throw in two watch bands worth RM398 — brown and grey — for free.

Their recent   are abysmal. Plus their latest flagship is  . Yet it seems the folks in Japan haven’t gotten the memo because here’s  ‘s latest smartphone — the Phone Biz — and it runs Windows 10. 
 Here we go, another Windows Phone that will probably be let down by the buggy software. Why should you care about this phone? Well, the design for one is magnificent. If you’re unhappy with the fantastic-in-plastic   series then this VAIO Phone Biz may be the device you’ve been waiting for. It looks   good with that metallic finish and aluminium build.  The rails look really well done too, with the slight rounding just before it touches the screen to help with grip. The front is sleek and clean looking (which you would expect if it is supposed to be a business-centric phone) but I’m a little worried about that massive bottom chin. It’s not like it has a great big speaker at the back/front or anything so why is the bezel so big? Still, that subtle curve at the back is definitely attractive if you can ignore the tiny speaker grille and the two panels at the top and bottom. However, on the inside things aren’t as good. It’s got a 5.5-inch 1080p LCD panel with a Snapdragon 617 processor and 3GB of RAM. For camera optics, you get a 13MP rear shooter with a single LED flash. Decidedly midrange then, though it is worth mentioning that this device supports   — a function that lets you use your phone like a desktop. Here’s the weird part: That power button placement. This is a 5.5-inch device with a massive chin and forehead bezel but the power button looks like it’s located right at the top. Pick up your 5.5-inch phone and try to reach the top without changing your grip on the phone. Any luck? Either way, this sleek metal thing will go for JPY50,000 (around RM 1760), but there is no news on whether it will be available locally. All that’s dandy but why Windows 10? Surely there has to be a better mobile OS. VAIO spun off from Sony when Sony decided to sell off its computer division due to   PC sales. This would be their second phone after the first   of the Panasonic Eluga U2."

Rumours and leaks obviously exploded and many of them pointed at Xiaomi releasing s — one with a glass and metal construction and one that is all metal. Now it looks like we have a leaked photo of one of the backs. What you’re looking at is supposedly the back plate of the glass + metal variant of the but, what’s interesting is that they don’t match up with the renders of the device we revealed earlier. First off, the flash is on the wrong side of the camera module — opposite of that on the Mi Note as well — but the shape is pretty much the same. Secondly, this back panel isn’t curved either as suggested by earlier leaked renders. It does look good though, there’s no doubt about that, especially with that fascinating pattern.

As a recap of the Mi 5’s specs, it is said to run a Snapdragon 820 processor with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM as well as either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Unfortunately, not all Mi 5s will be made the same as the all-metal variants are said to be the lower specd version. That means, the all-metal devices will feature a full HD 1080p resolution screen whereas the glass and metal ones will pack a QHD 2K display. Sizes for the screen has been said to range from either 5-5.2″. For camera specs, it is said to feature a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a 3,600 mAh battery to give it juice.

Tons of new phones, tons of new devices and a whole lot of people. But smartphone manufacturers have begun to hijack the crowd that will be going to MWC and have their own launch event just before it. Two tech giants have done exactly that —   and   — but while it was very likely the   would be revealed on 21 February, we never had any confirmation…until now. LG USA has released three teaser images featuring the number 5 plus a caption reading #LGG5, February 21st. #MWC2016″. #Hype? Worth noting that LG USA has since removed the tweet. Was it a blunder or an intentional tease? This means the G5 and Samsung’s dynamic   duo will go head to head on the same day. While we’ve heard a lot of exciting specs about these two devices, we want to know is, which would you get? On paper, these 2016 flagships clearly have not skimmed on power. The LG G5, for example, is said to sport the latest next-gen processor from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 820 — a quad-core chip with their latest Kryo CPU architecture — plus 3GB (  say 4GB) of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Samsung’s latest flagships will allegedly feature similar specs to the LG G5. According to popular leakster @evleaks, the upcoming Samsung devices will feature either a Snapdragon 820 or an Exynos 8890 processor (depending on the region) coupled with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. However, while the S7 and S7 edge are supposed to have a larger 3,000 mAh and 3,600 mAh battery respectively compared to the LG G5’s small 2,800 mAh unit, the LG G5’s battery is removable. Here is where Samsung has the slight edge though as their S7 will likely come in two variants — the 5.1-inch regular version and the 5.5-inch edge version. They will also be Quad HD Super AMOLED displays and we know just how fantastic Samsung’s panels are. Plus, the edge variant will probably have all of Samsung’s nifty edge features to boot. The LG G5, though, allegedly has a smaller 5.3-inch screen (down from the G4’s 5.5-inch panel. Why did LG decide to go with a smaller display? Well its allegedly because they want to make room for a secondary   display (think  ) which can house notifications, updates, quick settings among other things. The good thing about cramming a Quad HD panel on a 5.3-inch screen though is that the dots per inch (dpi) value will be off the charts.   actually. Details on the LG G5’s camera are a little all over the place at the moment. Some say that the device will come with a 21-megapixel Sony sensor while others place a 16-megapixel shooter with a secondary camera on the back of the G5 which will help it achieve a wide 135-degree field of view. Either way, with how good the G4 and V10’s cameras are, we don’t think LG will let us down with the G5. Samsung, on the other hand, has pulled out all the stops, introducing their new BRITECELL camera technology that will not only reduce the size of the camera hump but also improve low light performance. Pair that with a 12-megapixel sensor with an f/1.7 aperture lens and we’ve got what looks like a very capable camera. Both devices will obviously feature a front-facing selfie shooter, with the LG G5’s one suspected to be an 8MP unit while the S7 gets a 5MP snapper. Samsung’s new flagships have a host of extra features that were missing on the Galaxy S6. Waterproofing is supposed to be one of them. A microSD card slot is also supposed to be another, which will undoubtedly put a smile on Sammy’s fans. LG though, seem to have baked something rather interesting into their G5. While rumours of an iris scanner have been floating around, there has been no solid confirmation on whether or not this is true. What does seem to keep popping up is something called the “ ” which is supposed to allow for modular hardware upgrade — some examples include different types of cameras. While there is no word on how this will be implemented exactly, it is something to look out for. However, there is no hard confirmation on whether the smartphone will come with a microSD card slot. While these devices do look fairly good on paper, keep in mind that these are only rumours and nothing has been officially confirmed yet so we’ll have to wait until the 21st of February to see. Still, this is shaping up to be a pretty interesting fight. What do you guys think? Which is the worthier flagship? Let us know in the comments below."

If a tablet was one of the characters in my sappy rom-com, it’d be the ‘one that got away’. To me, it was a novel idea where you could have your smartphone with you for the serious business stuff while your tablet showed you a good time between working hours — literally, with videos and movies or a good book — but when you actually think about it, the tablet simply isn’t practical. If you take a look at the International Data Corporation’s (IDC) latest report on their preliminary data from the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker, you’ll find the truth in my words as tablet sales are on a downward trajectory. That’s not to say it’s all doom and gloom though as their report also says that detachable tablet sales have reached an all-time high — lead by the sales of none other than the  . Spearheading the detachable (or convertible/2-in-1) pack to finish at 8.1 million devices sold in Q4 of 2015 is Apple’s biggest iPad, the Pro, raking in just over 2 million units sold — more than Microsoft’s entire   lineup put together. That’s quite surprising if you ask me because we think that the Surface, especially the   is a   that can easily replace your laptop, at least for productivity anyway. On the other hand, if you look at reviews online, the iPad Pro is nothing more than a ginormous   with a flimsy looking rubber keyboard that has the word “Smart” in its name. Uh oh, am I “bashing” Apple again? Oops. I guess I was wrong then if we’re going off sales figures because Microsoft only sold about 1.6 million Surface devices in the same quarter. That’s a gigantic gap especially if you consider how many Surface devices there are on the market versus the lone iPad Pro. Quite a feat then but it’s worth noting that this is only one quarter and we’ll have to see if the iPad Pro can keep this up over the coming quarters. We can definitely see the appeal of a 2-in-1 because it brings the power of the laptop into the form-factor of a tablet. The emphasis is on power though as IDC’s findings reveal that of the Surface devices sold, more of them are of the pricier and more powerful Surface Pro line, as opposed to a more affordable Surface 3. That said, Microsoft wasn’t the biggest loser in the last quarter because that title belongs to Google. According to the IDC, Google’s recent stab at staking a claim in the convertible market was rather lackluster and that it “will require a lot more refinement to achieve any measurable success”. Oh dear. Google better get cracking on that   if they want to carve a slice out of this market. Rounding up the report though is the sad news of the “slate” tablet’s slow demise as the entire tablet sales dropped 10.1%, from 230.1 million to 206.8 million devices. The way we see it, the problem with the slate tablet is that they’re neither here nor there. Unless you’re picking up one of Apple’s iPads (they’re leading the sales by the way at 16.1 million units shipped — 7.1 million more than the second-placed Samsung) which do offer some tablet optimisations, you’re usually stuck with either an unoptimised Android tablet or a buggy Windows tablet. Amazon’s USD50 (around RM210) Fire tablet, which runs on their own Fire OS, did come in at a surprising third place — accounting for 7.9% of the market share, beating out the likes of Lenovo and Huawei. Though IDC does note that Amazon’s success is purely based on the price of its tablet. Trying times for the tablet industry it seems, though, there is some hope in the convertible market, it looks like the slate tablet is slowly dying off."

Not only that but the entire plan itself has received a price cut of RM20 working out to a theoretical RM5.33/GB of Internet. An emphasis on the theoretical part though because your Internet quota is split between three different types and even in the most ideal of situations it seems unlikely that you will be able to make full use of it all. Nevertheless, this plan also comes with unlimited calls and SMS to all networks which gives it the slight edge over Digi’s recent   SmartPlan 75 and the   which only offers unlimited calls, but as those two plans are cheaper at RM75 and RM70 respectively, it definitely evens things out. Plus, if you’re counting raw 24/7 data alone, both of the plans offer 7GB mobile data, which is 2GB up from Celcom’s 5GB. But, depending on your weekend data usage, you may use more than 2GB over four weekends which would once again place the plans quite evenly with each other. You will get to bring over any unused quota (up to 5GB) to the next month though, which is a nice touch. What’s more, if you exceed RM225 on your monthly usage, Celcom will give you 1GB of bonus data and 2GB of bonus data if you exceed RM500 per month. This means you’re eligible for up to 3GB of bonus data per month if you spend more than RM500 on your monthly usage. Celcom also provides free music streaming from Yonder for 12 months to their FIRST Gold subscribers. Besides that, you can also be in the running for Celcom’s giveaway promotion where they have given out free   and petrol thus far.

The Celcom NewPhone program is open to current and new Celcom customers and you can own your phone with monthly installments over 24 months. On top of that, you get to change phones for free every 12 months. Unlike Maxis, Celcom gives you the option to change phones earlier. If intend to do this before 12 months, an advance change fee will apply that ranges between RM300 to RM1,000 depending on phone model. Similar to Maxis, you are required to return your existing device in good condition. For greater peace of mind, they are also offering Device Protection which gives you coverage for damages, theft, and even water damage. For new Celcom customers (or those who have only been Celcom customers for less than a year), if you do opt for the NewPhone plan, you will be required to pay 3 months of your NewPhone’s installment upfront, which will be rebated back to you over the coming months.

This time, we supposedly get a glimpse at how Samsung are addressing one of the biggest weaknesses of their previous   flagship — the battery life. According to popular leakster Eldar Murtazin, the Galaxy S7 can last 17 hours of continuous video playback “with maximum backlight” — which according to Eldra is a record for this class of devices. Video playback consumes quite a lot of battery power — especially at maximum brightness on what should be a Quad HD display. If this is true, 17 hours of continuous video playback at maximum brightness is borderline bonkers. Even tablets can’t last 17 hours of continuous video playback. We are curious how they achieved this feat, if it’s true. If we compare the Galaxy S7’s purported 3,000 mAh battery to its predecessor Galaxy S6 active’s 3,500 mAh battery you can sort of get a scale of how insane this claim seems as the Galaxy S6 active can only manage about 10-11 hours of video playback with  . What’s more, Murtazin revealed that the Galaxy S7’s battery takes 100 minutes to go from 0-100% charged which is a touch longer than the existing Galaxy S flagships, but we doubt that people will mind that if the battery can truly last as long as Murtazin claims it to be. That said, this is just a rumour with no word on the conditions of the test — for example, was this streamed or played offline — so do take it with a pinch of salt. If we add this to the list of purported specs that the Galaxy S7 is said to feature — a Snapdragon 820 SoC (and likely the Exynos 8890 in different regions), 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, a 12-megapixel BRITECELL primary camera and a 5MP wide-angle selfie camera (f/1.7 aperture for both) — plus waterproofing and a microSD card slot, Samsung’s next flagship looks to be a beast. The S7 is also said to come in two variants, the 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge.

Rory Lee,Would you use Samsung’s baked-in browser if it had an ad block plugin?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/01/would-you-use-samsungs-baked-in-browser-if-it-had-an-ad-block-plugin/,"Samsung,Samsung ad block,Samsung Ad Block Internet,Samsung adblock,Samsung Internet,Samsung Internet 4.0","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-01,"Ad blocking is not something new. It screws over some people who rely on ads to generate income so ad blocking is generally frowned upon but let’s face it, we all do it. Pop-up ads are just too annoying to not use an ad block program. While many are religious about using an ad block extension for browsing online, when it comes to mobile browsing, most don’t care anymore. Mostly because the process of installing an ad blocker on your phone is just so complicated. Well,   wants to help you along by adding support for content and ad blocking plugins to their preinstalled web browser. This updated browser is being pushed to all Samsung phones with Android Lollipop or newer starting today. It will allow users to install helper apps that block ads from websites they visit, similar to Apple’s Safari browser in iOS 9. The first content blocker available for Samsung’s Internet app is Adblock Fast — which is supposed to be the “world’s fastest ad blocker”. Whether that claim rings true doesn’t matter because it is said that this plugin can decrease the web page load times on Android by 51 percent — makes sense since you don’t have to load the banner/popup ads on a page. Still 51% isn’t a number to scoff at. A quick search on the Google Play Store, there are several browsers with built-in ad block functions but none of them have been able to really get people to jump over from Google Chrome. Let’s see how well this does. It is available for Samsung Internet 4.0 and users can download it from the   but keep in mind that the Internet version 4.0 is only being pushed out, so it may not be available on your device yet. Oh, and your device needs to be on Android Lollipop or newer. What do you guys think of this “new” function? Would you use Samsung’s Internet app over Chrome over this? Or maybe you’re already using Internet. Either way, let us know in the comments below."

What started out as a promising third player in the mobile OS game was quickly shot down. In a recent   by the IDC, it showed that in the recent quarter, about 400 million smartphones were sold and if you compare that to Microsoft’s earnings report, only 4.5 million of them were Lumia devices. That’s 1.1% of the market share. To contrast,   moved around 85 million devices in that same quarter. Things don’t get much better if you compare all time sales between   +   and Windows, where Microsoft and Nokia only shipped 110 million devices total compared to the 4.5 billion Android and iOS devices sold in the same period. That’s only about 2.4% of the market share. And, if you look at this graph, things look like they’re going from bad to worse. I loved the Windows Phone. I spent two years of my life committed to my little Lumia 625. I loved the way it looks, the cool animations and most of all I loved the unified idea behind this new operating system. Despite all the qualms, despite all the bugs and despite all the problems, I convinced myself that the OS was new and it could only get better. Right? Well, I can’t say that with certainty anymore. When Windows Phone first came out, many jumped for it. Extensive investment went into the platform and developing devices for it.   took a stab with their Venue Pro,   went all-in with a pretty stellar lineup of devices (some were tempting from a looks standpoint) and even manufacturers like   and Samsung had a pretty decent lineup to offer. However, as pointed out by Vlad Savov, these investments proved fruitless. Microsoft wanted to be the leading light in their own OS — understandably — and the apparent favouritism towards   (which they later acquired) was enough to piss the other manufacturers off."

But looks are all they’re offering as under the hood these smartwatches are very much the same as the current   Classic. The Gear S2 Classic in 18K Rose Gold is paired with an Ivory Genuine Leather Band while the Platinum version comes with a Black Genuine Leather Strap. Besides the new variants, Samsung is also expanding its watch strap and watch face collection, partnering with exclusive designers like Colombo, introducing premium watch straps for the Gear S2 as well as new watch faces including Peanuts characters and artworks from Keith Haring, Jean-Michael Basquiat, Jeremyville and Burton Morris. Both are expected to be available globally come February this year, but there is no word on its pricing.  With an 18 Karat case for the Rose Gold edition, though, we don’t expect this smartwatch to come cheap.

Add that to the fact that smartphones now come with added security and encryption services, like the fingerprint, and you have another avenue for smartphone utilisation — paying for stuff at the store. Samsung Pay is one of these wireless, moneyless, wave-to-pay services that lets you use either of the following devices: to store your credit or debit card information and let you pay with your phone at “virtually anywhere you can swipe or tap your card”. Support for Samsung Pay is also available on the Gear S2 smartwatch. To illustrate, here’s a clever advertisement about Samsung Pay: As you can tell from the video, it’s fairly simple to get started on using this service. Simply swipe up on your phone to launch the app, pick the card you want to use, secure with your fingerprint and hover your device over the card reader to pay. Hassle free. Of course, it is likely that when this Service comes to SEA, not all banks or carriers will be supported but it is safe to assume that many of the major ones will be. As Samsung have only just announced this at their SEA Forum, there is little information on when this will actually arrive in Malaysia (or if it will at all), though Samsung has said that Singapore and Australia will be the first countries to get this service.

With the  , the South Korean electronics company showed that they could do “premium” incredibly well and I wondered if that aspect would carry over to the Galaxy A lineup, or if it would just be a half-arsed rehash. Well, when I arrived at the launch venue floor, that thought was quickly answered. The one I was waiting to find out about. Was it going to live up to the hype? In short, yeah it did that and more. Like the Galaxy S6, the glass panels of the A series (yes all three of them) came together with the metal frame about as well as glass and metal can possibly come together. The 2.5D contoured edge glass helped with giving the side of the phone a rounded and more natural feel in the hand. Each panel was a massive fingerprint magnet, though — as glass usually is — but at least they’re Corning Gorilla Glass 4, so that should keep scratches at bay. The buttons were fantastically tactile and had a satisfying click, even the home button. The three devices are spec’d accordingly, with the smallest 4.7-inch Galaxy A3 being powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon quad-core processor paired with 1.5GHz on RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. It is also powered by a smaller 2,300 mAh battery. On the other hand, the bigger 5.2-inch Galaxy A5 has the same processor as the Galaxy A7 — a 1.6GHz octa-core Snapdragon SoC — with the only difference being that the 5.5-inch Galaxy A7 has 3GB of RAM over the Galaxy A5’s 2GB of RAM. Performance across the board was relatively smooth, the most buttery of which is the Galaxy A7. If you place the Galaxy A3 next to either the Galaxy A5 or Galaxy A7, you will notice a slight delay when it comes to switching between multiple applications. In terms of connectivity, all 3 models support Dual-SIM and you’ll be pleased to know that the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 has a dedicated microSD slot, so you can pop in two SIM cards with no compromises. For a series separated by price and tiers, buyers would be happy to know that Samsung didn’t skimp on the camera optics. Well, not by much anyway. All three devices share the same 13-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo, except for the fact that the Galaxy A3’s snapper is missing optical image stabilisation. Though, with a large f/1.9 aperture lens I don’t foresee poor low-light performance to take too much of a hit. That said, we will have to put them through a proper camera test before passing judgement. As these are Samsung devices. it isn’t surprising that they come preloaded with some extra features. While some were fairly gimmicky, there are two features that stand out. The first of which is the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7. It’s supposed to be an improved version over the existing Galaxy S6 and from what we can tell, it’s pretty good. Nowhere near as snappy as a Huawei or Apple sensor, but it’s not bad. Another great feature that we were happy came over to the midrange devices was the double tap home button to quick launch the camera. It works as well as on the other flagship devices. In conclusion, these are really pretty good devices. They’re well built and look really premium but they’re expensive. Very expensive. The Galaxy A3 is priced at RM1,299 while the Galaxy A5 is priced at RM1,599. The top of the range Galaxy A7 is going for RM1,899, which is encroaching flagship price territory. To make the Galaxy A series more enticing, all 3 models will come with an extra 32GB microSD card, giving them a total of 48GB of storage out of the box. If you’re looking for something affordable, I can’t honestly recommend any of these devices.

Rory Lee,Samsung’s Galaxy A 2016 series has landed in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/28/samsungs-galaxy-a-series-has-landed-in-malaysia/,"Galaxy A launch Malaysia,Galaxy A official launch,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy A,Samsung Galaxy A 2016,Samsung Galaxy A 2016 launch malaysia,Samsung Galaxy A3 2016 launch Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy A5 2016 launch Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy A7 2016 launch Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-01-28,"has officially unveiled their midrange   in Malaysia. Being one of the company’s first moves into the budget-premium market, the original Galaxy A series was fairly well received and Samsung hopes to replicate that success with the 2016 versions. Much like the original Galaxy A smartphones, these 2016 models feature a premium metal body that is reminiscent of the electronics giant’s flagship   smartphone. The glass panel on the backs of the devices definitely gives them an air of exceptional build quality. Today, they unveiled three phones — the  ,  , and   — which are differentiated by price. As these phones are not created as equals, the more expensive Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 have a fingerprint sensor embedded bellow the home button, a big feature that is missing on the Galaxy A3. However, they do share several key features. The first, and most notable of which, is that all three devices — even the little Galaxy A3 — sports a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture primary shooter plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 front-facing selfie camera. What separates them is that the Galaxy A3’s primary camera unit does not have OIS while the bigger two do. All three devices also have support for dual-SIM plus an expandable microSD storage slot. Except for the Galaxy A3, the devices don’t use a hybrid-SIM set up so you can use two SIM cards and a microSD card simultaneously. On the Galaxy A3 you will have to sacrifice one SIM for storage expansion. The king of the hill among the Galaxy A lineup, the Galaxy A7 sports a large 5.5-inch full HD Super AMOLED display on the front of the phone. Inside, it’s powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). Giving this smartphone juice is a large 3,300 mAh battery. What is basically a shrunken version of the larger Galaxy A7, the Galaxy A5 comes in at only 5.2-inches, but sports the same Super AMOLED full HD panel found on the Galaxy A7. It packs a 1.6GHz octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. For battery, the Galaxy A5 gets a respectable 2,900 mAh unit in the back. Finally, we arrive at the runt of the family, the Galaxy A3. It comes with a small 4.7-inch HD Super AMOLED display and a quad-core 1.5GHz processor on the inside. Helping you with running apps is 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Since it’s the smallest device here, Samsung have fitted it with a small 2.300 mAh battery to keep things going. It is worth noting that none of these devices will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Instead, they will default to the older Android 5.1 Lollipop, though we do expect them to receive the Marshmallow update sometime in the future. If you want to get your hands on these three devices, the Galaxy A7 will go for RM1,899 while the Galaxy A5 retails for RM1,599 and the Galaxy A3 will set you back RM1,299 including GST. All of these devices can be purchased at the official Samsung retailers from 28 January onwards. All purchases will be bundled with a 32GB microSD card free of charge. The devices will come in four colours — Black, Gold, White and Pink Gold.   From today until 31 January 2016, there will be a roadshow at Sunway Pyramid’s Blue Concourse for the general public to experience the features that the Galaxy A Series 2016 has to offer. A number of units are up for grabs for lucky winners."

This would help Celcom to accelerate its 4G LTE coverage by providing a robust and high bandwidth capacity to their sites through TM’s fibre network.  
The next agreement is to extend’s Celcom’s access to TM’s HSBB Network.

That’s all peaches and unicorn farts, but what’s gonna happen to this ad? MyTeksi not seksi anymore? Aw, shucks. Regardless, this rebrand does bring more features to the existing Grab app. In an attempt to unify their services into one platform, Grab is adding three new features to their service. No, not that kind of flash, get your head out of the gutter. What this Flash does is put every kind of vehicle (from a standard taxi to a GrabCar+) on the map. Simply hit it and it will call the nearest vehicle to you regardless of the type of ride — perfect for when you’re in a hurry. Keep in mind that Flash is currently only available in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam whereas roll out in Malaysia is set for 30 January. This service lets you input more than one credit card, or choose to pay with cash or use someone else’s verified credit card to book a ride. Once again, the multiple card function will only roll out to Malaysia in February of this year. What this does is basically keep your business rides and expenses separate from your personal ones. In-app features include the expense code, trip detail fields for tracking and expense claim purposes. Passengers can log onto the   to download their consolidated business or personal statements for claims submissions purposes. You can also add a corporate card via the multiple credit card support and toggle between them easily.

Rory Lee,"Microsoft’s new case looks good, but only on the surface",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/27/microsofts-new-case-looks-good-but-only-on-the-surface/,"flip case,microsoft,Microsoft case,Microsoft flip case,Microsoft Surface,Microsoft Surface Phone,smart phone case,smartphone case","Industry in General,Microsoft,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows Phone",2016-01-27,"I hate flip cases. They’re horribly old fashioned and often come in colours that resemble different shades of puke. Plus, except for   Case, most flip cases never did anything particularly  . Sure you might have some practical functions, but none that doesn’t scream “ZOMG WHAT A DWEEB”. Okay, maybe I’m being a little harsh here but the point is, I would never, ever,   use a flip cover case…unless they did this. So with a flip case for your smartphone, you’re often left with a lot of space on the inside of your flip case. Space which can be used to either let your toddler/cousin/nephew/niece enthusiastically doodle on, or perhaps use it as a space for you to stick photos of your loved ones — y’know like the inside of a locker door. However, neither of those are particularly practical, nor do they help you do more with your smartphone in any way. Well, it looks like the boffins at Microsoft Research — Microsoft’s research division (go figure) — seem to have figured out a brilliant way to make use of that space. Enter the   “Type Cover” for your phone. What they’ve done with the flip cover is line the inside of the case with an always-on, low-power display that can display “useful information”. Some examples provided by the concept includes the displaying of travel itineraries, tickets, the calendar while you’re composing an email, and (my personal favourite) a fully qwerty touch keyboard. That sounds fantastic doesn’t it? It is, until you realise that if this “inside screen” is touch sensitive and is attached to the side of your phone, how on earth are you going to type with both hands? Here’s a picture to illustrate my point: So unless you’re typing with your index fingers on the table, or if you tuck the case behind your device, it’s kind of unfeasible. Plus, if you do the latter, you might as well just use the multitasking button to switch between apps. There is promise when it comes to the full QWERTY keyboard though, but even that has it’s problems. Because if the phone/case does not have a kickstand it’ll just end up looking like this really   for a  . Either way, it looks like this is merely a concept and could do with a lot more polishing. The good news is that we might not have to wait for the rumoured “ ” to (hopefully) test this case out because Microsoft Research is supposedly “in deep talks” with the Lumia division to turn these flip covers into real products. What do you guys think? Is one screen enough?"

When you sit down, you whip out your phone. When the food comes, you whip it out to post a picture what you’re eating on social media. When you want to avoid awkward conversations with that family member you’re supposed to be close with but barely remember their name, you have to whip it out. I think you get the gist. It’s a bad habit but most of us are guilty of it. Dinner time should be about the food and the people you’re having it with — especially when it is a family dinner. So, IKEA decided enough was enough and came up with an inventive solution to this particular conundrum: They created a new….table? Who would’ve thought of a smartphone-powered-steamboat-machine-table-thingamabob? I definitely didn’t. It sounds fantastic. While the table was definitely interesting, what’s equally interesting are the subjects’ responses. When they sat down, the usual routine of whipping out the smartphone begins right up until the steamboat pot is placed on the fire. One eagle-eyed observer noticed that the soup wasn’t boiling and after some clarification, hit the button and raised the steamboat platform in a futuristic sci-fi manner. Obviously, everyone started freaking out at how cool that was, but when the waiter told them to take out their phones the subjects thought it was to take pictures of the contraption. When they found out they had to place their devices into the base of the machine to power the steamboat, many were hesitant but eventually gave in to their tummies demands. The result was pretty awesome. Everyone made a whole lot more eye contact and looking at each other’s faces rather than the Zuck’s Facebook. Conversation happened with their mouths as opposed to their thumbs. Smiles were exchanged without the need for round yellow emojis. It was heartwarming, to say the least. We’re big fans of good tech and are always on our devices — for work and for play. But sometimes it’s better to just disconnect from your devices and reconnect with actual people and respond to them without needing a notification tone to prompt you.

Drones that can sail across the surface of the water like boats are also pretty cool. Just the other day we were talking about a whole bunch of  . But what we didn’t include was this drone. This guy, is a helicopter, a boat, AND a submarine. While drones can let you get some sick wedding shots and awesome drag racing footage, they’re also a little creepy. People can use these little things to spy on you, streaming video directly into their creepy little devices. If you thought you could escape them like you escape bees (diving in the water, in case you’ve never been chased by bees before) you’re sorely mistaken. This flying, swimming and diving device called the Loon Copter was developed by the Oakland University’s Embedded Systems Research Laboratory. It uses a barrel like body, attached to an otherwise regular quadcopter, to act as a ballast tank in a submarine. Filling it with water allows it to sink beneath the surface. It fills in a unique way that rotates the quadcopter ninety degrees in the water, so that the propellers bcome like outboard motors, allowing the drone to navigate under water. It can’t really navigate very deep bodies of water, but as this is nowhere near mass production, we can forsee it diving much deeper in the near future. When you want the drone to fly again, simply empty the tank and it will send the Loon Copter to the surface again. While, swimming and flying drones aren’t all that new, what sets this drone apart is the fact that it uses the clever ballast system. According to the project’s lead scientist, the drone can sit on the surface of the water without any energy usage, as well as change and control depth with little power and no propeller use. Currently, you can’t stream video from the Loon Copter to your smartphone — so you need to record it for playback later — but the creators have noted that future versions of this little guy could make use of acoustic modems or repeater buoys to allow for live streaming and control options. Created out of noble aspirations to help with search and rescue operations, this drone could also be misused — like all good things in life. The end result would come from the user, and while we think that it could be a little scary to give people this much flexibilty when it comes to filming spy footage, there is no denying the cool (and potentially useful) factor of this little device. That said, imagine how much easier filming the next Jaws movie will be with the Loon Copter. All you need to do is strap a fin to its side and queue the music. Dum dum, dum dum!"
Cheryl Bates,Acer Predator 8 Review: Made for fun,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/26/acer-predator-8-review-malaysia/,,,2016-01-26,"One of the first of its kind, the Acer Predator 8 is essentially the one of the world firsts in terms of tablets built for gaming.  As far as the design and build go, the Predator 8 isn’t your bog standard tablet. Coming in at about 8 inches in size, the tablet has a rather unique shape; with four front-facing speakers (called the Predator Quadio) with one situated at each corner of the tablet. The tablet is surprisingly light considering how chunky it looks and how solid it feels; weighing in at a paltry 350g with the battery in. The sides are also shaped in a way that you have a decent place to grip without your hands getting in the way of said speakers if you want to play games in landscape mode. One minor gripe is the placement of its microUSB port at the top of the device as the charging cable will get in the way if you are playing games while charging. The rear of the device is home to a brushed metal plate with the Predator logo on it and is the only bit of the tablet that is made of solid metal. The rest of the Predator 8 is made of a combination of plastic and rubber that only simulates that metal finish but still looks good regardless. Due to its unique shape you probably won’t find many 3rd party cases for it, unfortunately, but  . Also, we feel we need to mention that this is the first (compact) gaming tablet that has a form of haptic feedback called the Predator TacSense. There are two haptic motors, with one placed on each side."

While most keyboards, the Windows Phone version of Word Flow included, have support for one-handed typing — mighty useful on the phablets of today.

A metal build, a nice full HD display and a snappy fingerprint sensor are hard to come by at this end of the market. While honor have not announced when the device will go on sale or how much it would cost, we got to take a quick look at this all-metal midrange device. A premium metal construction is almost a necessity these days. While   that a metal body is all that, smartphone manufacturers and people who want to show off certainly do. Has honor delivered with the 5X? Well, I can tell you that it definitely feels better than the more expensive honor 7. The front of the device is nothing to shout about, but when you move to the sides of the device, you can see where all of honor’s effort went. They talked endlessly about the sandblasting they had to do to keep the device feeling smooth in the hand and they did accomplish that to a certain extent. The sides are nicely chamfered (ala-Nexus 6P) to help with grip and very smooth to the touch. They decided to go with a brushed metal look for the back plate but the moment your fingers touch it, the panel feels in no way shape or form brushed. It was smooth as a baby’s bottom — which may appeal to some, but I like a little grain and roughness. There are other niggles that come from the buttons. While they had nice tactile feedback which felt really premium, the power button shifts around a little too much and if you apply pressure to the center of the volume rockers you will be greeted with an incredibly unpleasant flex. Since this isn’t really a high-end device, you can’t really expect much when it comes to performance. It sports a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. With proper optimisation, those specs would do fine for light to medium tasks, but from our brief hands-on it doesn’t seem to be the case. Switching between applications was slow and sluggish. Exiting the camera app was the most painful thing to watch as the frames stuttered and choked. It was a disaster. That said, this can probably be fixed with a quick update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The honor 5X comes with a decent 13-megapixel f/2.0 main camera with a dual-LED flash mounted on the rear, right above the fingerprint scanner. It’s a pretty decent snapper with a host of features as is the hallmark of EMUI’s camera app. Stuff like beautification, HDR, panorama are all bundled into it. Shots from that sensor are decent with reasonable amounts of colour accuracy and detail. The front 5MP f/2.4 selfie cam also takes reasonably good pictures, though we would have liked if it was a little wider for those crucial wefies. Its Huawei-made fingerprint scanner is as fantastic as ever. I loved the accuracy and speed though I would have appreciated a little haptic feedback when it successfully reads your finger but that’s me nitpicking. The honor 5X’s sensor only needs 6 taps to register your fingerprint yet it has an amazing level of accuracy. As is a common theme in Huawei made devices, the fingerprint scanner at the back is more than simply a fingerprint scanner. You can swipe down on it to pull down your notifications, as well as hold it to exit your application and return to the home screen. It also allows you to take photos by tapping it though we found that quite pointless and horribly unergonomic. It also has a curious function that lets the fingerprint scanner act as a back button allowing you to tap it once to go back to your previous task. So what if I’ve enabled the camera single tap to take a photo? Design oversight? It also lacks the swipe left and swipe right to scroll through pictures or text. All in all, it’s a pretty decent budget premium device with an okay camera and decent specs. All it needs is some proper optimisation (please patch ASAP) and a little skill when taking photographs. It’s a decent all-rounder but it faces tough competition from the likes of the   and the   (when it arrives) even if our estimate of a sub RM1,000 price tag comes true."

Unfortunately, this deal isn’t for every Digi subscriber as it is only applicable for those under the Digi SmartPlan 65 banner or higher. If you aren’t one now though, from today onwards you can sign up or upgrade to the SmartPlan 65 (or any higher plan) and get this very offer as well. But there’s more. This deal is supposedly limited and it will operate on a first come first served basis which means that if you want to take advantage of this free year of iflix, it would probably be wise to act soon. That said, Digi never specified a specific “limit” to this offer — no dates, no number of customers, nothing. Could this be a marketing strategy to generate hype? Well, if it is, this wouldn’t be the first time Malaysians have been lured in by the word “free” and “limited”. Let’s just say we like free things. In any case, much like the TM deal, this one requires no login because Digi has “back-end” integration with iflix allowing the streaming service to automatically detect if you’re on a Digi line and grant you unrestricted access to their library. All you need to do is download the app (via a Digi network) on either   or  , and launch it. iflix will take care of the rest. Plus you get 1GB of extra quota (until March 2016) to watch iflix content. If you’re not interested in upgrading to a Digi SmartPlan 65 or higher, you can still opt to retain the 60-days free subscription with iflix that is the result of the first collaboration between the telco and the streaming service. For those who are curious, Digi’s SmartPlan 65 offers two variants — one that has unlimited calls to all networks plus 3GB of data, versus one that has 5GB of data and only 200mins of free calls.

There was never any official confirmation beyond an   in the Indonesian certification agency (which has been removed) and an   by SamMobile. Now, though, thanks to Indian import-export tracker Zauba, we at least have confirmation of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge’s screen sizes. 
 Based on this listing, the two devices bearing the model number SM-G930R4 and SM-G935R4 — which is the Galaxy S7 and   respectively — have been listed to pack a 5.1-inch screen for the S7 and a 5.5-inch screen for the S7 edge. This reflects the earlier   outed by popular benchmark AnTuTu. Plus, since only two models have been imported, it is becoming less and less likely that Samsung will launch four devices at the same time. Then again, smartphone manufacturers have done crazier things. Though, it is worth noting that only two of each device have been imported, probably because they’re tester units (as can be seen in the description “FOR TESTNG”). Based on most leaks, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge should come with a Quad HD display packing either an Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 processor (likely depending on region) plus 4GB of RAM and either 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of expandable internal storage. Yes, there will be a microSD card slot. The camera will probably be a 12-megapixel BRITECELL rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing selfie cam. These devices should also have support for Cat.12/13 LTE connectivity and a USB Type-C port. They should also come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.

It comes preloaded on all new LG G3 devices and displays a variety of notifications and suggestions, including recommendations to stay in touch with favourite contacts. What happened was, the app failed to validate the data presented to users, making it possible for attackers to manipulate the data and lace it with a malicious code that can be executed on affected devices. According to the researchers who found out about this vulnerability, the malicious code could be triggered when events like callback reminders or birthday notifications were displayed. An estimated 10 million LG G3s were said to be affected by this vulnerability. The researchers developed several proof-of-concept payloads including one that harvested data from the SD card, another that opens the browser to any remote site and a third that performs a denial-of-service attack that could make the user’s phone go crazy.

It seems a little silly that such a feature was left out front the start and would only be coming in the future, but I guess if you consider the number of backers versus the number of creators, that percentage is pretty lopsided.

While it looks like you’re getting a whopping 3GB with full speed internet on the surface, the reality is that nothing has changed. As a mobile internet user, you’ll depend mostly on high-speed internet which in this case, remains at 1GB for free.

Previously, when you used up your free 1GB of data, you have a choice to top up more with its   or continue using with slower 64kbps speeds at no extra charges.

Clad in an all-metal unibody, the honor 5X comes with a 5.5-inch full HD and packs a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage.

With those specs, this places the OPPO F1 right in the Xiaomi Redmi 3’s crosshairs. The F1 should have the edge in terms of performance though as it has 3GB of RAM versus the Redmi 3’s 2GB, but that extra performance does come with a higher price tag. The only question is how much lower will the Redmi 3 retail at? The OPPO F1 officially goes on sale online tomorrow, 22 January 2016, at midnight on the   for RM1,198. The first 200 customers to purchase this device from the online store will receive a free OPPO Selfie Stick. If you’d prefer to check the device out before purchasing it, the OPPO F1 will be available in physical stores starting 25 January 2016."
Rory Lee,OPPO F1 hands-on and first impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/oppo-f1-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"Oppo,OPPO F1,OPPO F1 first impressions,OPPO F1 Hands on,OPPO F1 Hands on Malaysia,OPPO F1 launch,OPPO F1 Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-01-21,"plans to take over the midrange smartphone market one selfie at a time with their latest smartphone the  . OPPO are so committed to the selfie abilities of this smartphone that they’ve even hired “Selfie Ambassador” Nora Danish to demonstrate just how powerful this device is at taking selfies. 
 Let’s start with the build. If you’ve been following our coverage of the OPPO F1, I’m sure you would have noticed how similar this device is with the OPPO R7 series. It so happened we had an OPPO R7s on hand so we placed the two devices side by side. Quickly, which device is which? Honestly, besides the size and the back firing speaker grille, these two devices are almost exactly the same from the back. The camera module, the flash, the two toned rear panels (because of the different materials), the feel and the rounded edges were all exactly the same. It was unreal. Since it was exactly the same, it also had the same feel in the hand as the R7s — albeit the smaller footprint — so that part didn’t feel so good. Then again, for a midrange device, you can’t really complain. Around the front, that’s a different story. The front bears enough differences to identify which is which. Opting for capacitive buttons instead of the on-screen ones on the R7s, the F1 lets you use its display to its maximum potential. Not that it had a very impressive display, but we’ll get into that later. What I did like was the rounded front edges. With the 2.5D glass set to curve slightly more and slightly later, the glass and the metal blended seamlessly into each other giving the device a nice rounded edge. It was almost iPhone 6s Plus like, so props to OPPO for acheiving the something like that on a midrange device. Beyond that, the device felt generally nice in the hand — though I would have liked it a little more if it had a slight curve, but that’s up to the individual. The OPPO F1 is powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. At the front, the device sports a 5-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) IPS panel which isn’t all that impressive. The device comes running Android 5.1 Lollipop with OPPO’s ColorOS 2.1 running on top. The device draws juice from a 2,500 mAh battery and also has support for dual-SIM (Micro+Nano) although since it’s a hybrid set up you will have to sacrifice a microSD slot for the second SIM. Performance was pretty decent. It didn’t lag when switching between applications (though there weren’t many applications pre-installed to begin with) and it handled what little multitasking I threw at it. I’m not particularly a fan of the ColorOS Android skin, but some of you may like it so that’s ultimately down to personal preference. The display was okay-ish and you probably wouldn’t notice the 720p-ness unless you’re coming from a higher screen resolution. Now we get to the part everyone has been waiting for — the camera. It packs a 13-megapixel ISOCELL rear shooter with Phase Detection AF and a large f/2.2 aperture that was pretty good in the venue’s sketchy lighting. It took decent shots, but since we could only view it on a 720p screen, we won’t make any claims just yet. What everyone’s curious about is the 8MP front-facing snapper. When you think of a “selfie phone”, you’d think of something like the   which sports a massive 13MP front facing selfie shooter with autofocus and dual LED flash for RM1,049. Next to those beastly specs, the OPPO F1 that costs RM1,198 simply pales in comparison. It doesn’t even have a front facing flash — instead it relies on a “screen flash”, which basically turns your screen white and bright, to illuminate dark subjects. Probably best used in dark conditions, the screen flash did absolutely nothing in the launch venue’s dodgy lighting, but again we will have to fully test this out before we make any judgements. When you think about this phone, you can’t go at it purely from a specs perspective. If you were to do that, perhaps the ZenFone Selfie is the better device with it’s 5.5″ full HD display, but look at it. It’s chunky, it’s fat and it is very plasticky. The OPPO F1 on the other hand, is a slim thing with a great build and a premium feel. It’s rounded metal rails and smooth metallic back are awesome to run your hand across. It’s the phone for the fashionista, for someone who cares more about style and looks than pure hardware specs. Let me put it this way, could you see Nora Danish using a ZenFone Selfie?"

Yes? Then have you ever been too lazy to get into your car and   all the way to a shop to grab a bite to eat not knowing if the food will even be good thus making the trip not worthwhile? Well, now you might not have to pull your hair out over it because popular food review app Zomato is teaming up with   to help bring you to good food. At least, we hope it’s good food. If you haven’t already heard about Zomato, it’s an app that helps you “discover” new food by providing information such as restaurant reviews and ratings as well as create your “own network of foodies for trusted recommendations”. How this works is: You launch the app and sign in to your account. Then you can scroll through a timeline-esque UI of food reviews and ratings based on your current location. Then, you can hit on whichever restaurant tickles your fancy to find out more information about the establishment. While previously it only gives you directions to the restaurant, now it will give you the option to “Ride there with Uber”. Why is this better than just launching the Uber app and inputting the destination? Well, because it happens with a single touch. Hitting the option would bring up a pickup time plus the estimated price range for the trip — just as you would find on the regular Uber app — without needing to launch a new app. Saves some time I guess? This feature has been available to Zomato users in 30+ cities across 13 countries, namely India, Australia, Canada, The UK, South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, The Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Turkey, UAE and the United States. Unfortunately, as of right now, we are still unable to get the option here in Selangor. Curious, we contacted Zomato and they told us that the function would roll out in stages. So far only users in Kuala Lumpur can access this function, with Selangor’s availability on the way soon. While I think this is pretty neat, I’ve actually never tried it before. So do let us know, if you’re a Zomato user, what you think about this little feature. If you aren’t a Zomato user, would you be interested in trying this out?"

Our own device (also from the US) has for the past week and, for the longest time, nobody claimed responsibility or could even identify what was wrong with the device. Well, thanks to our knights in shining armour over at Android Authority and Techradar, we now have an answer. After picking up the story about the bootloop issues from LG G4 users, Android Authority gathered what they knew and confronted LG about it. Thankfully, instead of denying any problems the electronics giant admitted that there was a problem with the smartphone’s hardware and said that they would repair the affected devices, though it is unclear if your device needs to still be under warranty for it to be eligible. The problem puts the phone in a boot-up loop where it tries to reset, fails and tries again and again which then proceeds to brick the phone. We thought it was a problem with our device’s battery, but now according to  , it is resulting from “loose contact between components”. Currently, it is unclear if this problem affects all LG G4s or if it is just limited to those units in the US. However, according to Android Authority, the bootloop issue persists and affects all regional and carrier models of the device. LG advises its customers who have bought their devices via a carrier and are experiencing such issues to contact their nearest LG Service Center for repair under full warranty. On the other hand, customers who have purchased their G4 smartphones from non-carrier retailers should contact an LG Service Center “with the understanding that warranty conditions will differ”. We don’t know if this problem affects local Malaysian units, so if you are using a local LG G4, do let us know if you’re experiencing such problems. We’ve contacted LG Malaysia ourselves and we’ll keep you updated on their response. [ ,  ]"

When abused, it can cause adverse effects. That’s what Communication and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Salleh Said Keruak believes as the government is mulling for tougher enforcements for online users. According to the minister, social media is often abused for defaming and to incite hatred against leaders and the institutions of government. To put an end to these issues, the government is pushing to amend the MCMC Act in March, which will give it more powers to act on such abusers. The police will work closely with the MCMC in their investigations. To speed up the process, a dedicated deputy public prosecutor has been appointed by the Attorney-General’s Chambers to handle social media cases.   The new amendment could also allow more websites to be blocked, especially those that are seen to be threatening the peace and violating the Sedition Act. One such site is Sarawak Report, which he says has been spreading lies against the government and it creates confusion among the people. The minister has also added that he hopes Malaysians won’t view this in a negative light as it was necessary to safeguard the public’s interest. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen such warning. In the middle of last year, MCMC had   advising Malaysians against spreading lies on 1MDB.  Once the amendment is passed in 2 months time, you better think twice before making slanderous statements on your Facebook, Twitter and other social channels. That one rant could win you a “Go to Jail” card.  There are a lot of nasty things being posted on social media these days but there’s a difference between offensive and defamatory.

A few days ago, we saw the new Galaxy A trio  . Now, we’ve just received an email indicating that Samsung will be launching these new devices — the  ,   and   — next week. Samsung Malaysia has set the official unveiling of the Galaxy A line for 28 January 2016  which is next Thursday. The Galaxy A series will share the Galaxy S6’s good looks with its glass front and back panels held together by a metal frame. The edges are rounded for a better grip and feel in the hand. The devices also get a bump, across the line, up to a 13-megapixel f/1,9 aperture rear shooter and a front-facing 5MP f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates the Galaxy A3’s camera from the other two bigger devices is the lack of OIS though we suspect people who are going for a budget device won’t mind this too much. The best part? All three devices have a Pink Gold colour option — which we hope they will bring to Malaysia as well. Sitting at the top of the Galaxy A’s pecking order is the largest of the trio with a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED display. On the inside, the devices will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Thankfully the internal storage is expandable via microSD to up to 128GB of extra internal storage. The Galaxy A7 also gets a large 3,300 mAh battery. Next up we have the Galaxy A5 which is slightly smaller at 5.2″ but with the same full-HD (1920×1080) Super AMOLED display. Powering the device will be a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. However, it gets a smaller 2,900 mAh battery for juice. Rounding out the trio is the smallest sibling, the Galaxy A3. Sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720) Super AMOLED display with a quad-core 1.5GHz processor running on the inside. It also packs 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. The device will be drawing power from a 2,300 mAh battery. The trio of devices will not launch with Android 6.0 Marshmallow though, as they’re set to come with Android 5.1 Lollipop out-of-the-box. That said, we do expect them to get Marshmallow within a reasonable amount of time. The two higher end devices — the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 — also sport a fingerprint scanner. Those are mighty specs for a budget device, but only if these devices are actually priced like a budget device. Based on the Singaporean pricing of the Galaxy A line, that doesn’t really look to be the case. In Singapore, the Galaxy A3 is going for SGD398 (around RM1,211),  while the Galaxy A5 costs SGD598 (around RM1,820) and the biggest Galaxy A7 will set you back SGD698 (around RM2,125). A pretty hefty price tag then. Then again, Singapore’s prices have generally been much higher than in Malaysia. If we’re going off last year’s Malaysian pricing, the Galaxy A3 went for RM899, Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199 and the Galaxy A7 had an RM1,499 price tag. But, keep in mind that these prices were before GST."

Rory Lee,Here’s why we think the “Indonesian Iron Man” is fake,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/heres-why-we-think-the-indonesian-iron-man-is-fake/,,,2016-01-20,"By now, I’m sure most of you have seen a video making its rounds on social media, and even  , about a guy with a robotic arm that he built in a garage to help him overcome the limitations of his paralysed left hand. Sounds amazing right? Yeah, we think this sounds too good to be true. Here’s why. I Wayan Sutawan, affectionately referred to as Tawan, suffered a minor stroke six months ago which paralysed his left arm. Because he’s a mechanic of sorts, one can imagine that having a paralysed left hand can be quite a cumbersome thing. So, rather than sit around and whine about it, Tawan set to work and in two months created a robotic arm out of spare parts he had around his workshop. He can control the robot arm via a headband around his forehead that picks up his brain signals and allows him to control the arm movement accordingly. Based on the video, not only can he lift objects and move his arm around, he can also pick up and hold on to rather delicate objects. So why do we think this miraculous feat has more in common with the Boy Who Cried Wolf than it does with Iron Man? That means the body part — the muscles, the nerve cells, the tendons and ligaments — are perfectly functional, there is just nothing telling them to move. So, if it’s the brain that can’t issue the command, how then can his “brainwave detector” — that looks like a bunch of LEDs strapped around his head with duct tape — detect the brainwaves issued by a part of the brain that no longer functions? Plus, even if that contraption around his head   pick up the brainwaves from dead/damaged braincells that can no longer issue commands via a human’s regular nervous system, where on earth did he store the processor needed to make sense of those brainwaves (or even identify the correct ones) and translate them into mechanical motor functions? How did he develop such sophisticated programming? What kind of supercomputing power is being used to digest all that data? While the motors and the hydraulics for the upper segments of the arm could possibly pass off as motors to facilitate movement, the glove that controls Tawan’s finer finger movements don’t have any actuators at all. So how could this contraption allow him to make the finger movements necessary to pick up and grip the solder in the video? Prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the brain aren’t exactly new. Take a look at this   by The Guardian on a DARPA-funded research project for robotic arms that can feel. What the scientists at Johns Hopkins university Applied Physics Laboratory did was have the electrodes from the prosthetic hand inserted into his sensory and motor cortexes so that he could not only control the hand with thought, he could also feel and sense when his “fingers” were touched. Once again, this is proof that in order for your brain to control a prosthetic arm, the necessary cortexes would have to be able to send a signal and function properly first. Another thing to note is that if a project led by the brilliant scientists of Johns Hopkins needed funding from a US military agency like DARPA to succeed, how on earth did Tawan manage to build one himself out of spare parts? What is more likely is that the man simply has a weak arm that needs some motorised help to actually function properly. In fact, if you pay close attention to his left arm when he is inserting it into his mechanical contraption, you can see his wrist flick upwards before it enters the sleeve. Everything about this story seems too sketchy to be true. The fact that a simple mechanic from a rural town could just one day up and build something so advanced from spare parts should have raised at least a few flags. Add “brainwave-controlled” to that description and you would have a beautiful script to a story designed for the big screen. You would have Iron Man actually. And Tony Stark doesn’t exist — no matter how hard Elon Musk tries."

You can also use it to authenticate Google Play as well as Android Pay purchases, but we’ve always hoped it could do more especially since Google baked fingerprint support into Android 6.0 Marshmallow itself. Thanks to the open API though, now you can use your fingerprint to lock specific apps in your phone — but there’s a catch. App locking is no new concept. It simply allows you to lock specific applications, requiring either a password or pin to access that particular app. Let’s say, your friends are the nosy bunch and the moment they get their hands on your device, they like to head into the gallery to look at all your embarrassing failed selfie attempts. Thanks to an app locker, you can stop that by protecting access to that application with an app locker. Some devices even have that natively in their Android skin, while others even allow you to lock entire folders of applications. Entering a password is   last century and developer SurpriseToYou have come up with AppLock -Fingerprint-, an app that lets you (if you’re on Android 6.0 Marshmallow) lock individual applications in your phone with your fingerprint. Although we must note the incredibly sketchy developer name. When I’m using a security app, I don’t really want it to surprise me. To use it, the app requires you to grant it three different levels of access — Apps with usage access, Draw over other apps, and Activate device administrator. Once in, it’s a simple task of choosing which application you want locked by flicking the toggle next to that specific app. Once you launch the app that you’ve locked, the AppLock -Fingerprint- overlay will draw over the app and ask for your fingerprint. But, true to the developer’s name, here’s the surprise — when that overlay pops up and “locks” your app, should you receive a banner notification from WhatsApp, the overlay drops and you have access to said “locked” app without ever inputting your fingerprint. What kind of security is this?! While the fact that this app runs on ads without a way to disable it is a little annoying, I think the far more pressing issue is the fact that you can break the “encryption” with a single banner notification. If, however, that doesn’t bother you and you’re interested in this app, you can get it from the PlayStore. Just, erm I don’t know, turn off your banner notifications in the mean time?"

While all of that were just rumours before this, now we have what looks like actual confirmation of what the device will look like as well as some of its hardware features. Android Authority received an exclusive tip from Shai Mizrachi in which they came into possession of several LG G5 diagrams showing exactly what the phone will look like on the outside as well as its dimensions. Based on the diagram, it does indeed look like the phone will have a flat design unlike that of the previous   and   models. Besides that the diagram confirms that the G5’s volume control buttons will be placed at the side of the smartphone while the power button remains put beneath the camera module (likely where the fingerprint sensor will reside as well). It does seems kind of silly to have a clickable button at the back, but then again we’ve doubted the back button placement before and that turned out pretty well in the end. Speaking of that camera module, while it does look like a massive module, it seems that there will only be one camera at the back. Judging from the cutout in the middle plus the earlier concepts by CNet Korea, the rest of to module will be home to the dual-tone LED flash and a laser autofocus. It also looks like the G5 will indeed be thinner, taller and wider than the LG G4, measuring in at 149.4 x 73.9 x 8.2mm versus the G4’s 148.9 x 76.1 x 6.3-9.8mm. Unfortunately, while this diagram does confirm a lot about the device, there is no mention of specs or what exactly the body will be made of. If we’re going off past rumours the G5 should have a 5.7-inch QHD display plus an all metal body with a removable battery that can be slid out by   off the bottom or top of the device. [ ]"

Rory Lee,Did you damage your device? Soon it’ll bleed to let you know,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/did-you-damage-your-device-soon-itll-bleed-to-let-you-know/,"bleed,car bleeding,casing bleed,color changing polymer,colour changing polymer,early damage detection,how to see tiny cracks,polymer coating","Cool stuff,Others",2016-01-20,"Sometimes, a tiny crack is all it takes to cause severe damage to an object. It’s these tiny cracks that we don’t see because they’re often impossible to spot in, for example, your car’s windscreen. However, these cracks become the first weaknesses in any object and could potentially lead to something really bad somewhere down the road. Well, a University of Illinois research has led to a   coating that could be an important early damage warning system, making it easier to find cracks or damage in particular objects by making them bleed. This polymer coating consists of tiny micro beads that crack open, causing a chemical reaction that will visibly highlight any damage with colour. These beads are pH sensitive so any damage will cause a colour change — from yellow to red — without the need for additional chemicals. The bigger the crack or scratch, the deeper the object will bleed as more capsules are affected. What’s good about this coating is that it works on multiple kinds of polymers that can coat metals, other polymers and even glass. Plus, they’re apparently not too expensive either, but no specific quote of a price was given. What’s more, the coating shows no sign of degradation — meaning the microcapsules will stay intact until actual cracks or damage happens. The application possibilities of this technology are endless. Since only 5% of a polymer needs to be microcapsules to have a strong damage indication ability, you can apply it to a myriad of things. While this can prove useful to big projects like rocket launches into space as well as deep sea exploration, there are also plenty of everyday products that can benefit. Off the top of my head would be your action cam/smartphone’s waterproof casing. Those things are transparent so it’s incredible difficult to find small cracks in their seal, but all it takes is a little nick to let the water in and damage your precious device. Planes and vehicles stand to benefit from this polymer too, as important components in these machines can be coated to allow for early damage detection which could potentially save lives. It’s kind of nice to think that your car could bleed for you before you have to bleed yourself."

We just received the invite in our mail stating that honor are planning to launch both devices at the same time on January 26, next Tuesday. Suffice to say we will be bringing you live updates from the ground on that very day. Of the two devices launched, the honor 5X is definitely the more interesting one. The 5X is honor’s answer to the  , with it’s full metal build as well as rear mounted fingerprint scanner. The 5.5″ device will sport a full HD screen plus a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor — a departure from their home-grown Kirin SoCs. Nevertheless, the Snapdragon 616 will be paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. What it does have over the Redmi Note 3 is a dedicated microSD card slot which allows you to expand that small internal memory. Because of the fact that honor ditched the hybrid SIM set up, users can use two SIM cards and the microSD storage simultaneously. It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with their EMUI 3.1 skin running over it. For camera optics, the device will sport a 13MP f/2.0 primary shooter with dual-LED flash to help out in low light conditions, as well as a 5-megapixel f/2.4 front shooter. The phone will draw power from a fairly large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0. The honor 5X is going for RMB1,099 in China (around RM730) which is only a touch higher than the Redmi Note 3’s 16GB version and the same price as the 32GB version. In Malaysia you can get an imported Redmi Note 3 ( ) for under RM1,000, so the question is: How low will honor go? The honor 7 Enhanced isn’t all that different than the already good un-enhanced version which we   a lot. The only enhancement is the fact that this device will now come with 32GB of internal storage and Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. While the bump in storage from 16GB might not be that big of a deal to some, many felt that one of the biggest problems with the honor 7 was the lack of storage space. Now with double that, this device just got a whole lot better. Besides that, this will be the first non-nexus smartphone in Malaysia to be officially sold with Android M out-of-the-box. So, you get to have all those awesome Marshmallow features to yourself. The device features a 5.2″ full HD display on the front with an octa-core Kirin 935 processor clocked at 2.2GHz paired with 3GB of RAM. Camera-wise it has a 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash. The front camera is an 8MP unit with its own front-facing flash to help with those low-light selfies."

Unfortunately, some applications are really heavy and take up a lot of resources, slowing down slower phones. One of which is the   application. It takes up a whopping amount of space in your internal storage versus something like Instagram that only uses a fraction of the amount, but because this is the only and most complete application for browsing Facebook, we begrudgingly use it. Common perception would be that the mobile browser version is always a whole lot worse than the app, but according to Android Central, that isn’t the case. Russell Holly wrote an   about how he uninstalled Facebook on his Android device and it turned out to be a better experience than he expected. That got us thinking, is the Facebook app really worth it? Well, for what we believe is the majority of FB users, we doubt it. Here are the five reasons we think   users should ditch the Facebook application. If you’re on it for a moderate amount of time a day, you will notice that it becomes one of the biggest battery drainers on your phone. Plus, it is a performance hog too, something Russell also notes, so it will significantly slow down the performance of lower-end devices."

With all the smartphone manufacturers pursuing metal and glass bodied phones as the agreed ‘standard’ for a premium build and feel, the question becomes: Does that really give the best feel in the hand?

This is because WhatsApp realises that many of their customers did not possess credit or debit cards and were afraid of losing their access to this service. According to the company, nearly a billion people around the world rely on this app to stay in touch with their friends and family across the globe. Since this app can basically let you reach as far as there is some semblance of an Internet connection, rural folks were worried that — due to their limited to non-existent access to banking services — they would lose this connection to their loved ones. Besides that, WhatsApp has also ensured their users that they would not be resorting to third-party advertisements on their application to generate income. Instead, they’re testing tools that will allow users to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organisations that they want to talk to. Think of it as a messaging gateway for enterprises.  For example, you could possibly communicate with your bank about whether a recent transaction was fraudulent or with an airline about your recent flight delay. Also imagine being able to receive TAC PIN number from your bank on WhatsApp instead of SMS. This means instant updates that could otherwise take hours — a good idea in concept at least. The thing about this is, have you ever paid for WhatsApp? Yeah sure, some of you early adopters on   and   might have had to pay USD0.99 (RM4.40), but I think the rest of us haven’t paid for it once. I know I haven’t, despite all that “free-for-first-year” thing. What about you guys? How many of you have paid for WhatsApp and are annoyed with this?"

What’s more, the fourth device will feature a dual rear camera setup. According to a report on VentureBeat by Evan Blass, otherwise known as  , Huawei’s P9 lineup will include the regular P9, a budget-friendly P9lite, a larger P9max as well as an unnamed “feature-enhanced P9”. Although Blass noted that his source fell short of dubbing it a premium model, this enhanced P9 is said to feature a larger screen (though not as large as the P9max) more RAM, more internal storage as well as a dual 12-megapixel rear-facing camera. This isn’t new for the Chinese smartphone manufacturer however as they’ve already tried the dual-camera set up on the 2014-2015  . In fact, this new P9’s camera is supposed to be a second generation upgrade of that very dual-camera. Therefore, it will likely mean that the P9’s dual-camera will offer the same additional features afforded by the honor 6 Plus’ like post-capture refocus, simulated aperture adjustment and filter application plus what VentureBeat says will be “even more unique capabilities” as this camera concept has been further refined. Is two better than one? If our   on the upcoming LG G5 is any indication, it would appear smartphone manufacturers definitely think so, as that device is rumoured to sport not only a dual-screen setup like the LG V10 but also a dual rear mounted camera. That said, these are merely rumours as there has been no official confirmation beyond a person with alleged knowledge of Huawei so take this with a grain of salt. One thing is for sure though none of the P9 variants will feature a QHD resolution screen (2560×1440 pixels). As with all Huawei devices (except the Nexus 6P which we can all argue can be considered more of a Google device), the company feels that the slightly better screen and image quality offered by a QHD screen just isn’t worth the shorter battery life. We were pretty   with the Mate S’ battery life, so maybe they do know what they’re doing. As far as specs are concerned, Blass’ source didn’t reveal anything, but we did come across a device that posted a   on Geekbench that we believe could be the Kirin 950-powered Huawei P9. With that kind of horsepower and now a dual-camera, suffice to say we’re excited. Despite all of this information and anticipation, Blass indicates that Huawei will not launch these smartphones during the Barcelona Mobile World Congress’ timeframe, choosing instead to give them a dedicated launch several weeks after MWC. However, it is said that Huawei is expected to unveil a Surface Book-like 2-in-1 in Barcelona next month but there are unfortunately no details on this product for the time being. [ ]"

It seemed like a gigantic design oversight by the South Korean electronics giant, but the solution was a simple one — don’t put the pen in backwards. Sometimes, accidents happen and it seems that   has picked up on that as they’ve quietly fixed this gigantic flaw with the S Pen via a hardware modification to their newer Galaxy Note5 models. But, as there is no way of telling if your device has the fix, please don’t try this with your own device. Based on the image, it looks like Samsung have added a little lever (left) to the original circuit board which looks like it will allow users to eject the S Pen if it were inserted the wrong way. According to Phandroid’s sources, this new mechanism works beautifully despite the fact that it looks like it is being held together by some tape. We don’t think that’s how Samsung will actually hold the lever there, but if there is a fix for this issue it is pretty good news. However, since Samsung made the oversight in the first place, we’re sure many of the early Galaxy Note5 adopters must be pissed that their device doesn’t have this hardware fix. Plus, since Samsung seems to have ninja-fixed this, it doesn’t look like they want others to find out about it which is kind of a bummer.

Now a video has surfaced, claiming to be the “First real 4-inch iPhone 2016” video leak, the short 40-second clip — if true — does give at least some information on Apple’s purported next product. Yeah, it looks exactly like an iPhone 6/6s. In fact, it looks so much like an iPhone 6/6s that many are calling this video a fake and that the reason it looks small-ish is because the guy manning the camera has large hands. Honestly, it does look kind of sketchy and as 9to5Mac pointed out, the speaker grille ratios were pretty similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone so that does add some credence to the “big-hands” justification. It is said that MIC Gadget has a reasonable history in obtaining devices for a hands-on ahead of time so maybe there is some truth to all of this. But, there is no way of identifying if this is actually the new iPhone 6C or if it is just a regular iPhone 6. There’s tape over many of the important identifier bits, there is no comparison with the iPhone 6/6s, and there is really nothing in the room that can tell us anything about the scale of this device.

Who knows. What we do know is that you shouldn’t believe everything someone tells you. So, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt.

It’ll go on sale next month in the United States but it’ll be missing the biometric security component that’s available in other markets. And we think we know why. While quite far-fetched, the probably intentional delay of the US release of their Xperia Z5 line could mean that   had a chance to see if their new fingerprint sensor would be a hit or otherwise. Following which, they would take note the feedback of their side-placed fingerprint sensor, and decide if it’s worthy to risk having the power button doubles as the fingerprint scanner. Mainly because, it doesn’t work (well). When asked why they decided to pull the scanner, they simply said: “it was a business decision”. Android Authority has reached out for further clarification but has yet to hear back. Sony already has a lot on their plate and if these issues keep cropping up, they better make sure their next flagship makes the cut. This is their first run at such technology on their devices and while we could argue they should’ve perfected it before putting it out, we’ll cut them some slack. This move could be a good one, provided that they make changes to the prices to reflect the lack of a fingerprint sensor.

However, there is also word that this could be the last Lumia smartphone of this year. So,   anyone? According to Windows Central, multiple sources have confirmed with them that February 1 will be the date that Microsoft reveals details about the device including pricing and availability. This device is said to feature a 5-inch 1280×720 pixel HD display with a quad-core Snapdragon 212 (or 200) processor with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD). It is also said to have an 8MP/5MP rear-front camera combo with an LED flash.

Then again that article also said that the Lumia 550 was cancelled, so, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt. With the abrupt cancellation of both Lumia devices, it is unlikely that Microsoft will sit on their hands and not launch any more mobile devices this year.

Now the word “optical zoom” may not be a term everyone recognises. Some of you might be thinking that your current smartphones can zoom jolly well, so why would you bother about this device? You see, the zoom commonly found on your smartphone camera is what people call “digital zoom” which essentially crops the image to a smaller frame and enlarges to make it seem like you’re bringing the subject closer to you. No lens movement happens within the camera module. On the other hand, conventional DSLRs and their respective lenses use “optical zoom” which works when the different elements that make up a lens move around to refract light differently, bringing the image closer to you. The biggest difference though is that when you use digital zoom to zoom in on a subject, you lose quality, because you are no longer using the full image — rather you’re only using a cropped fraction of it. Optical zoom then is the way to go if you want to zoom (but not with your feet) and you don’t want to lose image quality at the same time. If the benefits are so great, why don’t more manufacturers equip their smartphones with optical zoom? The biggest reason is size. With more than one element in your lens, the whole camera module tends to get pretty ginormous. Think   or the  . However, with ASUS’s 13-megapixel camera on the ZenFone Zoom, they have used a special dual-periscope design to mount the camera horizontally across the back of the smartphone, letting them hide the camera bump with the ZenFone’s signature curved back."

We’ve all heard good things about this streaming service, from the shows they have to the quality of their stream plus all the Netflix exclusives like Daredevil and Jessica Jones. It’s gotten so popular that we see it mentioned in TV shows themselves, that one time in Suits when Mike Ross wanted to piss Edward Darby off for example. But, when we took a hard look at their catalogue from our Malaysian accounts, we were quite bummed out that there were so  . Even popular comedy series How I Met Your Mother wasn’t there. So the craftier of us went ahead and used VPNs (Virtual Private Network) and proxies to mask our IP addresses and as a result, gain more access to their content. Well, it seems like Netflix has had enough of our scheming ways and has said openly that they’re putting a stop to VPN users once and for all. For those of you who don’t know what a VPN or proxy does, it basically masks your IP address, preventing a website — Netflix for example — from finding out where you are connecting from. So, with a VPN or proxy you can set it up to have the site or app detect that you’re connecting from an American IP address, for example, then the region locked site would grant you access to their content as if you were coming from the US. If you’d like a more detailed explanation you can head on over to Gizmodo’s article on  . In short when it comes to Netflix, this allows you to bypass region restrictions and circumvent the walls Netflix have put up (because of licensing, censorship and other technical reasons) and have access to whatever content you want — something Netflix is clearly upset about. In a blog statement by Netflix Vice President of Content Delivery Architecture David Fullagar, he said that Netflix would continue to enforce content licensing according to geographical location. However, they did say that they were working on making all their content available to all their subscribers — something they anticipate being able to do. For now, though, they’re focusing on blocking proxies and ensuring that you can only access content from your own region. Although they didn’t say exactly how or when they would block the proxies aside from a vague “as technology continues to evolve and we are evolving with it” line. One possible way we could see them doing it is locking your account by credit card. For example, if you wanted to use an American account, you would have to have an American credit card, likewise, if you’re using a Malaysian credit card you can only access the Malaysian Netflix content. Although they could also take more drastic measures and force you to use your IC/identification numbers to register. Though we doubt it since it would cause some amount of hindrance to user experience. Either way, it looks like your proxy days are numbered.

Do note that the white unit with the black camera module is a prototype given to professional photographer Peter Tan. Of course, this device’s party piece lies in its massive camera module that dominates the back of the phone. Its 13-megapixel Panasonic SmartFSI sensor has a 10-element f/2.7-4.8 aperture lens that utilises a dual-periscope horizontal-mount design allowing it to not only have a massive 3x optical zoom, but also maintain a relatively thin form factor.   Besides that the primary camera comes with other goodies like optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus and a dual-tone LED flash. To help the camera out in low light, the ZenFone Zoom comes with ASUS’ Pixel Master 2.0 technology which is renown for its low light and long exposure capabilities. If 13-megapixels isn’t enough, ASUS have bundled a Super Resolution function into the camera which allows it to take gigantic 52-megapixel photos, by stitching four 13MP shots together for more detail and clarity. While the sample shots on display (taken by Peter Tan) looked rather impressive, we would have to fully test out the functions for ourselves before making a decision. Being a camera-centric phone, the smartphone comes with dedicated camera hardware buttons — a dedicated shutter and video record button — which were awesome and tactile. The device also has equally tactile dedicated zoom keys that can double as volume rockers when not in the camera app. Zooming in and out with the keys was pretty satisfying as the phone gives you a little buzz when it hits the maximum 3x optical zoom. We did notice that launching the camera from the shutter button (which you can do by holding it down) was a little slow (maybe 2-3) seconds. Besides that, the shutter speed and time between shots were not as snappy as something like an iPhone 6s or a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. However, it does have a complete manual mode with full manual controls that can be easily accessed via a tap of the M button located to the top of the on-screen shutter button. What we were impressed with was the macro capabilities of this device. ASUS boasts a 5cm macro focal distance and from our brief testing, you could get pretty darn close to the subject and still focus with no problems. The front camera is an average 5MP f/2.0 unit with a wide-angle lens and support for Pano Selfie. For a better understanding of this device’s cameras and what optical versus digital zoom really means, stay tuned for our camera comparison. Spec wise, the ZenFone Zoom isn’t all that different from ASUS’ previous flagship, the  . It has an updated quad-core Intel Atom Z3590 processor clocked at 2.5GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable (via microSD up to 64GB) storage. The smartphone also comes running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’ ZenUI running on top. It’s a shame that it isn’t a more updated version of Android but we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update. Connectivity wise, the device will have a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot and will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi. From our brief hands-on, though, the device handles itself quite well, not stuttering or lagging when switching between applications, then again with 4GB of RAM and a high-end Intel chip, this isn’t really surprising. Being a premium phone, it is definitely built well. The nice rounded metal rails were fabulous to hold in the hand and the back curved nicely to fit in our palms. The camera unit is barely noticeable, letting you believe that it could just be a normal camera. Kudos to ASUS for hiding such a beast of a lens array. ASUS says that the leather on the back of the device is real leather, not some faux nonsense, and we were inclined to believe them…until we took the rear panel off. But, when we held the panel by itself, we started to doubt their claims. That said, the stitching around the “ergonomic hump” is real as we could move the thread around. It felt flimsy and plasticky so be careful when you rip that baby off. The bump on the back to help ergonomics was interesting, to say the least, and we quite liked it since it helped a little with the ergonomics. But as most of us usually take photos with a certain finger positions (like pictured earlier), we didn’t really notice it helping much with grip. What did feel nice were once again the metal rails and those fantastic buttons. ASUS also includes a wrist strap that attaches itself to the back of the device, which is a nice touch. As a whole it was fantastic to hold in the hand and it definitely feels like the premium price you’re paying for. However, do note that from the devices on display, there was a difference between the front of the device between the black model and the white model. The black one will remind you of every other ZenFone model with that familiar chin, but the white one seems to have done away with the chin, instead moving the ASUS logo to the bottom of the device. The device is priced at RM2,099 and ASUS says that the device will be available locally at the end of January."

In terms of specs, it gets a one-hand friendly 4.7″ display that does 1280×720 pixels resolution and it runs on Qualcomm’s 1.1GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 210 processor with 1GB of RAM. Keeping your apps are content is a modest 8GB of storage that’s expandable up to 200GB extra with microSD.  For taking pictures, it settles for a 5.0MP f/2.4 camera at the rear that shoot videos up to HD 720p. Meanwhile at the front, it gets a 2MP f/2.8 camera. The Lumia 550 is a single-SIM (nano-SIM) device and it also supports 4G LTE for faster connectivity. For charging and data transfer, it still uses a standard microUSB port. So you can’t use the Microsoft Display Dock like its more expensive siblings. Keeping the lights on is a 2,100mAh battery that’s removable. You can learn more about the device over at its  ."

While we weren’t that surprised that the   was #1 on their list, we were shocked at how MUCH further it was from the competition. Let me give you a hint: 132k. According to the popular cross-platform benchmarker, the average score of an iPhone 6s Plus is 132,620 points, the only device to break the 100k mark in 2015. On paper, this gap doesn’t seem possible as the iPhone 6s Plus is powered by a dual-core Twister A9 chip that is clocked at a tame 1.84GHz  and a PowerVR GT7600 GPU paired with (a frankly depressing) 2GB of RAM. Comparatively, the second placed   packs a monstrous next-gen octa-core Kirin 950 SoC — four Cortex A72 CPU cores clocked at 2.3GHz, four Cortex A53 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz and a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU — plus 4GB of RAM. Yet somehow the iPhone 6s Plus outperforms it by about 30%. It is worth noting that the top 3 performing phones all run on full HD displays so they have less pixels to push compared to their Quad-HD competitors. As we move down the ladder, we find the Samsung Exynos 7420 chipsets occupying places three to five with the   leading the pack.

I guess it REALLY isn’t about how much horsepower you have, it’s about how you use it. However, it is worth noting that these are average scores so the number of benchmarks ran as well as the conditions in which these benchmarks were run should also factor into the results.

The   is said to be following   but new information suggests that they won’t be abandoning the needs of power users. The folks at CNet Korea has posted a render of what the new flagship could look like. Instead of a curvy shape as seen on the G Flex and G4 models, the new G5 will have a flatter design with round edges. Another radical change is the volume rocker and power buttons are now purportedly moved towards the sides. Despite having a full unibody design, the source also claims that the battery is still removable. How is this even possible? Apparently their engineers have made a mechanism that allows the bottom portion to be removed, giving you access to its battery. The lower end of the device will get a drawer-like design that helps to keep dust and water away. When we think of a full unibody design with a removable battery, we thought of the old   that was released about 6 years ago. It had a sturdy body made from a single block of aluminum and the removable cap at the bottom gives you access to its SIM, microSD and removable battery. This was the time when HTC was at its peak.

The only reason we switch on navigation apps (like  ) in the morning is to find out which is the least congested route, but doing so every morning, having to manually set your location each time can be rather cumbersome. So what if you don’t want to have to set your location each morning but still want to find out which is the least congested/fastest way to get to work on time?   has the answer. With the continuous development of Waze, it has become a fantastic navigation app and I personally use it over Google Maps, less because I feel that it is a better navigation app that Maps (which I don’t) and more because of its nifty, user-friendly features. Features like knowing where you’re going based on your history — for example, if you leave for work at 9 AM a few days in a row the app will suggest “work” the next time you fire it up at around the same time of day — as well as changing your route on the fly based on the changing traffic. That said, I do feel that the application updates the routes rather slowly (especially when it comes to congestion) and the navigation isn’t as crisp and informative as Google Maps’. Plus I really hate the way it looks and how slow it is to launch and calculate routes. With Google Maps v9.19 though, it seems that there is an alternative to that. With the acquisition of Waze by the search engine giant,   has slowly integrated more and more of Waze’s features into their own navigation app. Now, along with a whole host of interesting new things, Google Maps has support for Driving Mode — but you’ll have to activate it first. Driving Mode isn’t what you think it means. It doesn’t convert your phone into a landscape screen that has gigantic buttons for doing simple tasks to like answering your phone calls so you won’t get distracted on the road. Instead, it guesses (based on your history) where you’re going and it gives you live updates on the traffic situation as well as the fastest routes to your destination, without the need for you to set a location beforehand. However, thanks to the comments section, users have pointed out that signing out and signing into Maps itself will trigger the feature and unlock the additional options. From there, simply hit “Add Driving shortcut” and you can access this awesome new feature. Once in you will be greeted with the new interface that shows you multicoloured roads (much like Waze) with different colours indicating different levels of congestion. You can then begin your journey or tap the screen once to bring down the menu and set your destination."

ASUS have mounted their 3x optical zoom glass horizontally across the back of the device allowing its thickness to be greatly reduced. The primary camera itself is a 13-megapixel Panasonic SmartFSI sensor with an f/2.7-4.8 10-element lens and a whole host of goodies like optical image stabilisation (OIS), Pixel Master 2.0, laser autofocus plus a dual-tone LED flash. If you’re worried that 13MP isn’t enough, ASUS have included a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for up to 52-megapixels per photo. Besides that, the camera boasts a 5cm macro shot distance as well as a pro-style Manual mode. The front camera is a modest 5MP f/2.0-aperture, wide angle 88-degree lens with Pano Selfie. While the device itself has nice metal rails — an improvement over the plasticky ZenFone 2 — the back is made of some kind of soft touch leather that ensures the phone is grippy even in one hand. Close to the dedicated shutter and video record button is a slight bump which helps with the ergonomics when you’re shooting pictures with this device. This smartphone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’s ZenUI skin on top. It also sports a reasonable 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS’s BoostMaster fast-charging technology. The ZenFone Zoom will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi and a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot. Being a relatively premium device, the ZenFone Zoom will come in two colours — Ceramic White and Pure Black — at a retail price of RM2,099 and will be available at the end of January."

With the upcoming iOS 9.3 update for the iPhone and iPad, Apple wants you to sleep better at night with its new “Night Shift” feature.  According to Apple, Night Shift aims to make it easier for you to sleep by making the display more pleasant to your eyes. Using your device’s time and GPS, it will know when it is sunset and would gradually change the display to show warmer colours, cutting down on blue light emission. As a result, it would help to increase   naturally, a vital component to get better sleep at night.  Of course, this isn’t entirely new. Most smartphones from China including Xiaomi, OPPO, Huawei and BenQ have their own low blue light or reading mode that does the same thing. The only difference is that Apple is making it automatic based on your current time.  There’s no mention if there’s an option to turn it off, but we are sure it would be important for those actually working night shifts.  Apart from this low blue light mode, the new iOS 9.3 update will also introduce a multi-user feature for the iPad. This would allow several people to share a single device and the experience will be customised based on their individual profiles. Unfortunately, this appears to be catered for schools and we are not sure if they would extend this to end users as well. On top of that, the native Notes app can be secured with your fingerprints.

They say that the easiest way to spot that a person does not drive a Ferrari is to look for the guy wearing the Ferrari branded sunglasses/shirt. And since there are many more people who don’t own luxury cars versus people who do, car branded accessories are popping up everywhere. What’s worse is that these “accessories” are usually just overpriced versions of otherwise normal products. Slap a Rolls Royce logo on a microwave and it will probably be worth 10 times more. Bentley has the same idea, and working with luxury phone manufacturer  , they’ve smacked a Bentley badge on a USD9,900 (around RM43,600) phone to create the Vertu Signature Touch for Bentley. My bank account isn’t ready for this. Vertu is renown for being the manufacturer of ultra-premium phones that usually prioritise form over function. But with their latest device, the Signature Touch, they’ve managed to combine the two aspects as it packs an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and 4GB of RAM with 64GB of internal storage under that pretty stitched exterior. The Signature Touch also has a 5.2″ 1080p full HD display with sapphire crystal glass. It also sports a 21MP rear shooter with PDAF for their rear camera while the front will have a 2.1MP selfie camera. Powering the device is a 3,100 mAh battery. So what’s the difference between this Signature Touch for Bentley versus the regular Signature Touch? Well, it has a 3D Bentley logo; two-tone Beluga and Hotspur Bentley leather with Hotspur stitching. Besides that, the Signature Touch for Bentley also features knurled side keys, a “unique” pillow rail and sound bar. I know right? Try explaining why this phone is special   sounding pretentious. Other than the potentially absurd price tag, there really is nothing too special about this smartphone that makes it a better phone than a similar flagship. It even runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop. I honestly think it looks really ugly, unnecessarily tacky and frankly quite   (there is really no English word for  ) too. I’d like to say that this automobile-branded-regular-product-fad has gone on for way too long and things are getting out of control so we should all refrain from buying them. But, I know that somewhere out there, there is a guy sitting in his million ringgit car thinking: “Hmm, if only I had a smartphone that costs about the same as a Myvi to match my Bentley…”."

This is to facilitate the push towards Microsoft’s new operating system,  . When we say terminate, we don’t mean that your Windows 8 machine will just up and die or stop working straight away, it’s just that Windows 8 won’t receive updates, security fixes and bug fixes it used to get. If you are running on Windows 8 though, don’t worry because there is a simple way around this issue. Besides the obvious upgrade to Windows 10 being one of the solutions, Windows 8 users can also upgrade to Windows 8.1, which based on their lifecycle fact sheet, will continue to receive updates for two more years until January 9, 2018. If you’ve read the horror stories of Windows 10’s ominous privacy terms and want to avoid such dangers by staying on an older version of Windows, you can now do so. As you can see, today also marks the end of Windows 7 service Pack 1’s mainstream support — but don’t worry you will still continue to receive security updates as extended support will go all the way to January 14, 2020. All you lose is the mainstream support which includes free incident support, warranty claims and fixes for non-security and security bugs, plus design changes and feature requests. Based on statistics published by Tech Crunch, 2-3% of PCs (30-40 million devices) are still running on Windows 8, while Windows 7 is said to currently be in use on  . Why is it important to keep your system updated and within Microsoft’s support lifecycle? Well, the first and most obvious reason is security. As operating systems lose their security updates, they become vulnerable to new malware and potential attacks, which puts your information as well as your system at risk. Microsoft, via updates, patches these new vulnerabilities when they come up so that these exploitable holes are fixed. Once that support ends, you lose all protection against future vulnerabilities. Besides Windows 8, Microsoft is also terminating support for older versions of IE, urging users to upgrade either to IE 11 or Microsoft’s new Edge browser. I’ve personally never been a fan of IE because of how messy the interface is and how clunky it makes browsing feel, so it comes as a surprise to me that 20% of the desktop web browser market still uses the older versions of IE (8, 9, 10) as their daily driver. Unfortunately for those people, they will have to migrate to either the new IE 11, Microsoft Edge, or other third party browsers like   or  , or else they would be facing security vulnerabilities when browsing the web. Microsoft Edge, the built-in browser on Windows 10, promised much in terms of functionality and performance. Things like extensions were supposed to come to Edge to keep it up to par with browsers like Google’s Chrome but til this day, there is still   anywhere. I don’t know about you guys but I definitely need my extensions. Killing off old software is nothing new, and I welcome it because not only does it allow software developers to focus on their latest and greatest product, it also allows them to free up valuable resources to focus on new projects. Resources that would otherwise go to updating and patching old software can now be redirected towards either new software or the improvement of current software."

The images gave us a look at the front of the device but we never got to see the back of it. Now, information has surfaced that suggests the new flagship device could feature two different variants sporting different specs and different back panels. Xiaomi is no stranger to bold choices when it comes to their products. Look at their   series where the   and the   were wildly different — one had a full metal body and a fingerprint scanner — yet they were both launched only two months apart. Would it really surprise you then that they would do something as radical as having two different back panel/constructions on their upcoming flagship device? Well if it comes true that will definitely still surprise me. Of the two devices, the first one is purported to have curved 2.5D glass at the front and the back of the device with a metal frame. Think   or  . This variant is also supposed to feature a 1080p full HD resolution display with the possibility of having 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. On the other hand, the supposed second phone is said to feature an all-metal design — that means full-metal rear housing instead of curved 2.5D glass. Additionally, the device is said to have a higher QHD 2K resolution display and it could possibly house the 4GB RAM/64GB internal storage variant. Other than that, both devices should be identical — sporting a Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a suggested screen size that can range from 5 to 5.2-inches. The smartphone is also said to have a 3,600 mAh battery and become official by January 21, though sales are only expected to start on February 8. Of course, this is all just guess work based on rumours at this point and for all we know it could be the other way around. That said, this isn’t the first time Xiaomi have done two versions of the same device as the   and   are essentially the same device except for the fact that the Pro variant has a more powerful processor plus more RAM and a higher resolution screen. If these rumours of the Mi 5 are true though, it would be the first time that the Chinese company have gone with two completely different back constructions on a phone. So, take this with a grain of salt."

While there were some who liked it, everyone in our office was not impressed with their “flagship”. It was a little sluggish and for a device rated so highly on DxOMark, we were quite disappointed with the camera. With a device that left much to be desired and a quiet CES 2016 showing, Sony fans must be hungry for something cool to come out of the tech giant. Well, we don’t have their new flagship for you, but here’s a pretty pink-gold (rose gold? It could just be gold with bad white balance/me being a little colour blind) Sony device. It appears all of Sony’s quietness hasn’t stopped someone from leaking what looks to be the Xperia C6 — sporting a sexy rounded bezel-less design with Sony’s trademark camera-shutter-esque power button. If you’ve been paying attention to futuristic sci-fi movies, you’ll know that bezel-less is the way to go and we were glad Sony are going one step further from the near bezel-less display that appeared on the   from last year. That said, this doesn’t look like a C6 Ultra simply because it looks relatively small in what we’re assuming is the leakster’s hands. Unless of course he/she has gargantuan hands. Either way, if we look at the device’s designs, the good looks we’ve grown accustomed to in a Sony device are all mostly apparent with that thin body and the familiar shape. The edges are rounded like the Xperia C5 Ultra which should make it nicer to hold than the Xperia Z5 though it does seem that the device still has a flat back. There is also a distinct lack of front-facing speakers (aw man) despite all that chin and forehead sony are giving it. What’s a little unnerving is that the back panel of this device seems to be peeling off — which we hope won’t be a problem on the finished product. Sony devices have had pretty good build quality after all. The Xperia C6 is rumoured to sport a 5.5″ full HD display up front, with a 2.0GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor running on the inside. Besides that, there isn’t much information left about the device itself. I guess we’ll have to wait for the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year to (hopefully) find out more. Since it’s pink though, it could potentially tie in with an upcoming pink Sony device that the company has been endlessly teasing on their  , With, nine images teased thus far, this device’s reveal has been set for 12 January 2016 and the folks over at Xperia Blog reckon it isn’t a pink Xperia Z5.

Then again nothing is truly invented until   does it right?  
 Based on 9to5Mac’s article, the AirPods looks to be exactly what the name suggests — “air” versions of Apple’s   — completely wireless earbud headphones. Likely bearing a physical resemblance to the Motorola Hint, these new headphones are co-developed with Beats Electronics (which Apple acquired awhile back) and are designed to be compatible with the new   that is rumoured to be ditching the 3.5mm jack altogether. That’s not to say the EarPods will just die off, no, the wired EarPods are expected to be connected via the Lightning connector, a feature that has been included in iOS since 2014. The AirPods on the other hand, are expected to be sold separately as a premium upgrade to the wired in-ear headphones. 9to5Mac also suspects that these earbud headphones will feature a noise-cancelling microphone system for phone  calls and communication with Siri even without Apple’s in-line microphone and remote. It would make sense, after all, they’re supposed to be built for a phone so it wouldn’t make much sense if you couldn’t make calls on them. These AirPods are suspected to come with a carrying case that will charge your wireless headphones when you’re not using them. Without which 9to5Mac estimates the headphones’ battery life at just under 4 hours on a single charge. These AirPods could also be port-less requiring you to charge them in that case. Ditching the 3.5mm jack is nothing new in the mobile phone industry, even Oppo has done it with their uber-thin R5. While Apple’s decision could be driven by the fact that they want to make the iPhone 7 thinner, it could also be because — with all these waterproof iPhone rumours floating about — having a 3.5mm jack would mean another headache when trying to make the device waterproof. When the original iPhone came out right until the iPhone 4s, the headphone jack was located at the top of the device. Since the iPhone 5’s inception, however, the 3.5mm jack has transferred to the bottom, a trend that has carried on even to the iPhone 6s of today. Apple isn’t a stranger to changing things up with their line of products; removing the optical drives from most of their computer devices was one move, changing the headphone jack placements is another. When they made the first move on the iPhone 5, it was because it apparently made more sense to have all your cables sticking out on one end of the device. People were also more inclined to placing their devices head first into their pockets — something I agree with. With their upcoming iPhone 7, Apple is looking to mix things up even more — design wise — with a   and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, opting instead to stick with either a Lightning port or a wireless Bluetooth solution. The thing is, wireless devices run on battery, and if you’re already charging your smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, tablet and over-ear headphones, do you really want to charge your earbuds too? The worst part? Having to charge your earbuds are just the tip of the iceberg. At first, Apple locks you within their app ecosystem. Then they don’t allow you to use third-party ports and connectors. Now, they don’t even want you to use third-party headphones, forcing you to stick with their proprietary ones. What about those of us who have bought a solid set of headphones with a 3.5mm jack? Are we forced to use an adapter? Apple has always made some beautiful devices, with gorgeous fit and finishes, but ever since they launched their rendition of a  , we’re a little worried about the new iPhone. Maybe the   was a dud, the ugly apple pie you hide from your guests when they come over for dinner. A lazy oversight. For Apple’s sake, we sure hope so."
Rory Lee,Anyone can crash your WhatsApp with the power of emojis,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/11/anyone-can-crash-your-whatsapp-with-the-power-of-emojis/,"Android,emoji crash whatsapp,smartphone,Whatsapp,whatsapp crash,whatsapp emoji,WhatsApp vulnerability,whatsapp weakeness","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-11,"seems to be full of vulnerabilities these days. At first, it tried to steal your   through a malware in WhatsApp’s update, now it seems that you can crash specific users’ apps by sending them a whole bunch of emojis. 5,000 emojis to be precise. Researcher Indrajeet Bhuyan reveals that people can cause Android versions of the WhatsApp application to crash by sending them at least 5,000 emojis from the web version of WhatsApp. When a user receives the application and tries to open it, the whole app would crash. The only way to recover from that is to delete the entire conversation. Through our experimentation, it does indeed work. When we tried to open the “malicious” message, sure enough, our application crashed and we had to close and restart it before we could access the app again. However, the other conversations were unaffected by the malicious thread, so as long as you leave that conversation alone it won’t crash the application. This also works for group chats. The only way to access that conversation again is to delete the entire thread and start a new conversation with that contact. That said, if you have 4GB of RAM like we did on our Oppo R7s, you can have varying degrees of success in opening the thread again though you would have to wait awhile. This vulnerability does not extend to the iOS version of WhatsApp as the emojis only cause the app to lag, unlike a previous   that relied on a specific message. Although WhatsApp does have a character limit of 6,000 — to prevent messages that the application cannot handle — it seems that this still far too many as a mere 5,000 emojis will kill the app. When talking about the potential exploits of having such a vulnerability, Bhuyan says that an attacker could be sending abusive messages to their victim, blackmailing or threatening them, then send them 5,000 emojis to crash that thread and make it so that the victim can’t access the thread for evidence again. Let’s hope WhatsApp (or Facebook) pushes out a fix for this soon before people with bad intentions catch on and start abusing this."

While many see the Apple Watch as a marvelous piece of engineering, these Swiss watchmakers are unimpressed. So much so they told smartwatch users to “get a life” by upgrading to a mechanical watch. Oops, we’d better not show them our   then. Dubbed the Swiss Alp Watch, H. Moser & Cie’s light-hearted jab at Apple comes complete with an Apple-esque product video, complete with rotating close up shots and cheesy “revolutionary” one-line product descriptions. There’s even audio of what sounds like someone taking a bite out of an apple. Kind of reminds us of the time Ikea took a  , complete with the same  . As amusing as this video is, the Swiss Alp Watch is certainly no joke. Besides being a carbon copy of Apple’s smartwatch, the Swiss Alp Watch comes in 18-carat white gold body that has the same dimensions as the Apple Watch. It also has a screw-in non-digital crown adorned with an M, which will power on the device with a single twist. Besides that, the watch has a see-through sapphire crystal rear case that allows you to see the watch in all its beautifully-crafted mechanical glory. As far as features are concerned, the watch (obviously) doesn’t have support for phone calls, heartbeat sensors, text messages or sketching. It does, however, show what H. Moser & Cie calls the “most valuable commodity”: The time. It will “let you reconnect with people by getting out there, meeting your friends and spending time with your loved ones”. All that intricate engineering will cost you, as the watch — which is limited to 50 units — costs a whopping USD24,900 (around RM109,000) which is a touch more than the Apple Watch Edition, which will set you back RM80,000. Okay, maybe more of a smack than a touch. Either way, this video shouldn’t be taken too seriously, as The Verge points out because H. Moser & Cie is by no means a large watchmaker. So it’s more likely that this was made simply to be a tongue-in-cheek joke than anything else. It supposedly represents the company’s “resilience” and their “ferocious desire to fight our values and traditions”, embodying everything they believe in. The important thing is that this is compatible with   device."

As we’ve covered stories before about small   or  , we thought it’d be fitting to follow up with a bigger modular device — a TV. Yup,   have come up with a modular TV that can split into several different parts and dance around your wall like something you’d find in a bachelor pad from the future. If you can’t wrap your head around what I’m talking about, take a look at this short clip by Gizmodo: Pretty freaking cool. However, Mashable’s Pete Pachal does note that while all the moving around is cool and stuff, when the screens do come together, he could see the seams between the displays which we found pretty disappointing. Then again this is relatively new tech so there are plenty of kinks to work out. Another TV that Samsung had on display showcased the ability for the TV to change its aspect ratios with the modular technology. The display could rotate two sides of the screen to switch it from a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 4:3 aspect ratio in seconds. This means you can use up all of those valuable pixels for either of the popular aspect ratios, eliminating those annoying black bars. It’s pretty cool but once again Pete noted that the seam was visible. One final modular TV on display, however, showcased what is realistically the closest to a completed product — a massive 170″ wall TV that is made up of several smaller panels. Mashable notes that this is perhaps the most practical use of the modular technology, especially since the seams were not visible. Not only does it allow manufacturers to push the TV’s size to even more ridiculous proportions, Mashable notes that it also makes these monstrous TVs easier to ship because movers can break down a huge set to smaller screens. That’s cool and all but we can think of one more way to utilise these modular panels. Assuming they’re easy to remove and hot swap, parents could easily remove a section of the TV to prevent their kids from watching it when they’re being grounded or during their study sessions. In fact, you could probably remove one panel and bring it along with you on holiday to discourage thieves from nicking your precious television. Then again they’d have to have a pretty sizable moving truck to be able to ship a 170″ television in the first place. Either way, as all modular things usually are, the possibilities are almost endless. What do you guys think of a modular TV? Can you think of any other useful things it can bring to the table that your current TV set can’t? Let us know in the comments below."

Sporting a metal unibody and a massive 4,100 mAh battery, the device looks be a strong contender in the budget end of the smartphone market. The device will feature a 5″ 720p HD display with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 processor coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage running MIUI 7 out of the box. That’s bordering on mid-range territory. It will also have a hybrid SIM setup where users can choose to either run dual SIM or one SIM and a microSD card (up to 128GB) for more storage. One of its strongest selling points is the massive 4,100 mAh battery which Xiaomi says will give you an 80% improvement in talk time duration compared to its predecessor. Despite all that extra battery capacity though, it is thinner than the Redmi 2, coming in at just 8.5mm and weighing only 144g. Besides that the battery also supports 5V/2A fast charging so you can top it up in a jiffy. All of the internals will be housed inside a full-metal body — a first for the Redmi line — that has an all-new lattice design made up of 4,166 stars woven together to reflect an arrangement of diamonds. From the images, it certainly looks pretty good. Camera wise, the device will sport a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear shooter with phase detection autofocus (PDAF) which Xiaomi quotes will give you a fast autofocus time of 0.1 seconds. Selfies, on the other hand, will be taken care of by a 5MP f/2.2 snapper at the front. The Redmi 3 will be available in three fashion colours — fashion gold, fashion silver and fashion grey — plus a classic gold colour and will be priced at RMB699 (around RM470), which is the   as the Redmi 2 before it. It will go on sale in China tomorrow (12 January 2016) on   and  . The device is already on display at Mi.com’s  .

Rory Lee,This is a 16-lens DSLR killer that can fit in your pocket,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/this-is-a-16-lens-dslr-killer-that-can-fit-in-your-pocket/,"16 lens camera,Android Marshmallow,camera,CES 2016,DSLR,DSLR killer,L16 camera,Light L16,Light L16 camera,Snapdragon 820","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-08,"The problem with getting started on a DSLR is that you have to fork out a tonne of cash to be able to afford a decent body plus a lens. Sure some of you might say that you’re OK with the kit lens, but let’s face it, we all want a red band around our lens. Unless you’re not using a Canon device. A startup called Light is trying to change that with their L16 camera — a camera that has 16 lenses packed into a body small enough to fit in your pocket. Well, sort of. By Mashable’s estimate, the camera is about the size of three iPhone 6 Pluses stacked together. It probably won’t fit in your skinny jeans then. Nevertheless, it is still an impressive feat that they managed to cram that much tech and that many lenses into a body so small. Oh, did we mention it’s powered by a Snapdragon 820 SoC? On the hardware side of things, this camera has 16 (5x35mm, 5x70mm, 6x150mm) different prime lenses that work together to take an image. The camera sets it up in a way that — depending on your zoom and framing — 10 lenses will fire at the same time, taking different quadrants of an image. Note that Mashable says the device has 120mm lenses instead of 150mm lenses, but from the company’s video and several other sites, they say that it uses 150mm lenses. The camera then stitches the 10 images together to form a high 52-megapixel image that is should eliminate quality loss normally experienced at the fringes of a lens. These lenses don’t use any kind of fancy glass, instead, they all use f/2.4 P5 plastic lenses coupled with smartphone camera sensors. Plus, since it uses so many lenses at so many different focal lengths, Light claims that the camera has a near infinite depth of field — something you can adjust in post processing. Sporting a 5″ touchscreen paired with a Snapdragon 820 SoC and an interface based off of Android M, this device looks to bring camera and smartphone imaging technology closer together. Don’t be fooled, this doesn’t have a cellular modem so you can’t make phone calls. A best of both worlds then? We certainly hope so. News of this little guy has been floating around for quite awhile now but recently Mashable got to take a look at one of the prototypes for the device. According to them, the photo stitching on the prototype took a little while to process (it ultimately froze), with the company stating that they’re trying to get the image stitching and processing down to below 1 minute. A pretty ridiculous waiting time for a photo if you ask me. The silver lining is that the processing time is only for the 52-megapixel image, so if you want to post a quick snap on social media, the camera will generate a lower quality image for you. My nose is wrinkling in annoyance. According to Mashable, when Light compared the images between an  , Canon 5D Mark III and the Light L16, they were impressed with how detailed the L16 images were but noted that there was a lot of image noise. Battery life on the other hand, Mashable says that the company ballparks it at about 400 shots. While this is a noble attempt at killing our tried and tested DSLR cameras, it seems like it is still a long way off from actually dealing the final blow. Even if the software is perfected and the device works wonderfully, we (like Mashable) believe that the DSLR will continue to live on and be the primary tool for professional photographers. For events and on-the-go photography though, we can see how this device can be very useful for the professionals thanks to it’s portability and, hopefully, stellar image quality. We will have to see how it stacks up against other compact monsters like the Sony RX100 series before jumping to a conclusion though. That said, if this device works out, it could be a great (and much cheaper, coming in at USD1,699 which is around RM7452) alternative to the DSLR for hobbyists and prosumers. Exciting stuff then!"

If they’re bringing such premium materials to their budget Redmi line, that means the bar has been set for their flagship Mi series, starting with the  . Previously leaked press renders hinted that the device would take a rather big turn when it comes to design as it looks to feature a physical button at the front. Now, new images have surfaced on Weibo of the actual device that seems to confirm that suspicion. Besides that, the device also seems to sport metal rails along the side that should lend it a more premium feel in the hand though we’re not entirely sure if the device will have an all-metal unibody though it does seem likely. The speakers look to be placed at the bottom of the device, flanking a charging port. Whether or not that will be USB Type-C port remains to be seen. Since it’s a flagship, the device is no slouch, sporting Qualcomm’s latest quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There are rumours that there will be another model sporting 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It is also said to feature a 5.2-inch 1080×1920 pixel display, but there are other rumours that it might be a   (2560×1440) instead. As far as camera optics are concerned, the device is rumoured to have a 16-megapixel rear sensor with a 13-megapixel front camera to boot. It is also said to feature a 3,600 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0. Those are some interesting specifications and design choices but do note that these are not officially confirmed so take it with a grain of salt.

So they are removing a name but the entity will continue to tinker away under a division of Lenovo. One has to have a sense of humour to appreciate the different stances that took place but for once we think Lenovo and Motorola have finally sorts out their branding issues or so we hope. Back in August,   was what Lenovo decided to do as reported by Android Authority. A slight U-turn of decisions by our records but we guess it’s not easy running a company as large as Lenovo and they’re bound to make some wrong turns along the way. At least following their statements today we can conclude that brand name-wise, Motorola will cease to exist. Subsequently, any new devices under the umbrella will be sold as Moto by Lenovo or Vibe by Lenovo. So the crux of all this is, any future “Moto” device will still very much be built, designed and created by Motorola – e.g. Moto X, Moto G and Moto E – the only different being the company name that sells it. Business will go on, as usual, just the technicalities behind the “names” who sell them will differ. We already saw all of this coming since Q3 of last year but riding the “Motorola” name is really sad to see. In the light of this move, we’re going to take everyone on a trip down memory lane.

The video, while it gives us some insight into what the regular version of the device should look like, it doesn’t have any renders of the variants. Awhile back, there was some discussion on whether the S7 launch in February would see four variants (the S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge Plus) of Samsung’s new flagship. We didn’t think so, but new information has surfaced recently about the possibility of a Galaxy S7 Plus and a Galaxy S7 edge Plus being launched. Popular case manufacturer Spigen has put their Samsung Galaxy S7 cases on sale on   even before the device has been launched, though the cases are not on  . The cases are going from USD14.99 (around RM66). What’s interesting isn’t that the cases are out — because this isn’t the first time Spigen has   — it is that there is a case for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Plus and Galaxy S7 edge Plus. This could very well be confirmation of an earlier @evleaks post about the 4 S7 variants. While we don’t think that Samsung will be launching the S7 Plus and the S7 edge Plus in February, it also doesn’t make sense for Spigen to have the preorder for those cases so soon if Samsung weren’t going to launch their devices until the end of the year. If they do launch four of them at the same time, the devices could either be separated by region, size or even processor. However, if the devices do get separated by region like   and  , we’re sure there will be many unhappy Samsung fans. That said, the images look like placeholder/rendered images because if we were to compare them to @OnLeaks’ (who is quite reputable when it comes to leaks) youtube video, you’d notice that Spigen’s model device is missing the  -esque rear curves. As a recap of the specs. both the S7 and the S7 edge are said to run either their latest Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 depending on the market paired with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Good news is that that storage is said to be expandable as leaks claim Samsung is   slot that was missing from their 2015 flagships. Camera wise, the Samsungs are said to have a lower megapixel count, at 12MP for the primary, but feature the Korean manufacturer’s latest BRITECELL camera technology that is said to improve low light photography and reduce the camera hump. That coupled with a rumoured f/1.7 aperture lens should see the camera do quite well in low light. The S7 should come in a 5.1″ form-factor while the S7 edge takes on the 5.5″ body. Both devices could also be waterproof,  which looks like   for the upcoming 2016 flagships."

Now, on Xiaomi’s official Weibo account, the company released an image confirming our suspicions. What’s more, they’ve also included a release date! Beyond that, Xiaomi hasn’t confirmed any of the other specifications but if we’re going off the TENAA entry, the device should have a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. That 5″ screen should also be a 720p HD screen and the device will likely run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. For camera optics, the Redmi 3 should have a 13MP primary camera paired with a 5MP front camera combo. On paper, this is a significant boost over the Redmi 2, pushing this into the mid-range category. We can only hope that the price will not follow suit. Popular Youtuber MKBHD once said that good phones are getting cheap while cheap phones are getting good and we share that sentiment. This is definitely something that is catching on because it seems that even Xiaomi realised they can’t continue making plasticky budget phones anymore.

The move of getting into the phone business was timely. Close to a billion mobile phones was sold in 2006 worldwide. That’s about 5X more than PCs, over 7X the number of MP3 players and 10X more than digital cameras at that time. Steve Jobs was targeting just 1% market share with a goal of selling 10 million iPhones for 2008.  The iPhone was revolutionary back then with its full touch-screen capacitive display with its multi-touch technology. Browsing the web was smooth and there were no cluttered keys or buttons that get in the way. Steve Jobs even mocked the use of a stylus as the iPhone was intuitive enough to be used with your bare fingers. Compared to today’s iPhones, the original model was very barebones. At a time when smartphone makers are moving towards 3G, the iPhone was only a 2G device supporting up to EDGE. There was no AppStore, meaning you’re stuck with its native apps, and the common copy and paste feature was only introduced with iOS 3.0, 2 years later. At the time, many had doubts on the iPhone. The base 4GB model was priced from US$499 (RM1,746 at that time) on a 2-year contract. If you want more storage, the 8GB version was going for US$599 (about RM2096), also on contract. Even Steve Ballmer of Microsoft had a laugh about it and this was a time when Windows Mobile and Nokia Symbian phones reign supreme.  When it was eventually released in 2008, Apple   phones, surpassing its original goal and the rest is history. For Malaysia, the first iPhone to reach here officially was the  . It was priced at RM2,540 for 8GB and RM2,960 for 16GB models.  Until this very day, the iPhone is still considered as the de facto benchmark for the smartphone industry. It changed the way we interact with touch-screen devices and how we consume content and services on a mobile device. However, after Steve Job’s departure, it seems that Apple hasn’t been innovating as much as before, with the competition offering compelling choices at a much competitive price point.  For Steve Baller, he regretted not moving into the hardware business earlier, which saw themselves overtaken by Apple and Samsung.

Did you wish it came with a slide/flip/rotate out physical keyboard? Or did you wish that   made a   like they did with their bigger models? Yes? Good news then! One2Touch have introduced the SlimType — an NFC keyboard smartphone cover designed specifically for the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. Do you want to touch it? Smartphones took the world by storm as people discovered exactly how much they could do on a tiny little device that fit in their pocket. Users began using them for instant messaging, web browsing, social media browsing and media consumption. In fact, people are using them for anything but making a call. However, productivity has been the weakest link in the smartphone’s chain, due to many reasons. First is the fact that with screen real estate that is only the size of your palm, it is quite difficult to view something like a spreadsheet, for instance. Matters are made worse when users have to type because the virtual keyboard usually takes up half the screen. Plus it isn’t very satisfying typing on a virtual keyboard — one reason why   kept the keyboard on the  . With SlimType though, it looks like you can use your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge as a productivity device. There is one major problem that we’ve picked up on, though. Have you seen it yet? Yup, it doesn’t have a kickstand. Most tablet keyboard covers either rely on the device’s built-in kickstand or they fold in some sort of elaborate manner to form a triangular base. On the SlimType though, none of those options appear to be available. We don’t know about you but a kickstand seems mighty useful when you’re trying to be productive. The keyboard doesn’t look like it has much travel or much of a mechanical feel, which makes sense since it’s a phone cover. Doesn’t mean it will be nice to type on, though. Maybe this keyboard can work in a pinch or if you simply hate virtual keyboards and what it does to the size of your screen. Will it truly turn your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge into much more of a productivity beast than it already is? We doubt it. A cool attempt, but alas it doesn’t seem very practical. Although this device, which is on  , currently doesn’t ship directly to Malaysia, there are still ways to get such products into your hands. Google it you lazy people! We’re the type of people who simply must have the best when it comes to productive typing, so maybe we’re being overcritical. What do you guys think? Would you consider dropping USD39.99 (around RM174) on it?"
Alexander Wong,Maybank and Visa lets you make payments from your wrist,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/maybank-visa-payband-contactless-payment-malaysia/,"Contactless Payment,Maybank,Maybank PayBand,Maybank Visa PayBand,NFC,Smart Wearable,Visa,Visa Payband,wearable,Wearable Payment","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-01-08,"Paying by cash is troublesome. You would need to keep a sufficient amount in your wallet and if you don’t have exact change, you’ll end up with bulky coins in your pocket. While Touch ‘n Go is gaining momentum in stores, here’s another way to pay without cash. Maybank together with Visa has just announced the PayBand, the first payment wearable in Malaysia. According to Visa, Malaysians are moving towards contactless transactions and they are more likely to shop at a place that accepts one.  How it works is somewhat similar to the Maybank’s  , which is a sticker that you can stick onto your smartphone. Details of Maybank’s Visa PayBand isn’t available on their site, but if it follows the same mechanism, you can make payments up to RM250 without the need of signatures or pin numbers. Think of it as a Touch ‘n Go in a wristband form and it charges directly to your credit card.  In terms of acceptance, it will work with Visa PayWave terminals throughout Malaysia. Just like that PayWave enabled credit card, you would need to wave it in less than 4cm from the terminal to make a payment. This apparently is better than handing over a physical card as there’s no chance for merchants to obtain your full card details. You can learn more about its availability  . The PayBand device isn’t entirely new as   had introduced this in the UK in wristband, keychain fob and sticker format. So if you’re going for a jog, you can stop for coffee or breakfast without carrying your wallet. We have yet to see the Payband ourselves and we are curious to know if there are offering customisable band options.  With most smartphones and even smartwatches these days supporting NFC, we are still surprised that mobile NFC payments have yet to catch on in Malaysia. There were several attempts by Maxis with  , in collaboration with CIMB and Maybank. Unfortunately, it was short-lived and we haven’t heard of them since. Carrying an extra band would be quite cumbersome if you’re already wearing a smartband or a smartwatch. Having SamsungPay and Apple Pay in Malaysia would be a more elegant solution don’t you think? Would you consider getting a Visa PayBand? Let us know in the comments below."

The rear camera is said to be a 13MP main unit with Phase Detection AF, while the front has an 8MP shooter. This is hardly any difference from its current OPPO R7 range but hopefully it gets a couple of surprises during its official reveal. The OPPO R7 was   at RM1,598, while its lower spec R7 Lite is priced at RM1,298.

The newer Snapdragon 820 processor aims to turn things around while bringing its performance up to the mark.  At CES 2016, Qualcomm had announced China’s LeTV Le Max Pro as the first smartphone to use their SoC. Apart from having top end performance, the Le Max Pro is also the first device to feature Qualcomm’s   and the first to support multi-gigabit 802.11ad WiFi, which is also known as WiGig.   The LeTV Le Max Pro is a large 6.33″ phablet that pushes Quad HD resolution. Under the hood lies a Snapdragon 820 processor with quad Kyro cores at 2.2GHz that’s mated to 4GB of RAM. The processor claims to be more efficient with a 16nm process and it is accompanied by a Adreno 530 GPU. The new processor with quad-cores apparently provides 2X the performance of an Octa-Core based Snapdragon 810 unit.  The Sense ID is supposedly a more advanced biometric feature as it uses ultrasonic sound waves that’s superior than capacitive based scanners commonly used today. Instead of recording an image of your fingertips, Sense ID scans deeper below the skin. As a result, it harder to spoof and it works well even with contaminated fingers. Another advantage is that it works underneath glass, plastics and metal materials, allowing manufacturers to implement the sensor discreetly on smartphones.  In terms of design, it looks like a Huawei/honor device with a familiar antenna band stripes from an iPhone. Strangely there’s still a visible fingerprint scanner at the back which could have been omitted with Sense ID. The rear camera is said to be a 21MP shooter with Optical Image Stabilisation and powering this phablet is a generous 3,400mAh battery.  As seen in the pictures below, it uses USB Type-C for charging and data transfer. Connectivity wise, it also supports Cat 12 4G LTE with download speeds up to 600Mbps and uplink up to 150Mbps. There’s no mention of its availability but you can expect more Snapdragon 820 flagship smartphones to be announced next month during MWC 2016."

When I look around at my friends, more than half of them have more well-defined abs than I do life goals. To fulfill this desire to track health and fitness, tech companies have launched a myriad of fitness bands, trackers and applications designed to keep you as well informed about your body as possible. But while most of those devices existed as individual elements, none were truly unified. At least, that’s what HTC and Under Armour said when they launched their brand new ‘fitness system’ that costs USD400 (around RM1751). You must be thinking, you’d get a lot of gear right? Well, that depends on your definition of ‘a lot’. What we do know is that with the UA HealthBox, you will be receiving three devices — a fitness band, a smart scale and a heart-rate monitor. Dubbed the UA Band, this fitness band is designed to be worn all-day every day because it tracks daily activities, workout and sleep. Under the band’s “seamless exterior shell” is a display which is “discreetly hidden” allowing it to disappear when not in use. While we don’t know how hidden they wanted the screen to be, from the pictures (even their product shots) it certainly looks like it’s well hidden enough to be a nightmare to view under sunlight. The UA Band also features an advanced workout mode with a display that stays on during the workout as well as an LED that indicates heart rate zone when paired with the heart rate monitor. Wow, a screen that stays on! Next, we have the UA Heart Rate — a compact heart rate monitor that is designed to be undetectable during workouts. It is also supposed to help individuals monitor intensity and train smarter while providing an accurate calculation of calories burned. How refreshing, a heart rate monitor that actually does all this accurately! Finally, we have the UA Scale. It’s a smart scale that is “beautifully crafted” and WiFi enabled in an “iconic circular design”. This scale also has a hidden LED display that makes the technology invisible when not in use. It also looks like there is a “nifty” feature where they show you a bunch of logos, greet you and only after they’ve done all that do they show you your weight. Perfect for when you’re in a hurry! According to them, these three devices are perfectly synced to provide the user with a “customised experience”, but they fail to mention exactly what that customised experience is. Based on the video, it looks like it’s just a personalised profile on your “dashboard” in the UA Record app. Speaking of the app, UA and HTC have made it available in both the   and   as a free download. The application shows you the results of your daily health and fitness tracking plus a “How do you feel?” scale. That said, there is some benefit to having all of these devices connected. Like they highlighted in their video, there is a lot of potential for growth into an actual ecosystem (via smart shoes, headphones, etc.). Plus there is the benefit of it being simple to use and understand. For now though, this “system” seems more like your paying a lot for a brand to be plastered onto existing technology and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, look at Beats by Dre, they’re selling like hot cakes."

Well, there has been a new development in the matter as TM have decided to postpone their defaulting to the e-Bill format by six months. Towards the end of last year, TM broadband subscribers (Streamyx and UniFi) exploded in outrage when they found out that TM was planning to charge them an exorbitant amount for their printed bills. The ISP justified their actions by claiming that it was part of their move to go green — cutting down and eliminating the usage of paper. As a form of ‘motivation’ to get customers to switch to e-Billing, the telecommunications company was going to incur a monthly charge of RM2 for those who still want to receive their bill in paper format. Charge Malaysians extra for anything and you know outrage will soon follow. In any case, TM issued an explanation that ended up giving consumers more confusion than confirmation because while they announced that it was an RM2 surcharge on their website, a surcharge of RM5 was mentioned on the printed bills. Now, there is finally a very official document detailing TM’s plans. According to the release, TM is postponing the defaulting of billing to the e-billing system to 1 July 2016 — seven months after the original intended implementation date of January 2016. This means that customers can still continue to receive their printed bill for now, but are strongly encouraged to make the switch as soon as possible. Customers who fail to make the switch by 1 July 2016 will continue to receive their printed bill but be incurred a surcharge of RM2 per month. TM is calling on all their subscribers to make the switch as soon as possible if they don’t want to be forced to pay more. They highlight that there are many benefits to using the e-billing system, from speed (customers can receive their bills within 4 days) to SMS alerts and even the ability to check your bill online (up to 6 months) from anywhere at any time by simply logging on to this  . To do so, simply update your preferred email address and mobile number by sending an email to help@tm.com.my or visit the nearest TMpoint outlet, or call TM Contact Centre at 100 from your landline. According to TM, over 700,000 out of more than 4.4 million TM residential customers are already on the e-Bill statements. That’s only about 16% of the user base. Do note that this does not affect people who are only subscribed to TM’s telephone services (without broadband). These customers will receive the printed bill for free."

Recently released in Taiwan, the ASUS Zenfone Zoom is a pretty interesting device. While smartphone cameras have gotten better with each iteration, one of their flaws have always been a lack of optical zoom. This was because adding an optical zoom would cause your device to be much thicker than a regular smartphone — a compromise device manufacturers were not willing to make. So, unless one was willing to manually zoom with one’s feet, smartphone photographers often had to settle for a grainier picture if they wanted to zoom. With the Zenfone Zoom, however, ASUS is claiming that this is the thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphone…in the world. They accomplished this by mounting the smartphone camera’s dual periscope horizontally across the back of the device. As a result, it boasts a 5mm “ultra-thin edge” thanks to an ergonomic curve that looks a lot like ASUS’s other Zenfones. The primary camera itself, while only sporting 13-megapixels, comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus, a dual-tone LED flash and a SmartFSI Panasonic sensor. To make up for the lack in resolution, ASUS has implemented a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for greater clarity (up to 52MP). It also has ASUS’s PixelMaster 2.0 — a feature famed for its low-light performance. To facilitate the impressive camera specifications, the Zenfone Zoom will have not only have a dedicated shutter button, it also has a dedicated video button. It’s no slouch when it comes to performance either, sporting a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom CPU paired with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB/128GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). The phone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box with ASUS’s ZenUI skin on top. At the front, this camera-centric smartphone features a 5.5″ full-HD display tucked under Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. It also has a metal finish along the rails of the phone to give it a more premium feel. Around the back, there seems to be some differences compared to the one  , as that one had some kind of textured back (faux leather perhaps?). However, this could be because the images in the Malaysian site are outdated. If you head on over to the   you can see that the build more closely resembles the one released in Taiwan. Nevertheless, we will find out how it looks like in about a week’s time. The Zenfone Zoom will sport a 3,000 mAh capacity battery, paired with ASUS’s BoostMaster technology. It is supposed to give you a 60% charge in 39 minutes. Although the Zenfone Zoom has support for up to 802.11ac WiFi, it only has one micro-SIM slot for mobile connectivity. In the US, the Zenfone Zoom comes in at around USD399, which translates to about RM1,760. Considering the state of the ringgit, an optimistic estimate of the Zenfone Zoom’s price here in Malaysia would be RM1,799, but realistically we should probably see it closer to RM1,899. While we’re pretty stoked about the device, we want to know what you guys think. Let us know in the comments below. Stay tuned for our coverage of the official release."

Not only it is super fast with transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, it is also capable of pushing more power and it can even replace your existing HDMI cables as well. As the one connector to rule them all, the new reversible port will be a common sight in upcoming smartphones, tablets and laptops.  To be in the forefront of this new standard, Acer has announced at CES 2016, the World’s first monitors to support USB Type-C. The H7 monitor series lets you connect your smartphone or laptop onto a bigger screen, while allowing you to transfer files and charge the device simultaneously. This basically sounds like a monitor with a built-in  .   The Acer H7 series isn’t entirely new and its   lineup employs the same classy look that’s being held up by a premium crafted brushed metal stand. It gets a ZeroFrame design that’s wrapped up in aluminium. There are 2 models available – 25″ and 27″, both of which boast WQHD resolution of 2560×1440 with 100% sRGB colour gamut reproduction.  The monitors come with built-in speakers, that’s assisted with DTS Sound and Acer TrueHarmony enhancements. To protect your eyes, it also gets a Blue Light Filter to reduce eye fatigue over extended usage. For backward compatibility with older devices, the new H7 monitors also support HDMI 2.0. The Acer H7 series is priced from 499 Euros (about RM2325), and it is expected to go on sale globally in February. Also announced at CES 2016 is the Acer R1 – The World’s Thinnest Monitor under 7mm. It is virtually bezel-less with its ZeroFrame design, allowing seamless viewing when paired with multiple monitors. The Acer R1 monitor series pushes Full HD resolution and it comes in either 21.5″, 23″, 23.8″, 25″ and 27″ sizes. Price starts from 139 Euros (about RM648) and it will be available globally starting this month."
Rory Lee,The ASUS Reco Smart camera is more than just a dash-cam,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/the-asus-reco-smart-camera-is-more-than-just-a-dash-cam/,"ASUS dash camera,ASUS portable camera,ASUS Reco Smart camera,ASUS Reco Smart Camera launch,CES 2016,Reco Smart,Reco Smart camera","Asus,Mobile Accessories",2016-01-06,"just dropped a video for their new Reco Smart camera that is designed to not only work as a dash cam but also as a portable camera.  With a fast lens, Sony sensor and an interesting design, things are looking pretty good for it. The Reco Smart camera is shaped a lot like a regular camera lens, without the body, which means that it is also quite large, much like  ‘s QX Camera. With that extra real estate though, ASUS can fit a large (and fast) f/1.8 aperture lens which should let it perform well in low-light conditions. ASUS’s camera also has a ‘Parking monitor mode’ that lets the camera detect movement in front of your vehicle and automatically start recording until it detects no further movement for one minute. Coupled with a 150-degree wide-angle lens, this Reco Smart cam is shaping up to be a pretty good dash-cam. In the event of a collision, the built-in three-axis G-sensor triggers the emergency record function. It will then save the recording to the ASUS WebStorage cloud and lock it down so it won’t be deleted by accident. Besides that, the camera can also be programmed to send out an emergency text message to a designated contact. Although there is no mention of the sensor’s megapixel count, the camera supports full-HD 1080p video recording as well as real-time previews and downloads on smart devices via the Reco app. Pairing with your smart device should also be a breeze with NFC One Touch Engage. As the device is WiFi capable (802.11 b/g/n), you also get 500GB of ASUS WebStorage cloud storage for free for one year. When ASUS said that the device could also function as a portable camera, they weren’t kidding because from the looks of things, the Reco Camera is compatible with a wide range of standard camera accessories. Stuff like tripods, monopods and even lens filters (which work with 58mm diameter lenses) should fit with no problems. The only bummer is that the device comes with a tiny 720mAh battery that can only support up to one hour of 1080p video recording with the WiFi turned on. As a comparison, a   Hero4 usually averages 1.5 hours of battery life at 1080p recording. You do get a decent amount of kit in the package though, including a microSD card, car charger, dual USB car charger, GPS mount holder and more. A waterproof housing for the camera is also available for purchase. For now, there is no information on availability or pricing."
Rory Lee,Apple Watch may launch in Malaysia this February with special Chinese New Year limited edition,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/apple-watch-may-launch-in-malaysia-this-february-with-special-chinese-new-year-limited-edition/,"apple,Apple Watch,Apple Watch Chinese New Year,Apple Watch Chinese New year Edition,Apple Watch Malaysia,Apple Watch Malaysia Launch,Apple Watch special edition","Apple,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Smart Watch",2016-01-06,": Apple Watch is   in Malaysia. Priced from RM1,599. One of the biggest thorns in our smartwatch sides has been the fact that   has yet to bring it’s coveted smartwatch, the  , to our shores. Well, the wait is almost up because Apple is set to put two exclusive Apple Watch Sport designs on sale in Malaysia on February 8. To commemorate the Chinese New Year celebrations, Apple looks to be putting these two “special” models on sale in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This comes after an announcement message appeared briefly on the countries’ corresponding Apple websites before being removed earlier today. The announcement read: 9to5Mac also reports that while the “Buy Now” and “Shop Now” links appeared for a short time on Apple’s website, it looks like the company might have launched the announcement a bit prematurely. It is currently unclear how Apple plans to sell these devices, or if they will be priced at an equally “special” price from the normal Apple Watch Sport models. While Apple officially launched the Watch way back in 2014, the final release of the product was in April the following year. Since then, the availability of the device has slowly trickled into our neighbouring countries. Now it seems our time may be near, though at this point it is still a rumour because there is no official confirmation. That said, this information was sourced from 9to5Mac and MacRumours, both of whom are usually right when it comes to stuff like these. If this launch date holds true, this would mean that Malaysia is one of the last markets to get the Apple Watch — almost an entire year after it was officially released. To make matters worse, this sale is only available until February 22 while supplies last. If you’d like to brush up on the Apple Watch and all of its glory before you decide to purchase one, head on over to our   of the smartwatch."

Alongside several interesting features, Lenovo will also be bundling its midrange device with a virtual reality (VR) headset. The Vibe K4 Note’s specifications look good on paper, with it sporting a 5.5-inch full-HD (1920×1080 pixels) IPS panel, which results in a pixel density of 401ppi. The display, which the company claims has a 1000:1 contrast ratio with adjustable colour balance, will be tucked under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC paired with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. For optics, the device will see a 13MP rear shooter with PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) and a fast f/2.2 aperture. Helping the device out with low-light shots is a two-tone LED flash to the right of the camera module. For selfies, the phone unsurprisingly sports a 5MP front-facing camera. What is surprising is the fact that the device will feature a pair of front-facing stereo Dolby Atmos speakers, something that’s missing even on most flagship devices. What’s more, this mid-range device also sports a fingerprint scanner mounted at the back just below the primary camera (my personal favourite location), something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market. Powering everything will be a quick charge enabled 3,300 mAh battery that is supposed to deliver 265 hours of 3G standby time and 22 hours of 3G talk time. The device also comes with dual-SIM support, both of which have support for 4G LTE. The device will run Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovo’s Vibe UI skin on top, though we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update in the near future. The reason they bundled the smartphone with a VR headset is so that users can take advantage of Lenovo’s TheaterMax technology which converts regular content into immersive VR content. While we don’t know how “immersive” TheaterMax will end up being, Lenovo seems pretty confident in it, leaving the final judgement to time itself. Lenovo’s mid-ranger will go on a flash sale on Amazon India on January 19 at INR11,999 (around RM783) for just the device, while the VR bundle will cost INR13,299 (around RM868). Note that for the first few flash sales, the device will only be sold in the VR bundle, but priced at a discounted INR12,499 (around RM816). No information on whether this device will make it to Malaysia is present at the time of this article’s writing. It is important to point out that the predecessor, the Note K3, is   at RM599."

In the past, Samsung has limited its Gear smartwatches exclusively to Galaxy devices but recognising the need to go mass, they have finally opened up the Gear S2 to work with most Android smartphones. The Gear S2 is their first round smartwatch and it stands out with its rotating bezel that we feel is more intuitive to use than the digital crown on the Apple Watch. The Gear S2 is currently priced at RM1,399 while its Classic version is going for RM1,599. As a comparison, the Apple Watch is priced officially from RM1,599 and that’s for the base aluminium model with a smaller 38mm size.

Up front, the tablet will have a 12-inch FHD+ (2160×1440 pixels) sAMOLED display — the first Windows 10 tablet to have a Super AMOLED screen. On the inside, this massive tablet will be powered by a dual-core Intel Core M processor, clocked at 2.2GHz. paired with 4GB of RAM and either a 128GB or 256GB SSD.

For video, the cameras will support recording up to an FHD resolution (1920×1080). Powering the components will be a 5,200 mAh battery that Samsung says can last up to 10 hours, and because the tablet sports a USB Type-C port, it will also have fast charging allowing you to top the device up in about 2.5 hours. Since 2-in-1 devices are all the rage right now, the Galaxy TabPro S will come with a keyboard (not sold separately) that looks very much like the old   Type Cover.

Of course, there are many that frown upon its compromises. It was their first flagship to not have a removable battery and most critical of all, it lacks an expandable microSD slot. If you were disappointed by the Galaxy S6, there’s a lot to look forward to on the upcoming model. According to @evleaks, the new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will finally offer a microSD slot. Like the current S6, both models will be offered with either 32GB and 64GB storage options, which in Malaysia we are likely to receive the smallest option of just 32GB. This would be good news for those taking loads of pictures and 4K videos as the device is alleged to support microSD cards up to 200GB. This reaffirms an earlier “ ” that Samsung is finally bringing back the microSD slot to its latest flagship. With each new model, the Galaxy S lineup has always seen an increase of battery capacities. However on the Galaxy S6, it was downsized from 2,800mAh on the Galaxy S5 to just 2,550mAh (2,600mAh on the S6 edge). Fortunately, the new processor and energy efficient   were good at maximising every mAh of power. The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are alleged to receive 3,000mAh and 3,600mAh capacity batteries respectively, which is a huge jump. That’s like fitting a Galaxy Note battery into a smaller device, and hopefully this could translate to more than 24 hours of usage. Wireless Charging will still be the star of the show and Samsung will likely to support fast wireless charging for the new flagship duo as it did with the Galaxy Note5. Charging an S7 is reported to take about 2 hours wirelessly while the S7 edge will take slightly longer at 2.2 hours. First introduced on the Galaxy S5, the S7 is said to be getting water and dust resistance with an IP67 rating. This is similar with the Galaxy S5 which in theory can be submerged up to 1 metre for up to 30 minutes. Even if you don’t go to the pool, having water resistance is a good feature to have especially for those unexpected moments. Even word has it that the folks at Cupertino   to make its upcoming iPhone waterproof. If Samsung is doing it, it better be a cap-less design without those clumsy flap covers. The Galaxy S7/S7 edge will be running on their latest Exynos 8890 processor but there will be a Qualcomm-powered version for selected markets that runs on a Snapdragon 820 processor. Expect them to come with 4GB of RAM and has support for faster Cat 9 4G LTE. In terms of screen size, the standard S7 is likely to retain the same compact 5.1″ Quad HD display while the S7 edge is rumoured to be either a larger 5.5 or 5.7 incher. To have a 5.7″ smartphone at this time of the year   as it would cannibalise its own S6 edge+ that was launched not too long ago. Camera wise, the new flagships will get a smaller pixel count of 12MP instead of its current 16MP shooter. However, it is compensated with faster f/1.7 lens versus f/1.9 for better low-light performance. With a smaller BRITECELL camera module, the new S7 could have a flat and flush back design without the protruding camera hump. Are you excited now? MWC 2016 is happening on 22nd February 2016 and Samsung would normally announce their latest Galaxy S model a day earlier."

Unless you’re me, then that all changes depending on how many times I hit the snooze button. Facebook could probably be your favourite social media platform. Heck, you’re probably reading this article because it popped up on your Facebook feed. Now, what if I told you that your favourite social media platform was secretly experimenting on you? According to a report by The Verge, it appears that Facebook had secretly experimented on its Android mobile users, crashing their apps intentionally, “selectively disconnecting” them from their Facebook applications for hours on end. Why? Well, apparently it was done to prepare for the possibility of     for competitive reasons. They wanted to prepare for a future where users might have to resort to downloading the Facebook application from a source outside of the Google  . Despite the fact that Facebook is one of the Play Store’s biggest application developers, there is a looming threat that the social network could bypass Google’s services altogether. The tests were allegedly conducted to see how far they could go to get Android users to abandon their platform altogether. The results? “People never stopped coming back.” According to a person familiar with the tests, those who were locked out of their application defaulted to the mobile web browser version of Facebook, rather than abandoning the application. Are you surprised? We weren’t. Right now, there is simply no alternative to Facebook and what the social media platform offers, so it seems only natural that users would find any means possible to access the site. The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back. The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back. Although this was supposedly a one-time experiment conducted years ago, this isn’t the first social experiment Facebook undertook. Yes, we’re talking about the controversy in 2014 where Facebook altered the content on users’ News Feeds to see if it would change their moods. Information surfaced last year that Facebook bombarded several users’ News Feeds with sad and depressing content to see if they were less likely to visit the site if it made them sad. The experiment was so controversial that even the editor behind the study was “ “, questioning if the results of the study were actually worth all the backlash. What most people don’t realise — or choose to turn a blind eye on — is that social experimenting on the Internet is nothing new. Pretty much every website has done it to some extent. The question then becomes whether you know you’re being experimented on or not. Perhaps what makes what Facebook did so painful was that it felt personal on some level because these were people’s personal feeds. Privacy settings exist for a reason right?

First up is a glorious fixed-wing UAV from Parrot, the very same people who brought you the Bebop 2 — a powerful little quadcopter drone that is allegedly windproof up to 40mph (that’s about 64 kph). With the Disco, Parrot are looking to shake their lineup up with this foam-plastic fixed-wing drone that has automated takeoff and landing. That means you can just toss it in the air and the drone will start flying though it does need a little bit of room to get it climbing. The Disco, with it’s single propeller and detachable wings, can hit speeds of up to 50mph (around 80kph) and stay flying for about 45 minutes on a single charge. There is also an ultrasound camera mounted at the bottom of the drone that helps it land autonomously. Well, more like crash autonomously if we’re looking at the teaser footage. Like the Bebop 2, you can control the Disco with Parrot’s Skycontroller or plot a flight plan and have the drone do the flying itself. The drone also has a “return home” function that does exactly what the name suggests. Mounted at the front is the same eye-like 14-megapixel fisheye lens camera Parrot mounts on the Bebop 2, so it will likely feature the same digital panning and stability options as well. While ditching the quadcopter design lets you fly more realistically (especially with FPV goggles), there will inevitably be drawbacks. The drone, for example, loses its ability to hover and takeoff vertically, making it less ideal for filming. It will also inevitably be less stable and manoeuvrable than a quadcopter. Upside? Y0u can fly, turn and pitch like an actual plane. COOL. Despite their claims, The Verge points out that Parrot aren’t the first to introduce a ready-to-fly fixed-wing drone as there are already several small fixed-wing drones in the market. Though we do think the Disco is one of the best looking fixed-wing drones out there. Or almost out there, since it’s still a prototype. Parrot does plan to make this available to consumers within this year so that’s something to look forward to."

This year, the participating parties are offering a USD100,000 (RM434,000) grand prize to the team that can build the best application for launching a drone from a moving vehicle as part of a search-and-rescue mission. Although we’ve seen drones being launched for rescue missions in the past, none of them have been launched from a car in motion. This is an issue because the conditions of a disaster are never the same, often needing the rescue team to stay on the move to avoid getting caught up in it themselves. So, the participants are tasked with launching and landing a drone from the bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck. Here’s the full timeline of the DJI SDK Developer Challenge: In certain parts of the world, drones bring about more fear than anything else, though it’s amazing to see that there are (obvious) pros in utilising them for aid drop-offs and search-and-rescue missions; lessening the risk of rescuers by putting drones out there instead. And let’s not forget the use of these drones by photojournalist worldwide, capturing civil unrest in states observing media lockdowns. Besides holding competitions to save the world, DJI has also updated their existing Phantom and Inspire drone series. While DJI’s uber cool Inspire 1 gets a minor colour update (it now comes in black), they’ve added a 4K camera to the Phantom 3, a feature only available on the Phantom 3 Professional in the past."

While there have been rumours going around about a potential Samsung Galaxy S7+, SamMobile believes that this will likely be the S7 edge instead. We highly doubt Samsung would cannibalise their popular recent flagship and risk their consumers getting pissed at them, just so they can be “radical”. It’s very unlikely that they would  . Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, the picture also reveals another interesting specification: The camera module. According to the picture, the S7 (or S7 edge or S7+) looks to feature a 12.2-megapixel rear camera coupled with a 5-megapixel front shooter. What’s interesting is the drastic drop in megapixel count for the rear camera, down from 16MP, in a 2016 device. This is in-line with an earlier rumour that the device would sport a 12MP large pixel sensor, though it doesn’t match Samsung’s  . At their Investor’s Forum last year, Samsung unveiled the BRITECELL camera technology, which utilises tiny one micron pixels which are “the smallest pixel for slim smartphone”. If Samsung were to use these small pixels and also drop pixel count, then they would really have to have something up their sleeve to help the sensor cope with low-light photography. The image also reveals that the device will have a Snapdragon 820 processor with an Adreno 530 GPU mated with 4GB of RAM, which is, unsurprising. In any case, these are only rumours and Samsung could just be pulling a fast one, using multiple prototypes to mislead leaksters.

People simply spend too much time on it, causing them to ignore their loved ones, peers and — like this woman found out the hard way — can even lead to death.   Wang, a 28-year-old woman from Wenzhou, located in China’s Zhejiang province fell into a river and drowned after she missed her step because she was too preoccupied with her phone. Wang, who was a migrant worker and mother of two was walking in the middle of the road before the incident. However, as she was too preoccupied with her device, she didn’t notice when she gradually began walking towards the edge of the water. Online surveillance footage shows Wang struggling for over a minute before she disappeared from the surface of the water. Her body was discovered after her husband Yang spotted her shoe floating on the river when he went looking for her the next morning. Although the river was only chest-deep, the sludge at the riverbed can cause people to slip and fall. This incident has served as a wake-up call to the Chinese public as netizens took to the social media, calling for people to exercise caution when using phones. We’d like to say that this is the first tragedy caused by phubbing (snubbing someone in favour of your smartphone), but that just isn’t the case. It used to be “don’t drive and text”, now it needs to also be “don’t walk and use your phone”. You might think, “oh that’s not me, I only use it at the dinner table!”. What people don’t realise is that everything starts somewhere. Using them initially to avoid socially awkward situations can often lead to a reliance on the device and we all know where that leads. An Ohio State University researcher discovered that the number of pedestrian deaths has dramatically increased over the past few years and many of which were caused by telephone distractions.

Well, thank goodness for crowd-funding because now we have the next best thing: Modular smartphone cases. 
 The thing that makes the idea of a modular device, be it a smartphone,  , or, in this case, a smartcase, so brilliant is that it is completely customisable. For the first time the users themselves can decide exactly what they want or don’t want to have on their device. Fancy a good camera? Get a powerful camera module. Need more juice to last you an entire day? Get a battery module. Want a chainsaw to go jungle trekking? Get a…err well, I don’t think there’s a module for that yet but I’m sure you can see my point. Initially, people thought that a modular smartphone was the way to go, so companies like   poured their resources into developing a modular smartphone, but it obviously that    . Then, along came the people who founded nexpaq, a small group of talented individuals who wanted to bring the modular concept into the world on a much smaller scale:  . It’s something everyone uses, it’s something almost everyone needs and — perhaps most importantly — something far more accessible to the general public. Despite claiming to be cheaper than the smartphones we know and readily purchase today, purchasing a modular smartphone was always going to be a big investment. However, with a case like nexpaq’s, a   that includes a case and four modules would only set you back USD169 (around RM728). The best part? The folks at nexpaq are enlisting the help of the community to develop their modular smartphone case, releasing developer kits for both the modules and its accompanying software. Now, more are following suit, with the latest one coming from a company called i-Blades who have put up their version of the modular smartphone case, the i-Blades Smartcase. The i-Blades Smartcase is currently on Indiegogo looking for funding and the best part about it is that their modules can apparently stack infinitely. Your device would look like it has one of Apple’s  Cases though, but I digress. If you’re interested, head on over to their   and check it out.

Rory Lee,Apple gets sued for rolling out iOS 9,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/30/iphone-4s-users-sue-apple-for-ios-9/,"apple,Apple iPhone 4s,apple sued,apple users sue apple,class action lawsuit,iOS,iOS 9,iPhone 4S","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-30,"They say a king is nothing without his people. A tree, nothing, without its roots. A product, nothing, without its consumers. So what happens when a smartphone manufacturer gets slapped with a class action lawsuit filed by the very people who used to preach their excellence? Draaaama! More than a hundred infuriated   owners have filed a lawsuit against  , claiming USD5 million (around RM21.5 million) in damages, accusing them of significantly slowing down their devices with the new   9 update. The lawsuit was filed with a New York district court, though no hearings have been set at this time. According to plaintiff Chiam Lerman and several others, the new update slowed the device down so much that it interfered with day-to-day usage. It seems that after upgrading, both first and third-party applications exhibited delayed launch times, slow response to touchscreen input and other problems. Overall performance was also affected by freezes and crash events. They also accuse Apple of engaging in deceptive trade practices and false advertising by proclaiming that the update is compatible with legacy smartphones dating back to the iPhone 4s models. The lawsuit also claims that Apple were well aware of iOS 9’s negative impacts on the iPhone 4s but went ahead with the marketing campaign anyway. The campaign advertised faster performance, enhanced security, longer battery life among other enticing features. To make matters worse, the company’s advertisements, website, and iOS page did not have any warning of potential compatibility issues for older devices. Apparently the complaint went after Apple’s iOS system itself, because when faced with a sluggish and slow device, it is more likely that the average Apple user would upgrade to a new iOS product instead of branching out. The reason being that transferring information across devices within the same ecosystem is much easier. Plus there is also the familiarity factor. It isn’t too surprising that a new iOS update would slow down older devices because each new update is designed to take advantage of the hardware from the recent models. This includes a host of new features and improvements that an older device may not have even dreamt was possible, much less have support for it. Apple has been in this situation before, back in 2011, where plaintiffs complained that iOS 4 turned their iPhone 3G into “iBricks”. That case was tossed out a year later and it seems likely that this lawsuit will suffer the same fate. One of the main arguments in the iOS vs Android war was that Apple always pushed new updates, even to old devices such as the iPhone 4s while Android devices have a realistic lifespan of 2 years. After 2 years, it is very unlikely that your Android device would be getting any updates from its manufacturer. Apple fans argued that this was because Android was so fragmented, with so many different manufacturers making so many different versions of the Android OS. iOS isn’t the same because everything was unified under one banner. That said, there is an exception to this   dilemma: The   devices. Nexus smartphones tend to receive OS updates much quicker and for longer than most other devices. But unlike what’s happening to these unfortunate iPhone 4s users, each Android update usually improves the performance of older devices due to improved optimisation of the OS. This brings Apple users to what looks like a difficult decision. Do you update your OS to get new features and better security at the risk of sluggish performance? Or do you stick to what already works and brave potential security risks? Let us know in the comments below. If you’re as frustrated as these users and think Apple does this on purpose so that people will be forced to buy a new iPhone, don’t hesitate to drop your opinion in the comment box too!"

Alexander Wong,This might be the best alternative to KLIA Express,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/30/here-is-a-cheaper-way-to-go-to-klia/,"Car Sharing,Comos,electric car,KLIA,KLIA Express,KLIA Express Alternative,Renault Zoe,Ride Sharing,Uber,Uber Malaysia","Cool stuff,Others",2015-12-30,"If you’re a frequent traveler,   is the best way to get to Kuala Lumpur International Airport in under 30 minutes. With everything going up, the fares will be   to RM55/way effective 1st January 2016. That’s a hefty RM110 for two people heading to the airport.  Is there a cheaper alternative? What if we tell you there’s another way of getting there with zero emission and it costs less than an   ride? COMOS, a ride-sharing provider that uses 100% electric vehicles has introduced an Airport Valet Service. For a flat rate of RM70, you can head to KLIA or KLIA2 in an electric-powered  . The service comes with a designated COMOS staff, so you can hop-on and hop-off without worrying about parking. Do note that the Renault Zoe is a compact hatchback, so the boot isn’t as spacious as a typical sedan car.  The COMOS Airport Valet service would cost you RM70 which is inclusive of GST, toll and delivery charges to your location. So that equates to RM35/person for a trip for two or RM23.34/person for 3 pax. On the downside, it is only available from 9:00AM to 4:00PM, and it covers just the following areas in the Klang Valley.  If you haven’t tried COMOS before, the first step of getting a key card would take a while. You would need to   for a membership which now costs RM50 for 1 year (Normal: RM300). Once that’s done, you can collect your COMOS card and start booking as follows: You are advised to request the service at least 2 hours ahead of the intended time and it is subject to actual availability of cars. You may book for the next day but the option is only available after 10:00PM. This is a cashless service and the final amount will be charged to your registered credit card. You can read up more about the service  . COMOS was introduced as an alternative means to car ownership. Being a ride-sharing service, you only pay for membership and usage fees according to your usage. At the moment, the rental costs RM6 for 15 minutes with a minimum booking of 30 minutes (RM12). For an all day usage, it will cost you a flat rate of RM144.  With its fleet of electric cars, there’s no fuel cost involved so you won’t need to return the car with a full tank. There are several COMOS pick up stations located around PJ and KL with more being planned out in the near future. Currently all bookings are done via its website on   and soon they will be releasing a mobile app for iOS and Android. We’ve tried COMOS a couple of times and it is quite an experience driving a quiet vehicle that hums like a spaceship. Since it’s new, the number of stations with charging points are quite limited. It isn’t really that cost efficient for simple point to point trips since you’re required to return the vehicle to its limited pickup/drop off points.  If you’re making a stop, you would still need to pay for parking, which defeats the purpose of saving time and money. This would probably make more sense once they have more stations around strategic points including shopping malls and office complexes.  If COMOS isn’t viable due to timing and location, Uber is   a flat rate of RM75 (excluding tolls) to KLIA/KLIA2. There’s no promo code required, and you can request anytime from now until 5th January 2016. Uber is available on  ,   and  . If you’re traveling alone, KLIA Express is still the cheaper option overall. Despite the RM55/way announcement, there are additional discounts if you book return tickets and purchasing them online or using specific credit cards. At the moment,   are entitled to a 20% discount. A return KLIA Express ticket cost RM100 and it will cost you just RM80 which is equivalent to RM40 per way. That’s basically RM5 more than usual RM35/way price."
Rory Lee,Mobile data in Malaysia is more affordable than you think,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/31/mobile-data-in-malaysia-is-more-affordable-than-you-think/,"internet data price,internet price,Malaysia,Malaysia Broadband Price,malaysia data price,malaysia internet price,malaysia mobile data price,mobile data,mobile data price,mobile data price malaysia","Industry in General,Players on the Field",2015-12-31,"If you’re frustrated with how expensive your data plan is, or if you feel cheated by some mobile operators who   but limits usage to certain times of the day, we understand your pain. If you’ve been envying our neighbours in Indonesia, who are paying nearly half of what we pay for 1GB of data, we feel you too. But, if you’re thinking of creating a blog to hate on our mobile carriers, citing examples of how much cheaper data is in our neighbouring countries, you might want to reconsider. This is because based on data collected by website  , we actually have more affordable data — on average, per 1GB — than most countries in Southeast Asia. In their study, Tech In Asia compiled data from all the Southeast Asian countries and calculated what the typical price of 1GB (in USD) of data was. Then, they looked up the minimum wage of each country, (picking the typical wage of a low-income worker in Brunei, Singapore and Cambodia because they didn’t have an official minimum wage) comparing it with the respective data costs. Finally, they used that data to estimate how many hours a worker would have to work to be able to afford 1GB of data and arranged the countries according to scale in a nifty infographic. The results of their study are as follows: From the data, Malaysia is actually doing quite well, finishing within the top 5 of all the countries in SEA for the most affordable data, despite the fact that we’re paying nearly USD1.60 (RM6.88) more than Indonesia and almost USD1 (RM4.30) higher than Vietnam and Myanmar for 1GB of data. Thanks to our higher minimum wage, a Malaysian minimum wage worker would only have to put in 3 hours and 45 minutes of hard work to enjoy 1GB of data. We’re still far off from Brunei though, who leads the pack at only 1 hour and 4 minutes of work needed for 1GB of data, despite their data costing USD2.67 (RM11.48) more than Malaysia. The power of a higher income nation eh? Another interesting bit of information is how incredibly low the price of mobile data in Cambodia is, coming in at a cool USD1.50/GB (RM6.45), sliding them into third place right behind Singapore despite their minimum wage being only USD0.66 (RM2.84) per hour. There is only one cause for concern: The accuracy of this data. Let’s take Malaysia for example. Based on the infographic, we average USD4.42 per 1GB of data, which is roughly equivalent to RM19/GB. Are our plans that expensive? Let’s take a look at the current prepaid data plans being offered by our Telcos: 
 Across these 18 different plans, the average (mean) cost of 1GB of data in Malaysia is RM18.68, which is pretty close to the average in the data set. Keep in mind the lower average value is likely because of the promotions that are currently active. Hashtag legit information (as far as Malaysia is concerned anyway). It’s no secret that we’ve arrived at an era where everyone is obsessed with staying connected. In the past, only moderately large F&B chains offer free WiFi to their customers, but now even mamak shops have “FREE WIFI” signs pasted in and around their establishment. Why? Well, smartphones are getting more and more accessible for the masses and we all know that unless we keep our phones connected to the Internet, they’re little more than 180g bricks. But, we can’t always rely on WiFi to stay connected. What if we’re on the train? Or in a cab? I mean, we can’t just NOT send that tweet or NOT check if our new Instagram picture broke the 11-like barrier right? That would be  . As the citizens flailed about in a chaotic mess, crying out for a saviour, our local telcos came riding in on white stallions offering data plans like food to the hungry. Those who could afford it rejoiced while others griped about how expensive it was compared to our neighbouring countries — some of which could be considered less developed than we are. The problem with that is when you argue “affordability” based purely on how much a plan costs, you’re leaving other crucial factors like income, development, penetration and even freedom of Internet, out of the equation. That’s like arguing who’s the best badminton player based purely on how fast their smashes are. It seems that the folks over at Tech In Asia have had enough of this nonsense and thanks to them, we now have a better understanding (hopefully) of what affordability really means. That said, this chart doesn’t appear to differentiate between connection speeds (4G LTE, 3G, 2G, etc) so that could be another factor affecting cost.  could also be another reason for the difference in cost. We’d much rather pay a little more for a wider and more stable data connection. What do you think of this infographic? Should carriers focus more on reducing cost or improving coverage and stability? Let us know in the comments below. Thanks to   for the tip!"

Using a mobile app, Uber lets you request for a clean and reliable ride, which is like a breath of fresh air in cities with failed taxi services.  The one billionth trip was taken in London on a Honda Insight Hybrid. To celebrate the occasion, the lucky rider is receiving a year’s worth of Uber rides, while the driver will be getting a well deserved holiday at a Uber city of his choice. Not bad for a short trip that only costs £5 (about RM32). To top it off, Uber is also making a charitable donation to an organisation at the neighbourhood where ride had started.  Despite its political and regulatory hurdles, Uber has been growing quite rapidly covering hundreds of cities in 68 countries worldwide. It is said that they are currently doing 3 million trips a day which is substantially more than its competitor, Lyft. While they are doing well in most markets, Uber is also facing bans and suspension by some local authority such as Spain and Germany.  Fortunately, it is still business as usual in Malaysia as it still operates in Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru. Despite protests by taxi drivers, SPAD (Land Transport Authority) has yet to   for these new “ride-sharing” services. For riders, it is a better alternative to taxis without the hassle of haggling. At the same time, driving with Uber is an opportunity to make extra income which is more critical with the rising cost of living.

Already it is cheaper than most taxis and in some markets, it could be  . Whatever regulation SPAD plans to enforce, we hope it would be beneficial to both consumers and the industry.

The sad thing is that this is the same for most things, including smartphones. If you’re a smartphone buyer, odds are you have bought more than one device. The only problem is, what do you do with your old phone when your new one arrives? Do you toss it out? Give it to a niece/nephew/child (let’s be real they probably have better phones than your old   anyway)? Try to sell it to on a certain popular local forum filled with lowballers? Well,   now has a new option for you. Vmall Malaysia is currently conducting a BETA test for their “Trade-in & Go Green With Honor!” programme, in collaboration with LTG Technologies, where — yep you guessed it — you can trade in your old devices and be compensated for it. You won’t be getting money, though. Instead, you’ll be getting a Vmall code which you can then use to redeem a Vmall voucher which you can use to purchase any device on the website. To put it in simpler terms: At this moment, the number of devices per manufacturer, with the exception being   and  , is rather limited. Hopefully, they will add support for more devices further down the line. If your trade-in value is RM40 or higher, LTG will arrange for a pickup at your specified address free of charge. Once LTG receives your products, they will evaluate and see if your devices are worth the quoted amount. If they sign off on it, you will receive a Vmall voucher code of equal value to that of your devices. If they don’t, they will inform you of the new value of your device, allowing you to decide whether or not you want to take the offer. If you don’t respond within 3 days, they will automatically assume you accept the revised offer. The best thing about this programme is that you can register any amount of smartphones, from old and functioning to broken phones (yes they accept broken phones if it is within their criteria). However, remember to register all your devices at one go so that you receive a single code for a single voucher. Not only will this help you hit that RM40 free delivery sweet spot, it will also help when you make purchases on Vmall, because you can only use one voucher per purchase. Keep in mind that this programme is only in BETA but it is expected to go live sometime early next year. If you’ve had your eye on an honor or Huawei device, this seems like a pretty decent incentive to go and get one."
Arif Lee,The four-way 4K video battle,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/29/nexus-6p-4k-camera-comparison-galaxy-note5-xperia-z5-iphone-6s-plus/,,,2015-12-29,"You asked for a video comparison and here you have it. We put these four heavyweights in the camera department to the 4K video recording test. And while we understand that most people out there won’t have the technology to view 4K content, we decided that choosing the highest recording resolution for all four devices would be the fairest gauge.   Duking it out will be: A slow but steady advancement of camera technology has us finding that most flagship smartphones are now capable of being the only device we’d use to take images and video, rendering point and shoots somewhat obsolete. Easily put – the best camera you’ll have is the one in your pocket. How you use that technology will be dictated by the photography skills you’ve honed throughout your “journey”, if there’s one to begin with. That said, a professional photographer could definitely take better photos than someone that has little/no knowledge on the matter. Of course, when using a smartphone, you don’t necessarily have to be knowledgeable in photography to begin with but have you seen those campaigns dedicated to showing off what these smartphone cameras are capable of? Apple has been running a   to show-off what the iPhones can do. Other smartphone makers didn’t bother following suit but you can check out their imaging and video capabilities through a quick search. When 4K video recording hit the scene back in 2013, we thought capturing content at that resolution was crazy; more so, when you’re viewing it on screens that hover around 5-inches. But we’re not here to argue about whether Full HD or Quad HD screens are sufficient when it comes to actually viewing the content on them. We’re here to see how 4 smartphones perform when tasked to handle the rough and bumpy Malaysian roads that often surprise you with a new pothole or two with every passing day – obviously, OIS would be important here. The following are a breakdown of the 4 respective specs: All four devices had some form of image/video stabilisation; the Nexus 6P uses software based technology, shared also by the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual which uses its own software-based two-stage SteadyShot stabilisation.

Perhaps Microsoft simply doesn’t know how to make good flagship mobile devices, but that’s a tough claim to make considering not many are having a go at it. Until now. Early this month, a fancy new Windows Phone dubbed the   Falcon was  . What caught everyone’s eye was the dragon it had beating at the heart of the device; a   to be specific. It was the first Windows Phone device to have been spotted with  ‘s latest baby in the driver’s seat. What’s more, the GFXBench entry also indicated that the device would feature a large 5.8″ 2560×1440 pixel panel with a 20-megapixel primary camera and a 12MP front-facing selfie camera. Mmm, yummy specs. There were some oddities, however, as memory was only listed at 1GB of RAM with a peculiar 43GB of internal storage. Then again, it isn’t uncommon for manufacturers to configure the device differently when running benchmarks. In any case, it looks like there could be a monstrous Windows Phone (likely running Windows 10 Mobile) set to be released sometime next year. In fact, a new report out of   claims that the device could see an official unveiling at the upcoming   (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona next February. However, the report also notes that HP has yet to give the project the final go-ahead. With specs that exceed even Microsoft’s own Windows flagship devices (plus it could be cheaper), could this be the Windows Phone messiah fans have been waiting for? We doubt it. Especially if Windows 10 Mobile doesn’t receive the updates it needs in time. Though we haven’t spent time with the Lumia flagships, reports and reviews point to a worrying trend of incomplete (plus buggy) software, similar to that on the Surface line of 2-in-1 devices. Reviewers have noted some minor problems such as 4K video recording not working properly to big problems like the home screen disappearing entirely after an app crashes — something that happens quite often apparently — which shouldn’t happen in a completed product. If these problems lie with Windows 10 Mobile, then all the hardware in the world won’t be able to save the experience. It is admirable that it seems like HP wants to show Microsoft how to really build a Windows 10 Mobile flagship, but unless Redmond steps up its own game, the new device will likely not amount to anything. What a shame that would be."

Can you confidently tell how far apart one building is from the next and navigate it without a proper scale? What about those little parts that are obscured by a building or a shadow? Can you tell what’s hidden there? Now imagine all of that detail compressed into the body of a baby girl and you’ve only begun to scrape the surface of how difficult surgeon Dr Redmond Burke’s operation was. Teegan Lexcen, a 4-month-old baby was admitted into the Niklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami, Florida because she was born with a misplaced heart. Without surgery, she would be dead by Christmas. The worst part? Doctors couldn’t see a way in to operate. I don’t think I need to tell you how delicate heart surgery is, or how difficult it can be. It becomes nigh impossible when you don’t have all the information you need. Burke says that surgeons need to be able to visualise the entire procedure before they step into the operating room, which is why many surgical teams passed on Teegan’s operation because they kept running into walls during this process: It seemed inoperable. Burke had the same problem as he had no way of knowing if a standard incision over the sternum would be enough, but “inoperable” was not a word he enjoyed using. Exhausting medical solutions, the team began looking for creative solutions and one particularly enterprising member uploaded the scans of Teegan’s chest to  , converting them into 3D stereoscopic imagines, which allowed them to view it in VR. Virtual Reality. That was the answer. Burke said that with   and a smartphone he was able to see the patient’s entire heart by simply tilting his head. He could turn it and manipulate it as if he was already in the operating room. From there, Burke could see Teegan’s heart as well as her chest wall and with that information, he knew that a standard incision would indeed be fine. According to Burke, this solution came just in the nick of time; any longer and her kidneys may have suffered too much from her being put under. She would be alive, but on dialysis for the rest of her days. We’re floored that a little bit of cardboard and a smartphone actually saved someone’s life. That and good old fashioned human ingenuity of course. Burke views every operation as possible and it was down to whether the doctor had the confidence to perform it or not. With VR he could visualise the steps in his head and help him come up with a plan of operation for his team which allowed him to save his patient. Seven hours later, little Teegan was all patched up and ready for Christmas and ho, ho, ho-pefully for many more Christmases to come."

It offers a decent 4.7″ HD 720p screen, dual-SIM slots and 4G LTE for under RM400. While the specs are impressive, the build quality is still quite plasticky, which is understandable for its low price tag.  Following the release of its metal-clad  , Xiaomi appears to be taking the same premium route for its upcoming budget device. The phone you’re seeing here has just appeared on China’s TENNA certification and it is believed to be the new Redmi 3. It gets an all metal back like its larger Redmi Note 3 but without a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Being a unibody design, the back cover doesn’t seem to be removable, which means you can’t replace the battery on your own. According to its purported spec-sheet, there will be a microSD expansion, which is likely to be housed on the SIM tray slot.  The Redmi 3 is said to be having a slightly larger 5″ HD 720p display and it is expected to run on a higher 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM. On-board storage is listed at 16GB and it also comes with a standard 13MP + 5MP camera combination. This is quite a huge step up, pushing the Redmi into the mid-range category, even if this was an “enhanced version”.  With better specs and premium materials, we are curious if Xiaomi could maintain its affordable 699CNY (RM463) price tag as the Redmi 2. It is likely to priced higher but it shouldn’t exceed its bigger Redmi Note 3 that starts from 899 CNY (about RM595)."

And we mean big feature. As our demands for smartphone performance and portability grows, manufacturers have often skimmed on battery life to ensure that their device stays as lean and mean as possible. But that means they hardly ever last a day, much less two days. Carrying a power bank or a charger has become a norm in our society. Acer has good news for those who want raw, unadulterated battery power, because their   smartphone comes with an enormous 4,000 mAh replaceable battery. With a battery this size it becomes very unlikely that you will need to carry a powerbank around, much less another battery. In fact, that massive battery supports USB OTG (on-the-go) charging so you can even help a friend out by giving them a quick top-up if their device is running low on battery. Mighty handy in a pinch and for RM659, this is one of the most affordable and good valued devices with a 4,000 mAh battery that supports OTG charging in Malaysia. This is because the device itself does boast pretty decent specs, with a quad-core MediaTek processor clocked at 1.3GHz paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. This should ensure that everyday tasks and light to moderate application multitasking will go on without a hitch. It also has a 5.5-inch HD IPS panel and an 8-megapixel front and rear camera combo. 8-megapixels is quite a lot for a front facing camera, especially in this device’s price bracket. Even some flagship devices only rock a 5MP sensor. More megapixels mean that your selfies will be much more detailed and less pixelated. If you don’t fancy such a big device, or you simply feel that you don’t need all that battery power, Acer does offer a smaller device with a 5” HD IPS display, the Acer  . The name suggests that this smartphone would be a downgrade from the the Liquid Z630, but it also shares its bigger brother’s internal hardware as well as camera optics. That’s a pretty good deal for RM559. Acer also has an entry level device in the Liquid Z line, the Liquid  , priced at RM439. It comes bundled with a 1.1GHz Snapdragon 210 quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM running underneath its 4.5” screen. That should be more than enough for you to get a feel of what the Android experience is all about, making this device the perfect starter smartphone for anyone. All three devices will have blazingly fast dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity and will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Acer’s Liquid UI running over it. Additionally, these devices will have the Acer Float Apps which essentially allows users to open more than one application and multitask at the same time. Acer also bundles a Float Caller which appears as a mini popup when a call comes in, letting the user decide how to respond without interrupting what they’re doing. Every one of the trio will also have what Acer calls the Quick Mode. The Quick Mode functions to allow users to pick between three customised layout options: Standard Mode (for those familiar with smartphones), Easy Mode (for those just starting out), and Basic Mode (locks down application and usage for kids). There is also a Kids Center application which grants parental control over the device for a safer browsing, viewing and playing environment for your child. These devices also come with Acer’s Bluelightshield which reduces strain on the eyes by reducing the amount of blue light emissions from the display."

Rory Lee,What if your car could see?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/23/what-if-your-car-could-see/,"autonomous cars,SegNet,self-driving cars",Cool stuff,2015-12-23,"Autonomous cars are the next big thing. Well, it’s actually the current-to-next big thing, but we digress. The point is that people are apparently bored of driving cars and want systems and programs to drive them around everywhere so that they can sit in the back seat and pretend to be Donald Trump. The only problem with self-driving cars is that they aren’t able to function properly in the real world as you simply can’t replace human instinct and reaction when things on the road get challenging. Why? Because cars can’t see in real time the way we do, so it makes it very difficult to make split second decisions when that double parked car pulls out suddenly. Apparently, now they can. 
 Thanks to SegNet, a new system created by the University of Cambridge, your dreams of being driven around by software might just come into fruition. SegNet can “read” the road in front if it, allowing it to differentiate various elements like the sky, other cars, road markings and even people. SegNet “sees” the road in an RGB image and then classifies different layers and objects using a   of the scene. According to the release, the system can “take an image of a street scene it hasn’t seen before and classify it, sorting objects into 12 different categories in real time”. It can also apparently deal with light, shadow and night environments and currently labels more than 90% of pixels correctly. Unlike laser/radar-guided systems that require expensive base sensors which cost more than the car itself, SegNet has been “trained” by a group of Cambridge undergraduates who manually labelled every pixel in over 5,000 images. Once that was complete, the researchers proceeded to train the system for over 2 days, after which one of the students notes that it is surprisingly good at recognising things in an image. From our testing, we tend to agree. It does a remarkable job at differentiating between the 12 elements though there is quite a lot of polishing to do, especially at night. As this system is “trained” though, it can only get better over time as it sees more images and learns to recognise more elements. One of the biggest problems about driving around in Malaysia is that the lines are never where they should be. Add that to the fact that people double park like there is no tomorrow and that the roads have potholes the size of Canada, even human beings would have trouble navigating our treacherous streets, what more a software? With this though, there is the potential to train the system to recognise these little nuances that make up our little snowflake of a country. Given the right circumstances, the possibilities are quite endless. Although the researchers say that this is still far from being able to be implemented into autonomous cars, we could possibly see this in a domestic robot – like a robot vacuum cleaner – in the short term. From where we stand, trust in an autonomous car seems to be the biggest hurdle for people to overcome. Would you relinquish control of your car in a highway to a computer program developed by some bloke in a laboratory? If you want to test out this system for yourself, head on over to   and you can upload a picture of your own to be scanned by SegNet, or you can browse through the sample images they’ve uploaded."

That’s usually a buyer’s biggest criteria when looking for a smartphone.

It is these buyers that were ultimately disappointed when   launched the   because it had decidedly mediocre specs for a not-low-at-all asking price of USD400. In a world where smartphone manufacturers are churning out devices with incredible specs for an equally incredible low price, this is simply unacceptable.

Early leaks suggested that it could run the  , which reignited the fire within the hearts of many an HTC fan. However, as time progressed, the rumours changed and on paper it looked like the One X9  . Well, the device has finally come out from the shadows and at first glance, it definitely doesn’t look like the flagship device everyone was clamouring for. Then again, since this was launched this year, were we realistically expecting it to outperform the   especially since it doesn’t even bear the M badge? The One X9 sports a 5.5″ 1080p panel (though there doesn’t seem to be any information on whether it will be an AMOLED or IPS screen) which results in a pixel density of 401 ppi that HTC claims has a 170-degree viewing angle. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 processor and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of internal storage. Thankfully, HTC has included a microSD slot that allows expansion up to 2TB. It will also feature a reasonably large 3,000 mAh battery and support for dual-SIM. Optics-wise, the device sports a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with optical image stabilisation and 4K video recording, plus a 5MP f/2.8 front-facing shooter. It is likely that the device will come pre-loaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, much like the HTC One A9. Although the specs are nothing to shout about, the device does bring back HTC’s much-loved BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers, something that is missing from it’s smaller brother, the One A9. HTC also went further down “nostalgia alley”, bringing back their backlit capacitive keys, which is placed where the HTC logo usually goes. One aspect that will be missed is the absence of a fingerprint sensor, something that is available on the HTC One A9. Another serving of good news is that the metallic smartphone looks to retail at a lower price than the One A9, coming in at 2,399 Yuan, which translates to around RM1,598. Yes, if you did pick up on it, the retail price is in CNY which means that this device — as of now — has only been launched in China with no information about availability elsewhere. This device, it seems, represents HTC’s stab at trying to get a bigger cut of the affordable premium smartphone market by competing with other Chinese manufacturers on their home soil. If you think horsepower is the be all and end all of smartphones, then this HTC One X9 will look like another disappointing HTC “hero” device that could have been so much more. It isn’t the best value-for-money device out there, but is a device’s worth measured only by how well it does on benchmarks? Sure, 4GB of RAM looks good on paper, but can you realistically feel the difference between 4GB and 3GB of RAM? Fit and finish has always been one of HTC’s strongest selling points. That and their front-facing speakers, both of which can be found on One X9. It honestly doesn’t look too bad either — except for that slightly sketchy camera visor — and based on the company’s track record, they certainly know how to do metal unibodies. The device’s closest competitor would probably be the Sony Xperia M5 Dual, and based on build alone, we definitely prefer a metal finish to the Xperia M5 Dual’s fingerprint-magnet glass-plastic construction. With proper optimisation, these specs should get you through day-to-day usage without a hitch and for a frankly reasonable price tag, this doesn’t seem like that bad a deal for HTC fans. Yeah, sure, you won’t be able to brag about it to your friends but then again, there aren’t that many brag-worthy HTC devices to begin with. With HTC’s flagships only managing to stay afloat as well as the Titanic could, perhaps the midrange premium market is where they can reclaim some of their former glory."

Fortunately, the government will be offering GST rebates as announced during  . To address concerns, MCMC has published the full details ahead of its implementation on new year’s day  Beginning 1st January, a RM10 prepaid reload will be sold at RM10, while a RM30 prepaid reload is sold at RM30 just like the old days. So you’re getting a full ringgit to ringgit value without the extra 6% charge. The official FAQ also states that old top up tickets must be sold at the original price without the extra 6% charge. At the moment, several prepaid brands are   and rewards if you top up by 31st December. However with the new mechanism, the GST charge will kick in when you reload. So after activation of a RM10 top up, you’ll get RM9.43 airtime with RM0.57 (6%) being deducted for GST. To the regular consumer, it appears to have no difference since eventually you’re getting 6% less versus paying 6% more. This will be running from 1st January until 31st December 2016 and there’s no mention if it will be extended to the following year.  The good news, of course, there’s a full GST rebate on prepaid usage. This will be applicable only to Malaysian citizens based on the NRIC or police/army identification number during registration. According to MCMC, the 6% GST will be refunded within 24 hours. So if you’ve topped up RM10, you should be getting the earlier deducted RM0.57 back to your prepaid account. In a nutshell, Malaysians should be able to enjoy the full reload amount but provided that you’re registered. You are advised to check with your telco provider to ensure they have your correct details.  The GST rebate is only for prepaid users, so Malaysian postpaid users will still continue to incur the 6% charge in their monthly bills. All domestic use including phone calls, SMS, mobile services and data are GST chargeable. International roaming including data usage overseas are zero rated and non-Malaysian prepaid users are also eligible for a refund.  For more information, you can read up the full FAQ  ."

Before you get too excited, mind you that the actual mobile data is only 6GB and it gets an extra 4GB for weekend use (1GB per weekend).  The balance 30GB?

For the regular consumer, the custom interface adds more value and nifty features which  . Of course, there are others that will consider pre-installed software as unnecessary bloatware, and proclaim plain vanilla is the way to go. Whichever side you pick, let’s take a look at the Chinese manufacturers.  With Apple seen as a status symbol, most of these Chinese smartphone UI lacks an App Drawer. Yes, it can be simple for first timers but power users might find it cluttered or annoying when it comes to organising their home screens. Of course, another popularity with Chinese Android UI is the wide availability of themes that you can customise to your preference. So Xiaomi has their MIUI, while Huawei has their very own EMUI. On the current version, EMUI looks awfully similar to Xiaomi’s own interface from the flat icon design, to the minimalistic approach for its built-in apps such as phone dialer, alarm clock, stopwatch, toggle switches and even the menu page. Even the shutdown menu interface that’s displayed after long pressing the power button looks the same as well.  Just recently, images of OPPO’s new ColorOS 3.0 has surfaced, and it looks awfully familiar with both custom interfaces. The photos you’re seeing here is an   that runs on ColorOS 3.0.0_151216_Alpha. At first glance, it looks like another honor device if you didn’t notice the ColorOS and OPPO branding.  So far there’s no word of its release but it is likely to be running out of the box with their upcoming 2016 models. Disappointingly, it still runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop instead of the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow. At the rate these Chinese companies are going, they all might end up looking the same and the only difference is the exterior and the logo plastered at the back. What do you guys think? Do you fancy these app-drawerless interfaces or the mainstream offering from Samsung, HTC, ASUS and Sony?"

Customers have a choice of two Celcom  : the   and  , both of which are designed to give you more data when you need it most. As you can tell by the colour, both data plans are designed for different users. For the more casual user, the Celcom FIRST Blue offers a monthly quota of 6GB of internet for only RM45 a month. The quota is split between three categories, where users get to have 2GB of monthly Internet, 2GB of free Internet on weekends (500MB every weekend), as well as 2GB of complimentary Celcom WiFi. The Celcom FIRST Blue plan also gives its users a cool 50 minutes of talktime and 50 free SMSs to all networks. Meanwhile, designed with the heavy user in mind, the Celcom FIRST Gold plan takes it up a notch, offering an accumulative Internet quota of 12GB each month. The quota, much like the FIRST Blue, will be split three ways which amounts to 4GB of monthly Internet, 4GB of free Internet on the weekends (1GB free every weekend) and 4GB of complimentary Celcom WiFi. Celcom FIRST Gold adopters will also receive double the talktime and free SMSs, at 100 minutes of talktime and 100 free text messages, to all networks. This means that if you sign up for any of Celcom’s FIRST plans, you can record a video of that beautiful sunrise from the top of Broga Hill and upload it to YouTube without worrying about it affecting your daily quota. It truly brings a great new meaning to separating business from pleasure. So go ahead and enjoy Celcom’s amazing 4G LTE speeds that will let you surf up to 10 times what you would normally get from a regular network connection. The good news doesn’t end there as Celcom FIRST subscribers will be entitled to free unlimited music streaming on Yonder Music. That means more awesome tunes streaming right to your phone so you get all the enjoyment without the headache of having to use up your precious smartphone storage. Better yet, if you have had a particularly economical month in terms of quota, Celcom FIRST rewards you by letting you carry over your unutilised monthly Internet to the next month. That means no more rushing to eek out every little bit of that quota near the end of the month! While most of you must be wondering if there is a catch, or perhaps even a contract to this plan, rest assured as Celcom doesn’t believe in tying you down with contracts for their FIRST data plans. As a testament to how committed Celcom is to providing its customers with a good deal, you can enjoy all of the fantastic privileges that come with the FIRST plan without the fear of being unable to terminate your plan due to a contract. Additionally, Celcom offers an extended credit limit of up to 5 times the extra credit limit of your monthly commitment value. With Auto Debit payments, you can also enjoy 5% savings over your monthly bill. Everything cool needs a club and Celcom’s FIRST plans are no exception. Subscribers will get to be part of the FIRST club which offers exclusive rewards and privileges designed only for club members, that range from additional free Internet calls, SMS and many more. What’s more, Celcom is having millions of movie ticket giveaways worth millions every month, letting you catch that epic year-end blockbuster movie without worrying about buying a ticket! There are three different ways you can participate and grab a gift code for the movie tickets: 
1. For new customers, simply sign up for a new Celcom FIRST plan (either Blue or Gold) 
2. For existing customers, purchase a Max Up at only RM20 a month for 1GB of data and free unlimited streaming on Yonder Music 
3. Alternatively, you can also purchase either a Samsung Galaxy Note5, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ or a Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 with Celcom FIRST.

Keep in mind that this contest is only valid until January 6th 2016, so you’d better hurry if you want to get your movie on! For customers in Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu. you can still redeem GSC or MBO tickets and watch them in a state where the cinemas are available, or you can opt for an ESCAPE online movie pass instead."

OK, it’s quite useless actually since you can do practically everything on your Android smartphone anyway. So maybe  , despite how incomplete and frustrating it is, is the way to go.   certainly thinks so since what looks like their latest 12-inch Windows 10 tablet was just certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG. Rumours that Samsung were working on a 12″ Windows 10 tablet have been floating around for quite some time now but this is the first piece of solid confirmation that this device is indeed in the pipeline. According to SamMobile Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG certifications are usually a good indicator that the device is on the way to the shelves soon. The 12-inch unit bearing the model number SM-W700 is said to feature a screen resolution of either 2560×1600 or 3840×2400. On the inside, the device will allegedly be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM. Some have said that the tablet may also come with an S Pen which, coupled with the full Windows 10 experience, could certainly improve productivity. If Samsung adds a keyboard accessory then we may have another Surface/iPad Pro challenger on our hands. As Android phones continue to get bigger, the equivalent OS tablet is becoming less and less relevant because people can already do so much on their phone. Front facing speakers plus a 5.7″ Smartphone can provide just as much immersion (if not more) as a side/rear speakered 7.9-inch tablet. It’s just not worth carrying an extra device just so you have a slightly bigger screen. Keep in mind bigger, in this sense, doesn’t always mean better as in general smartphones have a better pixel density than tablets and a better pixel density usually equals a better viewing experience. Let me put it this way, spreading a single cup of waffle batter over a baking tray the size of your palm would get you a thicker, fluffier, and more satisfying waffle versus spreading the same amount over a tray the size of a dining table. The same concept applies to screens. If you spread 1080p over a 5.7″ display, you’re bound to get a better screen than if it was spread over 12-inches of real estate. So if media consumption is not the best, productivity has to be the tablet’s redeeming factor, and in that Windows 10 beats Android hands down. Considering how wonky Windows 10 is, that’s saying quite a lot about how unoptimised Android is for the big screen. The Korean electronics giant isn’t the only one launching a Windows 10 tablet though as Xiaomi has just   in both Android and Windows 10. It has been a while since Samsung has launched a Windows-powered tablet but it seems that they’ve recognised that if you want a tablet, Android is no bueno. [ ]"

Kudos to you! What most people do not realise is that there are users (in fact a considerable majority) who use their devices in the configuration it came out of the box, fearing to dig deeper into their device’s settings in the event something disastrous happens. While one could make the argument that previous Nexus devices were geared more towards those with experience rather than the mass market, we feel that the   is the first truly “mainstream” Nexus device that we would have no problem recommending to anyone.

Even more excited than others were the fans of  ‘s old   because they finally had an upgrade to their beloved 4.95-inch phone. Well, that was until it melted in one of their pockets. User AFChimpanse took to the   forums yesterday and shared a story about how his/her brand new Nexus 5X had a meltdown, literally. According to the OP (original poster), the device was sitting in his/her pocket when suddenly it started heating up. When the OP took it out, it continued to heat up and started producing a “low frizzling sound” releasing an “extremely toxic smell”. The smartphone eventually got too hot to hold in the hand and the OP had to put it down. When (we’re assuming the frizzling had died down) the device was picked up again, the user noticed that a portion of the back cover to the right of the LG logo had melted inwards. User DarcyFitz and GlassHalfFull pointed out that it should be a battery issue judging from the location of the melted bit relative to the device’s internals identified by iFixit’s teardown photo: According to AFChimpanse, the device was only 11 days old and had never been plugged into a third-party charger before. So I guess we can rule out   as a cause. While there is nothing official to validate the user’s claims, this isn’t the first time a smartphone has exploded, as there have been cases where   and this   (though this was  ) suffered a similar fate. Most smartphone batteries are filled with chemicals that could potentially be triggered if it endures excessive force or physical trauma, as can be seen in this video by TechRax below: Although you might not be taking a hammer to your device, there is a chance that these devices may come in contact some unfavourable conditions which may cause undesired reactions. Unfortunately, when it comes to phones you stop drop and roll so if your phone is getting a little hotter than usual, our suggestion would be to take it out of your pocket immediately.

Being relatively candid on the subject, Pichai jests that he’ll take his mum’s considerations when the time comes to name Android N, though it won’t only be her he’ll be looking to; supposedly, Google will also run an online poll to help decide if the N stands for Nougat, Nutella or something entirely different. Speaking mainly to an Indian crowd, one of the attendees asked about why there has never been an Android version named after sweets and desserts from India, Google’s CEO replied “When I meet my mom, I’ll ask her for suggestions” He added the following regarding the next nickname: “Maybe what I’ll do next time, is when we’re working on the next release of Android, Android N, maybe we’ll do an online poll on what the name should be. And if all Indians vote…. I think we can make it happen!” From the super sweet list below, it’ll be tough to see anything other than something sweet make the list: Android is widely adopted across the globe and while most of these nicknames have their namesake desserts/sweets originating from western countries, maybe Google will let globalisation do its own thing, allowing international sweets to be a part of the fun.

But their postpaid plans offer something we’ve never seen before, a profit-sharing mechanism that allows users to start own pyramid referral system, of sorts. The details on this XOX affiliate programme are still in the wind, with the website only stating that it “helps you grow your income without having to do very much at all. Or at least helping you in cutting your monthly phone bills in the simplest way!” You’ll find details of their postpaid plan below: When we called to find out how this system works, we were told to attend a “dealer orientation” – sketchy, at best. But if you’re interested in this program, head on over to their website (linked at the bottom) for more details. We’ve left out contact details and await a call from an XOX representative and we’ll be sure to let everyone know the outcome. Also to those wondering, XOX piggybacks on Celcom’s cellular network. Since we don’t usually see “pyramid” schemes and MLMs from telcos often (if at all), this inclusion could possibly add a peculiar twist to the Malaysian cellular operator market – then again, 2016 is already shaping up in a rather interesting manner, with TM entering the hypothetical mobile network ring. More competitors always means more choices, so maybe it’s time to jump ship, come 2016."
Rory Lee,Microsoft’s Surface Book & Surface Pro 4 receives a much needed fix,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/18/microsofts-surface-book-surface-pro-4-receives-a-much-needed-fix/,"microsoft,microsoft surface 4 type cover,Microsoft Surface Book,microsoft surface fix,Microsoft Surface Pro 4,surface 4 type cover,Surface Book,surface fix,surface keyboard fix,surface keyboard problems,Surface Pro 4,type cover,windows keyboard update,windows update","Industry in General,Microsoft,Mobile Devices",2015-12-18,"‘s much anticipated new   products, the   and  , launched to a myriad of complaints from users who were receiving a less than satisfactory experience with it. Many, ourselves included, felt that Microsoft shipped an unfinished product. From what we gathered, it isn’t the hardware that the Surface users are unhappy about, rather it was the software implementation that let the devices down. What’s worse, Microsoft’s “solution” to the problem was an apology on their forums which only served to irk more users. Now though, they seem to have actually come up with a solution to at least one of their problems. Besides the issues with the device’s power drainage during sleep and random reboots, one other nagging issue was the Surface device’s keyboard and touchpad. The much improved Surface Pro 4 Type Cover keyboard was so advanced, it seemed, that it didn’t deem the Surface Pro 4 a worthy device and thus refused to pair with it properly. The Surface Pro 4 had issues connecting with its keyboard, especially when removing the Type Cover and reattaching it, bugging out the mouse cursors and other modes for Continuum. For us, the problems were more rudimentary when it came to the Surface Pro 4. We found out that if the keyboard was attached when the device was off, it wouldn’t detect the keyboard when we switched it on, forcing us to disengage and reattach the keyboard to the device. This update also affects Surface Book users, where apparently the device had problems with its touchpad and keyboard as well. Here are the  changelogs: If you were anywhere near as excited as us for the launch of the Surface Pro 4, and dropped a considerable chunk of your savings to get one with the Type Cover keyboard, I’m sure you were equally crestfallen when you discovered that Microsoft already knew the device had issues yet still decided to put it in the market. While doing something like this is, frankly, unforgivable, you’d think that a company as big as Microsoft would have some kind of fix ready almost immediately after it put an unfinished product on sale. Instead, they said that major fixes would  . In any case, these problems seem to be software based, and fixable via updates so if you’ve bought a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book device, our advice is to hunker down and weather this initial storm in the hopes that your device will eventually live up to its full potential. If you’re still on the fence about purchasing one, stay tuned to our upcoming review of the Surface Pro 4 where we will be taking a close look at the device, all of its problems, fixes and more."

To store your entertainment content, it comes in either 32GB or 64GB storage capacities which fortunately is upgradable with microSD. Upfront there’s a 2.1MP front camera for your video confering or occasional selfies.  Being a TV/Tablet convergence device, you can use it without being plugged in for up to 8 hours with its 5,700mAh capacity battery. Connectivity wise, it has Bluetooth 4.1, WiFi 802.11ac and there’s an optional model for LTE but it looks like we are getting a WiFi only version according to the specs shown on SIRIM. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop and the interface is customised with large buttons for ease of use as a media centre. After all, this is designed to be as a media consumption device that’s smarter than your average TV. It is just a pity that it lacks external sources like HDMI.   The Samsung Galaxy View is going for US$499 in the US which is around RM2,154 in our current exchange rates. The question remains, would you get one? Thanks   for the tip!"

If they plan on following the generic his/her accessories trend then the device will likely be smaller in both their bands as well as the watch case itself.

Cited as the Top Trending Searches for 2015, we’re perplexed as to why the most searched “term” in the country was “HRMIS 2.0”, an internal system used by those in the (extremely large 1.5 million people) public service. Though you’d think that a frequently visited site used for work would deserve a bookmark or at least remembrance of the URL. Moving on, there were searches regarding BR1M 2015, the annual subsistence handout by our government; How-Old.net, an application that tells you how old it thinks you are (duh); and some local shows/movies. No surprise as the “USD to MYR” was searched highly too, followed by “GST” and the “Bersih 4.0” rally. For the top 10 most searched individuals list, it seemed that Malaysians looked for information regarding notable people who passed away during the year. That includes, the late: Lee Kuan Yew, Former Prime Minister of Singapore; Paul Walker, the famous actor that passed away during a car crash; and Kevin Morais, the murdered deputy prosecutor. Our current Prime Minister was also on the list, while athlete Farah Ann Abdul Hadi made her way on it as well (for obvious, gymnastic attire reasons). People also kept up with international news, as searches for the missing QZ8501 airplane, the Paris Attacks and ISIS, topped the list for trending news searches. The list of searches really show what we’re looking for, be it happenings of the world or an important individual. Given the growth of the Internet and Google being one of the go-to search engines (seriously, who still uses Yahoo or Bing?), we’ll continue to see what sort of information our country is keen to look for, hopefully John Cena won’t make the list again next year."

Then, the Taiwanese company gave fans another glimmer of hope when the   leaked online with what  . Now, more pictures of the device have also been leaked and it looks…different to say the least. Based on the pictures, the new addition to the One lineup looks to have a couple of very interesting design choices. The first, and most obvious of which, is that camera “visor” ala-Nexus 6P that stretches across the top of the device right around the camera module. When images of the Nexus 6P were first leaked and people saw the visor, they were a little apprehensive to it and how it seemed to have tainted what could have been a good looking device. Now though, that visor has become a signature of the latest Nexus device and at a glance, people can easily differentiate it from its less powerful brother the Nexus 5X. The thing is, while Huawei decided to set that visor apart, letting it dominate in its blackness across the top of the phone, HTC seems to have tried to “hide” their “visor” by painting it the same colour as the rest of the device. Again, apprehensive is the word we could best use to describe those looks. That said, taste varies between the individual so there obviously will be people who completely dig that look. Around the front of the device, HTC seems to have gone “retro” with the inclusion of capacitive buttons along the bottom of the device (where their logo usually is) while the HTC logo has moved to the device’s forehead. There also seems to be, what looks like, a pair of front facing speakers (which we hope are BoomSound speakers) as well as a front facing camera.

It looks like the device will be running an octa-core 2.2GHz processor (which rules out the Snapdragon 820 and Helios X20 rumoured earlier) mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable via microSD up to 1TB. The smartphone also looks to sport a 5.5″ full HD IPS display (1920×1080 pixels). In terms of optics, the device will get a 13MP primary camera with an LED flash and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter on the front. It is also rumoured to run Android 5.0.1 Lollipop (likely with HTC’s Sense UI on top) out of the box. To be fair, we couldn’t really expect this to be a full-fledged flagship device, especially since it doesn’t bear the M badge. One could hope, right?"

The Lumia 950 with a compact 5.2″ display is going for RM2,699 while its larger 5.7″ “phablet” model, the Lumia 950 XL is priced at RM2,999.

The question is, will it change Microsoft’s success in the local market? Let’s see if Digi enterprise/business customers take advantage of this special deal. The smaller of the two, the Lumia 950 will be absolutely free of charge though it’ll come with a hefty monthly fee of RM 238 on a 2 year (24 months) contract – working out to a huge RM 5,712 total.

If you’d prefer something bigger and more powerful, the Lumia 950 XL will be available too. You’ll get the same plan as talked about above, at the same monthly price, but you’ll have to fork out an additional RM 330 upfront for the smartphone itself; bringing you to an eventual RM 6,042 total cost. Given that spending RM 238 per month doesn’t sound as practical for someone who doesn’t use all that bundled data, calls/texts and instant messaging, you can bump that price down by choosing other Digi plans that will be announced on the 18th of December; mind you, the two smartphones’ will cost more, but you’ll be paying less monthly.

Local Ian Oz found this out the hard way. He, like many other Nexus 6P fans, ordered the device off Lazada’s website, however, when the package arrived, instead of unwrapping a brand spanking new smartphone, Ian unwrapped a pair of…earrings? Oh dear. 
 It turns out Lazada had somehow screwed up the order and sent Ian six pairs of earrings (worth RM58), which were initially meant for someone named Irene Yeow. The worst part was that based on the receipt, Irene’s earrings were meant to go Johor, which in case you didn’t know, is in another state. As it looks like Lazada had mistakenly stuffed the earrings into the Nexus 6P package, it seems likely that Ian’s smartphone was stuffed into the earrings package. The good news is that there is a contact number included in the shipping invoice. Ian, obviously outraged, took his irritation onto the social media, posting a picture of his receipt on Huawei’s Facebook page. Luckily, Huawei responded fairly quickly and ensured Ian that they had escalated the problem to their core fulfillment team and Lazada. What we don’t understand is how a mistake like this could be made in the first place. On the Pos Laju statement, it clearly states that the package should weigh 0.2kg (Nexus 6P weighs around 178g) which reflects the device’s weight, but it seems unlikely that six pairs of earrings would weigh the same as Google’s latest device. Nevertheless, paying RM58 for a brand new Nexus 6P seems like a phenomenal deal. Where can we sign up for it? In all seriousness though, we wish Ian luck in the retrieval of his device because we know how terrible it must feel to pay over two and a half thousand ringgit only for your shipment to be messed up.

The game takes you on an on-rail action adventure through a space station filled with Stormtroopers who happen to be surprisingly accurate. With your trusty lightsaber equipped, you will engage in ranged combat, where you deflect blaster fire back at your attackers,  as well as melee combat. We haven’t made it far enough into the game where we’ve encountered a Sith yet, so do let us know in the comments below if you have. It is a fantastic experience we highly recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or otherwise especially since it works on both iOS and Android. We did encounter some input lag in our adventures through the game as well as some drops in framerate but that is kind of expected when playing a browser game. The experience in itself more than makes up for it though, so all is forgiven. Maybe by the next installment of the Star Wars franchise we will be able to play this (or something like this) in virtual reality."

All he wanted was to buy an iPhone 6, but instead, he was forced to fork out more than double the price by an unscrupulous seller.  Just when you thought nobody will pull the same trick here in Malaysia, think again. A local paper had reported several customers being held against their will until they pay up more than what was agreed upon.  A 28-year-old victim was reported to be buying 4 phones at RM200 each at Kota Raya Shopping Complex. However after making the payment of RM800, he was told to enter a secluded room where he was locked up for hours. He was then told to pay an exorbitant RM10,000 fee for his release. Eventually, the victim was set free, but not after he withdrawn RM5,000 from an ATM. To rub salt to the wound, the 4 phones which he got was different from what was shown earlier.  Obviously, the next thing to do was to report to the relevant authorities. He was said to have complained to several agencies including the Ministry of trade and Consumer Affairs, but no action has been taken. As a last resort, he seeks help from PPIM (Persatuan Pengguna Islam Malaysia) which proceeded to raid the shop.  From the operation, it was found that there are a number of phone shops at Kota Raya that are selling counterfeit products at skyrocketed prices. In total, they had managed to cover as much as RM11,900 on behalf of 7 victims. Apart from locals, these shops tend to target foreigners especially women that would often fall prey to such tactics. As always, it is advisable to shop at reputable retailers and beware of dodgy dealers that offer unbelievable deals. If the deal is too good to be true, then it probably is. This isn’t just limited to expensive phone models as we’ve seen   in the market as well. If you’re planning to get a smartphone, it is best to visit an authorised dealer or order directly from the official online store. Hopefully you won’t get a surprise like  ."

Hold on a minute, the latest Android hasn’t even gone mainstream but they want to talk about the future? Representing Google during an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session, the 6-man team chipped in on a slew of topics, including: the direction of Pixel C and the future of Android. If you’re asking why there’s such a bridging of the two; it’s mainly due to a merger that’s reported to take place come 2017. The report suggests that heads at Google think combining the two makes the most sense, since Android has had an early start as an operating system for quite some time. And we’re already starting to see small changes that point towards a unification in latest Pixel product. Google’s Pixel branding has been have over the place, of late; partly due to the Pixel C choosing Android over Chrome OS. This further points to a crossover of operating systems and that might mean more “desktop”-like capabilities to ease productivity in the following phase of Android. So while mediating all these unanswered questions regarding the switch, the software team thought it would be a great idea to hold an AMA session. Allowing users to ask whatever they needed to. But it was surprising that the developers choose to share two facts about Android N, given that non-Nexus devices have yet to receive Marshmallow. The first of the two is a proper split-screen/multi-window function that we’ve already seen on iOS (iPad Pro only) and some Android OEM skins as well. This pretty much only applies to tablets since it’ll be a tiresome experience navigating multiple windows on your smartphone screen. Another feature that came about was DisplayPort via USB Type-C connector, that a competitor has put to good use – yes, we’re looking at Windows with their Continuum support. A trend that you could see a mile away, with more people dropping PCs for day to day task and opting convertibles that are slowly catching up in the processor department. These replies below were from the team themselves: Faster processors in smaller packages are already here and they’ll only continue to get better. And you can expect us to start using smaller devices on bigger screens real soon. Oh and maybe a Pixel smartphone? Let us know what you make of this announcement and share with us if your technological consumption habits have changed of late, in the comments below."

Announced during IFA 2015, the Acer Predator 8 has finally arrived in Malaysia.  Sporting a 8″ Full HD (1920×1200) display, this is Acer’s compact tablet with the gamer in mind. It gets a gaming inspired aluminium frame and has not one, not two but four front-facing speakers with Dolby Audio enhancement. For a more immersive gaming experience, the Android tablet has two haptic motors inside that rumbles on both ends.  Powering the device is Intel’s Atom x7-Z8700 2.4GHz Quad-Core processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. Onboard, it gets 32GB of storage which you can expand via a microSD up to 128GB. The Predator 8’s IPS display claims to have 100% NTSC colour gamut that provides a vibrant and accurate colour reproduction. The included MediaMaster settings let you optimise the display and audio for gaming, movie, photo viewing and standard modes.  The main highlight, of course, would be its Predator Quadio (Quad Audio) setup that offers a virtual surround sound.

So in total, you’ll have Celcom, Digi, Maxis, U Mobile and TM as the 5 key 4G LTE telcos in the country. Is that enough? Well, it appears a new player is about to jump into the ring. 5 years ago, the Malaysian government had allocated 2,600MHz LTE spectrums to  . Only 4 of them had officially rolled out commercial services namely Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. With TM’s   of P1, they now have access to the 2600MHz spectrum which they can roll out full LTE based telephony and data services.

For those who are clueless about the numbers, these are Mobile Network codes. According to MCMC, 502 152 belongs to YTL Communications while 502 153 belongs to Packet One Networks. We haven’t heard much from YTL Communications in a while and they could be making a big come back next year with 4G LTE. Their Yes 4G WiMAX service is still alive and running with occasional   promotions.  So what’s the big deal if YTL launches its LTE service? Almost 2 years ago, YTL was   to be testing   on 2.3GHz, which supposedly is more efficient in bandwidth and cost. Utilising Time Division instead of Frequency Division, TD-LTE requires just one channel for download/upload as opposed to having a pair of frequencies for the same purpose.  In Malaysia, our existing telcos are running on FDD-LTE, while TD-LTE is commonly used in China and India. Whether   boils down to the telco itself. It is not what you have, but how you manage your network and your customer experience.  Seamless transition from WiMAX, is also a factor why YTL favours TD-LTE. In an interview last year, its CEO Wing K Lee says that their WiMAX network is   and it won’t cost much for them to roll out LTE. Back then, YTL is claiming 85% population coverage with WiMAX and we can confirm it was definitely wider than P1 in our road test conducted exactly  .

But it’ll be a very different route from what we saw on their first device with a fingerprint sensor – the Redmi Note 3, that places the sensor on the rear. Tying it all together, these images come just after a reputed analyst shared his thoughts on the Mi 5’s fingerprint technology. Pan Jiutang shared that the device won’t have the latest UltraSonic Fingerprint Scanner technology by Qualcomm, as it’s still in the developmental stages. Leaving the impression that it’ll likely be the same scanners you’d see in other manufacturers’ devices. Spotted carrying some heavy hitting internals under the codename Xiaomi gemini, which include a Snapdragon 820 chipset while running Android Marshmallow; it’s likely we’ll see the Mi 5 early next year and its accompanying leaks as the new year unfolds."

There are some of us at SoyaCincau.com who feel the same way and then there are those who simply cannot comprehend how paying so much for a device that comes with, what essentially is the “outline” of the Android OS, could be justified. We don’t like letting those without a voice go unheard, so we had an extensive discussion and compiled a list of reasons why vanilla Android is the only Android you DON’T want to have. Do keep in mind that this list is tailored to the average, inexperienced consumer who wouldn’t root their brand new Nexus device and play around with custom ROMs lest it becomes a two and a half thousand ringgit aluminium brick. We do like a near stock experience, but we also can’t deny that there are many luxuries that come with the Android skin on most devices these days that we almost couldn’t live without."

Malaysian   fans have been clamouring for the Apple Watch ever since it was announced, but here we are eight months later and still no Watch in sight. Well, we actually don’t know if this is good news or just slightly sad news because apparently Apple is already preparing a March 2016 event to unveil the second generation Apple Watch alongside what could be the 4-inch “iPhone 6c”. 9to5Mac reports that the second-generation wearable could possibly start shipping in April, a full year after the first device was launched. They also report that Apple had long developed the technology needed for future Apple Watch generations even before the original Apple Watch started shipping. Components that allow sleep tracking, wireless, health sensor technologies and even a new camera for the wearable have already been developed. When we  , it was rumoured to be launched in the first half of 2016 and based on this new report, it looks like it should, at least, get a first half announcement alongside the 2nd gen Apple Watch. Following the success of the iPhone 5c, it doesn’t really come as a surprise that Apple wants to continue the c-badge because there are many Apple fans that simply cannot shell out the dough needed for their flagship devices. What’s even better is that the   could be powered by an Apple A8 ( / )/A9 ( / ) chip, so performance on iOS should be about as buttery as can be. If it follows in the footsteps of the iPhone 5c then it should come in a plastic body sporting a multitude of funky and bright colours. The smaller size would be a throwback to a time before iPhones became “iPhablets” which we’re sure will be welcomed by those with smaller hands. However, with the current abysmal exchange rate of the Ringgit, if this device is launched, would it be affordable enough to appeal to those below the high-end market? Based on the iPhone 5c’s  , RM1,999 for the 16GB model and RM2,399 for the 32GB model (keep in mind both of these are without GST), we doubt so.

A term, to the layman, that is commonly associated with a certain ugly vehicular abomination that claims to be green and is well loved by Hollywood actors who want to appear environmentally conscious. Cameron Diaz has one y’know. In tech, it is also a term that has been gaining popularity because it usually means you can afford to carry one less device around with you.

It also sports an 8-megapixel rear camera that supports 1080p recording and a 2-megapixel front camera, but we do advise against being one of those “tablet photographers”. The tablet attaches to its keyboard via magnets, but the thing that we found great was the fact that the keyboard has a solid base which means you can use it on your lap. For more information on the tablet and its keyboard, head on over  . Marketing it as a tablet with a keyboard means that the Pixel C was not exactly designed to be a hybrid laptop or tablet. And that kind of shows since it is running Android instead of a dedicated laptop/desktop OS. Clearly it   but we do hope that ChromeOS-Android hybrid comes soon so that we can see what this tablet is fully capable of. Of course, this isn’t the first tablet to come with its own keyboard. Sony has done it with the Xperia Z4 Tablet, Samsung has Galaxy Tab S, ASUS has the Transformer, and even Google themselves have the Nexus 9 with a keyboard. The Pixel C is currently available in the Google Store with prices starting at USD499 (around RM2,130). The magnetic keyboard is a USD149 (around RM635) optional extra, but it does also come with a folio keyboard, similar to the Nexus 9’s and will also be priced at USD149. Based on these figures, the Pixel C looks like its a pretty good bargain, especially if you compare it with the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet which will set you back RM2,699 for the device and another RM799 for the accompanying keyboard. Unfortunately, the Pixel C isn’t available in Malaysia. As of this moment there doesn’t seem to be any information on availability in our market but we do hope they will bring it over soon so that we can see first hand what Google thinks is the proper way to build a tablet."

After its   in late September, the Nexus 6P is finally here in Malaysia and you can place your orders beginning this Thursday, 10th December. Available in a single 64GB storage variant, the Nexus 6P is priced officially at RM2,698 inclusive of GST. For Malaysia, we are getting two colour options – Aluminium and Graphite. So far there’s no news of its other Gold and Frost White versions. In terms of size, the Nexus 6P despite its “6” moniker has a 5.7″ screen which makes it more compact than last year’s Nexus 6 by Motorola. The AMOLED screen pushes a Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440 that gives a pixel density of 518 pixels per inch. The exterior is where the Nexus 6P stands out. It gets an all-metal unibody design with a “helmet visor” bump at the back that houses its camera module. Accompanying its high-resolution screen is a pair of stereo speakers which is perfect for gaming and audio playback. For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P also gets a fingerprint scanner at the back that’s natively supported by Android Marshmallow. Like most rear-mounted fingerprint scanners, it unlocks instantly in a single touch. Powering the device is a flagship class 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of RAM, which should be more than sufficient to provide a buttery smooth experience. Like all Nexus smartphones (except for the Nexus One by HTC), there’s no expandable microSD slot and it comes with a single nano SIM slot supporting 4G LTE. In terms of cameras, the Nexus 6P focuses on larger pixels rather than the usual pixel count. Despite having a 12.3MP sensor from Sony, it boasts a larger 1.55 μm pixel size that allows in more light and this apparently is good enough to compensate for the lack of an Optical Image Stabilisation. It gets a dual-tone LED flash, Phase Detection and Laser Auto Focus so that you won’t miss a shot. Over at the front, selfies are taken care by its rather large 8MP shooter. Keeping the lights on, the Nexus 6P has a generous 3,450mAh battery and it charges up via a reversible USB Type C port. Out of the box, you get 2 sets of cables – a USB Type-C to Type-C and the standard USB Type-C to full sized USB. The power adapter pushes a higher 3Amp output through a USB Type-C port which should be faster than standard 2Amp chargers in the market. Of course the main reason why anyone would get a Nexus, is for its pure Android experience without the unnecessary fluff that’s often preinstalled by OEMs. The Nexus 6P will be available online this Thursday (10th December) through Huawei’s   and   Online store. Those who snap up units quickly, Huawei will be throwing in an introductory offer of a   (the first version) worth RM 199, totally free of charge to the first 600.

In terms of optics, the device features an 18-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) and a dual-LED flash. It is also certified by Schneider-Kreuznach. Unfortunately, the PRIV only receives a 2-megapixel selfie-panorama front facing camera for selfies, which we’re sure may disappoint some.

Many expect the PRIV to be a game changer as it is supposed to bring the best of both Android and BlackBerry operating systems together in a premium device.

These are synonymous with Apple. People may disagree with a lot of things but many will agree that when it comes to making something as ubiquitous as a smartphone look like a work of art, Apple does it best. But sometimes, even the best get it wrong. This is the Apple Smart Battery Case. It’s the company’s first ever battery pack and it’s decidedly un-Apple. More on that later but first, let’s go into the specs. The Smart Battery Case is a battery pack that fits the   and  . It packs a 1,877mAh battery and Apple says it’s good for 18 hours of internet browsing time on LTE or 20 hours of video playback time. The battery case has a soft touch silicone exterior with a microfibre inner lining to protect your iPhone. There are two colours to choose from (white and charcoal gray) currently and it’s the only battery case that comes with a lighting connector. So why is the Smart Battery Case un-Apple? It’s the design. Next to the slim, sleek and slender iPhone 6, the Smart Battery Case, with its unsightly bulge, looks like an afterthought, like the designers at Apple didn’t even bother to make this thing look good. It’s not that great as a battery case either. There’s no separate switch to activate or deactivate the battery case and the lack of an external battery indicator makes it difficult to know how much power you have left without turning on your iPhone. You do however get an integrated battery status built into iOS when the battery case is plugged into your iPhone but that means you will have to turn on your phone every time you want check the power status of the battery case. And for the   asking price, you’re not getting a lot. A popular battery case alternative like the   with a 2,750mAh battery pack, a dedicated on/off switch and external LED indicators costs about the same. So if you’re an iPhone 6 or 6S user that’s constantly looking for a power point because your iPhone is out of battery, you might want to stay away from the Apple Battery Pack. It’s ugly, it’s expensive and for something that’s designed for the iPhone by the makers of the iPhone itself, it’s decidedly un-Apple. Maybe Apple took some inspiration from the device below.

Well, we thought so too. This magical ad triggers a pop up in search results and allows users to stream the application (for now it’s only for games) for up to 60 seconds. The purpose is to allow users to try out the application before deciding whether or not they want to download it. According to Google, one in four applications downloaded is never even used because of the shortening mobile attention span of the average user. Trial Run Ads attempts to curb that by letting users really get a feel of an application before downloading them, thus benefiting both the user and the app developer. This application is only in its beta stage though, but Google has unveiled this to app developers so the ball is in their court now and it is up to them to decide how to best utilise this feature. With proper and effective implementation, this looks like it could be a very interesting feature. Besides this nifty app Harry Potter-y, Google is also starting the beta for Interactive Interstitial ads that utilises HTML5 to create interactive mobile advertisements. It will let advertisers completely customise the advertisement to their liking and give them the freedom they need to use HTML5 instead of standard templates and pull data dynamically. It is truly customisable and can allow advertisers to include the app’s value proposition and functionalities to suit advertisers who are looking for higher user engagement."

You can’t deny that’s pretty impressive considering Samsung only sold   for the whole of 2014. Even Android Wear has managed to ship  , with Moto 360 leading the pack.

In the face of heighten competition from its affordable Chinese rivals, they are continuing to grow from 3.9 million units shipped in Q1 this year to 4.7 million shipped in the last quarter. Driving the sales is their popular Charge and Surge, as they continue to increase its presence worldwide. According to IDC, the increase for Fitbit was also attributed to the rise of corporate wellness programs with large corporations providing Fitbit trackers for their staff.  With the entry of Apple Watch, the Cupertino company has managed to catapult itself to 2nd place, putting a dent to the market share of current wearable brands. In Q3, Apple has shipped 3.9 Watches, an increase of 300,000 over Q2 as it increased its availability to more market. Strangely Malaysians are still not getting the Watch, while it is already on sale officially in Singapore, Thailand and most recently   starting yesterday.

For storage it has 32GB on-board which is expandable with microSD.  Running on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with the possibility of being upgraded to Marshmallow early next year, the PRIV eliminates the concern of having limited apps with full access to the Google Play Store. With virtually all Android players adopting a full touch screen display, BlackBerry hopes to fulfill the needs of consumers that desire the tactile feel of a physical keyboard.  Given its retail price, the PRIV will face a tough challenge from likes of the Galaxy Note5, Xperia Z5 and even the Nexus 6P. After all, existing Android users will be their key focus group   to their Senior Director for Asia Pacific Product Management. The main deciding factor of course the slider keyboard.

We’d still think that driving an automobile is an experience best felt by being fully in control but they’re obviously perks to being able to have the ability to control your vehicle autonomously or through a remote. 
Pushing the boundaries of driving autonomously, the multi-talented UK based research team from Land Rover have been prototyping technology that allows you to move around your huge SUV or off-road beast, through fiddling with on-screen controls on your smartphone. 
Usher your Multi-point turn enabled Range Rover in a relatively controlled environment at a max speed of 4mph and manoeuvre your way through tight situations. Handing you controls for steering, breaks and accelerator, you’ll be able to be outside your car as you carefully move it around challenging terrain or hard to see parking situations – taking bad viewing angles out of the equation. 
Land Rover researchers also programmed the Multi-point turn technology to give those manning the virtual wheels the controls to adjust high and low range, angling the car in just the right manner to get around. It doesn’t stop there, as these in-built sensors on the car will apparently work in all weather conditions and environments, always enabling you to get yourself out of a tight spot, if need be. There are some limitations, such as range, when considering that you’ll only be able to “command” the car from a distance of 10 metres, all while your smartphone and smart keys are in close proximity. 
The team of researchers have also developed technology that allows you to turn your car a full 180-degrees in a tight spot; basically conducting a three-point turn. A much dreaded manoeuvre for anyone’s that has been in the driver seat of a large vehicle. Although other carmakers have already started implementing some of these options, it’ll be interesting to see how the idea of controlling your car from your smartphone’s will run along. It won’t please any motorheads but given the notion, it might be pretty cool."

What are we talking about? Well, the folks at   have decided it was a good idea to poke the metaphorical bear that is Apple, with their latest advert for an  /  Sandstone back case. Mmm, we love the smell of napalm in the morning. In their cheeky video – which looks like a parody of what we like to call the “swelling-music-advert” – OnePlus have painted themselves (or their users at least) as   who has got it “covered”, always ready and willing to help out their friends in need. In this case (ha ha), it would be OnePlus’ new friends over at Cupertino. As fun as this is, we certainly do hope OnePlus doesn’t think ALL its users dress like the guy in the video (that hat, really?). Just yesterday, OnePlus also posted a teaser on their Facebook page about their latest product, which I’m sure must’ve irked many an iPhone user now that the cat’s out of the bag. There is yet more evidence of this “friendly ribbing” on their product page as they strive to give iPhone 6/6s users the “Never Settle” feel, adding that its “sturdy, polycarbonate construction” adds both “grippiness and protection”. Apparently it’s one of those things “you won’t understand until you try it”. To sweeten the deal, OnePlus is throwing in a physical   invite with every purchase of this back case. That’s not all, the invites aren’t only invitations to buy the regular phone, but there is also a chance that you could get an invite to purchase the OnePlus X Ceramic or better yet, a free device. Now that sounds dandy and all but when we tried to purchase the case from their online store, a pop-up informed us that the case was currently out of stock, despite it being listed as in stock on the page itself. Maybe this is some kind of elaborate April fools prank in December. December Dummies perhaps? Of course, this isn’t the first time OnePlus has done something most people deem ridiculous to generate buzz, just a few months back their  .

That is a staggering number of people if you think about it, especially taking into consideration the keyword in that phrase is ‘ever’. Which means that, even two years ago, when smartphone cameras were arguably worse than they are now, people still defaulted to them for that snapshotting needs. This is completely understandable simply because a smartphone is more portable, usually cheaper and are just generally more convenient. Well,   hopes to add to that statistic with their latest  , which officially goes on sale in Taiwan today. One of the biggest problems was that most smartphones relied on a digital zoom, which is more like a fancy way to crop your photos if you think about it. The one you want to go for when zooming is the optical zoom, which adjusts the glass positioned in a camera/lens unit to reposition the light hitting the sensor, which brings the image closer but maintains its quality. Most smartphones shy away from using this because having multiple pieces of glass in the camera unit means having more space which in turn translates to a bigger camera hump. The supposedly brilliant thing about the ZenFone Zoom though is that it is the “world’s thinnest 3x-optical zoom smartphone”. How thin is thin? Well ASUS states that the ZenFone Zoom only has a 5mm edge. Bear in mind, this is the edge, and as the ZenFone line of devices have usually been curved at the back, this looks to be no exception. From the looks of it, the device’s camera unit does take up an enormous amount of space on the back panel ala- , but it doesn’t seem to protrude as much as the Lumia. In a device that is designed to take photographs, most of the actual photography will be taken by the primary 13-megapixel rear shooter while selfies and video chats will be handled by the device’s 5MP front facing unit. Other primary camera goodies include a dual-LED flash, laser autofocus, optical image stabilisation (OIS) and ASUS’ PixelMaster 2.0 camera technology that is designed to greatly improve low light photography, granting up to a 400% increase in brightness. For those curious about the PixelMaster 2.0 technology, we’ve already put it through its paces in our  . The ZenFone Zoom will also feature a dedicated shutter button, record button as well as a zoom rocker. Then again, we already expected most of this as the device was announced almost a year ago. What we do know now for sure now is that the device will come in 64GB and 128GB variants. Internal specs include an Intel Atom Z3580 quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz for the 64GB variant while the 128GB variant will be powered by a 2.5GHz Intel Atom Z3590 quad-core processor. Based on the website, it appears that the device will also come with 4GB of RAM and be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS’ BoostMaster quick charging technology. The devices will also come running Android Lollipop out of the box. Display wise, the smartphone will come with a 5.5-inch full HD display with a pixel density of 403 ppi tucked away under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The body will also be of an aluminium unibody construction with what looks like a faux leather back to help with grip and texture as well as a ridge at the bottom of the phone to help with one handed photography. But we all know what a unibody means: no removable battery. It does have what looks like a lanyard port and appears to come bundled with a camera strap. The 64GB device retails in Taiwan for TWD13,990 (around RM1,806) while the 128GB will go for TWD15,990 (around RM2,065). While ASUS did not announce when this device will be available in other markets,   has hinted at an  , which means it could be any time now. The odd thing is that this device was announced a long time ago, and between its announcement and today ASUS has launched several devices already. This begs the question, what took them so long? Was there a massive kink in the device that delayed its launch this long? Let’s hope they’ve worked out whatever problems they had with it (if they had any problems) lest we have a repeat of  . We suspect this device will appeal to some camera enthusiasts who were interested in the Lumia 1020 but not the Windows Mobile platform. While it does seem that this device is a worthy Android equivalent, its sensor is but a measly 13-megapixels versus the Lumia 1020’s 41-megapixel monstrosity. Then again, megapixel isn’t the be-all and end-all of camera quality, so we will just have to wait and see."

By making his own smartphone. An engineer by occupation, Andy Rubin has been around; he’s graced Car Zeiss, Apple, MSN, Google and of course, Android Inc. Interestingly, a report from The Information has the long lost granddaddy of all things Android calling for a recruitment drive for individuals to join his revisited escapade. A year plus after taking his leave from  , it’s apparent that his brainchild Playground Global will finally start giving back to his own causes. The aforementioned start-up by Rubin serves as a tech hatchery of sorts; enabling those wanting to start their own thing but don’t have the resources, mentorship and funding to make it happen. The Fund itself, managed to raise roughly US$ 300 million from investments by Google (no duh), Hewlett-Packard aka HP, Seagate and others. Leveraging on his venture capital experiences with Redpoint Ventures (where he is a partner), as for now, his cash flow has been streaming to artificial intelligence and smart home segments. Though the aforementioned report states that Rubin still sees the opportunity to enter the Android smartphone market. Folks at the Verge seems to think that the dynamics of the low to midrange market is too volatile to enter, with manufactures popping up every now and then. Thus, maybe his best bet is to make a premium device that’ll hope to take a slice away from the Apple pie. The inhibitors of Mountain View might have something to say about that, since Google themselves have been reported to be working on their own hardware; all the pieces seem to be lining up quite well for the former head of Android Inc. And a possible return to the smartphone scene might amount to a foreseeable re-entry at Google. Jumping at any opportunity to make something great, Rubin has touched the lives of many, even if we fail to realise it. As the master of surprises and all things Android, should we expect anything less from him?"

Several years ago, the idea would be laughable, but today an Android smartphone could actually make or break this once dominate mobile brand. As BlackBerry continues to lose ground in smartphone  , they are pinning   hopes on the  . Their first Android device that comes with a slider keyboard.  The PRIV will be launched in Malaysia   and we’re lucky enough to get a brief hands-on with this new slider device.  At 5.4 inches, the PRIV is the largest smartphone BlackBerry has ever produced and the display features a double curve screen that’s very much like the S6 edge. Though the phone is not wrapped in metal, it does look premium enough for the business-centric user. The back has a grippy texture to it which gives it an assuring feel in the hands, but it took a little while to get used to. When held in the hands, it does have a nice heft to it and despite having a larger screen plus a sliding keyboard mechanism, it is lighter by a couple of grams than the  .  The sliding QWERTY keyboard is the main highlight of the PRIV, and the mechanism and the design are much improved from the old BlackBerry Torch. When sliding out, the PRIV feels slightly top heavy but it didn’t really bother us while typing. Having used a BlackBerry Bold previously, I found the keyboard to be enjoyable to use. Yes, you do type faster with on-screen keyboards with advance prediction technology but it doesn’t give the same tactile satisfaction as the real deal. Another advantage of using a slider keyboard is that you’ll have an unobstructed display to view your stuff since there’s no on-screen keyboard occupying half of the screen. Like the BlackBerry Passport, the keyboard has a couple of neat tricks. It also functions as a touchpad for scrolling and it makes text selection quicker and accurate.  There’s also a text prediction feature that was introduced on BlackBerry 10 and it lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard. In terms of single-handed use, the width of the device is just right and you won’t struggle as much as the BlackBerry Passport that’s super wide.  If you’re not using a physical keyboard, the stock BlackBerry keyboard works just fine and you probably could install 3rd party ones like Swype or SwiftKey. I can imagine myself using the virtual keyboard more frequently for quick social updates, replies or while hooked up to a holder while driving.  In terms of performance, the PRIV that runs on Android 5.1.1 felt quite smooth and I didn’t experience any noticeable lags in the short time using it. The UI is very stock like and they do integrated a couple of native BlackBerry Apps including the unified BlackBerry Hub. If you’re using an Android device currently, you should feel quite at home but BB10 users might take a while to get used to it as   by their CEO John Chen. So is the BlackBerry PRIV the device to get? Probably the one and the only reason to consider is its physical keyboard. I love the feel of it, I really do and it is something that I find myself using regularly for writing stories or replying emails. But for other things when you just need to shoot a quick reply, the on-screen keyboard does the job just fine.  Knowing BlackBerry will definitely   at a premium, we struggle to justify why anyone should get it over the Galaxy Note5. In terms of hardware, the Quad HD display, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is pretty much mainstream. You could get that on the LG G4 that’s currently going for about RM2,299.  Of course, specs is just one factor to consider and the PRIV is also focused on privacy, which they are claiming to be the most if not one of the most secure Android smartphones in the market. Admittedly, I didn’t manage to explore other features such as the 18MP OIS-equipped camera and the DTEK security monitoring tool. Hopefully, we get to do so during the official local launch that’s happening on 8th December. Unless you’re getting this as a company phone, it is quite hard to justify paying more just the keyboard alone. Is there a genuine need for a physical QWERTY keyboard? Several Android brands have tried with the  ,   and the  , but most of them have ceased to exist. The recent attempt is by Samsung with its   for the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+, but with a less ideal implementation."

The model that’s available on DirectD’s website is the 16GB version, and they’ve priced it RM 899 (w/ GST). The colours on offer are Champagne gold and Dark grey. Jogging your memory on this tablet, it has a 7.9-inch screen plastered onto its metal build, the screen itself has a resolution of 2048 x 1536 (326 ppi). Lighter, thinner and overall smaller than its predecessor, it maintains the same screen size but shrinks down the bezels all around the screen. The Mi Pad 2, ditches the plastic yet weighs in at 322grams, when the model it replaces tips in at 360grams. The upgrades continue with an Intel chipset now at the helm, a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 to be precise. Its 16GB internal storage might set off some alarms with the omission of a microSD slot, especially those inclined to have most of their media with them on the go. For photography (if you’re seriously going to consider that with a tablet), it’ll get an 8-megapixel f/2.0 aperture lens on the rear, that will get you up to FHD video recording. As the front has a 5-megapixel lens, in case of those video calling moments or selfies (again, if you’re seriously considering doing that with a tablet). Two speaker grills will be found on the bottom rear and underneath its backing, there’s a 6190 mAh battery, smaller than before. Xiaomi however, promises it’ll get you 100 hours of music listening and almost 12 and a half hours of video watching. Charging the aforementioned battery will be the USB Type-C port and connector, while other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi; sadly, no 4G LTE support makes its way on this device. In terms of software, you’ll find MIUI 7 OS skin, as per usual. Xiaomi has plans on releasing a Windows 10 model soon, but we have no idea when it’ll be announced. Comparing prices abroad in the brand’s domestic market (China), the 16GB sells for roughly RM 662, that’s a RM 200+ premium, that you’re paying for. At the same time, the higher 64GB model retails for about RM 861, so think about that for a second. You pay for what you get it seems and DirectD has the ball in their court, whether or not it’ll be received well, that depends on you guys."

If they keep the pricing in the same bracket as the previous Galaxy A series, we could have a serious contender in the low-to-midrange end of the smartphone market. The Galaxy A series consists of three phones, the  ,  , and   all bearing their new “6” badge that is supposed to represent 2016. We don’t know about you, but this peculiar badging just seems like another way to unnecessarily confuse prospective buyers. At first glance, all three devices share  ’s   flagship’s looks with a metal body sandwiched between two panels of glass. They also feature the rounded edges of the Galaxy S6 and pretty much the same layout we’ve grown to get used to for Samsung devices. All three devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. One thing that we were quite impressed with was the camera. All devices across the announced Galaxy A range feature a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture rear shooter and a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates them is that on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 both come bundled with optical image stabilisation (OIS) for their primary imaging unit. That’s pretty impressive for what looks to be mid-range devices. The best part? They all come in Pink Gold, so if you’ve ever wanted that colour but not the price tag it usually comes with, this could be your chance. That aside, the Galaxy A series begins with what looks like the entry-level Galaxy A3 sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) Super AMOLED display. The device would be powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz processor mated with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. This smartphone will also come with a 2,300 mAh battery. The Galaxy A3 will also have dual-SIM support, but it doesn’t appear to be a hybrid-SIM set up which means that you can have two SIMs and a microSD card. Other goodies include Cat.4 LTE connectivity support and 802.11 b/g/n WiFi. It also comes with Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, but no support for Samsung Pay. Moving up the pecking order comes the mid-range Galaxy A5. As the name implies, the Galaxy A5 is a step up from the Galaxy A3 and features a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (also expandable via microSD up to 128GB). It is also bigger, with a 5.2” full-HD (1920×1080 pixels) Super AMOLED display. Powering it all will be a 2,900 mAh battery with fast charging. Connectivity options include Cat.6 LTE support, 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, this time with support for Samsung Pay. Perhaps one of the key features of this device is the fingerprint scanner, which is quite rare beyond the top end of the smartphone spectrum. Much like the Galaxy A3, the Galaxy A5 also has dual-SIM support. Sitting at the top of the range is the Galaxy A7, which is the largest device, featuring a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel. Under the hood, the smartphone will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. It also has dual-SIM capabilities. Connectivity options are the same as the Galaxy A5, but the Galaxy A7 gets a bigger 3,300 mAh battery also with fast charging. Like its smaller brother the Galaxy A5, the Galaxy A7 also comes with a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay. Though the specific type of processor was not revealed, we have a hunch that it is Samsung’s Exynos processor. The first range of the Galaxy A smartphones were launched towards the end of 2014 and it was Samsung’s first attempt at truly bringing premium build quality to the masses. Before the Galaxy A series was launched, Samsung’s low end devices were all very plasticky and felt cheaply made, which felt like a rude reminder to all those who bought them to work harder. Now, with the rise of Chinese OEMs and their seemingly impossible smartphone value-for-money, especially in the lower end of the spectrum, the Korean electronics giant can’t afford to be complacent in their budget smartphones and risk giving up this lucrative section in the market. If the refreshed 2016 versions of the Galaxy A lineup are to be priced similarly to the previous Galaxy A lineup, we think that it could definitely be very competitive in that market. However, if Samsung prices these devices higher than their previous lineup, you’d be better off with a discounted Galaxy S6 instead. As a reference, when the original Galaxy A lineup was launched, the Galaxy A3 was priced at RM899, while the Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199, and the Galaxy A7 would set you back RM1,499. Bear in mind, these prices were before the implementation of GST and the falling ringgit. Of course, there are other good smartphones at this price bracket as well, such as the  , the   and the  . So the question is, do you buy into Samsung’s idea of a premium mid-range device? We’re pretty keen on these devices, what do you guys think? Let us know in the comments below."

Well, they certainly weren’t kidding when they said it was designed specifically for the 4G LTE user. Hotlink FAST’s starter pack is priced at RM15 and it comes with RM5 preloaded airtime, 300MB preloaded high-speed Internet and offers users a choice of three internet passes. The first plan gives users a 2GB quota for 30 days, then the second plan doubles that up to 4GB and finally the third plan is sort of a “lite” version where it gives users 500MB for 7 days. Call rates are the same across all plans at 6sen/30sec to your ACTIV10 (10 Hotlink/Maxis numbers) and 12sen/30sec to all local networks. SMS is rated at 1sen/SMS to your ACTIV10 contacts and 12sen/SMS to all local networks. Users can also apply for an add-on of either 1GB (RM12), 500MB (RM8), or 300MB (RM5) that will last the duration of your quota cycle. On the website, it states that there will be “No credit drain” and that the “Internet will stop its service once the FAST Internet pass expires.” However, Hotlink informs us that one the quota has been finished, you can still surf the Internet, but at a throttled speed of 64kbps. They explained that although the quota was split between 4G LTE and non-4G LTE speeds, once a user depletes their designated 4G quota, they can continue surfing at 4G speeds but this time it will draw from their “All Networks” quota instead. Unfortunately, the inverse is not true. This means that if you were in a location without 4G LTE coverage, you can only use the “All Networks” quota, which is half of what you are actually paying for. Now we understand that to create a “competitive” plan, compromises have to be made, but surely this doesn’t make any sense. Why would Hotlink want to segregate quota by network type? This just seems like a major inconvenience to the consumer. Perhaps this is a testament to  , but even that seems like a stretch to try and justify their actions. In any case the plans themselves, if you ignore the split quota, is quite reasonable. So, if you have faith in Maxis’ network coverage and would like to sign up for this plan, existing Hotlink users can do so via the Hotlink RED app by going to ‘My Account’ and selecting ‘Change’ next to ‘Rateplan’. Alternatively they can dial *100*6*1# from their mobile devices."

Making inlays into the higher-end market by imploring classier materials like metal, as seen by Huawei and Xiaomi, Vivo hasn’t been left in the dust, releasing the X6 and X6 Plus in light of the current trend. Specs are king though the new duo might have something to say about that, taking a look under their hoods. Let’s start with the smaller X6, that carries a 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display. Under that screen, sits a 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6752 Octa-core processor, mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory. It is made from anodised aluminium and going through 57 steps before getting laser engraved and well deserved polish. Other stock internals include the 13-megapixel sensor on the rear, while sitting under it, is a square cut out, where you’ll find the fingerprint scanner. The rear lenses on both devices will be equip with Phase Detection auto-focus, HDR and a f/2.2 aperture sensor. As a quick flip to the front will reveal the 8-megapixel shutter on the top of the screen. It’ll also natively support a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot, that allows you to swap up the second SIM for a microSD card. The two devices are quite similar, only altering by screen size, internal storage and battery size. That said, the larger X6 Plus has a 5.7-inch screen of the same resolution, while its internal memory gets bumped up to 64GBs. The smaller of the two will carry a 2,400 mAh battery and the vivo X6 Plus will don a 3,000 mAh battery. Vivo’s X6 has a footprint of 147.9 x 73.8 x 6.6mm, as its larger sibling doesn’t pay heed to its dimensions on vivo’s website. Both devices will fun Funtouch OS on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop and retail for the following prices: 2,600 RMB (RM 1,721) – vivo X6 and 3,200 RMB – vivo X6 Plus (RM 2,118). We’re not entirely convinced that people will pick up the device, considering other household names that sell their mid-range devices for roughly the same price. For now this Apple look-alike will only be exclusively sold in China beginning the 7  of December. Then again, all smartphones pretty much have some form of resemblances with one another – or maybe that’s just our opinion."

Captivating tech folks since coming into existence, the USB Type-C port is almost an all-in-one cable/head solution – beam pixels your display, transfer your data and charge up your power-hungry devices. So how does Thunderbolt 3 come into play? Well, utilisation of USB Type-C protocols and Thunderbolt 3 technology will in theory allow data transfers up to 40Gbps (giga bits per second), doubling what we’ve seen on Thunderbolt 2 ports, and quadrupling speeds on USB 3.1. That roughly translates to an uncompressed RAW 4K video (1 hour long) sizing in at 158.2GB transferring around 30 seconds – working out to 5GBps. Talking about driving pixels on screen, it’ll also be capable of displaying two 4K-resolution screens up to a 60Hz refresh rate at the same time and quicken charging for notebooks up to 100 watts. Setting a platform for other types of protocols like DisplayPort, Super Speed USB and PCIExpress, Intel will bank on Thunderbolt to gain traction, as it hasn’t really caught on for most users; except those tech-centric folks out there needing more from their ports. Already realised on smartphones like the OnePlus Two (but don’t use their cables, read about that here), Xiaomi’s Mi 4c, Lumia 950 series, latest Nexuses, PCs and tablets, we hope that USB Type-C catches on quickly. But then again, what about all our old cables and plugs?"

According to the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), this update was not initiated by the app maker and has been infecting Android devices in Singapore over the past few months. After the “update” has been downloaded, the malware will prompt the user to enter confidential information, such as credit card details. Then the malware would take over the affected device and intercepts the one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS to the phone for committing fraudulent transactions. “Criminals have been targeting computer users, but now criminals have turned to targeting Android phone users as banks are pushing out more banking apps for user convenience,” said ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon. It turns out convenience really is becoming the downfall of humanity as we continuously rely on our devices to carry out daily activities. According to Channel NewsAsia, this vulnerability extends beyond just WhatsApp as they claim the malware is disguising itself as an operating system update as well. They reported that about 50 smartphone users have been hit by malware targeting mobile banking customers in the last three months. Besides disguising itself as a WhatsApp update, it also reportedly masquerades as an operating system update for the battery management module. Channel NewsAsia also reports that ABS estimates the average amounts lost by the victims who are customers of major retail banks in Singapore were “a couple of hundred of dollars”, although some victims could have lost several thousand dollars through multiple transactions. The source of these fraudulent transactions appear to originate from Eastern Europe and includes purchases of budget airline tickets. “Jailbroken iPhones or rooted Android [devices] are vulnerable…and in particular Android, because that phone system involves easier download of third-party apps,” said Ong-Ang. The silver lining is that ABS states that banks may refund victims on a case-by-case basis depending on whether or not the victim took the necessary precautions to protect themselves from such attacks. Singapore is awfully close to our home soil of Malaysia, so please be warned and double check your updates before installing them. At the time that this article was written, there has been no official announcement on this matter posted on WhatsApp’s Facebook page, Twitter or Blog. So the moral of the story here is, please make sure that your application updates come directly from the Google Play Store."

Brimming on the fastest 4G LTE award given by Ookla and wanting to show appreciation to their customers, U Mobile will be handing out the aforementioned data free of charge to its customers only for the month of December. Though the only catch is you’d have to be on an existing U Mobile data plan. Extending across all its data services and customers; no matter if you’re on prepaid, postpaid or their broadband plans. As per minimum, for prepaid any UMI or iPlan will make you eligible for this special offer. Postpaid customers, just ensure you’re on the U28, P50 or P70, iPlans or UD plans. Lastly, broadband users on the MB Plan will be allocated the same free 1GB of data. The data will be bundled with your existing package, so there’s no nonsense about using this quota before getting the additional 1GB, not that it matters in the first place. Bear in mind that this is only a year end promo, so your extra 1GB of free data will only last you until New Year’s Eve aka 31st of December, 2015 only. To check up if you’ve actually received the data, you can refer to your UMB, SMS and U Mobile app. It’s no question that the orange telco learnt a thing or two from Digi’s offer that required customers to “activate” their free data, after their network outage – so kudos U Mobile for making it easier for your customers.

As a gesture of appreciation to its subscribers, they are giving out   for the month of December. So how fast is the fastest? Speedtest has finally revealed the numbers along with the rank of our current fixed and mobile operators in the country. Full details after the break.  Starting with mobile networks that are running on 4G LTE, U Mobile is ranked #1 with an average download speed of 22.58Mbps with uploads of 10.34Mbps. Following in 2nd place is Celcom with 19.46Mbps downloads and Maxis holding on to third place at 18.20Mbps. Meanwhile, Digi takes the last place at 17.49Mbps.   For fixed broadband, TM takes up the Top 3 which is a mixture of various identifiers that lead back to Telekom Malaysia. Looking at the speeds, it is safe to assume that all 3 listings are predominantly Unifi subscribers on the highest 20Mbps Unifi plan. This is then followed by Maxis and YTL Communications, that operates Yes 4G WiMAX. Surprisingly Time Broadband didn’t make the list and we feel they could be among the Top 5 if it wasn’t for TM’s duplicated entries.  To recap on the  , Speedtest measures the average performance of each telco based on the fastest technology possible which is 4G LTE. So in theory, this wouldn’t take into account of speedtests conducted on 3G and on older non-LTE enabled devices. For fixed broadband ISP, the performance is calculated based on the top 10% of each network’s speedtest results. This according to Speedtest is to accurate represent customers that subscribe to the highest tier/package offered by the ISP.  While 4G telcos are   the widest, fastest and best network, Speedtest is probably the best independent indicator for now. Another glaring difference between Malaysia versus other countries is that our mobile telcos are delivering faster speeds than our fixed broadband providers. In most cases, the fixed broadband providers in US, Canada, UK and Australia are clocking around 100Mbps or at least 2-3X faster than their fastest 4G operators. So what do you guys think of the verdict?"

I completely understand this desire to milk every last drop out of your prized cow simply because money is hard to make in this world where piracy is rampant. Generally, many of these spin-offs tend to fall flat and the way I see it, there are two big reasons why this happens. The first is that the show doesn’t live up to the hype. It’s hard to follow in the footsteps of something as big as, say,   for example (we’re looking at you  ). Secondly, it doesn’t eventually break off from the original and find and identity of its own, or that special niche that makes a show special. In the world of smartphones, it seems, that there exists this same desire to spin off into various other versions of an OEM’s flagship or popular device. Some spin-offs are designed to make their flagship devices more accessible with lower price points by omitting one or two key features but keeping the feel the same. Others try to incorporate one new key feature that’s absent from the main device."

Spending all your hard earned money on a fake device has to be one of the most heartbreaking things ever, so   Malaysia teamed up with the Ministry of Domestic Trade Co-operatives and Consumerism (KPDNKK) to crack down on these counterfeit bandits. On the 20th of November at 11am, the operation began and both OPPO Malaysia and KPDNKK raided two locations, Plaza Alam Sentral in Shah Alam as well as Terminal 1 in Seremban. KPDNKK’s Intellectual Property Enforcement Division head Othman Nawang said that based on the information and intelligence gathered during the KPDNKK’s investigation, they had conclusive evidence to carry out the raid on these two locations suspected of selling counterfeit OPPO products. Sure enough the raid was a success as the joint task force uncovered 8 counterfeit devices worth over RM4,200. This may only seem like a fraction of the earlier reported 644 counterfeit devices, but at least these are devices that people haven’t spent their hard earned money on, so at it’s a start if nothing else. Among the phones confiscated, were fake versions of the OPPO Find 7 and OPPO N3. Othman said that the ministry had sent out recon teams to investigate the two locations and they found that these counterfeit devices were being sold between RM400 and RM700, which is a stark contrast to their original price range of RM1,000 to RM2,098. According to OPPO Overseas Customer Service manager Boyce Lee, this was the first raid to crack down on counterfeit phones conducted by KPDNKK. “Ever since we received reports in early January, we have been in close contact with the Ministry to further strike down these counterfeiting activities,” he said. “We have brought this to the Ministry’s attention that the circulation of counterfeit products are getting worse with each passing day and we seek legal actions to be taken by the authority.” Boyce added that to the layman, the counterfeit products’ design were almost indistinguishable from original OPPO products, but the devices’ poor design quality and unstable features tainted the OPPO name. He added that there was a possibility that the cheap parts used could have direct harmful or toxic effects on the user."

However, clearly pushing into the mobile sector proved difficult even for the telco giant, so TM have instead decided to take baby steps and only start user trials and network readiness tests come December. However, according to TM group chief executive officer Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, development of Telekom Malaysia’s overall LTE network rollout is on track, with the core LTE network being managed and planned for future growth by  . “We are now building on that core to roll out nationwide, starting with urban areas and adjacent to existing base stations,” said Zamzamzairani. This isn’t TM’s first foray into the LTE technology as they had launched their very own LTE-based 4G broadband service,   back in August of last year. TMgo was launched while the TM-P1 partnership was still pending approval, so it ran at a lower 850MHz frequency instead of the usual 1800MHz/2600MHz bands used by mainstream 4G operators. Now, with the full support of P1 at their backs, TM can really flex its muscles and push their way into the four-horse race. As with any industry, having more competition will only be beneficial for the consumer. With more competition, telcos have to tread carefully to keep their services relevant and avoid being run over by competition. With a major telecommunications player like TM entering the mobile services scene, you can expect the existing players who are currently locked in a four-way-free-for-all for LTE supremacy, to scramble and make sure the upstart new challenger doesn’t take their crown away from them. In any case, if TM successfully makes their way into the mobile sector, it can only mean good things for us consumers. We can realistically expect more competitive pricing,   and probably a whole lot more drama."

When it comes to actual usage, speed is probably more important in our current connected age.  So who is the fastest? A popular internet speed testing tool has just named Malaysia’s fastest mobile network and the winner might surprise you. 
 U Mobile, Malaysia’s youngest mobile telco was just awarded the Fastest Mobile Network in the country by Ookla’s Speedtest. An impressive feat considering U Mobile is the last among the 4 telcos  . Despite not having extensive 4G coverage, U Mobile is capable of delivering high-speeds up to 42Mbps with its   network.  We’ve mentioned   that the current 4G coverage race is getting rather silly. Any telco can throw numbers but ultimately what does it mean to the average consumer? For example, when Digi reclaimed the widest 4G LTE title, they   that customers can expect 5Mbps speeds on 4G and more than 15Mbps on 4G LTE-A. Those numbers are low for 4G standards and they are already achievable with current 3G technologies. After all, it is not what you have, but what you do with it.  At the moment, Ookla has yet to publish the full Malaysian report on their   page but we assume that they used the same methodology here as other countries. The results are derived from the average performance recorded on the fastest technology possible which is 4G. Each test are aggregated by averaging each user’s test result at several locations each day. This prevents manipulation of repeated speedtests by a handful of users from affecting the overall result. You can read up how Ookla determine who’s the fastest over  . So U Mobile subscribers, do you agree with this verdict?"

Using a globally recognised encryption system, it gives you a peace of mind when communicating with your peers. So how does Zipit Chat work? Read on to find out. Zipit Chat is currently available for Android devices and you can download it directly from the  . For new users, activation is as easy as entering your mobile number and enter the verification code that’s sent to you. You’ll receive a unique Zipit ChatID that looks like a BlackBerry PIN and you can set your password between 6-16 digits.  Once that’s out of the way, you can start inviting your family and friends from your contact list. There are plenty of instant messaging apps out there but nobody does security better than Zipit Chat. Encrypted with AES 256 technology, your messages are impossible for anyone to intercept which gives you a true end to end encryption.  When transmitting sensitive information such as password, pins or confidential information, you can set a Self-Destruct Timer from 30 seconds up to 10 minutes. For an extra layer of security, Zipit Chat even disables your phone screenshot function, so that nobody could snap a copy of it.  Emails are still relevant these days and for business users, there are messages that are highly P&C. We’ve heard stories of email accounts being hacked and if it does happen to you, Zipit Chat can keep your email threads secured with the same military grade encryption. The content will be scrambled including its attachments and only the intended sender and recipient can view it fully via Zipit Chat.  If you’re unconvinced, Celcom had earlier issued a challenge for anyone to decrypt 3 messages that are encrypted by Zipit Chat and nobody has managed to crack it so far. So even if some snooping agency or hackers have gain access to your inbox, it would take probably years to figure it out by brute force.  Most people would have different logins and passwords for various accounts including online banking. If you find it hard to keep track of all of them, you jot them down safely under Zipit Chat’s Secure Notes. Similar to its email feature, it scrambles your note into a bunch of unreadable text, thus ensuring only you are able to read it.  While it is not recommended to store passwords on your phone, at least you know there’s a safer way to keep from prying eyes.  Having your phone stolen is bad enough and the last thing you want is to have your personal data stolen. With Zipit Chat, your messages, notes and emails are always password protected at all times. When left inactive, it will constantly require your pin number to launch the app. For another layer of secrecy, there’s a rather clever Stealth Mode which removes the Zipit Chat icon completely from your smart phone. To access the app again, just dial #*# followed by your pin number and then hit the call button."

Easily pointing to the manufacturer not wanting to bite themselves in the butt by selling the Nexus at a lower price, to keep some emphasis on their other smartphones.

Internal memory options were listed above, while it’ll carry 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM for multitasking and app switching. In terms of photography, there will be a 12.3-megapixel sensor on the rear that’s equip with 1.55 micron pixels and an aperture of f/2.0 for those low light situations. Accompanying the camera module will be a dual-tone LED and laser auto focus as well. Taking a look at the front, an 8-megapixel f2.4 shutter will greet you near the top; this sensor will carry a 1.4-micron pixel size. For audio, it’ll boast dual front facing stereo speakers on the top and bottom, while Huawei also deploys USB Type-C for data and charging utilisation. The port itself, will help charge up the 3,450mAh battery that’s inside, while   the future-proof port will help bring it up to speed, just a little quicker – only on particular   though; nope those Quick Charge 2.0 charging heads won’t be of any use. The last bell and whistle would be the Nexus Imprint finger print sensor, that sits below the rear camera lens. A feature that pretty much lined up with Google’s vision to make native fingerprint scanning a thing on Android M."

These three devices were announced during IFA in September and today they have finally arrived on our shores. The entry-level Acer Liquid Z330 has a 4.5-inch FWVGA (854×480 pixels) screen, with a quad-core 1.1GHz Snapdragon 210 processor with 1GB of RAM running on the inside. The Liquid Z330 will come with 8GB of internal storage that is expandable via microSD. In terms of optics, the device will have a 5MP rear unit with an LED flash and 5MP fixed focus front camera. It will also come with a 2,000 mAh replaceable battery that Acer rates at up to 11 hours of talk time and up to 430 hours of standby time. The second device launched is the slightly more powerful Acer Liquid Z530 which is powered by a quad-core MediaTek MT6735 clocked at 1.3GHz paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, also expandable via microSD. It will also come with a 5-inch HD IPS panel pushing 1280×720 pixels.  In the camera department the Liquid Z530 has a slight upgrade of it’s little brother as it comes with an 8-megapixel f/2.0 main camera with an LED flash to help it out in low lighting. The front-facing camera has also been upgraded to an 8-megapixel 84-degree wide angle lens to help with those we-fies. Powering these hardware components will be a 2,420 mAh battery rated at 12 hours of talktime and 630 hours of standby time. At the top of the Liquid Z food chain sits the Liquid Z630 which comes with a huge 4,000 mAh replaceable battery. That massive battery will be powering a 5.5″ HD IPS display (1280×720 pixels) which brings it to a pixel density of 267 ppi. Under the hood, the top-of-the-range device will feature the same processor, RAM and internal storage as the Liquid Z530. The camera will also be an 8-megapixel front and rear camera that supports 1080p video recording. The front camera will also have a wide-angle lens. All three devices will support dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity and comes running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Acer’s Liquid UI running over it. Both the Liquid Z530 and Liquid Z630 will support USB OTG, while the Liquid Z630 will also allow OTG charging from that massive battery, similar to  ‘s   and  , something that is all the rage now it seems. The entry-level Liquid Z330 will cost RM439 while the higher spec Liquid 530 will set you back RM559. The top-of-the-range Liquid Z630 will be priced at RM659. These three phones are available right now at all authorised Acer dealers. As a little surprise, Acer also announced the Liquid X2, which will sport a 5.5″ HD IPS screen, powered by a 64bit octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The device supports triple-SIM 4G LTE, which is one of the first devices to have such support in Malaysia. Optics are also a big upgrade over the Liquid Z series as it sports a 13MP f/1.8 front and rear camera with an LED flash.  This Liquid X2 will draw power from a 4000 mAh battery. Acer announces that the device will come in two colours, black and gold, and is set to be available January 2016."

Those with a large net-worth need a little more from their smartphones and Priv owners can now join the upper class – as if adding gold to your smartphone elevates your status. While production quality of the video posted by Karalux seems to be subpar, they showcase the Priv with other devices that they’ve pimped out before. Basically the 24K gold replaces any metal accents that you’d find on the BlackBerry’s first Android device – which isn’t a lot to begin with, mainly on the back of the slide out, the rear camera and the top and bottom of the smartphone. As talked about earlier, existing Priv owners in Vietnam, will get to deck their units out for a cool US$ 350 (RM 1,491), though if you’re in the country and want the gold-plated Priv, it’ll cost you US$ 1,100 (RM 4,687). International buyers, it’ll cost you US$ 1,300 (RM 5,540), if you want the same thing shipped to you.

The Mate 8 will be another aluminium unibody device that has come from the Chinese manufacturer but it’ll carry the newly released processor from their subsidiary Kirin, promised to blow away any of the current SoCs out there. Taking a close-up look at the 950 processor, it’s an Octa-core chipset that runs 4 cores at 2.3GHz and 4 other cores clocked to 1.8GHz. The manufacturer says that through the new “i5” coprocessor, the device will have a better power management system and allow speech recognition as well. Underneath along with the processor, are a combination of either 3GB RAM/32 GB internal storage, 4GB/64GB or 4GB/128GB, depending which model that you fancy. The 6-inch screen will run a native 1920 x 1080 resolution, and feature 2.5D curved glass from edge to edge all around the display. You won’t find much else on the front, aside from the 8-megapixel camera near the top. Moving onto the rear, there will be a fingerprint sensor located a step below the Sony IMX298 16-megapixel rear lens module. Huawei is finally migrating to Android’s new OS, Marshmallow, in the form of a EMUI 4.0 skin and feature a huge 4,000 mAh battery. Once it hits it’ll be available in 4 colours; Champagne Gold, Moonlight Silver, Space Grey and Mocha Brown. Retail price is set to 3,199 RMB (RM 2,118), 3,699 RMB (RM 2,449) and 4,399 RMB (RM 2,912)  – based on the memory configurations we’ve listed out earlier. You’ll have to wait till Q1 of next year before it arrives in stores for the international market, while it is readily available in China already. The prices seem daunting for something that would come from the smartphone manufacturer but it seems that they want to step up their quality and prices have to reflect that – compared to last year’s Ascend Mate 7, it gets a RM 1k price jump but will consumer bite?

Rory Lee,Waze and Google Maps could expose Malaysia to “external threats” says UMNO MP,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/waze-and-google-maps-could-expose-malaysia-to-external-threats-says-umno-mp/,"external threats,Google Maps,Google Maps Malaysia,navigation,parliament,Raime Unggi,TPP,trans-pacific partnership,umno,Waze","Industry in General,Mobile Apps",2015-11-26,"When we announced that  ‘ offline navigation had finally rolled out in Malaysia, many rejoiced, but apparently not everyone is happy with being able to rely on navigation applications just a little more. UMNO lawmaker Datuk Raime Unggi said in Parliament today that Malaysian dependency on navigation apps to find their way around the maze-like labyrinth of Kuala Lumpur’s bustling city centre, was possibly exposing our country to “external threats” from foreign countries. The Tenom MP proceeded to elaborate that this was because when users use these applications for location searching, it indirectly provides information about Malaysia to external quarters such as the United States and Israel. The reason he cited these two countries, we assume, is because Google is headquartered in the US while Google owned Waze was developed in Israel. Kuala Selangor MP Datuk Irmohizam Ibrahim said that our nation cannot compromise when it comes to national security. He also brings up the issue about the extent to which our laws could protect such information leaks. “How far do we have laws that prevent information leaks in the usage of Google Map(s) and Waze?” he asks the Parliament. “Are there laws to make sure national security protected in the usage of such apps?” Communications and Multimedia Deputy Minister Datuk Jailani Johari reassured the concerned MPs that it was up to the users to decide how much personal information they wished to share and that they could choose to stop using the apps if they disagreed with the privacy policies. Jailani adds that the apps function based on privacy policies that are agreed upon by the individual and the application provider, be it Waze or Google Maps. If the user decides that they do not want to continue using the service, they can terminate the agreement and the provider will no longer hold on to their data. “We have yet to receive any report on any apps used for spying purposes. ‘The real issue is that our users are fond of over-sharing private information on the Internet. This results in the information being misused. As a smart internet user, we should have our own controls,” said Jailani, who is also the MP for Hulu Terengganu. Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed also downplayed the danger claimed to be posed by the navigation applications, saying that these applications have helped citizens navigate more than it helps terrorists. He did however say that he acknowledges the security concerns, but he feels that the pros outweigh the cons. Kuala Krai MP Dr Mohd Hatta Ramli raised another concern that if the government decides to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) it could give foreign countries access to Malaysian personal data collected by the aforementioned navigation applications. “Our personal data used to be kept within the borders of the country,” he said. “Now with TPP, we must not allow it to be taken out of the county. We have a lot personal data that we would not like to share with other people.”. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a 12-nation free trade agreement backed by the United States which is set to be debated in Malaysia in January next year. Opposition MP for Kelana Jaya Wong Chen said that the free trade treaty required Malaysia to allow transfer of electronic information to foreign countries. “TPP prohibition on data localisation laws (Article 14.13) essentially means personal info that is hosted abroad would be subject to different laws on privacy,” he said. Wong further explained that under this, your personal data could be subjected to US surveillance laws such as the US Patriot Act, instead of our own privacy laws."

Rory Lee,OnePlus offering refunds for their problematic USB Type-C cables,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/27/oneplus-offering-refunds-for-their-problematic-usb-type-c-cables/,,,2015-11-27,"Awhile back,   came under fire from critics and the tech community in general when it was discovered that their  . This could possibly lead to damage if used with any device other than the  . Leading the charge was Google employee Benson Leung who had embarked on a crusade to purge the world of non-compliant USB Type-C cables. His method involved ordering cables off Amazon then testing them to see if they met the USB standards. When he arrived at the OnePlus cable, he found that even a cable manufactured by a proper smartphone manufacturer did not meet proper USB Type-C standards. Needless to say, the Caped Cable Crusader rained sweet justice down on the Chinese manufacturer, bringing them to their knees (metaphorically speaking, of course). Yesterday, OnePlus finally caved and admitted that their cables were indeed non-compliant, but it seems the USB Vigilante still isn’t entirely satisfied. OnePlus graciously accepted Benson and the community’s criticism, openly admitting on their official forum that their USB Type-C cables and adapters were using a 10kΩ resistor instead of the 56kΩ resistor detailed in version 1.1 of the USB Type-C port standard. This message came straight from the top, no less. According to the post, the issue with resistors was that the cables and adapter were only designed for a maximum of 2 amps of power, which is how much the OnePlus 2’s charger supports. However, when used on other devices that allow fast-charging, the resistor will let the devices try to draw more power than a power source may allow. Ultimately, this could result in damage to said power source (such as 3rd-party cables, USB ports, etc.) if they do not have an internal mechanism to self-regulate the amount of power flowing to or from them. OnePlus added that typically, if a charger has the CE, UL, or CCC markings, it should be certified and safe to use. The OEM also compiled their findings into a simple and easy-to-understand table detailed below: Unfortunately for OnePlus though, it appears that they didn’t get everything right. Ah Benson, do keep up the good work! In any case, OnePlus is offering a refund on the affected products purchased through the OnePlus website. Do note though that the cables that came bundled in the box with your OnePlus 2 will not be eligible for a refund. This is simply because OnePlus remains firm in saying that the cables and adaptors are entirely safe to use with the OnePlus 2 and that the problem was compatibility with other devices. Based on the post, the refund appears to only be available for customers in North America, Europe, India and China, and will only be offered by OnePlus until the end of December this year. For those of you thinking of cashing in to get some cables at discounted Black Friday prices and then getting a full priced refund for them, tough luck, because it appears that both the cable and the adapter are out-of-stock on the OnePlus website."

Many owe this bad performance to the OEM’s disappointing 2015 flagship the   and how HTC didn’t go back to the drawing board when developing it. Perhaps it was because they were stubborn, or perhaps it was because of a lack of communication between the company and their customers that put them in this predicament. Well, HTC must’ve figured it was the latter because the smartphone manufacturer just announced that they are opening up the HTC Preview Program to all in the hope that it would help them better understand what exactly their customers want. In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on social, news and entertainment aggregation website Reddit, HTC’s USA Preview Team announced their intention to find a new way to connect back to the Android community, as well as answer any questions the community might have about this program. In a nutshell, this program will allow HTC fans to get their hands on the company’s latest software and hardware before it is released, in exchange for daily use and feedback. Yes, hardware too. In the   hosted on the Preview website, it is stated that while those selected to participate in this program will occasionally require participants to use their own devices, depending on the specific HTC Preview projects, the OEM may also provide loaner devices too. It seems like a good opportunity to get your hands on some unreleased HTC hardware. Of course, as the primary purpose of this program is to identify daily user habits, user information and feedback has to be collected by the company. However, HTC has clarified that while there will be logs running in the background to collect data on network/signal strength, battery information, usage times and apps used, they will not collect any sensitive personal data or tell what you are looking at on your screen unless you explicitly take a screenshot to share with them. They also clarified that one of the reasons they have opened up the HTC Preview program is to have actual hard facts and feedback on what their users want. This is so that they have actual data backing them when they tell executives what their customers want, which in turn makes it easier to have an impact on change within the company. HTC also reassured the community that they will take the feedback from this program very seriously and will tweak their upcoming devices to improve based on that information. They also added that if feedback for a device is overwhelmingly negative, they would even use that information to evaluate a product’s release. This is a very bold move by HTC, bringing what looks like, on the surface at least, more transparency to their product development. It should also ignite a warm fire in the hearts of HTC fans who have been clamouring for their voices to be heard and who are passionate about helping the company grow past these hard times. However, as this has only just been launched, the actual effectiveness of this program remains to be seen. They could just be all talk and have no action. For whatever it’s worth, let’s hope this does help them get back on its feet because it would be such a shame if the company, which had brought us one of the most beautiful metal unibody designs, fell out of the race. For those of you who are interested, you can also participate in the HTC Preview program, just head on over to   and follow the instructions there."
Rory Lee,6 Tips to stay connected during floods,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/6-tips-to-stay-connected-during-floods/,"banjir,CFM,flood,Flooding,Malaysia Flood,MCMC,mobile tips during floods,poor signal during floods,tips during flood",Industry in General,2015-11-26,"The rainy season is in full effect now with many parts of the country experiencing constant downpour each day. And with the tide phenomenon that is expected to occur in the Straits of Tebrau from the 24th to 30th of November is likely to mean more trouble for affected locals. Malaysia has had its fair share of flood woes in the past and since it’s the rainy season again, the folks at Communications and Multimedia Consumer Forum of Malaysia (CFM) have decided to take a more proactive role to ensure effective communication during these potentially trying times remains strong. CFM have sent us a long list of tips that are designed to help the public better manage as well as communicate more effectively during times of emergency. We at SoyaCincau.com value your time and as a result have condensed their tips for your convenience. Here are the 6 communication tips during floods:   CFM strongly urges the public to be patient when communicating. If your call or msg is unable to get through to the other person, wait awhile before trying again. The communication infrastructure is put under a lot of stress during times of emergency and can get congested due to the high volume of messages. So, if everyone incessantly tries to communicate, it becomes less likely that any messages will get through at all. It’s sort of like traffic congestion, really. If everyone leaves their office at 6pm, then nobody would be getting anywhere anytime soon.   We know some of you have completely abandoned the SMS service, because frankly who needs it when you have free messaging applications like Whatsapp? But, CFM advises users to use this ‘retro’ form of communication during emergencies because they take up less bandwidth and will put a lighter load on the communication system. If we were to build on our traffic jam analogy, a call would be that large BMW 750Li, while a text message would only be a little Vespa zipping along between traffic.   Needless to say, without power, that flagship smartphone you paid thousands of ringgit for is about as useful as a brick. Probably less useful since its so light and thin, so CFM encourages its consumers to charge up your devices and power banks when there is power. That way, if and when the power goes down, you will still have enough juice to keep your phones running. Of course, saving power also means using your devices less often. Save them for emergencies and only use them when you absolutely have to, not to post a selfie on Instagram. If your device has power saving mode, it is recommended to enable it to extend its battery life.    Speaking of Instagram, CFM implores everyone to limit their online activity to avoid coverage congestion. Actions like uploading photos, videos or sharing voice clips on social media consumes a lot of bandwidth and by now we’re sure you all know what that means. Yep, you guessed it, congestion. 10 points to Gryffindor!   We’ve all seen disaster movies. We’ve all seen the scene where the protagonists are trapped in a danger zone and are waiting by the radio with bated breath for information that could very well save them. Well, it turns out there is some truth in those scenes as CFM says that it becomes an important source of news during an emergency. However, they have stated that consumers should ensure that they have an adequate battery supply before doing so. You can also get the latest updates from local emergency response services or RELA members so it’s a good idea to keep their contact handy.   Well, keep calm. There really is no use in panicking during an emergency.   CFM informs us that they aren’t sitting on their hands at their end either. The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (KKMM) and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) are working with all Telecommunications Service Providers (SPs) to provide temporary base communication station towers at several affected areas as a support to enhance the coverage during floods or natural disasters. However, they did add that priority will be given to places that are in need of it the most. They also ask for your understanding that natural disasters can cause unavoidable damage to infrastructure in affected areas which would result in less than stellar coverage. Teamwork is key in these situations so do be considerate and work together to overcome times of emergency."

The   is their biggest yet with a gigantic 18.4″ screen and it runs on Android. In their latest ad, Samsung isn’t calling it a TV or a Tablet, but simply “entertainment reimagined”. Since both TV and tablets are generally media consumption devices, Samsung attempts to blur the line between the two, offering a larger screen experience in a somewhat “portable” form factor. Weighing at about 2.65kg, it is heavier than your average mobile device. With a handle at the back of the kickstand, Samsung wants it to be as easy to carry as a shopping bag. According to Samsung, the Galaxy View is designed to be used from an arm’s reach, hence they have created a new UI with larger icons and text for a more intuitive experience. Furthermore, the way people watch TV is much different now, with more opting to look for content when they want it, rather than to follow broadcast programs.  For gaming, the Galaxy View has an S Console game app, where you can project your mobile games onto a bigger screen. It turns your smart phone into a controller for a console gaming-like experience. While the hardware could potentially replace a TV, it is a pity that Samsung hasn’t included the essential TV ports such as HDMI. This could have opened up the Galaxy View as a portable TV for console gaming or to connect to other AV equipment.  In the US, it is currently priced at US$499 which is about RM2,110. It gets a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM and there’s a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD. With an on-board 5,700mAh battery, the Galaxy View can be used unplugged up to 8 hours. If it ever comes here, would you be interested to get one?"

If you’re in the market for a large screened smartphone, you’d probably have the   on your wish-list, so why bother searching any further? With its great dual-edged glass display that tapers off at the sides, it’ll definitely be worthy as that special gift for someone special. Once 2016 hits, you’re going to be out and about again, taking all life gives you. Jostling between your work and play is already tough to begin with but with a premium pocket companion like the Galaxy S6 edge+, it’ll get easier. Designed with high-end aluminium and glass, the combo makes the 5.7-inch device a pleasure to hold in your hands. Captivate friends and family with its QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED screen, as you browse through shopping lists, and let them notice the nimbleness of the package. You’ll notice the dual-edged display immediately and it offers some great functionality too, making sure your loved ones are just a tap away. Measuring at 154 x 75.8 x 6.9mm, it has a small footprint for a device with such a large screen, while only weighing 153grams. Light but still sturdy in its make, with materials that are now more durable than its predecessor. 
Multi-tasking won’t be a hitch either, with its class-leading Exynos 7420 64-bit Octa-core processor and 4GB RAM that goes along with. Aimed at giving you a stutter free experience as you switch between all your online shopping applications, browsers and entertainment options. With those specs, you’d expect the Galaxy S6 edge’s camera to flaunt the same resume, and it does. Testing the same sensor found on the Korean company’s other flagship, the Galaxy Note5; our readers voted for it to be the best of the flagships – across all the other major players. Pleasing you with the 16-megapixel main camera, it won’t show any compromises while your capturing and sharing photos during the holiday season. Feel free to take images of the things you’d purchase and ask for opinions on gift ideas, the camera won’t disappoint. The front sensor will hold its ground too with selfies abundant during the festive period, though some might not be as lucky; having to spend this season apart, due to unforeseen circumstances – fret not, the 5-megapixel lens allows 4K video recording, so no pixelated videos during sharing. All that moving around while recording or taking photos during parties won’t hamper the main camera either, since it comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS); there’s also HDR (high dynamic range) on board the two cameras, so the objects and backgrounds of your pictures will have just the right mix of exposure, giving you the best photo. Share all the splendour with its wide array of connectivity options; you’ll find 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0 and the works on board, never leaving you in a spot with cellular reception (unless it’s your telco coverage). The device will charge up quickly too, with Samsung’s own fast charge technology on the 3000 mAh battery. You can ditch cables too, if you have the supported Qi Wireless charging dock."
Rory Lee,Q Founder: Fossil’s first foray into Android Wear,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/q-founder-fossils-first-foray-into-android-wear/,"Android,Android Wear,Connected,fossil,Fossil Q Founder,Q Founder,Smart Watch,SmartWatch,TAG Heuer,TAG Heuer Connected","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Smart Watch",2015-11-26,"When the idea of a smartwatch started gaining traction, many suspected that the watchmaking industry would eventually try to take it over. It seemed like a logical thing to do to keep up with the times.  thought so too and while initial models of their Q line hardly looked high-tech, their latest smartwatch, the Q Founder, does. The Q Founder is Fossil’s first ever smartwatch to be powered by Android Wear and it’s the watchmaker’s attempt at mating “modern functionality and classic good looks”. With this watch, Fossil hoped to give smartwatches the “high-end-yet-mass-appeal design Fossil’s known for”. Previous devices in the Q line, namely the Q Reveler and Q Dreamer bracelets, and the Q Grant watch were made to be jewelry first, technology second and it showed. To the untrained eye, it is nearly impossible to know that they were high tech smart wearables. Fossil’s new Q Founder though, is entirely different. This device sports a full touch screen interface on its round watch face similar to that of the  . Unfortunately, it also has the Moto 360’s flat tire design, instead of a fully round display. If classic watch looks were what Fossil was going for then the Q Founder does pull that off quite well. It certainly doesn’t look like it was   or one that could be  . It is rather large though, coming in with a 46mm-diameter face and a 13mm-thick case which is the same as the expensive TAG Heuer Connected. Feature-wise, the smartwatch has a built in activity tracker that will help you track your steps, count calories and all the other good stuff. It’s also IP67 water and dust resistant so it’ll at least give you some peace of mind. Fossil estimates that the device will last one day on a single charge of the device’s 400 mAh battery. In terms of what actually powers the device, no information is available aside from the fact that it is likely an Intel processor due to their partnership. The device will also have 4GB of internal storage, an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Traditional watchmakers often   as more of a plaything that wouldn’t stand the test of time. However, with   and Fossil’s Q line, it appears that takeover has begun. Fossil’s Q Founder is officially on sale at their website for USD295 (around RM1,243) but unfortunately, they don’t ship to Malaysia. Shipping to Singapore, however, is listed as an option on the website, albeit at a higher price of SGD665.50 (around RM1,991). When we tried to place an order though, there was an alert from the product page informing us that shipping to Singapore was currently unavailable."
Arif Lee,TM wants to help you get a limited edition Star Wars Battlefront PlayStation 4 bundle,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/tm-wants-to-help-you-get-a-limited-edition-star-wars-battlefront-playstation-4-bundle/,"Battlefront,game,gaming,Playstation 4,PlayStation 4 Malaysia,promotion,PS4,star wars,Star Wars Battlefront PlayStation 4 Malaysia,Star Wars Battlefront PS4 Malaysia,Star Wars Malaysia,Star Wars PlayStation 4,Star Wars PlayStation 4 Malaysia,Star Wars: Battlefront,Telekom Malaysia,TM,TM Playstation 4,TM Star Wars PS4,TM Unifi,TM UniFi advanced plan,TM UniFi PlayStation 4,Unifi,Unifi Advanced,UniFi PlayStation 4,UniFi PlayStation 4 Star Wars,Unifi promo,UniFi PS4","Cool stuff,Players on the Field,Promotions,Sony,TM,UniFi",2015-11-26,"The Force has been relatively strong of late, with trailers, memorabilia, and even gaming consoles all paying homage to the world of Star Wars. Fittingly, our dear landline and internet provider,   now has a   for the Star Wars Battlefront PS4 bundle only for their customers. That said, if you weren’t one of the lucky few that picked up your unit on Sony Malaysia’s online store, since units are now  , here’s another chance. Fans of the Battlefront series will finally have their hand at playing the reboot to the original from 2004. Rated an 8/10 from IGN, the game itself is considered to be a first-person/third-person shooter and you’ll be engulfed in the battle of the Rebel Alliance against the Imperial Fleet. Dart across the worlds of Endor, Hoth, Tatooine and Sullust with characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Leia Organa and Darth Vader. Then again, you could easily pick up the game by itself and go on playing on your regular PS4 but that wouldn’t be as fun. Adding some great visuals on the 500GB console unit itself, with Vader himself being illustrated onto the front of the unit and one special DUALSHOCK 4 coloured in black, red and white to match the character. Other than the regular cables, AC power head and a one-year warranty, Sony also throws in four Star Wards Classics Voucher Cards that’ll give you access to exclusive games from yesteryears: Oh and they also add a 12-month subscription for PlayStation Plus in the bundle as well. Looks like there will be a lot of gaming happening towards the end of the year, what more with the holiday season coming around; this could definitely make a great gift for someone who loves the Star Wars series and gaming in general. Do note that this pre-order is only open to new or existing UniFi Advance Plan customers and the pre-order system will only begin at 3 pm on the 1st of December. No pricing has been mentioned by TM but as a reference point, Sony Malaysia lists it at RM 1,849 (w/ GST).

For Malaysia, the OnePlus X is officially priced at RM1,288 and it comes 16GB of storage. Oddly the spec-sheet listed on the page mentions 64GB of storage instead. On top of that, Lazada is giving an additional RM25 off if you use the oneplusx25 promo code. For those who can’t wait, the folks at DirectD had started   the same device a couple of weeks back for RM1,299. Boasting craftsmanship with premium materials, the OnePlus X is their compact offering with a 5″ display and it is available only in Onyx version. Spec-wise, it is quite similar with its first flagship killer, the OnePlus One. The AMOLED screen pushes a standard Full HD resolution and it runs on a 2.3GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 801 processor mated to 3GB of RAM. Unlike the One, the OnePlus X has a dual-SIM slot supporting 4G LTE, with the 2nd slot doubling up as a microSD expansion.  The rear camera is a 13MP f/2.2 shooter while selfies are taken with its front 8MP camera. On-board there’s a non-removable 2,525mAh capacity battery and the side also features a 3-step alert slider that was first introduced on the OnePlus 2. For charging and data transfer, it settles for a more traditional microUSB port. Out of the box, it runs on OxygenOS that’s based on Android 5.1.1.
