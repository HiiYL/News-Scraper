2016-03-08,http://blog.contexttravel.com/getting-around-athens/,"Getting Around Athens – Sightseeing by foot, taxi or metro","One might assume that  Athens , with its millennia of continuous history, would be a difficult-to-navigate warren. But, in fact, the center of Athens is extremely compact and easy to get around. Most of Athens’ attractions are located in and around the city center, so with a few quick tips it’s relatively simple to get around. 
 Walking is the most pleasant way to see Athens’ tourist attractions, and it’s also an incredibly efficient means of getting around in the city center. The  Acropolis  sits in the middle of the city and provides a great beacon: You always know where you are in the city relative to the Acropolis.  One of our favorite walks is from  Monument of Lysicrates  to the  Agora , winding through the magical side streets of  Anafiotika . Tucked into the side of the Acropolis, this romantic cascade of narrow streets feels like a step back in time. Some of our best-loved lunch spots, such as  Vyzantino Restaurant , are dotted through here, as well. 
 
 Down slope from here, the sidewalks of Athens are wide and the cafe life is exuberant, making a long stroll through the city to the  Agora   easy and pleasant. One of our favorite stops is the   Varvakios Market,  which we explore on our  Beyond Feta food tour  of Athens.   We also love the feeling of moving   from the quiet of ancient history into the energy of modern life in just a few meters, with colorful graffiti, pop-up installations, and lively wine bars dotting the curvy avenues. Psirri is a particularly lively neighborhood for street art. It’s an easy city to learn with your feet, to trace where the neighborhoods melt into each other and how the fabric of Athens culture twists and layers over itself. The city, though ancient, boasts a modern and comprehensive  metro system . Check out out the easy to navigate  Athens Metro Map .  With  Syntagma Square  and  Monastiraki  as the main transfer junctions, it’s possible to cover the distance of the city with ease. The metro connects the  Athens International Airport  and the  Port of Pireaus  to the city center, and accesses the  Suburban Railway  to the north. Metro rides cost 1.40 euro, though there are reduced price options and multi-day tickets available as well. Taxis in Athens are inexpensive and readily available. Though, as in any big city, it is possible to get taken advantage of, keep in mind that most cab rides within the city shouldn’t exceed 5 euro. Most trips will cost around 3 euro. This is significantly cheaper than most major Europeans cities, which allows a lot of freedom and flexibility when seeing Athens’ tourist attractions. If you spend the day walking and are too tired to return by foot, or if you’re interested in exploring the outlying neighborhoods, it’s excellent to have the choice to take a taxi. Context can arrange a  taxi transfer  from the airport or port for you.  It is not customary to tip the taxi drivers when seeing tourist attractions in Greece. 
 With so many things to see in  Athens , there’s no reason to miss the scope and awe of this splendid city due to transportation. Athens is charming in every way, and ripe for exploring whether by foot, taxi or metro.",
2016-02-12,http://blog.contexttravel.com/new-discoveries-in-old-london/,New Discoveries in Old London,"I consider  London  my second home for so many reasons. In a literal sense it was, in fact, my home for four years. More abstractly, I love the that the yin and yang of this metropolis is continually evolving. It is both traditional and contemporary, refined yet a bit cheeky, serious but still whimsical. I consistently feel as if I’m viewing London with new lens. Perhaps it’s because I’m older (and hopefully wiser), but it’s also definitely because the city is an alive and growing entity. I live and breathe London daily. I take inspiration both from what travelers are interested in seeing, and what locals are doing, to craft my idea of what London means to me. My colleagues on the ground are also an invaluable resource. From new restaurants, like  Hopper’s , a Sri Lankan gem, to the tucked away  Wallace Collection  in my dream neighborhood of Marylebone, they’re always pointing me in an unexpected direction. After a whirlwind trip, I’m excited to share my the experiences that my colleagues helped to shape, and my reflections on the a sides of London I hadn’t seen before. Do something you don’t think you would be interested in. 
One thing I love about working for Context is that I get to go on walks I normally would never think to do. Left to my own devices, I might just be looking at street art, local food markets, and some contemporary architecture. For example, when I lived in London, I had little interest in the royal history. Yet when I took part in the  Hampton Court  walk, it was impossible to not be enthralled with the stories of the Tudor dynasty, plus you get to feel quite clever when you begin connecting the dots as to how this era contributed to the London you see today. You’ve heard a million times how travel opens your mind. Take this a step further and delve into an area you don’t know much about when you travel. Is there a neighborhood you’ve never been to or heard of? Check it out with a local. You can also branch out further into a subject you’re already invested in. Perhaps you are an art lover who shies away from the contemporary scene. Spending a few hours with an expert who knows how to convey complex ideas to others is the ideal way to dig into a topic you didn’t even know you liked. I came to Hampton Court knowing that Henry VIII’s break from the Roman Catholic Church was significant, but I had yet to discover the almost Shakespearean twists and turns behind this decision. Being in Hampton Court, while the learning the ins and outs of his days, his fierce love of sport and competition, and his relationship with Cardinal Woolsly, Thomas More, and other advisors, unraveled the complexities of this epoch in history, and made this lesson come full circle. You could almost feel the weight of his decision to break away from the almighty church while walking through the ornate corridors of the palace.   Every aspect of your trip is a learning opportunity 
Neighborhoods, food, and beer are all excellent points of entry to discover more about London culture. One of my favorite neighborhoods in London is Shoreditch. This hip area of London is often overlooked by tourists, yet serves as an up and close way to understand the transformative processes talking place in the city these days. Our Ales and Pubs tour brought us to the  Crown and Shuttle pub , which quickly became my new favorite ‘local’. (The ‘shuttle’ is actually in reference to the French Huguenot weaving apparatus. The Huguenots were skilled weavers and the first immigrant group to the neighborhood centuries ago). It’s a dash Victorian and a dash quirky, with a full range of craft beers (my favorite being the Cita Saison made by  Brew by Numbers , just down the road.)   This area also offered some fundamental insight into the contemporary art scene in the UK. Tracey Emin’s, one of the pivotal ‘Young British Artists’, who spearheaded the creative shift to the East, still lives and works here. Some colleagues and I came upon her White Cube studio while strolling the streets of  Shoreditch . The artistic legacy of this corner of London has been cemented even further with its constantly changing street art. Works from the likes of internationally known Banksy, and Shepard Fairey, are sprayed right next to those of up and coming talents. Artists from around the world are using the streets of  East London  as their canvas. 
The London Eye adds a sleek and pretty touch to the riverside landscape in central London, but elevated views of the city hardly end there. While in London, I scoured the skies for some other noteworthy vantage points. Up until the 1960s,  St. Paul’s  was the tallest structure in London. Over the next few decades height regulations were massively lifted, and skyscrapers began to sprout up through the concrete. In the City of London, the skyscrapers that dominate the city skyline today are required to give something back to the community, typically in the form of a public art, or a public space. The Sky Garden atop the  Walkie Talkie building  (the nickname given to 20 Fenchurch Street) is the public space atop the tower that swells high above its neighbors. The Sky Garden is open to the public, and there’s also a vibrant bar and restaurant area. Sipping a cocktail (‘Chelsea Garden’ was my libation of choice) and immersing yourself in the sprawling skyline is a pretty unbeatable combination. The Roof Terrace at One New Change, a swanky shopping venue, provides a stunning view of the nearby St. Paul’s Cathedral. It’s a rooftop rarely frequented by tourists. I was in the company of mostly well suited professionals working in the area, taking a mid-day “nature break” amid the bustling city. 
For this one you don’t need to go up, just out a bit. Londoners love to slip out to  Greenwich  for a reprise from the core of the city. Our To the Sea Greenwich tour combines a boat trip down the Thames and an foray into of this gorgeous sect of London, complete with lush green spaces, science, and romantic Baroque architecture. After a day of exploration, relax in Greenwich Park, watch the sunset over London, and reflect on how lucky you are to be in one of the best cities in the world.",
2016-02-22,http://blog.contexttravel.com/cartagena-and-the-alex-rocha-youth-center/,Cartagena and the Alex Rocha Youth Center,"In the process of developing our  Cartagena  program in late 2014, Context Founders Paul Bennett and Lani Bevacqua had the pleasure of connecting with docent Alexander Rocha. A passionate local guide and community leader, Alex grew up in the low-income San Francisco district and after seeing how education and learning English could improve a child’s future, he founded the  Alexander Rocha Youth Center . Although founded only recently in 2012 and still very much in progress, the center is already making a difference in the community and is the focal point of our  Deep Travel Foundation ’s Cartagena walk,  The Barrio, visiting and volunteering in San Francisco.  We recently sat down with Alex to hear a little more about the Youth Center, its progress and how visiting it can create a meaningful Deep Travel experience. Context Travel: How did you decide to start the Alexander Rocha Youth Center? Alexander Rocha:  The main reason why I started it has to do with my own life experience of not having opportunities to learn, go to school and connect with people who could teach me. It wasn’t until I was about 24 when I started to get more serious. I was young and eager to learn but there were no chances to do so. I decided I wanted to do something good for the community and for our children, who get distracted very easily with drug abuse, gang activity and early teenage pregnancy. So that’s the reason I decided to create the Youth Center. CT: What are the main objectives of the center? AR:  Keeping children off the streets and reinforcing education by teaching English, that’s our main focus. CT: What has been most rewarding about running the center? AR:  The English that they learn at the center can be used at school, where English is very basic. When they go back to school, they can see the progress they’ve gained at the Youth Center. That is very rewarding. CT: And the most challenging? AR:  A lot of people in the community don’t care much about education because it’s not what they have experience with. The parents, relatives, friends, everyone wants to do something different than going to school. CT: Do you do other activities at the center besides English classes? AR:  Yes, we have a baseball team at the center. We are trying to get them involved in baseball because there are a few players from here in the Major Leagues in the United States, and that gives the kids motivation and role models who have “made it.” We also teach moral values like giving back, taking care of each other and mutual respect. CT: How many kids are involved and what are their ages? AR:  There are 35. They range from ages 8-14. We divide the classes by age from 8-11 then from 12-14, and we also have a teenage group. CT: How do you keep teenagers involved as they get older? AR:  We keep offering new courses. Just last week for example, we gave a course on leadership and technology, using computers to teach them new skills. CT: Could you tell us about any specific “success stories” with the kids at the center? AR:  Definitely! We have 4 kids, young adults really, who I gave English courses to, and they were able to use that to get jobs in tour companies, basically speaking English and helping with logistics of the passengers. The ones who speak English are the ones who have more opportunities. CT: What has been your experience the Youth Center’s relationship with Context’s Deep Travel Foundation? AR:  It’s a wonderful thing because the people that come to the Center motivate our kids and encourage them to continue going to school and doing what they like. The kids are able to interact with people from other countries, so they get motivated to learn more to be able to talk to them. 
The visitors also get very excited. I’m proud to be able to show them another side of the city where Americans usually don’t go. I give them a walk in the neighborhood, then they come to the Center and meet the children, play soccer or a game. We also get them in the classroom to talk with the kids and ask questions. They say it’s rewarding seeing REAL people. CT: Is there anything else you’d like to add? AR:  First of all, we really need volunteers: people who want to come, teach the kids and share their knowledge. 
Also, we are building a second floor where we are going to put a library, a computer room and a kitchen to offer food to the kids. We are looking forward to finishing this up by the end of 2016.   Context is a proud supporter of the Alexander Youth Center and is glad to be a vehicle which provides a mutually beneficial relationship between curious students and curious deep travelers. You can learn more about their program on via their  website , take our  Context walk  with Alex, or volunteer with teaching English, arts, or sports by  emailing him  directly. Together we can give new opportunities to children who deserve them most.",
2016-03-01,http://blog.contexttravel.com/the-taste-of-milan-beyond-the-classics/,The Taste of Milan Beyond the Classics,"Italy is renowned for its long-standing culinary tradition and in particular for its local specialities, and  Milan  is no exception. From the creamy risotto alla Milanese, with golden saffron, to the juicy  “cotoletta”, a veal cutlet pan fried in clarified butter, its dishes speak of an intensely favourful heritage. But the city is not weighed down by stiff folklore and rigid prescriptions – quite the opposite. Milan has been flirting with experimental approaches, and not just in terms of aromas, but also with architecture and socially-involved programs. On a recent trip to Milan, we set out to find out more about what the city has to offer.  The area around Porta Venezia has undergone major transformations over the past 5 years, becoming one of the liveliest spots of the city, with many new restaurants dotting the neighborhood. Here,  Pavé  (via  Felice Casati, 27 ) represents a wonderful way to start the day. This artisanal pastry-shop – with an open space lab –  crafts some beautiful, mouth-watering brioches, cakes and desserts, in which the most important thing is the high quality of the ingredients.  If you’re looking for some delicious vegetarian food, Milan has many wonderful options. Hosted in an historic building that dates to the beginning of the 20th century,  Ratanà  ( Via Gaetano de Castillia, 28,)  specializes in seasonal and local fresh products, mixed together in intriguing new combinations, while also paying homage to the tradition.  Radicetonda , instead, is the city’s first certified organic vegan restaurant. Everything in the restaurant is environment-friendly: plates, silverware and cups are made of 100% vegetable fibers, and the microwave is severely banned as a core premise. The ingredients come from  organic or biodynamic farming and, whenever possible, with a short supply chain: you’ll find no chemicals or preservatives in these colourful, and tasty dishes. All contemporary art lovers and film aficionados should not miss  Bar Luce  at Fondazione Prada (Largo Isarco, 2). Designed by film director Wes Anderson, the cafe sports a colour palette and decorative elements reminiscent of the Pop culture and Italian aesthetics of the 1950s and 60s. Some will also spot some similarities and resonances with  The Royal Tenenbaums and The Grand Budapest Hotel. Our favorite detail? A Steve Zissous-themed pinballs.  It would be reductive to refer to  28 posti  as just a restaurant (and pardon the pun). Despite the small size –  it can accommodate only 28 people –  this site’s reach and ambitions expand beyond food into the field of social engagement, which involves inmates from one of Milan’s prisons, political refugees, and migrants. The venue was restored by convicts of the Penitentiary Institute of Bollate, who also built the furniture, tables, and doors. Many of the objects decorating the space – lamps, pots, metal containers, placemats – link it to Nairobi and Bogota’, where the founders of this initiative first started collaborating on social projects. Also the recipes follow the same experimental approach, mixing sweet and savory items in daring – and very successful – matches.    While this is just a short sampling, which does not pretend to be exhaustive of the exceptional wave of ferment and innovation that runs through the city, we’re excited to see what’s in store for the months – and years – to come. With the World Expo now behind it, Milan seems to be firmly positioned in the international circuit, and its diversified offer will attract and satisfy the most variegated audience.",

2016-03-10,http://blog.contexttravel.com/3-bangkok-must-see-temples/,Say Wat? 3 Bangkok Must See Temples,"Bangkok: a city of layers . Shiny skyscrapers reflect gilded temples.  Skytrains  speed above above chugging canal boats, while the MRT’s tracks whir below these meandering rivers. What remains constant in the ebb and flow of this hectic city is the scattering of hundreds of Thai temples or wats. The capital of Bangkok, surprisingly enough, is not famous for its temples.  When one thinks of a Thai Temple, their mind immediately wanders to splendors such as Wat Rong Kuhn (The White Temple) in Chiang Rai Province or  Wat Suan Dok in Chiang Mai Province .   Yet, the temples in Bangkok might just surprise you and perhaps on further inspection merit a higher level of architectural appreciation. For that reason, with the help of our local Bangkok docents, we’ve selected our favorite three Bangkok temples and insider tips to maximize your experience at each one. Wat Pho Bangkok Wat Pho predates the very existence of Bangkok and was itself built on the foundations of a sixteenth century temple by King Rama I in the eighteenth century. Later restored under King Rama III, the  wat  essentially became the first Thai university: it allowed the general public and those who could not read and write to expand their knowledge through visual means. Within the many striking pavilions on the Bangkok temple’s grounds, you can see these murals decked with illustrative depictions of information relating to health, Buddhism, literature and daily life. Outside these didactic buildings stand nearly 100 stupas decorated with colourful floral designs; an architectural feat in themselves, yet not the most renowned structure on site. Although Wat Pho is home to over 1,000 Buddhas, the most celebrated is the Reclining Buddha. He stretches and shimmers a colossal 45 metres with the exact positioning of Buddha representative of its entry into ‘nirvana’ (the final stage of incarnation in Buddhism). Top tip:  arrive soon after 8am to see monks clad in their traditional orange robes chanting in the main Ceremony Hall. 
 Wat Saket (The Golden Mount Bangkok) The temple in itself does not dazzle in the same manner than perhaps other Bangkok temples; however, the process of climbing the 300 stairs, ringing atmospheric prayer bells en route to the top to then find yourself with 360 panoramic views of Bangkok is indeed worth the effort. The additional height is something that other  wats  cannot compete with: the view from the  Golden Mount Bangkok  offers a remarkable perspective of the city scape. Built on an artificial hill constructed under King Rama III in the Ayutthaya era, the Golden Mount was first used as a site for cremation ceremonies. This man-made summit offers a fitting location to begin our  Birth of Bangkok walk  and soak in a city so rich in history and culture, as discussed during our three hour walking tour of Bangkok. Top tip:  if you are traveling in November make sure you time your visit to the Golden Mount with the Loy Krathong festival. During this 9 day fair the temple is wrapped in red cloth and explodes into a carnivalesque atmosphere. Wat Arun Bangkok Located across the Chao Praya River from the Grand Palace, seventeenth century Wat Arun (‘Temple of Dawn’) stands a mighty 80 metres tall on the banks of the river. Adorning the temple and its surrounding buildings are teal and coral mosaics, glittering mirror and intricate stone carvings and statues. The level of dedication and workmanship necessary to build and upkeep the immense detail and intricacies of the Thai temple and its surroundings stupas is apparent (the site has been in renovation stages since 2013). For the steady-footed, it is possible to climb the steep steps to the top of this 80-metre central prang (Khmer style pagoda) and view Bangkok from the ‘center of the universe’ according to the legendary Mount Meru. Top tip:  despite its name, this Thai temple is best seen at  sunset . It is the ideal time to visit and marvel at the fading city lights against the shimmering mirrors of the main prang. Catch a boat to the other side of the river after the sun goes down to gaze at Wat Arun when it lights up after dark. Bangkok  is home to countless temples and striking complexes, all of which are unique and beautiful in their different ways for any interested and culturally curious eye. However, if you are in ‘the City of Angels’ for a short stint, here are our Context-worthy trio of truly notable  wats. 
 
 Please be advised, when visiting temples in Bangkok, it is advisable to dress respectfully. Full length skirts or trousers are the most appropriate, whilst shoulders and arms are to be covered.",
2016-03-15,http://blog.contexttravel.com/how-to-tour-the-musee-dorsay/,How to Tour the Musée d’Orsay,"Loving the Louvre is easy, it’s like the smash hit single that never disappoints no matter how many times we listen.  If we flip to the B side and walk across the  Seine , in the shadow of the  Tuileries , we  fall in love with our next favorite art jam,  the  Musee d’Orsay .  Housed in a former  beaux-arts  train station, the opulent structure provides a perfect backdrop for viewing an extensive collection of French masters. When viewing the Orsay, we often catch ourselves saying, “I can’t believe all of these paintings are in one place.” On display are some of the world’s most famous works from 1848 to the early twentieth century including the Realist, Impressionist, and Post-Impressionist movements, by the likes of Van Gogh, Courbet, Monet, Manet, Degas, Seurat, and Matisse. Our walking tours of the Orsay museum, led by credentialed art historians, offer an in-depth, immersive look at the world-class collection in a dynamic and digestible manner. Below you’ll find details of our walking tours as well as insider tips to help you prepare for your visit to the Orsay museum.   PLANNING YOUR VISIT TO THE ORSAY When to visit the Orsay Museum? We find the best time to visit the museum is during the once per week evening opening hours. The  Musee d’Orsay hours  are normally Wednesday to Sunday, 9:30 am to 6:00 pm; however on Thursdays the museum remains open until 8 pm. Visiting in the evening practically guarantees diminished crowds, which means shorter entrance lines and the space in which to tranquilly take in the art. 
 The busiest times to visit the museum are Mondays and Sundays. The Orsay is closed Tuesdays. We recommend purchasing tickets prior to your visit so that you can avoid long ticket lines. We provide skip-the-line Musee d’Orsay tickets on all of our tours. 
 How do I find the Orsay? The Orsay is located on the Left Bank. The nearest métro stops are  Solférino  or  Assemblée Nationale  on line 12, or  Musée d’Orsay  on the RER B . The meeting point for our Orsay tour is just nearby—you’ll receive these details in your confirmation text. 
 Do you have a recommendation for lunch after our visit? The Orsay has a number of  dining options in house , ranging from the very casual to the more formal. If you’re interested in dining in the surrounding neighborhood, it’s best to avoid the restaurants just facing the museum, as these tend to cater to tourists (and have inflated prices). Contact us  for our up-to-date restaurant suggestions. Is the Orsay wheelchair accessible? The museum is accessible. There are elevators throughout and, if you are visiting on your own, you can print a wheelchair accessibility guide from the the museum website. ORSAY INSIDER TIP Most visitors to the Orsay museum make a beeline for the Impressionist halls. Though they are absolutely not to be missed, the halls can be very crowded depending on the time of day. Instead of starting there, head to the  Salle des Fêtes ,  which, according to Context docent and historian Pablo Vazquez-Gestal,  “ is a very bombastic Third-Republic . . . flamboyant room . . . with a great view on  the Seine . It is usually empty, but gives you the idea of Paris as capital of the opulent, decadent  fin-de-siècle  and also a sheer contrast with the art that is just next door.” 
 TOUR THE ORSAY WITH CONTEXT Our small-group tours (never more than 4 in a group) offer an opportunity for in-depth analysis of the collections and engaging conversation with your docent. We arrange advance skip-the-line Musee d’Orsay tickets on all our tours (contact us if you plan to have a Paris Museum Pass). Musée d’Orsay and Paris in the Nineteenth Century  – A stimulating introduction to French painting and sculpture of the latter half of the nineteenth century. Whether you are new to the collection or visiting for the umpteenth time, viewing the collection from the perspective of a credentialed art historian is an enriching experience for the intellectually curious. If booked privately, we may be able to design a tour to focus on one particular movement, or even the current temporary exhibition. Please  contact us  for more information. Musée d’Orsay for Families  – Our child-oriented introduction to the museum is led by art historians specially-trained in working children and teaches our youngest spectators not only about the art movements of the late nineteenth-century but also how to “read” and appreciate art. ORSAY RESOURCES Musée d’Orsay Official Site Interactive Floor Plan The museum often arranges events, ranging from symposiums to classical music concerts. See the Musée d’Orsay  calendar  for information on events during your stay. ADDITIONAL READING Impressionism: Origins, Practice, Reception  – Belinda Thomson The Painter of Modern Life and Other Essays  – Charles Baudelaire The Letters of Vincent van Gogh  – Vincent van Gogh Lire la peinture de Cézanne  –  Laure-Caroline Semmer [in French] Les oeuvres-clés de l’Impressionnisme  –  Laure-Caroline Semmer [in French] The museum shop also has a substantial  library of books for sale .   ORSAY TIMELINE 16th century – The site of the museum was part of a garden belonging to Queen Marguerite de Valois 17th century – The site is divided into lots upon which private mansions are constructed 1708 – Construction of the Quai d’Orsay begins 1782 – Construction begins on the Hôtel de Salm (today the Musée de la Légion d’honneur), across from the museum 1810 – Construction begins on the Palais d’Orsay, on the current site of the museum 1871 – The Palais d’Orsay is burned to the ground during the Paris Commune 1898 – Construction begins on the train station,  Gare d’Orsay , finishing in time for the 1900 World’s Fair. The Gare d’Orsay was the head of the southwestern French railroad network 1939 – The site ceases to be used as a train station (as electricity grew in popularity and trains became longer, the Orsay station’s short platforms were rendered unusable) WWII period – Building is used as a mailing center 1977 – It is decided that the Musée d’Orsay should occupy the former Gare d’Orsay 1978 – The building is classified a historical monument 1986 – The Musée d’Orsay opens to the general public ADDITIONAL PLACES TO VISIT IN PARIS Saint-Germain-des-Prés and the Latin Quarter   – These two neighborhoods on the Left Bank (in French:  Rive Gauche ), a mere 15-20 walk from the museum, are steeped in history and worth concerted exploration. Our  Rive Gauche Stroll  provides a historical overview of the area. Luxembourg Garden   – The expansive, tree-lined  Jardin du Luxembourg  is located in the 6th  arrondissement , not far from the  Musée d’Orsay . It was designed in the 17th-century for Marie de’ Medici, meant to flank her newly-constructed Luxembourg palace. Musée Marmottan  – A small museum in the 16th  arrondissement  of Paris, formerly a private mansion, how houses a diverse collection of Impressionist pieces including the world’s largest collection of work by painter Claude Monet. Those interested in exploring the museum with Context may enjoy our  Monet Seminar , which also includes a visit to the  Musée de l’Orangerie . Montmartre  – This quaint neighborhood in the northernmost  arrondissement  of Paris was once a center for bohemian culture in the era of the Impressionists. Indeed, Renoir’s masterpiece  Bal du moulin de la Galette  was painted at a private club next to one of the area’s famed windmills, which itself is still standing. Context offers a seminar on the history of the  Montmartre  area. Giverny   – Visitors enchanted by the  en plein air  work of Monet may enjoy an excursion to the gardens where he produced much of his later work. An easy train ride out of town, a visit to the  Monet Foundation  in the tiny Norman village of Giverny makes for an enjoyable half-day.  Context also organizes art-historian led visits .",
2016-02-26,http://blog.contexttravel.com/guest-post-a-foodies-guide-to-istanbul/,Guest Post: A Foodie’s Guide to Istanbul,"I’m convinced there is no better city in the entire world for  food than Istanbul . I know that’s a bold statement to make, and while some may disagree you only have to spend a few days eating here to understand why. Istanbul is one of those places that you can go just for the food and spend your time doing nothing but eating. Even after a week you will have barely scratched the surface and you’ll ache to come back – I know because I did it. Breakfast in Turkey is an occasion in and of itself. I am not someone who longs for the first meal of the day though, a full breakfast spread is the thing of dreams. I just hate preparing it! Fear not, Istanbul has you (and me) covered. Get started early because a second breakfast may be in order. Here’s how I would spend a full day eating in Istanbul! My favorite breakfast find is a tiny shop just off the Bosporus in Karakoy. There you’ll find Karakoy Ozsut a family owned diner of sorts that does traditional Turkish breakfast like none other. Not only do they prepare amazing food, they have their own water buffalo farm where the milk and meat comes from. Order a full Turkish breakfast and you’ll be greeted with plates of kaymak and thick, rich honey, caramelized walnuts, warm buffalo meat sucuk sausage, and thin slices of buffalo meat that rival Spanish jamon or Italian prosciutto, fresh tomatoes and seasoned olives, and menemen, a traditionally Turkish egg dish. It’s the breakfast of dreams!  Cross the river towards the Spice Bazaar to discover a second treat. All meals should be followed with dessert and breakfast is no different. The small streets and alleys that lead to the spice bazaar and full of hole in the wall shops selling all varieties of food and drink. But, the best? The kunefe shops. Kunefe is a dessert eaten throughout the Middle East. It’s made with shredded strips of a flat pastry dough like phyllo. The middle of the dish is made with a mixture of cheeses, topped with the shredded dough then cooked to a crisp and saturated in a sweet syrup. Split one if you must, but you may want to keep it all for yourself.  With such a big breakfast you won’t need to lunch for awhile. Explore the Rustem Pasha  mosque  hidden in the  Spice Bazaar  and venture up the alleys lined with shops selling anything and everything you can imagine. For lunch grab a lahmacun from any number of sellers. These flat sandwiches resemble a pizza but don’t let anyone hear you call it that. Rectangles of dough are smothered with finely minced beef and spices then baked in a super hot oven. Locals garnish theirs with a squeeze of lemon and handful of flat-leaf parsley. If you’re really lucky you’ll discover a tantuni shop and you shouldn’t hesitate in ordering one to go. These thin pieces of lavash are wrapped up with beef, onions, tomatoes and peppers and seasoning – simple and delicious.  Like the Spanish, Turkish cuisine also has a fondness for small plate dining. The meze is the Turkish equivalent of tapas. You select a handful of things that sound good and then share them with the table. With small serving sizes you’re able to try more! It won’t be a challenge to find restaurants serving mezze but some of the best I’ve eaten were in  Kadikoy  in shops that are double duty restaurants and grocers. Fried fish, pulsed vegetables mixed with spices to create savory dips, and of course cheeses are all available. Don’t worry if you don’t speak Turkish just point and try a bit of whatever looks good. To cap off an amazing day of eating you must try  Turkish delight (lokum) . Go with the traditional variety found in shops everywhere or go gourmet. At Sahi you’re able to choose your own ingredients and watch them make it before your eyes. Everything is boxed for you to take home – if it makes it that far. I suggest trying the milk version as it is different from the other types of lokum found in shops.  There’s no doubt that you’ll find countless other food and snacks to try around the city, this list barely touches the top of the Turkish food iceberg.

2016-02-01,http://blog.contexttravel.com/the-anatomy-of-a-french-meal/,The Anatomy of a French Meal,"Eating in France  has long been considered an art form. Taking pleasure in preparing and enjoying a meal with friends and families is a central part of French culture, the mechanics of which have been long documented. In 1825, a humble book was published entitled “ The Physiology of Taste .” Written as a series of short essays, the volume was not authored by a chef or food critic, but rather by a lawyer, former mayor and judge, named Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.  Something of an everyman, Brillat-Savarin employs a scientific-like curiosity in his approach to food, meditating on digestion, chocolate, thinness, and coffee, among other things. Using his book as our guide, we’ll explore the parts that make up a French meal. With the assistance of culinary docents Preston Mohr (sommelier) and Cassandra Choi (pastry chef) we will learn what kinds of meals our docents like to prepare for and eat with friends and family.   On hors d’oeuvres and apéritifs Traditionally, French dinners begin with  hors-d’oeuvres  (small plates, literally translated to “outside the work”), and  apéritif , an alcoholic beverage meant to stimulate the appetite. Pastry chef Cassandra Choi likes to serve  gougeres  as an hors d’oeuvre, explaining it as “essentially  choux pastry  mixed with cheese, and baked.” There are plenty of other options as well, ranging from crackers, nuts and potato chips. Cassandra also enjoys serving  saucisson –  dried, cured sausage – common in France. She recommends Maison Guyard (42 rue de Verneuil, 75007) to find excellent charcuterie. Traditional Gruyère  gougeres Preston recommends champagne as an apéritif  par excellence , but says, “that’s far too simple of a response. For something different, try the tangy Pineau des Charentes, a sweet concoction of unfermented grape must and young cognac, made in France’s Charentes region. Technically a  mistelle , or young almost unfermented wine that’s muted with the addition of alcohol, in this case the local specialty: cognac.   The end result is a delicious way to start a meal!”  Other regional examples of mistelle include Floc de Gascogne, local to Gers, made with Armagnac, or pommeau, local to Normandy, and “made from unfermented apple cider with the addition of Calvados (a hard apple brandy).” All Parisian wineshops will offer a few different options of mistelle, and a larger selection would be available at Lavinia (3-5 Boulevard de la Madeleine, 75001). On the main course A main course could be one of a variety of options, from vegetarian to fish to meat.  Cassandra enjoys preparing a roast chicken with rosemary or thyme, which is a low-maintenance dish that allows her to spend more time with company.  Poulet rôti  is a very classic French dish, available at many restaurants and markets. Cassandra purchases chicken from her neighborhood butcher, but notes that every farmer’s market will have a roast chicken stand. When deciding which wine to pair with a meal, instead of being guided by  what  is being served, Preston recommends, “…thinking think in terms of matching the wine’s intensity to the food. In other words, very robust and flavorful dishes should be paired with like wines.   For dishes such as grilled meats, long cooked or braised stews like  daube de boeuf  or highly flavored dishes with garlic, onions, tomatoes, opt for a wine that has equal or more flavor than the food… [something like] a full-bodied wine from either the Côtes du Rhône or the Languedoc.” For pescatarians, Preston notes that, “one of my all time favorite pairings would be a good quality 1e cru or Grand Cru Chablis with a dozen oysters on the half-shell. So simple yet so perfect.” If you’re a fan of oysters, don’t miss Preston’s favorite  “…postage-stamp sized restaurant in St. Germain,  Huitrerie Regis  (3 rue Montfaucon, 75006). They produce their own oysters in Marennes Oleron, in the Charentes-Maritimes region on the Atlantic coast. Their concise menu only features oysters of various size and a few basic seafood options. A good selection of wines to accompany things from the sea is on offer.”   On dessert French dessert has evolved into the  pièce de la resistance  of a meal, a work of art in and of itself. Cassandra notes, “My favorite dessert to prepare is a soufflé, either chocolate, pear, or lemon. Though it requires several steps and is a bit technical, it’s very satisfying to prepare and always seems to impress when I bring it to the table. My favorite desserts to eat tend to be classics – creme caramel, a perfect chocolate tart, a Saint-Honoré.” For a great éclair or a chocolate or lemon tarts, Cassandra prefers Jacques Genin (133 rue de Turenne, 75003), and she also recommends La Pâtisserie des Rêves (93 rue du Bac 75007) for a Saint Honoré or Paris Brest.

He says, “Historically, sweet wines were the most prized and expensive wines of France. The luscious wines of Sauternes in Bordeaux, sweet Champagne and the glorious sweet wines Quart de Chaume in the Loire Valley were present on the tables of kings, emperors and ruling classes for many hundreds of years. Currently the pendulum swings in the direction for dry wines. An ideal sweet wine is one that is noticeably sweet but still maintains fresh acidity so the wine is not cloying. Opt for the little-known late harvest wines from Jurançon, in France’s foothills of the Pyrenees in the Southwest of France. These expressive wines are packed with tropical fruit-like flavors of papaya, mango, pineapple and are a perfect match to a fruit-based desserts. A general rule for dessert wines is simple: the wine should be as sweet or sweeter than the dessert.” As we come to the end of the meal, in the words of Brillat-Savarin,   Source Brillat-Savarin, Jean Anthelme.  The Physiology of Taste .

2016-04-25,http://blog.contexttravel.com/positive-impacts-of-tourism/,Positive Impacts of Tourism,"Can tourism bring down walls? In short, can  travel broaden the mind ? “Yes. Tourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls, and to create a sustainable way of connecting with each other and creating friendships.”   These are the words of  Aziz Abu Sarah , founder of MEDJI Tours based in Jerusalem. Sarah arranges tours of the city led by two guides, one Jewish and one Palestinian. The aim is to connect visitors with locals to understand their day-to-day realities in order to promote understanding, friendship and peace. This concept of echoing the  positive impacts of tourism  was declared by Mark Twain over 180 years ago when he famously wrote, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.” Since 2008,  Context Travel  and Sacramento Charter High School in Sacramento, California, have sponsored a  yearly scholarship  for one or two high-achieving students; it is designed to give youth from economically challenged, inner-city neighborhoods the opportunity to travel, and to broaden their horizons through a  student travel  initiative. It is perhaps more important now than ever to promote travel to the next generation and instill a spirit of open-mindedness. With this in mind, our winners Destyni and Ana experienced the trip of a lifetime in Paris. It was both of their first time to Europe (and Ana’s very first time on an airplane!), where they followed a series of walking tours led by our scholars and docents. From learning about the Roman history of Paris to studying Modernist Architecture, the girls saw, first-hand, the evolution of the city and Parisian culture. During their stay, both students reflected on their time by writing  blog posts  and the  positive impacts of tourism , specifically student travel, are clearly evident as you read about their journey . For the past few months, I have known that I am the co-winner of the Transforming Youth through Travel scholarship sponsored by  Context Travel , and now that the trip draws closer to the big day of my departure for Paris, I grow anxious in the best possible way. The plane ride across the Atlantic will… I had to double check if I was in the right room. Was I in the Louvre or at a rock concert? I felt the elbows and shoulders of strangers all around me, my body was being pushed forward, I even lost my balance a few times. My personal bubble was beyond burst. I heard… With my first bite, I tasted crystals of caramelized sugar. Then came the warm embrace of the buttery layers of flaky dough. It was like a super croissant, and I could not get enough of it. Its name was a Kouign Amann, and it’s difficult to find this pastry in regular cafes because it originates…   The scents and bright colors attacked my senses. I could smell the freshness of the fruits and vegetables. Is this what real fresh food is like? Is it possible that one can come and buy these products every day? It’s so easy to get seduced by the food in  Paris , to get lost in the… As I roam the streets of Paris I realize there are endless things to discover in this city. I’m not just talking about the monuments. There are hidden details at every turn. This city has amassed so much history that I wonder if even people who were born here have had the opportunity to see… Versailles  is breathtakingly beautiful and filled with allegorical features. At a first glance the statues and fountains seem to be just for decoration. However that is not the case, architects thought of everything and had a reason for everything. Everything in Versailles was an expression of the King’s power. The fleur-de-lis and the sun symbols… Each student will also complete a video project focused on one aspect of the trip they connected with the most, which will be updated  here  later this spring. We’re honored  to provide this opportunity for student travel year after year, and look forward to seeing the positive impacts of tourism as we follow these student’s bright futures.  If these students have inspired you to visit  Paris  please be sure to view our numerous selection of tours.",
2016-03-17,http://blog.contexttravel.com/the-best-craic-in-dublin/,The Best Craic In Dublin,"Happy St. Patrick’s Day from the Contextuals here at Context Travel!  Whether your family hails from the Emerald Isle or not, the beauty of St. Patty’s day is that everyone can be Irish for one day a year. As we snack on our Irish potatoes and listen to our Pogues and Flogging Molly CDs here at Context HQ our minds drift to our favorite Irish city,  Dublin .  Clients often ask us about the best things to do in  Dublin ?  The great thing about working at Context Travel is that we have local experts (our docents) in every city that can share with us a local perspective on their favorite things to do.   We sat down with Kevin Guyan who leads our  Story of Dublin  and  From   Medieval Mass to Georgian Splendour  walking tours in the heart of the city to get his perspective on the five  best things to do in Dublin .  In addition to working on his PhD thesis, Kevin also has his finger on the pulse of Dublin’s cultural scene. A scene that goes far beyond Guinness and James Joyce novels. We asked Kevin for the five  best things to do in Dublin , and he provided us with a wealth of knowledge on the  ‘ craic ’ the city has to offer.  Craic  is a uniquely Gaelic word with no English translation.  The closest the English language can come is “fun” which doesn’t quite capture the true meaning of the word.  You’ll have to visit Dublin to experience the craic for yourself and don’t forget to visit Kevin and take in the  Story of Dublin  walking tour.   While the establishments in the Temple Bar area are worth a visit, the city’s first brewpub lies just on the edge of this boozy neighborhood. Porterhouse is Kevin’s favorite bar in the city which serves a great selection of Irish ales, lagers and stouts.  You can hear live music most evenings and watch Ireland in sporting matches. Adding to the atmosphere, the interior reflects a classic Irish aesthetic with a modern edge, much like the city itself. Dublin is a great city, but to get a more complete picture of Irish culture and society, a visit to the smaller villages is in order. Howth – a 20 minute journey on the DART transit system and you find yourself in this beautiful coastal village to the north of the city.  The cliff-top walk on a sunny day has the best views of Dublin, and the fishmongers on the pier sell a fantastic selection of fresh seafood.  Smell and taste the sea air as you enjoy a meal along this unbelievable coastline.  If you’re taking a longer break in Dublin, Howth is definitely worth a visit.   Dublin is home to a strong artistic heritage, and continues to grow as a capital for art and creativity. Francis Bacon was one of the world’s most celebrated twentieth century artists, and was born in Dublin in 1909.  In 1998, the artist’s estate donated Bacon’s London studio to the Hugh Lane Gallery and its contents were relocated to Dublin, opening to the public in 2001.  As with most galleries and museums in Dublin, entry to the Hugh Lane Gallery is free and is a great example of the city’s artistic history. Housed in a former chocolate factory on the north side of the Liffey river, this industrial building now serves great coffee in its  Blas Café  and typifies the artistic vibe that is sweeping the capital.  Unlike some of Dublin’s other hipster locations, Blas Café – a few minutes’ walk from busy O’Connell street – remains undiscovered which means you’re guaranteed a seat. The beautiful gardens behind Dublin Castle are a hidden gem in the city centre and a great place to eat your lunch or enjoy a picnic.  After relaxing outdoors, you can then enjoy the beautiful Islamic, East Asian and Western objects on display in the adjacent Chester Beatty Library, which houses the vast collection of New York mining magnate and honorary Irish citizen, Alfred Chester Beatty.",

2016-04-01,http://blog.contexttravel.com/7-best-paintings-at-viennas-khm/,7 Best Paintings at Vienna’s KHM,"Great things come in fours.  Good luck requires four leaves on a clover, four seasons round out the personality of our world, and of course there were four Beatles-John, Paul, George and Ringo.  The phenomena of fours also extends to the art world. The Fab Four of art museums are:  The  Louvre ,  Metropolitan Museum of Art ,  London’s National Gallery  and the  Kunsthistorisches Museum   ( pronunciation )  in Vienna.  Opened in 1891 by Emperor Franz Joseph , the  Kunsthistorisches Museum  houses the Habsburgs’ extensive collection, showcasing their passion for the seminal painters of the day.  To help you find the  best paintings  and hidden gems,  we sat down with several art historians who teach in local institutions in Vienna (and who also lead our in-depth tours of the  KHM ) to get their opinion on the 7  best paintings  at the  KHM .   Reminiscent of the Roman Colosseum and symbolizing both the decay of Rome the eternal city and the conflict between Catholics and Protestants in the Netherlands, Dutch artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder painted The Tower of Babel in 1563.  Architectural Historian and Context docent, Piroska  Mayer-Sebest , says that the Tower of Babel is a must see because it is a study in contrasts,  “ What I like so much about it is that this unfinished tower is supposed to be extraordinarily well-built, bigger than any of the buildings surrounding it; but at the same time, it is somehow too near to the shore, leaning in a threatening way. If you were inside it, you would not feel very safe or be able to find your way through it. For me, this painting is telling us that we are sometimes so ambitious that we reach out too far and are not able to keep a balanced view of the world. If we could see the greater picture, we would not risk getting into disaster.”    Jupiter and Io  (1530) is a painting by the Italian late  Renaissance  artist  Antonio Allegri  da  Correggio   (1489 – 1534).  Known as Correggio, he painted Jupiter and Io as part of his Jupiter series.   Inspired by  Ovid ‘s classic  Metamorphoses , Art historian and Context docent Alexa Brauner declares, “This is my number one painting in the  Kunsthistorisches Museum . To me, it represents painted sensuality. Io, who tried to escape before, is now embraced by Jupiter and is lost in his soft foggy arms and she enjoys totally the situation. No other painting will show this theme in the history of art that way again. Not even the famous “Kiss” by Gustav Klimt shows dedication in that intense way.”  Wolf Hall  fans will recognize Jane Seymour (1509-1537) in this portrait, Henry VIII’s third wife and mother of King Edward VI. Famous for succeeding where Henry’s previous wives had failed, Jane provided the king with a legitimate male heir to the throne. King’s painter to Henry VIII, the German artist Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543) created this portrait after the marriage of Jane Seymour to Henry VIII in 1536.   Context docent, Clemena Antonova, loves Jane Seymour’s portrait because she says it is a pure example of art bringing history to life,  “The Tudor dynasty has always exerted a fascination over later generations, and Henry VIII and his six wives have been, in many ways, in the center of the spotlight. Ironically, the private life of the King is probably much better known that the fact that he helped initiate some of the landmark events in English and European history, as the English Reformation. What this seems to show once again is that people love stories. And Holbein’s portrait of Jane Seymour is part of the story – the story of the English king who got several of his wives executed, but loved Jane, next to whom he expressed a wish of being buried, and the story of the Tudors, whose reign saw the Reformation in England and the rise of Anglicanism, the Renaissance and Shakespeare, etc. It is also an important moment in the story of art, at a time when the only important painters in England were foreigners, especially Italians and Northern Europeans, including Holbein – a German painter at the Tudor court. When we read about Henry VIII and his wives, about Erasmus of Rotterdam and Thomas More, it is Holbein’s portraits of these historical figures that come to mind. We see a whole epoch in English history through the eyes – and the works – of Holbein.”   In 1431, Pope Martin V sent Cardinal Niccolo Albergati to Burgundy to mediate between Henry VI, Charles VII and Philip, Duke of Burgundy during the Hundred Years War.  Dutch painter, Jan van Eyck was commissioned to paint a portrait of the Cardinal which he executed from only a few sketches made during a brief meeting.  The sought after artist was considered a revolutionary during his time for his design and methods and Lisa Regan, another of our Context docents, says his technique really distinguishes this piece.   “The KHM includes a balance of really major works and some minor gems, including a couple of really exquisite individual works that merit extended close looking. There are some fantastic, and too often overlooked, portraits – for instance, the works by Holbein, and Rembrandt’s portrait of his son, Titus (the only one to live to adulthood), reading aloud to him. Of course, the van Eyck portrait of Cardinal Niccolo Albergati merits a few long minutes of close examination, especially the handling of the skin around the eyes, temples, and mouth.”    Girolamo Francesco Maria Mazzola, known as Parmigianino (1503-1540), created this self-portrait after painting himself as he appeared in a barber’s convex glass mirror.  Used as a portfolio piece to seek employment with the Papacy, the painting was not created on a flat canvas but on a section of a wooden sphere that reproduces the shape of a convex mirror. The unusual nature of the piece captured Context docent Reinhard Travnicek’s imagination.  “You can not stop looking at it – it is amazing and engages you immediately,” sys Richard. “ A lot of questions come to mind: ‘Is this a picture or a mirror? Who is the young boy? Why does he show us his hand like that? Why did he paint it so large and in such a prominent position?’ Based on these questions, we enter into the field of mannerist art, with its amazing effects and ambiguity.”    Venetian painter, Giovanni Bellini (1430-1516), painted Naked Young Woman in Front of the Mirror in 1515 at the age of 85.  His first female nude proved to be his final work of art.  Context docent, Gabriela Steiner-Sch says this is a foundational painting for her,  “With the works of the Italian Renaissance, I love very much the painting ‘ Naked Young Woman in Front of the Mirror ‘ by Bellini, who was a teacher of Titian. For me, it represents a very classical work of its time, but at the same time, it illustrates very nicely how painting tries to show the world that it is equal to sculpture, in regards to how it is able to show three-dimensionality. Once seeing this work in the Italian side of the picture gallery in the museum, I began to understand painting.” Created by Venetian painter Lorenzo Lotto in 1528,  this painting was said to be heavily influenced by Palma Vecchio.  Nearly almost forgotten after his death, Context docent Alexa Brauner greatly appreciates Lotto’s realism,  “I love Lorenzo Lotto’s work. He was that painter in Venice that built an extra touch of emotion upon the classic Renaissance by using special light effects and softened expressions of the characters, like the madonna in this painting. On the other side, he shows us what people of his time and his environment looked like without making them prettier; rather, he points out their character and doesn’t leave out imperfections.”",
2016-05-06,http://blog.contexttravel.com/5-best-popes-in-history/,5 Best Popes in History,"Since the declaration of Habemus Papam – we have a  Pope  – in 2013, the papacy has never been more popular in the modern era.  On his election to the Holy See, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, chose the name ‘Francis’, after Saint Francis of Assisi, becoming the first ever  Pope Francis .  Known as a reformer and unafraid to take on the establishment,  Pope Francis  has made headlines for his controversial stances on gay and civil unions, climate change and economic inequality. Among the  list of popes , is  Pope Francis  the best pope ever ? It’s probably too early to tell but after a recent visit  to the Vatican on our  Arte Vaticana  walk, we left mesmerized about the staggering  list of Popes  that have occupied the Holy See. We counted 266 Popes, but which Pope has contributed the most to changing the history of the church of Rome and its art? As we were itching to learn more, we sat down with our very knowledgeable Rome docents and Vatican experts, and they shared with us their favorite Popes based on personalities, contributions and  fondness for the arts . The first on our list is  Pope Sixtus IV , who ascended to the papacy more than 500 years before Pope Francis, yet shared a similar fearlessness and determination. Sixtus IV developed his reputation by blocking the Ottoman Turks advance in Smyrna, daring to declare war on the powerful Este family in Ferrara, and plotting Lorenzo de’Medici’s assassination in the   Pazzi Conspiracy  — albeit unsuccessfully. Besides his high-aiming political scope, which led him to bestow privileges on his fifteen nephews –  nipote  – and is where we get the term nepotism, this pope also had monumental plans for Rome. Sixtus IV invested heavily in architectural and urban projects that renovated the city of Rome – renovatio urbis. We can still walk over the Ponte Sisto, the bridge named after him, which he built over the Tiber to facilitate pilgrims’ access to St. Peter’s for the Jubilee of 1475. Sixtus IV improved and paved the streets of Rome, repaired the Aqua Virgo, one of the ancient Roman aqueducts, and its fountain at the Trevi, rebuilt S. Maria del Popolo where many of the della Rovere – his family – are buried, created the first museum of antique sculptures, known today as the Capitoline Museum, which included the famous bronze she-wolf, but he is perhaps best known for building the Sistine Chapel. The original chapel had been called the Cappella Magna, the Sistine Chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV. To decorate the chapel Sixtus employed some of the greatest Renaissance painters, which included Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Cosimo Roselli. Working as a team they painted frescos depicting the Life of Moses and the Life of Christ. These paintings were completed in 1482. A year later, Sixtus celebrated the first mass in the Sistine Chapel for the Feast of the Assumption, at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.   Our Vatican expert Lauren Golden seems to have a soft spot for  Pope Urban VIII , next up on the great  list of popes . She tells us Urban VIII  was a fervent patron of the arts during the  Baroque period . All the works of art commissioned by Urban VIII were aimed at displaying not only the supremacy of the pope and the Catholic church but also his family, whose coat of arms – of three bees, can be spotted in many paintings, sculptures, and buildings in Rome. In the 19th century, one scholar started counting the Barberini bees in Rome and gave up when he hit 6,000. The enormous vault of the grand salon in the Palazzo Barberini – the Sistine Ceiling of the Baroque – has 3 bees as its centerpiece, glorifying the Barberini family and its pope Urban VIII. Urban VIII,  who as a cardinal had been in charge of Bernini’s education, when he became pope, basically employed Bernini to redecorate Rome.  It is almost impossible to go anywhere in Rome today without coming across a Bernini work of art. Among the many  Bernini works that we still admire today, include the Palazzo Barberini, the Fontana della Barcaccia in Piazza di Spagna, the Fontana del Tritone, and the magnificent bronze baldacchino, skyscraper tall, under the dome of Saint Peter’s basilica. For this monument the pope is infamously remembered for ordering the removal of the remaining bronze of the portico of the  Pantheon , some of which was also used to make new canons for the Castel Sant’Angelo. Urban VIII’s unblessed recycling exercise earned caustic comments from the notorious antique talking statue, Pasqunio, who remarked,  quod non fecerunt barbari fecerunt Barberini  (“What the barbarians did not do, the Barberini’s did”). If you like exorcism and heads on stakes then  Sixtus V  stands out in the list of popes. Famous for rooting out corruption and lawlessness in Roman society by displaying criminals decapitated heads on stakes  around the city he also  performed exorcisms to get rid of pagan demons, after re-erecting four ancient Egyptian obelisks as signposts to pilgrims across Rome. The Vatican obelisk at Basilica of St. Peter, for example, has an inscription referring to exorcism on the east and west sides to keep evil away from the Vatican. According to our Vatican expert, we owe Sixtus V for the reorganization of Rome’s urban plan, as this pope created new straight streets and laid the foundation for the topography of the city – as we know it today. Thanks to Sixtus we can walk from the Porta del Popolo, where he placed an obelisk in the piazza, along the Via Sistina and Via delle Quattro Fontane. Our vatican scholars also tell us the Dome of St. Peter’s was completed under his patronage and in much haste. Sixtus V was presented a ten-year completion plan by Giacomo della Porta, to which the pope responded that he wanted it completed in 24 months. Upon such strict instructions and thanks to a tirelessly-working team, the dome was complete in only 22 months. In contrast to many other papal greats, Sixtus V had no appreciation for antiquities: for starters this pope endeavored to convert the Colosseum into a wool factory with homes for its workers, he demolished many Roman monuments to use them as raw materials for other construction projects, and turned the Column of Marcus Aurelius and Trajan’s column into pedestals for the statues of St. Peter and Paul. Lauren also likes to remember Sixtus V for leaving us the Moses Fountain. Originally known as the Sweet/Happy fountain after Sixtus V’s name ( Felice  translates to “happy” in Italian), when the statue of Moses was unveiled and was completely out of proportion, it became known as the ‘unhappy’ fountain. Our docents like to call the statue the “Fat Moses”, exactly for that reason. The fountain was part of Sixtus V’s plan to bring a second aqueduct (Acqua Felice) to the city, in addition to the Acqua Vergine (location of the Trevi Fountain), with the purpose of bringing clean water into a less inhabited area and encouraging people to live there. The Palazzo Barberini and the Triton fountain were later made possible thanks to Sixtus V’s aqueduct. Viewing the fountain’s facade today is quite a challenge due to the traffic pattern, and our tip is to pay a visit to the fountain at night. Innocent X  makes our list of popes due to his epic negativity. His family, the Pamphilj, were bitter enemies of Urban VIII’s family, the Barberini. He was determined to reform the financial climate in Rome that was threatened by his predecessor, Urban VIII, who emptied the papal coffers for his own private interests and whims. Innocent X imposed several reforms to restore the state income, responding with “no way” to everything he disagreed with – thus earning the nickname of Monsignor “No way”. However, Innocent X did continue rebuilding Rome to reaffirm the Pamphilij’s supremacy over the Barberini – yes, a building competition was all the rage between the two families – especially through commissioned works of art that had Borromini appointed as the papal artist who was engaged in the construction of several churches such as Sant’Agnese in Agone, Sant’Ivo alla Sapienza and the magnificent Oval Staircase in Palazzo Barberini. On the other hand,  Bernini  managed to “get a role on the stage” under Innocent X with his Fountain of the Four Rivers located in Piazza Navona. One of our docents really got excited explaining how the project of the fountain was originally given to Borromini but Bernini snatched the assignment, by cleverly giving Innocent X’s beloved (and greedy) sister-in-law Donna Olimpia, who’s nickname was La Papessa, a silver model of the fountain. O n seeing Bernini’s model,  Innocent X  could not resist Donna Olimpia’s will such was the control she had over the pope. We also owe many legendary works to Innocent X’s vision: Palazzo Pamphilj, the Agonal Obelisk, the Neptune fountain, all works found in Piazza Navona, as well as the current Papal summer palace, Castel Gandolfo, and the reconstruction of St. John Lateran. The last on our list of popes,  Paschal I , is considered to be the best looking Pope in history according to our Vatican scholar. Paschal I, was fixated on undertaking an urban reconstruction of Rome to emphasize its importance as an ancient and contemporary (for his times!) seat of power. As a “Roman from Rome” (typical expression used in Rome to state the authenticity of someone’s local origins), it is no wonder that Pope Paschal I had his dear city at heart and aimed at glorifying it by enhancing its superiority over the Eastern Orthodox church. Paschal I gave shelter to Greek monks and artists fleeing from Constantinople during Iconoclasm, thus creating his own team of  mosaic artists . These artists finely decorated church interiors, such as the golden Saint Zeno Chapel in the titular church of Santa Prassede, dedicated to his mother Theodora, whom he fondly loved as much as the Virgin Mary to the point of kick-starting the Marian Movement. Some might describe Paschal as a proper  Mamma ’s boy. Our docent also mentioned Paschal I initiated the major translation of the bones from the Catacombs of San Callisto and found the body of Santa Cecilia. Apparently, Santa Cecilia came to Paschal in a dream while he was having a nap on the papal throne and told him where to find her tomb. If imagining this is not enough, she mentioned we can admire a 13th century painting of the Pope’s story portrayed in the beautiful church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. If you flock to controversy, you will love  Julius II . While Julius didn’t quite make the first cut in our list of popes to remember, we just couldn’t leave him out of the discussion. As our docents tell us, Julius benefited from a prestigious position as a cardinal, bestowed upon him by his uncle Pope Sixtus IV and later became Pope without having a theology background (a bit unusual for such a prestigious position even for the 14th century.) Following in the steps of his uncle, Julius was more concerned with political matters to which he tied a strong commitment to the arts. Julius sponsored some of the greatest artwork of the Italian Renaissance, recruiting renowned artists such as Perugino, Raphael – who decorated the Pope’s private rooms (eg. La stanza della Segnatura), Bramante – who the Pope entrusted to be chief architect to build the new St. Peter’s, and  Michelangelo  to sculpt his tomb.  The Pope cancelled that project and forced Michelangelo, who considered himself to be a sculptor, to paint the ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. One remarkable detail, our docents shared with us is that Michelangelo when painting the Last Judgement for the later Pope Paul III took revenge on the Pope’s Master of Ceremonies, Biagio da Cesena,  who had criticized the nudity in the painting,  portrayed Biagio as a naked Minos, judge of the underworld, with donkey ears telling the world Biagio was a fool. We definitely recommend our Vatican walk to immerse yourself in further political intrigue. As we thank our docents for their insight, we realize our notebook is full of interesting information and we want to jump on the next available  walking tour  to learn more about the fascinating protagonists of Rome.

2015-11-17,http://blog.contexttravel.com/understanding-modern-art-in-turkey/,Understanding Modern Art in Turkey,"The development of Turkish modern art parallels the trends that were simultaneously going on in Europe, while speaking specifically to Turkey’s modern evolution. As Turkey transitioned from the Ottoman Empire, through World War One and the War of Independence, to become the modern day Turkish Republic, the art of the nascent country reflected that experience.  The Turkish Republic, led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, was designed to intentionally draw its influence from the West. The alphabet was changed from the Ottoman Arabic script to modified Latin letters, while loanwords from Arabic and Persian were exchanged for words borrowed from French or English. Dress was modernized, with the fez and the headscarf banned and Western-style dress encouraged. These rapid changes happened within fifteen years of the founding of the Republic, and inevitably this new Westward focus was reflected by the artists of the time. The Ottoman Empire empowered artists, but favored certain subjects, particularly landscapes and, later, portraiture. The fall of the empire and the rise of the modern state led to a deliberate westward shift in artistic styles of Turkish artists. Many took the opportunity to study abroad, picking up skills and contacts in Paris and applying those styles to their Turkish outlook on the world.  One of the most prominent paintings featured at the  Istanbul Modern  is by Fahrelnissa Zeid. Born to a wealthy Ottoman family of artists, Zeid was recognized for her artistic abilities early on. Though born into the Ottoman Empire, her art came of age in the early days of the Republic. Her paintings are large, colorful, abstract, and emphatically modern. She is the most prominently featured of quite a few female artists at the Modern. It makes sense. Identity is a subject that recurs throughout Turkish modern art, and female artists prominently deal with feminism and its place in Anatolia, while deconstructions of Turkey’s alphabet revolution or ambivalence with the headscarf provide the background for paintings, mixed-media pieces, and video art. Nil Yalter’s  The Headless Woman, or the Belly Dance  is one such piece, showing the torso of a bellydancing woman that has been covered with writing while old-style Turkish tavern music plays loudly. This was her way of calling attention to the objectification of women and the exotification of the Turkish identity. 
 
 Since it opened in 2004, the Istanbul Modern has created a collection of work that reflects a truly Turkish perspective of modern art. It is easy to appreciate the work on a purely aesthetic level, but  in the company of a Context guide , the stories and histories behind the development of Turkish comes to life. Exploring modern art in Turkey illuminates the distinct challenges, accomplishments, and evolution of the Turkish Republic.",
2016-04-15,http://blog.contexttravel.com/notebook-boston-an-insiders-view-of-beantown/,Notebook Boston: An Insider’s View of Beantown,"One of the wonderful things that happens when you run several thousand expert-led walking tours in 37 cultural capitals around the world like we do at  Context , is that you cultivate relationships with some truly remarkable people.  In recruiting the scholars who lead our tours, we look for learned individuals who have elevated to the top of their field in architecture, art history, the culinary arts and countless other cultural fields. We also cast an eye for individuals who are born ambassadors for their home cities and never tire of looking at landmarks such as the  Paul Revere House  and  Faneuil Hall .  When you bring love of a hometown like  Boston  together with a natural curiosity stoked by educational accomplishment– an intoxicating magic happens. Tom Gastel , a practicing artist, architect, and Context scholar,  guides clients through  Boston ‘s storied neighborhoods with a particular eye toward the city’s buildings – both historic and modern. His 2014 publication,  Notebook Boston , collects many of Tom’s Boston sketches and takes readers on a visual journey to some of the city’s most storied buildings like  F aneuil Hall ,  The Old North Church , and the  Boston Public Library . We asked Tom to share a little more about his work and the city he calls home. My favorite neighborhood in Boston is the South End because of the mix of beautiful Victorian buildings, excellent restaurants, quaint cafes, cute boutique stores, and a lively art scene. But, strictly speaking architecturally, I also love the exquisite Victorians of the Back Bay with their French influences.  I also love the idiosyncrasies of the the  North End  – especially the labyrinth of metal fire escapes in the narrow spaces between buildings. Part of what makes the North End unusual is the people: everyone is a like character from a novel: The old Italian woman pulling her shopping cart;the friars walking to church dressed in simple robes;the gaggle of Coast Guard men and women walking to get lunch in the neighborhood;the new “old” men sitting on lawn chairs on the sidewalk talking and watching the street scene;the grocery clerk who hand picks the produce for you one customer at a time; and the spice shop which is a throwback to the early twentieth century when the North End was nearly 100% immigrant population. I often depict how buildings relate to their surroundings – the slope of the land or the curvature of the brick sidewalks and granite curbs.  I also try to depict  how buildings were constructed , and the details of that historic fabric.  For example, showing exactly how the many colored stones of a foundation wall fit together. Gastel loves to explore simplicity in his art such asa stone lintel over a door or window, the keystone pattern of brick over a window, a the herringbone pattern of a sidewalk, a cast iron sewer lid set within a granite walkway or a downspout that leads to a brick channel within a brick sidewalk that spills out onto the street through a cut in the stone curb. Here are a few of Tom’s favorite selections from  Notebook Boston . The Gardiner Building, erected in the 1760s and once home to John Hancock’s counting house, is the oldest surviving building on Boston’s famous  Long Wharf . While the wharf functions today as dock for passenger ferries and sightseeing boats, it was once a busy place of business home to the famous  Bunch-of-Grapes Tavern  and  John Singleton Copley’s   mother’s tobacco shop where the painter spent much of his childhood. Many famous happenings took place at the Bunch of Grapes Tavern.  In 1733, the first grand lodge of Masons in America was organized there by Boston tailor, Henry Price, receiving authority from Lord Montague, Grand Master of England.  After the siege of Boston in 1776, George Washington, Lafayette and General John Stark all stayed there.  And oddly enough, Ohio University, the first land grant university in the US, was founded at the tavern by Revolutionary War veterans  Rufus Putnam ,  Benjamin Tupper ,  Samuel Holden Parsons  and  Manasseh Cutler . Built in 1680, the  Paul Revere House  was the colonial home of one of America’s most famous patriots. Located in Boston’s North End, the National Historic Landmark is now operated as a nonprofit museum by the Paul Revere Memorial Association. The poem  Paul Revere’s Ride , written in 1860 by the romantic poet and Harvard professor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, cemented the patriot as a national hero.  Longfellow actually created the poem in an effort to keep the Union together in the lead up to the Civil War as part of a series of American Legends which included  The Song of Hiawatha  (1855) and  The Courtship of Miles Standish  (1858).  Interestingly enough, the author knowingly took many liberties with the story of that famous ride which has unfortunately seeped into the American popular conscious as fact.  Most notably, Paul Revere was not alone on the midnight ride and was actually joined by two other patriots: Dr. Samuel Prescott and William Dawes.  It turns out, Revere is the best source for the account of the midnight ride and verifies the historical record in a  deposition  he gave after the revolutionary war and a letter he wrote to  Jeremy Belknap . Located at 41-43 Union Street, the  Union Oyster House  has been open to diners since 1826. Before its days as a restaurant, the building served a variety of tenants including  Isaiah Thomas , who published his newspaper  The Massachusetts Spy  in 1771. It’s a wonderful place to enjoy classic New England fare like oysters, clams, and lobstaaaaaah.",
2015-12-01,http://blog.contexttravel.com/vienna-in-winter/,Vienna’s Winter Festivities,"Vienna is famous for its seasonal fog, but the Viennese truly thrive on chasing away the winter chill with food, drink, and entertainments that make this one of the most festive cities to visit toward the end of the year. Here are some things to look for if you pass through Vienna in the next few months. Winter in the MQ 
 From November 5 to December 23, Vienna’s Museum Quarter is transformed into a winter wonderland, with six ice pavilions, a curling lane and audio-visual installations. This seasonal dose of culture is accompanied by local punch specialties to warm you up while you explore the  various venues , including the mumok, Kunsthalle Wien, the Leopold, and the Architecture Centre. Seasonal Food and Drink 
 Vienna is in wine country, and in the colder months there are several potent, wine-based brews to warm you to your toes. The first of these, seasonally speaking, is Sturm—a bubbly wine made from the first harvest of the year and appearing in September in both red and white varieties. Though its name means “storm,” it is actually lower in alcohol. The best place to drink it is any of the numerous Viennese  Heurigen —small wineries that since the emperor licensed them in the 18th century have been serving their own homegrown vintages. There are  Heurigen  in many of the outlying districts of the city, and we explore two of them in our  Vineyards of Vienna tour . As the colder weather arrives so too do the traditional  Glühwein  (mulled wine) and  Punsch ( punch ) .  Glühwein  has been served basically unchanged since the middle ages; it is mulled red wine, heated with spices. Punsch is stronger—a heady mixture of red wine, rum, fruit juice, and spice. It comes in an astonishing array of flavors, and also in a non-alcoholic variety; look for signs offering “Kinderpunsch” (children’s punch). Both  Glühwein  and  Punsch  are served at open-air huts and sausage stands where their warmth is essential. But if the chill gets to you, try some traditional  Marroni  (chestnuts) straight off a fire, or the  gebrannte Mandeln  (roasted almonds), served hot in a paper cone. For a taste of local traditional,  try one of our  Vienna food tours  with a gastronome. Christmas Markets 
 These utterly adorable little advent markets will spring up in about a dozen different locations around the city in mid-November, and stay open daily until Christmas (only one or two will continue briefly into the new year). With origins in the middle ages, they give a little taste of how the city might have felt in the era when all of Vienna consisted of the current first district, a crowded warren of wooden structures within the city walls. Christmas Markets in Vienna are miniature arts and crafts villages, where small stalls sell a variety of handmade goods (some local, some brought in from eastern Europe) and delicious treats. Christmas tree ornaments, pottery, toys—it’s a dream come true for the last-minute holiday gift-buyer. The food stands will sell plenty of the aforementioned  Glühwein  and  Punsch , and with good reason: one eats outdoors, at standing tables. Dress warmly. Our  unique seasonal tasting experience  takes place at the Christmas Village in Vienna’s former general hospital, now the campus for the social sciences and humanities of the University of Vienna. The quiet corners of this cozy local market give plenty of opportunity to pause and savor the various regional specialties that are only available during the holiday season. The markets offer a wide selection of savory dishes, and the main meal will include a selection of roast potatoes or potato specialties, roast chestnuts, soup, or sausages – enough to sate large appetites or share with friends or family. The markets range from tiny to sprawling, but all of them are extremely child-friendly.  This site  has a complete list of the Christmas Markets, and we can point out a couple particularly worth a visit: there are markets at the palaces of  Schönbrunn  and Belvedere that can be combined with visits to these historic sites. Ice Skating 
 It doesn’t actually snow much in Vienna itself, yet in the winter there’s always ice—in the form of several popular outdoor ice skating rinks. Two of them in particular have scenic and historic backdrops. The neo-Gothic Rathaus, Vienna’s late-19th-century town hall, provides a dramatic background to the Eistraum (Ice Dream), a large skating area ringed by stalls selling all of the usual winter treats, from the ever-present  Glühwein  to waffles and spiral-cut potatoes. The rink is hugely popular—it seems all of Vienna passes through to take a spin, and it’s an easy matter to rent a pair of skates and join in. If you’d like even more of an ice skating adventure, you can take a combination of the U3 subway line and a city bus, or just a taxi, into the Wienerwald, the woods outside Vienna, to the  Schloss Wilhelminenberg . This elaborate early-20th century palace (now a hotel) was the residence of an Austrian Archduke, and it gives a sense of the opulence associated with the very tail end of the empire. Beginning in late November, it hosts an astonishing ice skating rink, with a view out over the hills and down to the city below. This post was updated by Natalie Holmes on 11/24/15.",
2015-12-03,http://blog.contexttravel.com/festive-december-in-milan-and-the-celebration-of-st-ambrose/,Festive December in Milan and the Celebration of St. Ambrose,"From  Fashion Week  to the 2015 World Expo,  Milan  is undoubtedly the  place to visit this year . If you happen to be travelling in Italy throughout the beginning of December, it is a must see. After raking in more than 20 million visitors for the 2015 Milan Expo, the city is now back to its “normal routine.”  Fortunately for us, the Milanese life is not “normal” at all, as it is filled with extraordinary things to see and to do.  We recommend making the trip during the celebration of St Ambrose and the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, which fall on December 7th and 8th. 1 – It’s a traditional and local celebration (and provides a taste of the city’s rich history)  Ambrose (or Ambrogio, as he’s called in Italian) is Milan’s patron saint. He was made bishop, by popular acclamation, in 374 on the 7th of December. Since then, this day has come to be known as the day of Milan and hence the of big celebrations. There’s a long-standing tradition to celebrate this occasion with a Christmas market known as “ Oh Bej Oh Bej ”, meaning “Oh beautiful oh beautiful” in Milanese dialect.  The market’s location is more spacious and  comfortable than the original one, even if a little less romantic. Anyway it is  worth a visit. Immerse yourself in the Christmas atmosphere and browse through handicraft decorations and antiques, mixed with lots of people watching.  With the cold weather, don’t forget to grab a cone of  fragrant  caldarroste  (roasted chestnut) to enjoy while walking around, and don’t miss a  visit to the castle nearby. → Additional tip:  Make sure to visit the basilica of Saint Ambrose. Built between 379 and 386 AD, it is one of the most ancient churches in Milan and located just a few metro stops away. 2 – The opening night at La Scala Arguably the most famous opera and ballet theatre in the world,  La Scala  traditionally opens up its doors for the season on the night of December 7th. The theatre has hosted numerous “La Prima”, or first production, events like Giuseppe Verdi’s premiere of Othello. The highly regarded cultural event draws the likes of local authorities and celebrities wearing glamorous attire. The opening show for 2015-16 season is the “Giovanna D’Arco” by Giuseppe Verdi, directed by Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier, and conducted by Riccardo Chailly. This unique opera made its debut in La Scala in 1845 and offers one of the most immense musical experiences in terms of quality.  Even if you aren’t able to get your hands on a ticket, which can be very expensive and difficult to find, you will undoubtedly be in for a treat as you’ll experience the city burst with excitement. → Additional tip: Take a stroll through Via Manzoni and make sure to take a peak into the  Grand Hotel et de Milan , the former home of world-renowned Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi.  Verdi lived and wrote some of his greatest works at the Grand Hotel. He passed away here on the night of   night of January 27, 1901. 3 – Panettone With Christmas right around the corner, there isn’t a better time for you to get your hands on a traditional panettone, the legendary sweet brioche cake. Requiring a long and complex preparation, the deliciously authentic pastry recipe includes butter, eggs, and flour, with raisins and candied orange cedar pieces evenly distributed throughout the loaf. Don’t fret if you’re a chocolate lover, the panettone is also available in numerous variations, including one with chocolate. There are many legends surrounding the origins of the panettone, but one thing is certain: its birthplace is Milan! Where to find the best panettone? A few of our favorites: Cova:  Established in 1817, this pasticceria – now in via Montenapoleone – has expanded to Japan,  Hong Kong and China.  It was the favorite of widely celebrated opera composer Verdi, who used to buy panettone at this exact location for him and his second wife, Peppina, the opera singer.  Marchesi:  Founded in 1824 and a local favorite, Marchesi was just recently acquired by Prada.  Marchesi has also expanded to via Montenapoleone. Both the new and the historical location, on via Santa Maria alla Porta, offer a charming atmosphere, and impeccable service. Although their traditional cakes and sweets are all outstanding, you can’t make a trip here without trying the classic panettone. Sant’Ambroeus :  Established in 1936 and named after the patron of the city, you will be able to immerse yourself in the Milanese culinary tradition inside this very elegant pasticceria. → Additional tip: If pastries aren’t your cup of tea but you still wish to experience  authentic Milanese cuisine , there are plenty of amazing dishes to go around. Make sure to check out these other traditional plates such as risotto, “cotoletta alla milanese” (cutlet fried in butter) or, for the curious, a “cassoeula”, a traditional winter plate consisting of savoy cabbage stewed with different section of pork. Although some say that the prime time for a cassoeula is in the months of January or February, when the cabbages have been frozen by the cold temperatures, it it nevertheless delicious also in December. 4 – The Holiday shopping What better time to shop in one of the most important international fashion hubs of the world than the holiday season? And while you search for presents for your loved ones, chances are you’ll probably end up finding a few special items for yourself as well.  For the perfect ready to wear shopping experience, make sure to check the windows in the  Quadrilatero della Moda  around the via Montenapoleone district, known as Milan’s most splendid and extravagant shopping area. Visit a couple of hip stores like  10 Corso Como  or Excelsior and then make you choice. Although a bit on the costly side, you’ll surely walk out with the latest and most current stylish attire and accessories. If you’re a fan of design and decor, and have left some space in your suitcase, a visit to  Cargo/ High-tech  or  Moroni Gomma  is an enjoyable experience. The design area in La Rinascente also has an impeccable selection of timeless pieces ranging from home decor, to men’s and women’s fashion. Any gourmand friends on your Christmas shopping list? Bring them something savory from  Peck , the traditional temple of gastronomy, or Eataly, the Italian food chain that has slowly conquered the world. → Additional tip: If you have time and are not worn out from your world class shopping, visit the “ Artigiano in Fiera ”, the huge crafts fair that takes place every year in Rho from the 5th to the 13th of December. With more than 3,000 exhibitors from around Italy and the rest of the world, it will be virtually impossible not to find something that catches your eye. 5. You Can Always Come Back for More If you are dreading the cold and the possibility of snow in December, as you most likely won’t  feel like sitting along the Navigli while drinking your Negroni Sbagliato cocktail during aperitivo time… If you are worried that you won’t be able to see all of the fashion icons and designers strolling around the streets of Milano, which they usually do during fashion week and Salone del Mobile, when the city is literally full of parties… If you are thinking that you will not make any purchases in the stores…Well, these are actually all very good reasons to come now! Why? To have an excuse   to come back again. → Additional tip: do you have a couple of extra days at your disposal? There are amazing day trips outside of Milano, offering opportunities for leisure and relaxation.  You could enjoy hot drinks and fresh pastries at the Christmas markets in beautiful Merano or Bolzano, filled with the cosy and magical atmosphere of the holidays. If the snow allows it, skiing awaits you in the beautiful alpines in Valtellina or Valle D’Aosta. Regardless of the reason, there is no doubt that Milan is a central location for technology, fashion, and culture in Italy. Although the city is 2,600 years old, Milan offers a contemporary twist with many hidden treasures.",
2016-03-29,http://blog.contexttravel.com/vino-and-cava-and-vermut-oh-my-drink-like-a-true-catalan/,"Vino and Cava and Vermut, Oh My! Drink like a True Catalan","There’s more to fiercely independent Catalonia than football.  Sure when we mention Catalonia and its capital city of Barcelona, many think of Barca and the living legend Messi. For ourselves, our minds often turn to  Gaudi  and  Picasso ,  Art Nouveau architecture  and  Catalan  Independence . But lately we’ve been “drinking in” a different  Catalan  lens: Barcelona’s traditional beverages, including  vino  (wine),  cava , and  vermut  (vermouth). To dig deeper, we sat down with Context docent and gastronomic specialist Esther Dotras to discuss the finer points of these three traditional Catalan beverages. Regardless of whether you prefer red, white, or rosé, an excellent glass of wine is essential to a  Catalan  meal. Despite being overlooked by its seaside location, Catalonia boasts one of the finest wine regions in Spain. Its Mediterranean climate makes for dry, warm summers, perfect for growing the grape varieties that form the base of Catalan wines. With 11 protected denominations of origin wines, there are plenty of local wines to choose from. While it’s easy to stick to the basics—white wine with seafood and red with meat—there’s always room for improvisation.  “My personal rules are shellfish and seafood paella with very young dry white wine, whereas a fish soup goes great with a fresh rosé,” Dotras recommends. “Desserts with cinnamon pair well with a High Penedès white, and dishes with chickpeas meld well with a young red. ‘Complicated’ produce, such as artichoke and eggplant that only combine with a fruity rosé.” Catalonia’s wine regions make for a fun day trip from Barcelona, and an excellent opportunity to indulge in a wine tasting to discover your favorite Catalan wine. “ Cava  is the most popular drink for locals. Cava plays a central role in all special celebrations but also at family meals and when having a drink with friends. We drink cava with or without food,” Dotras says.  The marked difference between cava and a traditional wine is its second fermentation process. Combining yeast and different levels of sugar, this second fermentation creates carbon dioxide, giving this popular Catalan drink its characteristic bubbles. Offering more versatility than a standard champagne, a cava can be Brut Nature (extra dry), Brut (very dry), Seco (dry), Semiseco (semi-dry), or Dulce (sweet). Naturally dry, and lacking added sugars, Brut Nature is preferred by most Catalans.  Barcelona’s proximity to Sant Sadurní d’Anoia and Vilafranca del Penedes—centers of Catalan cava production—makes it easy to procure and enjoy casually.  “Meals can start with a Brut Nature cava but we also continue drinking it for the whole meal.  If cava is drunk with dessert it should be a sweet or semi-sweet one but this is only followed by the oldest generations,” Dotras says. “Brut Nature combines perfectly with seafood, especially shellfish and Brut for meats. However, many people don’t follow this rule, sticking to their personal favorite.” Perhaps less familiar than our previous two Catalan begudes, vermut is a local favorite. A traditional aperitif, vermut is an aromatic, fortified wine. Beginning with a base wine, alcohol is added into the mix to stabilize the wine from maturing into a vinegar during the maceration process. Following this initial step, a special mixture of bark, herbs, flowers, and often caramelized sugar is added to give vermut its distinctive flavor.  The aperitif was initially popularized in the early 20th century at Barcelona’s Modernista Café Torino, designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Pere Falqués, and  Antoni Gaudí . While the café itself was short-lived, vermut was cemented as the drink of the upwardly mobile and artistically inclined. Following the  Spanish Civil war , however, it was adopted as the favored beverage of blue collar workers, who would frequent bodegas and cafés after work in search of a vermut.  “Catalan vermut is my favorite drink with  tapas , ” shares Dotras . “’Vermut time’ used to be and still is on Sunday from noon to 3:00 pm, a perfect time for an aperitif with tapas. Since nowadays, tapas are eaten as a substitute for a meal, either at lunch or at dinner time, vermut is also enjoyed at those times.” Best served over ice with a twist of orange, vermut is the perfect accent to an afternoon on a sun-soaked terrace.",
2015-12-06,http://blog.contexttravel.com/unraveling-the-jubilee-what-to-expect-in-rome/,The Jubilee: What to Expect in Rome,"Anticipation is mounting in Rome as Pope Francis prepares to commence the Year of Jubilee on December 8th, 2015. But we at Context have noticed that very few people – natives and visitors alike – have a full grasp of what precisely the Jubilee Year means, both in the Catholic faith or to the city of  Rome . So we’ve put together a summary of where the tradition comes from, and what to expect here in the months ahead. In the ancient Hebrew tradition, the Jubilee was celebrated every 50 years and designed to rebalance rights and justice. It would offer families that had lost property, and sometimes their freedom, an opportunity to change their circumstances. It was also a reminder to the rich of their obligations to the poor and a reminder that slaves could again become their equals. In the Catholic Church, it all started in the year 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII granted “great remissions and   indulgences for sins” to pilgrims who visited the city of Rome and its holy sites within a year.  Since then Jubilees, or Holy Years, have typically been held every 25-50 years, focusing on justice and mercy, implying a general pardon and an indulgence open to all, as well as offering the opportunity to deepen one’s faith. Popes are known to occasionally stray from that traditional timespan, calling Extraordinary Jubilees to mark special occasions in off-years. Such was the case in 1983, the year of the the last Extraordinary Jubilee, when John Paul II celebrated the 1,950 years that had passed since the death and resurrection of Jesus. Such is again the case this Holy Year, which comes only 15 years since the previous Jubilee. The start of the upcoming Extraordinary Jubilee coincides with the 50th anniversary of the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council, and carries the theme of divine mercy.  “Dear Brothers and Sisters, I have often reflected upon how the Church can make its mission as a witness of mercy more apparent,” said Francis when he announced the Jubilee. “It is a journey that begins with spiritual conversion. For this reason I have decided to proclaim an  Extraordinary Jubilee  which focuses on God’s mercy. It will be a  Holy Year of Mercy . We wish to experience this inspired by the Word of the Lord: “Be merciful, just as your father is merciful” (cfr. Luke 6:36). This Holy Year will begin on the next Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception and will conclude on 20 November 2016, Sunday of Our Lord Jesus Christ King of the universe and the living face of the Father’s mercy.” The Jubilee begins with the opening of the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican, which is normally cemented shut, and opened only throughout the Holy Year. The other Roman basilicas –  St. John in the Lateran , St. Paul Outside the Walls and  Santa Maria Maggiore  – also have holy doors, which will be opened shortly afterward. The act symbolizes the start of an “extraordinary journey” for the faithful toward salvation. Catholic pilgrims are required to visit all four basilicas. For security reasons, all pilgrims wanting to cross the holy door at  St Peter’s Basilica  will have to register online. There will be a reserved walking path for them, which will will begin at Castel Sant’Angelo and finish at the Holy Door, passing through via della Conciliazione, Piazza Pio XII and Saint Peter’s Square. Pilgrims can sign up via  this website , on the page “Registration for Pilgrims.” Once pilgrims are registered, in addition to being able to sign up for the major events, they will be able to choose the date and approximate time of their pilgrimage to the holy door of Saint Peter’s, and they will receive a note confirming the request. There will be a Welcome Center for Pilgrims at via della Conciliazione 7, where people can sign up and find help regarding logistics. Considering the wild popularity of Pope Francis, officials estimate a massive turnout of up to 33 million people throughout the course of the Jubilee. In 2000, some 25 million visited Rome during the last Holy Year. According to Context docent Sara Magister,  a scientific consultant for the Vatican Museums and editor for the National Italian Encyclopaedia, this Jubilee gives tourists the perfect chance to see Rome in a different light,  not only as the capital of the ancient Roman empire, but also as a holy city. “This event gives us a better chance to understand how art and faith are so deeply connected and how it is mainly this specific connection that generated some of the best masterpieces. ” In the run-up,  Rome has undertaken a city-wide makeover. While you won’t see any major changes to infrastructure, you will notice repaved streets, repainted crosswalks, and areas where sidewalks have been widened, especially in the center. The objective was to create four main pedestrian itineraries that connect the major basilicas, while including some lesser-known, yet important, churches, such as the Chiesa Nuova,  St. Salvatore at the Laurels, and the Church of the Most Holy Trinity of Pilgrims.

2015-12-10,http://blog.contexttravel.com/charles-ii-el-escorials-most-bizarre-resident/,Charles II: El Escorial’s Most Bizarre Resident,"San Lorenzo de El Escorial, or simply  El Escorial , just outside of  Madrid , is a 16th century royal palace recognized for its opulence and the curious cast of monarchs who called it home. One such monarch is King Charles II of the Habsburgs, but it’s unfortunately not his exploits or ruling acumen for which he is best known. No, Charles II, nicknamed Charles the Bewitched, is notorious for being the peculiar last Spanish  Habsburg . The end of the line. Physically and (likely) intellectually disabled, afflicted with the infamous  Habsburg jaw , and infertile, Charles was the unfortunate culmination of generations of inbreeding, something for which the Habsburgs are especially known, and to which we attribute the ultimate extinction of the Spanish branch of the family. In order to keep the the bloodline pure and power consolidated, cousin-to-cousin and niece-to-uncle marriages were almost exclusively arranged—indeed Charles’ father, King Philip IV of Spain, was the maternal uncle of Charles’ mother, Mariana of Austria (of the Austrian branch of the family). Charles was an indolent child, never forced to attend school or even clean himself. Due to his crippling jaw deformities he drooled and had difficulty eating and speaking. It is said his only interest was shooting on the grounds El Escorial. He was married twice but produced no heirs. He was often sick and suffered from seizures, and became so disturbed later in life that he reportedly ordered his relatives to be unearthed from the mausoleum, simply to look upon them. Not surprisingly, once Charles took the throne in 1661, he was a wildly ineffectual ruler, allowing Spain to become ravaged by war and economic stagnation. By the time of Charles’ death in 1700, at the age of 38, his brothers and sisters had predeceased him (the Habsburg’s consanguineous marriages weakened the gene pool to such an extent that their infant and early childhood death-rate was higher than that of the area peasants). With no apparent heir, the Habsburg reign in Spain came to a crushing halt, and the Bourbon house has occupied the Spanish throne, more or less, since. Wandering the halls of El Escorial, now a national museum, provides insight into the life of Charles II, his noble family, and their legacy on Spanish history. El Escorial, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is approximately 50 km from Madrid, accessible by train or bus. Join our scholar-led  excursion  for an in-depth historical and architectural look at the site. Interested in other Habsburgs? We offer walks that illuminate the history of the Austrian branch of the family in both  Vienna  and  Prague .  For some scientific insight into the condition of Charles II and the inbreeding of the Habsburgs, we recommend  this article .",
2015-12-14,http://blog.contexttravel.com/dreaming-of-deep-travel-staff-picks-for-2016/,Dreaming of Deep Travel – Staff Picks for 2016,"As  Deep Travelers , members of the Context team can often be found dreaming of faraway shores. We take inspiration from our clients, docents, and each other, and love to plan our own immersive experiences. Here’s where some of us are aspiring to visit in 2016. Hong Kong 
 “I remember hearing about the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 without really understanding what that meant. As I’ve gotten older, the complex history of Hong Kong and its shift from a piece of the British Empire to a mostly-autonomous part of China has fascinated me and I would  love to learn more about it first-hand . But if I’m being honest, the main thing that calls me to Hong Kong– besides the history, the  vibrant cityscape , the multicultural melting pot– is  the food . I want to try all of it: the dim sum, the egg tarts, the street food and the fancy fare. For research, of course.”  –Katie Nadworny, Destination Manager, Istanbul & Athens (Istanbul office) Athens 
 “Growing up with a grandmother, who was a Greek Mail-Order Bride at the turn of the century, my mother has always had stories to tell. Between tales of Grandma Rellos playing in the rubble of the Parthenon as a child, to falling in love with the heavily edited waters off Mamma Mia!’s filming location (Skopelos, in case you were wondering), I found myself transfixed by Greece. After sitting down with an adventurous friend who hitchhiked her way across the country, I’ve decided to give in. It’s high time I tasted  feta  from someplace other than my local grocery store. While I’m mainly interested in the islands, a trip to Greece isn’t complete without discovering Athens. Connecting my memory of Greek myths to their stunning landscape, exploring ancient temples dedicated to  Athena  and  Poseidon  will be all the more poignant.”  –Lauren Sarazen, Assistant Docent Manager for France and Spain (Paris office) Istanbul 
 “This year I would love to go back to Istanbul and take my three-year-old with me. I look forward to sharing  delicious meze  with her while introducing her to this beautiful city. I plan on taking in the  mosques  and the  bazaars  in small doses, focusing on details such as the colorful Iznik tiles (picking a favorite one and trying to recreate it with crayons will be fun). We’ll take the  vapour  from the European to the  Asian side , probably more often than needed, as Anna loves boats. Finally, we’ll pay a visit to the  Dolmabahçe  to dream about life in the palace.”  –Petulia Melideo, UK Operations Manager (London office) “As a Canadian making Berlin my home, I’m becoming increasingly fascinated by the idea of a city as a palimpsest, a changeable landscape – built up, written over, and worn down by centuries of history. In the same way that Berlin’s quicksilver character hints at its tumultuous story, my idea of Istanbul is of a city that is both ancient and constantly reinventing. My neighborhood is the  Turkish quarter of Berlin , where biweekly markets hawking shiny-skinned avocados and succulent figs evoke a tiny piece of home for the immigrant community. My imagination is caught by Istanbul and the associations I have with the name: the scent of spices and coffee, hot midday sun mellowing to dusky light in the early evenings, slippery silks and sticky squares of  baklava . Now, I’m dreaming of late summer days in the Grand Bazaar and warm nights wandering in  Galata  – and extra fresh avocados.”  –Stephanie Taralson, Destination Manager, Central Europe (Berlin office) Tokyo 
 “Having devoured novel after novel by Japanese surrealist author Haruki Murakami, I am so utterly enchanted by the peculiar Japan represented in his writing that I must see it for myself. I look forward to wandering the erie  Aokigahara  forest, paying a visit to the cats of  Tashirojima , and soaking up quirky  Otaku culture . Of course no trip would be complete without also taking in Japan’s traditional side— zen gardens , the  Way of Tea , historic  markets  selling miso, wasabi, and fresh sashimi, the delicate cherry blossoms . . . What am I waiting for?!”  –Sara McCarty, Regional Manager, France and Spain (Paris office) Dublin 
 “Growing up in London and living now in Berlin–both cities with large Irish communities–over the years I’ve had the pleasure of making many friends from the Emerald Isle. They’re each horrified to learn that I’ve never visited their green and pleasant homeland, despite having travelled the world. It can be all too easy to miss the treasures in front of our eyes, and one of my New Year Resolutions is to do some exploring in my own backyard. I’m drawn to Ireland because it’s geographically so close yet  culturally distinct –exotic even. Plus, I’m dying for a decent pint of Guinness.”  –Natalie Holmes, Regional Manager, Central & Southern Europe and North America (Berlin office)",
