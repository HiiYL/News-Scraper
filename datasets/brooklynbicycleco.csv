The first is a   in association with  , whose executive director, Paul Steely White, will join us to quash those pesky bike myths that keep folks from riding. If you wanna join us for that,   here! Our second event,  , brings together four New York riders who want to share what it’s really like to bike in the city–and their discussion is moderated by funny lady  . Rachel  But why is   moderating  , our   panel? Because Gloria. Gloria is the bike Rachel’s friends gifted her this past Christmas after Rachel’s own bike was stolen. The bike is named after Gloria Steinem because, in Rachel’s words, “she is beautiful, she liberates me, and she exists because of my wonderful community.” The story of this bike–how it brought Rachel’s community closer–and Rachel’s own efforts to create community and empower people through storytelling do just what we seek to do as a company: strengthen communities.

(also known as TA) is more than just the headliner for the first of our events.  The organization is on a mission to “reclaim New York City’s streets from the automobile and to promote bicycling, walking, public transit.”  Given that most New Yorkers do at least one of these things daily, that’s a mission we can all relate to–and support. In their own words, “T.A. fights for the installation of infrastructure improvements that reduce speeding and traffic crashes, save lives and improve everyday transportation for all New Yorkers.”  That means fighting for Select Bus Service to decrease commuter travel times; pushing for bike and pedestrian paths on the Verrazano and on Queens Boulevard to save lives and open up new commuting options; championing the pedestrian   to protect walking New Yorkers from aggressive driving; and much more. You may also have heard of  , the idea that “no New Yorker should be killed or injured in traffic.”  Many cities across the US have begun committing to Vision Zero programs of their own, and TA is a part of the movement here in New York demanding that the city take meaningful action to realize this vision. TA was also instrumental in establishing New York’s now-successful  ,  , and still works with New Yorkers across all boroughs to win Citi Bike stations for their neighborhoods. This, together with all the other bike infrastructure TA pushes for, makes the organization’s Executive Director, Paul Steely White, the perfect man to set to rest, at  , those pesky   that keep people from taking advantage of a healthy and affordable mode of transportation. TA is only as strong as its many supporters in neighborhoods throughout the city.  Are you passionate about something–like why there’s no crosswalk at the end of your block and getting home is like playing Frogger?  Or why the “bike lane” you attempt to take to work is one giant pothole that has wrecked your tires one too many times?  TA encourages you to go and complain about it to the people who have the power to change it!  Check out their   and get involved at a local level, then sign up for their newsletter to stay updated on all the ways you can actually help change New York for the better.",

Blog,"May ( ) is  , so we’ve rounded up four New Yorkers who want to talk to us about what it’s really like to ride a bike in New York City—and one of them is   of  . Courtney grew up in the Midwest riding bikes–but as high school, college, and eventually grad school demanded that all of her attention be split between her studies and the student organizing she loved, she essentially forgot about her bike passion.  Upon moving to NYC in 2009, she noticed that the city at least had a bike culture she might want to be a part of one day, but in her tiny apartment, where her room was actually a living room with a curtain for a door, bike storage and a commuter’s life didn’t seem feasible. Ultimately, it was bike infrastructure that got   riding again.  As she unpacked the final item in her new Clinton Hill apartment, she realized there was a bike lane on her new street, and saw it as a sign that it was finally time to get back on a bike–as it happens, a vintage 10-speed purchased for $85 from the  .

Bike Accessories for Spring,"It looks like spring really has come early this year, which means the seasonal bike riders among us are getting back on our city bikes, and some of us are even making our first bicycle purchases since we were kids!  But none of us will get any use out of our bikes if we don’t have the proper accessories–and we’re not just talking functionality.  The   we buy should be just as stylish as our handbags, our briefcases, and every other lifestyle accessory we own.  So we’ve rounded up some of our favorite stylish & functional bike bags and baskets that will make it chic and easy to ride your bike anywhere you’d walk or drive… If you prefer to travel light and just need a way to keep your purse from falling off your shoulder while you ride, the     is for you.  Its ingenious straps keep it secured to your bike rack, and most importantly, it looks phenomenal on and off the bike.  So instead of constantly transferring the contents of your purse to a   & vice verse, or stuffing your actual purse inside a pannier, then worrying the pannier will be stolen when you run into the store, you can simply make this   your purse, taking it on and off the bike as you need, and feeling confident it’s both safe and looking good. And speaking of stolen–have you ever wished your bike came with a trunk, the way your car does? Something you could lock while you were away, that you could keep your gym clothes in, or where you could store one purchase while you ran a different errand…  Well, now there’s  –a trunk for your bike!  It locks and looks amazing; what more could you want–except maybe to look like   while using it? While the   attaches to your rear rack, our   is a stunning addition to the front of your bike.  A companion piece to our best-selling  , this version offers a sophisticated look, the security of keeping a watchful eye on your purse or briefcase while you ride, plus straps to secure that bag, blanket, book, and brown-bag lunch you’re toting.  The crate is supported by struts underneath, allowing it to hold more weight than a traditional handlebar basket, and because the struts are adjustable, the crate can be raised or lowered to suit most any bike.  Your new go-to front   has arrived.

2016-04-19,http://blog.brooklynbicycleco.com/bike-riding-irl-countri-bike-national-bike-month/,Bike Riding IRL: Countri Bike Talks City Biking,"If you’ve been reading our blog (and you have, of course), you know that we’ve got   happening soon, and that the second,  , happens Tuesday, May 10th, and brings together four New Yorkers who want to share with bike-curious city dwellers their experiences riding a bike in NYC.  One of those folks happens also to have experience biking outside of NYC–so far outside, in fact, as to wind up in California.  We spoke with  –a.k.a.  –about his choice to bike across the country, and what he plans to do now that he’s back. Biking is faster than walking and less expensive and more convenient than waiting for public transportation. I mean, have you ever seen anybody look happy waiting for the bus? Even on the coldest days I’d rather be in a bike lane than captive to MTA service while stuffed into a crowded subway car. I also dislike taxis because I have no control over their speed or driving style, which often irritates me. And honestly, while time and cost savings are important, the biggest reason I bike is because it feels amazing. On bike you create your own route. I love the logistical challenge of getting from A to B in NYC and inserting myself into the mix of vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic on crowded city streets. It’s absolutely exhilarating and surprisingly safe if you obey the traffic rules.  Bike sharing is the perfect way to get started riding more often because it allows you to ride without the hassle of owning or maintaining a bike of your own. I had a bike, but immediately switched to Citi Bike upon its launch. It made more sense to commute using their equipment, which can take potholes and glass shards far better than my road bike, and not carrying around a heavy lock and chain or worrying about theft are bonuses.",
2016-03-25,http://blog.brooklynbicycleco.com/national-bike-month-matters/,Why National Bike Month Matters - Brooklyn Bicycle Co. Blog,"We’ve been asking around, lately, and lots of people outside the bike industry–even people who ride regularly–aren’t aware that here in the US, May is  …or even that there IS a Bike Month, period.  But there certainly is–and, in preparation for  , we’ve rounded up all the reasons that, believe it or not, it’s a really important time for all of us. A little blurb making its rounds on the internet contends   was established in 1956 by the Cycle Trade Association of America purely as a means to promote sales.  We can’t find any evidence that this is the case, nor that any Cycle Trade Association of America ever existed.  (We’d love to hear, in the comments below, from anyone with more specific information!)  We do know, however, that the   now sponsors National Bike Month (and  ), and the initiative isn’t just–or even predominantly–about sales; it’s about transforming the US from a car-dominated culture to one where   are a mainstream form of transportation. But why do bicycles matter enough to warrant a whole month of advocacy and attention?  How does National Bike Month measure up to Black History Month,  , or  ?    benefit us on both societal and individual levels, and America’s adopting them as a mainstream method of transportation would change lives both here and abroad. , greenhouse gases from transportation (cars, trucks, boats, planes, etc.) account for a third of all US greenhouse gas emissions, and of these, “The largest sources of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions include passenger cars and light-duty trucks, including sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and minivans….[which] account for over half of the emissions from the sector.”  This means that reducing the number of passenger vehicles on the road will significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  Furthermore, the EPA says, “Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation have increased by about 16% since 1990.”  As our population grows, our cities sprawl, and cars become more affordable, our emissions increase.  Bicycles are a feasible mode of transportation and they could slow global warming and better the air quality of our cities.  have played a major role in the western women’s liberation movement and continue to offer opportunities to disadvantaged people the world over. Here in the US,  , “bikes are disproportionately important tools for the lowest-income workers” because bicycles are the cheapest form of transport.  Consider it: even if you bought the cheapest used car you could find for $500, you’d still have to gas it up regularly and pay for repairs.  But you could buy a used bike for less than $100, no gas required.  Air for your tires is free at most bike shops, and bike maintenance costs far less than car repairs. In certain places in Africa, people have to walk many miles to get to school, which of course discourages attendance, especially in women and girls, who must also find time to do housework.  Bicycles makes it possible for those individuals to get an education and, in turn, to enrich their villages. The   found that a million-dollar investment in bicycle infrastructure results in 11 jobs, as opposed to only 10 for pedestrian projects, and 7.8 for “road-only” projects.  In addition,   reports that, “While cyclists tend to spend less per shopping trip than drivers, they also tend to make more trips, pumping more total money into the local economy over time.”  According to a   done in NYC’s East Village, bicyclists spend more at local businesses than do pedestrians, drivers, or those who take public transit. The   notes that people who ride bikes live an average of two years longer than those who don’t, and the   found that biking just 20 miles a week (which is a lot easier than it sounds, if you consider that’s just one 3-mile roundtrip commute per day or two roundtrip 10-mile commutes each week) reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by 50%.  And if you take into consideration that   reduced the city’s Air Pollution Index score from the usual 160 (harmful to the health of Beijing’s residents) to just 17 (far lower than the US’s current 125 average), more bike ridership means better air quality and healthier citizens.",

After some relaxed mingling on everyone’s part,  ‘s Deputy Director Caroline Samponaro (pictured below with Brooklyn Bicycle Co. president Ryan Zagata) gave a great presentation about the “Myths & Legends” that surround biking in NYC. Myths include the biggie–that biking is dangerous, during which segment we learned it’s safer to bike in this city than it is to walk–plus well-known bike lane myths, such as that they increase traffic congestion (data shows they relieve it), are bad for business (studies show they’re actually good for business), and take up too much space (since bikes take up way less space than cars, really the argument should be made that cars are the ones taking up too much space). Legends featured legendary bike activists, including Jane Jacobs, whose 100th birthday was honored by the above   only a day after our party. Caroline’s presentation, together with great audience questions, incited a lively discussion, and we all learned things, shared concerns, and got to know new people.
