2016-04-20,http://coschedule.com/blog/email-subject-lines/,How To Write Email Subject Lines That Get More Opens,"The free blog post headline analyzer will score your overall headline quality and rate its ability to result in social shares, increased traffic, and SEO value.First impressions matter.This is doubly true when writing email subject lines. They’re the first thing recipients see in their inbox. When written well, they inspire readers to open your email newsletters and click through to read more. If they’re off target, however, they let your reader know your email is a waste of time and space.No pressure, though.To make matters worse, we all get too many emails. Whether they’re from a store you don’t even remember going to, or maybe your parents are wondering why you don’t write more often (you should really drop them a line), the pursuit of inbox zero is a fabled achievement (particularly amongst busy marketers).Table Of ContentsClick To Tweet

											The odds are stacked against you here. However, you’re a fearless email marketer, right? You know that if you can nail your subject line right away, your email stands a chance at delighting your reader. That’s because you know your newsletter is awesome, right? If it wasn’t, you wouldn’t have written it (or you would have re-written it).In this post, we’ll cover:Make yourself comfortable. We’re going to write sharp subject lines that demand the attention your email deserves.Let’s start by asking exactly why paying attention to subject lines is important. Here are some sobering stats about subject lines:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Every email marketing campaign and audience is different. However, there are some basic best practices that hold true in most cases. Here are nine to remember:People remember people that waste their time. So, don’t waste people’s time reusing subject lines. This sends the message that they’ve already read your email. Even worse, they may have ignored the first time (and now they’re even more annoyed).Different email clients display different character counts before cutting off subject lines. If you stick to roughly five to seven words (or about 50 characters), you can ensure yours will always appear in full.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You want people to read your email. However, you don’t want to be too aggressive. Avoid excessively sales-oriented sounding messaging. People are protective with their time and money. They don’t want to waste either. Show value first before going for the sale.Sometimes directing readers with a specific action can motivate them to respond. For example, “Join Us At The Movies!”
would likely be more effective than “Going To Movies Is Fun” if you were trying to drive customers to a theater.A lot of us like to think we’re funny. Sometimes we might even succeed, at least around our friends. However, comedy writing is a difficult skill to master. Unless you moonlight as a successful sitcom writer, it’s probably better to leave the jokes to the professionals.Data doesn’t lie. If you have a stat that sounds unreal or counter-intuitive, use that in your subject line. Just remember it’s important to present stats in a way that isn’t misleading.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?People have short attention spans. So, don’t make them work too hard to understand your subject line. Use clear language and keep it short while cutting out any unnecessary words.Be conversational and write like a human being. In other words, don’t sound like a robot. Use language similar to what your target audience would use.SERIOUSLY JUST BREAK THE ALL CAPS KEY AND NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN.Subject lines are a lot like headlines. The more emotional, the better.We don’t mean you need to make your readers sad. In fact, we’re talking about the complete opposite.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?People want to know how their life will be better, easier, or more enjoyable because they read your email. Those kinds of benefits aren’t necessarily easy to convey. However, they’re essential for optimal open rates.You want to make people feel something.This doesn’t have to mean something profound or life-changing. Just something that connects emotionally and makes them want to read your message instead of passively scrolling by (or worse, sending you to their SPAM folder).Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You’ve got some basic best practices down. You also know you’ve got to hit your readers right in the feels (figuratively, not literally). Now, it’s time to move beyond theory and start applying practical examples. Let’s look at some actual examples of how to write subject lines.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Tell users to take a specific action. For example, telling someone shoes are 50% is different than telling someone to save 50%. The former simply makes a statement, while the latter encourages an actual action.Deadlines and “limited time” messaging can inspire immediate action. The “fear of missing out” is real, and no one wants to miss out on something good.Everybody loves suspense. However, no one loves clickbait. The key to leveraging curiosity successfully is to get your reader wanting to know more, without obviously overselling yourself.Enthusiasm spreads. If you’re excited about what you have to offer, then other people probably will be too.People don’t just buy products; they buy experiences that make them feel good. Show recipients they’re appreciated by going above and beyond what’s expected from an otherwise routine transaction.Closed-ended questions are effective in headlines and subject lines alike. They get readers interested in the topic, and imply that your email will provide the answer.Email is an inherently conversational medium. People want to talk to other people. They don’t want to feel like another name on a mailing list, targeted by an automated system. Small touches, such as using words like “you” and “us”, can help add warmth to your messaging. Using language that’s written the way someone might talk helps too.People don’t have a lot of time to read everything in their inbox. You don’t have a lot of space to work with as a writer here, either. Keep things short by cutting out any extraneous words that don’t need to be in your headline.Next, let’s look at some real subject lines and see what makes them work. We’ll analyze these to see what tactics they use, and which kinds of emotions they inspire. These are real examples from my personal email inbox:I don’t know how State Farm knows I have bad driving habits (I like to think that I don’t, at least). However, this message clearly tells me it’ll help me do something better. It makes a promise to help improve the reader’s life in a small way. Plus, the word “time” helps invoke a little extra urgency.If you’re unfamiliar with Humble Bundle, they offer packages of ebooks, software, and other digital goods at pay-what-you-want prices (with a portion of the proceeds going to charity). Here, they’ve done a good job of letting me know time is running out to get this month’s offer. Since I know that once it’s gone, it’s gone for good, there’s added incentive to click.This is a simple sales message from Pet Smart that lets me know three things:The only thing this is missing is a verb to motivate action. However, with limited space to work with, this hits a lot of checkboxes.Way to play on my senses of guilt and responsibility, Petco. This subject line inspires an emotional response (people love their dogs). It also tells me what problem this email will solve (helping my dogThis subject line inspires an emotional response (people love their dogs). It also tells me what problem this email will solve (helping my dog not get the flu), and shows the price right off the bat. A responsible pet owner isn’t going to put a price on their dog’s safety, right?Hubspot is playing up the curiosity angle here. So, what happened when they sent fewer emails? There’s only one way to find out.Not only does this example from Wordstream tell me what I can do (spend less money), the word “lazy” suggests it’ll make my life easier too.It’s tough to incorporate humor unless it really fits your brand’s voice. However, artist-driven clothing company Threadless knows how to make lighthearted irreverence work. This example succeeds at all of the following:This is an emotional appeal to ego. Wired is a prestigious publication, and they’ve got an exclusive offer for me? The word “waiting” also instills some urgency to get moving.Proof Branding owner Matt Cheuvront writes awesome motivational newsletters. This is a great example of how to write a short, simple subject line that inspires a positive emotional response in just two words.The day I ignore this email will probably be the day I break a guitar. There’s not much to this subject line from Musician’s Friend, but it includes a verb that motivates action and creates urgency (hurry), and implies a benefit (not breaking my guitar).Click To Tweet

Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?When you’re done, circle two subject line options you’ll A/B test in our next step.Nearly every email service provider lets you send A/B tests for your email subject lines. Whether you use MailChimp, Campaign Monitor (our platform of choice), or something similar, most provide A/B testing options when building email newsletters.This video from MailChimp is specific to their platform, but it covers a lot of A/B testing basics that should apply to most platforms:However, what makes a good A/B test? It’s a good question that’s key to getting the best performance.The key to a good A/B test is to choose variables that really are different from one another. If you test two subject lines that sound too similar, you won’t learn much. There needs to be a substantial difference between your two options. Consider these five different approaches when you run your next A/B test:Let’s say your email content is promoting a post that both A) shows readers how to save time and B) shows them how to save money.These are two very different value propositions. Therefore, it’d be a good idea to write two options, one that focuses on each benefit. Then, see which performs best. This could yield the added benefit of letting you know which one your audiences cares about most.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Your audience might respond better to curiosity than urgency. Or, maybe they’re looking for something that will brighten their day.So, find out. Try targeting different emotions and see what drives a better response.You don’t have a lot of room to work with here. However, you might find different subject line lengths work best for you. Or, different lengths may work better for different types of messages.Consider experimenting with short (one or two words) versus long (seven or eight words).Questions can help get readers curious. However, definitive statements can express authority. Try both and see what happens.Statistics can drive email opens, especially when they’re difficult to believe. If your email content includes an interesting stat, try working into one subject line option. Then, compare it to another stat-less option.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Use the analytics tools built into your email platform to monitor open rates. Use this template to write down your winner and loser from the test, the difference in the results, and scrutinize the reason why your winner performed the best.When assessing the reason one subject line outperformed the other, keep the following in mind:What works for one person, might not work for you. This is why it’s better to know how to gather your own data than to simply follow someone else’s.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?It’s easy to overlook subject lines when we’re writing marketing emails.They’re short, so they should be easy, right? Not exactly. It’s often tougher to write short, punchy messages than long, rambling pieces. When you only have about 50 characters to work with, every word counts.We can’t tell you exactly what messaging will work best in your email. However, you’re now equipped with the knowledge you need to start experimenting with your own subject lines. By following the tips and best practices in this post, you’ll be able to dramatically increase your odds for success.Try different things. See what works. Ditch what doesn’t. Repeat for success.Click To Tweet

When he's not hard at work helping people do better marketing, he can be found playing bass guitar, drinking fine beer, and chasing his dog around the house.If you want to build and execute a data-driven, agile content strategy to get massive results from your content marketing, this post is for you.Need help creating more effective content, more easily? Download these 21+ marketing templates, each designed to help you do your best work now.Interesting data! But there’s a number that I would like to have seen here, the “click-to-open” rates. I think this is one of the most useful stats in email marketing, since it helps remove variables such as timing. This number shows the percentage of people who clicked AFTER the email was opened.To me, open rates aren’t quite as useful since some email clients (and webmail interfaces like gmail) open every email as soon as you click. It doesn’t necessarily tell you as much about the subscribers engagement or intent.Thanks for sharing your research! I’m really enjoying your blog…Great point, Andy. That’s data we do have as well. Perhaps we’ll have to do another post and dig into that a bit–it is fascinating to see what got people to click through and probably warrants a post all its own. Glad you enjoy the blog :-)I kinda feel like blog post topic is a potentially huge bias here. What if the opens were more about the topic of the subject line than the subject line itself? I’d be really interested in seeing tests where both subject lines referenced the same blog post.Thanks for the comment, Brittany. Yes, I mentioned that possibility up at the top in #2 (arbitrary decisions). I agree — that would make another round of interesting A/B testing, removing the topical difference, to try and see how that affects subject lines. Perhaps that will be one of our next tests :-)how do you know if a subject line test if Valid and if it is NOT VALID??Thanks.I like the examples you have shown. Thank you for posting this. What is your opinion about this website? https://www.coreminer.com/calculators/correlation-testThis content is more valuable for newbie email marketers. Thanks for sharing this information.Thanks for reading, Palash!Julie, you wrote a great guide! Though, I have a few things to mention. I actually do not agree with your examples like this one:
Hurry! Save 50% Before Time Runs Out. I think that similar subject lines can “throw” emails to spam.I am en email marketer myself and while getting ready my promo emails, I try to avoid words like ‘hurry’, ‘sale’, as well as %, $… This may cause troubles to my opinion.As an alternative, the subject line may be: Huge shoes deal at [company name]
or
Exclusive offer: save big on your favorite shoes Something like that :)Those are all valid points. It can be challenging to balance language that creates urgency while avoiding terms and symbols that might trigger spam filters. What works best can always vary between different brands and audiences (which is why we advocate so much for A/B testing), but that’s definitely something we could have been more careful to call attention to.Great post. But I have a caveat for the “Never reuse a subject line” rule — it can work if your email is relatively formulaic and regular and your subscribers know what to expect. I run a email-based subscription business, and I’ve tested using the same subject line vs. new ones. The results are pretty clear: more people open the emails with the same subject line. I’ve noticed others use this strategy as well. For example, Creative Market uses the same line (“😊 Happy Monday – Download 6 New Free Goods!”) every week for it’s freebie emails. Thanks again for the tips!You make an excellent point, Logan, and that’s a use case I completely overlooked. I’ve got nothing to add, other than I agree with you here.Thanks for reading and adding that insight!© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,3

											Evergreen content is timeless, valuable information your audience has needed forever and will continue to need well into the future. It’s pretty awesome for many reasons:Are you sold? Let’s get your brain going with a little evergreen inspiration.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?When we asked you about your biggest content marketing challenge a couple months ago, you told us that it’s most difficult to find ideas worth executing.So a good place to begin with evergreen content to make sure you get your 283% more traffic is by starting with awesome ideas.Your audience has always had questions that need answers, challenges that need solutions, and problems they need to solve.Use your knowledge of your audience to answer the tough questions no one else in your niche is doing well enough.Ideas:Examples:The key to making an evergreen step-by-step post is to focus on the practical utility behind the strategy instead of the mechanics of the programs or tools your audience could use to implement your advice.For example, show someone the data-driven ways that work for building an email list rather than the programs they could use to achieve that success. The programs may likely change and vary for any reader, but the strategy behind list building likely works with any tool.Ideas:Examples:Similar to step-by-step blog posts, evergreen guides focus on helping your readers understand the strategic thinking behind a process.Sometimes, these guides take on a different format than blog posts to appear super comprehensive.For example, you could write a how-to post about how to write compelling social media messages that will increase your traffic. The evergreen angle for this post would focus on the psychology of showing the benefits behind the click instead of the mechanics behind best message length for each social network.See the difference?Ideas:Examples:Fundamental posts typically present themselves as a list of ideas or ways to do something. These posts typically focus on presenting a lot of information in one place with the hopes that if your readers leave with even one takeaway, you’ve done your job.For example, let’s say you want to write a post about getting inspired when you hit a road block at work. To create an evergreen blog post, you’d present lots of ways, methods, or ideas to get past the challenge of being uninspired.Ideas:Examples:This type of content is one of the most influential kinds of evergreen content.Thought leadership and new method posts don’t necessary look at what others in the past have done—or link to other sources to back up their claims—but instead are the posts that present theories, processes, systems, and ideas that no one has really covered ever before.For example, have you come up with a modern way to do something that makes the standard process obsolete? That’s likely an evergreen idea you could add into your editorial calendar.Ideas:Examples:That headline might sound like a tall order. It should. Rest assured, though, no matter your resources or who you compete against, you can publish better content than anyone.All it takes is some research, optimization, and dedication—all skills you can learn as the ambitious marketer you are.A caveat on why this should be your goal: It’s hard to stand out. It’s even harder if you’re publishing content that isn’t better than your competition.If you want to win at evergreen content—like anything—you need to produce content that your audience finds extremely useful and helps them produce real and measurable results.The process you’re about to learn will help you do exactly that.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Since coming up with ideas is a major challenge for many content marketers, let’s start there. You know what types of evergreen content may work well for you, but how do you fill in the blanks with really great topic ideas?There’s a simple process that will help you come up with hundreds of ideas in next to no time. It involves a couple folks who know your audience really well, an instant messaging app, and an hour to sift through those ideas to find the absolute best ones.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?First, let’s set the story straight: Group brainstorming doesn’t work. But you can help your entire team brainstorm together in a way that is extremely effective.Set up an hour-long content planning meeting with your team to get started:Include an analysis of your most popular content in your meeting invitation. That will help you and your team understand what sorts of ideas your audience already loves and will help your meeting generate lots of awesome new ideas.Begin by first understanding what your goals are, and how you measure success:Here’s an example of what your spreadsheet might look like when you fill it out:Use the evergreen content planning meeting spreadsheet to discover your best-performing content to plan more ideas that will generate similar awesome results.And here’s the text you can copy and paste into your meeting invitation when you attach your spreadsheet:Hey team,Join me for a content planning meeting to help us discover new ideas that will help us {reason you’re blogging}.Before you come, check out the spreadsheet attached to this invite. The URLs at the top of the list are our best-performing blog posts—the kind of ideas our audience seems to love and ones we should try to replicate. The URLs at the bottom of the list are stinkers, so we should try to avoid ideas like those.The meeting will consist of 20 minutes of individual brainstorming and 40 minutes of grading to narrow our ideas to the absolute best ones.This is gonna be fun!Come to your touch point prepared with three things to kickstart your team’s creativity:From there, give them 20 minutes to brainstorm on their own, typing out every idea in an Evernote note, Google Doc, Microsoft Word—whatever. This is especially helpful for remote teams because this exercise doesn’t require you to be in the same room.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This is the fun part. ;)Ask everyone on your team to send you their ideas, then create a master list only you can see.Prep your team to help you sift through the ideas to find the best ones for your audience:From there, read each idea aloud off your master list and have the team instant message you their numbers. The lowest score is the final grade for the idea—and that’s because at least one person on your team doubts that the idea will be as successful as your top-performing content.In this way, you:You’ll get all of these benefits without the groupthink or the one loud team member dominating your meeting. And, you don’t get the siloed ideas that only you could think of but aren’t necessarily the best ideas.It’s a process we use at CoSchedule, and one we plan to continue doing to help us flesh out innovative ideas.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You just found some amazing topics your audience will love. Now it’s time to plan how you’ll help them find your evergreen content exactly when they want it—and long after you publish it. Remember, evergreen means that your content won’t grow stale and could hold a ranking for a long time, so this is an awesome way to keep that traffic rolling in.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?And chances are pretty high they’ll use a search engine like Google to do just that.The good news is that when you research and choose your keywords, it also gives you the opportunity to understand which content you’ll compete with, which you’ll learn about in a little bit.Anyway, this process can be as simple or complex as you’d like it to be. I’d suggest starting simple:Use a keyword research tool to help you understand the volume of searches for your topic. A great tool to start with is Google’s keyword planner. Simply type in the main topic of your idea, then navigate to the Keyword ideas tab.Start your research with Google keyword planner, then navigate to the Keyword ideas tab.The planner will show you the number of times people search for that term in an average month, which is great.But the real value here is seeing the other ideas for terms you might not have originally thought about. Do any of those ideas get more volume that might actually work better for your evergreen content?Google’s keyword planner is really great for finding synonyms for what you originally thought would be a good keyword.From here, use Moz’s keyword difficulty tool to understand your potential ability to rank for those keywords.It’s not really worth targeting a keyword you don’t have a chance to rank for, so this is a crucial step to help you make the time you invest into creating awesome evergreen content totally worth your while.Use Moz to understand your keyword difficulty. Choose a keyword with low difficulty and a high search volume.Shoot for a keyword difficulty percentage in the 40s (or lower) to start with.It’s a newer idea that you should now target multiple related keywords in your blog posts. From here, think about using those related terms—to get techy, this is latent semantic indexing or LSI keywords—as sections in your blog outline.I’ll let Rand from Moz explain:It seems like a lot of “marketing experts” suggest that creating better content than anyone else is the best way to grow your blog and business. That’s good advice. And they leave it at that… just… advice.Enter your keyword into Google and read the posts from your competition to plan how to create better content than anyone else.So here’s how to actually publish the best content on the Internet: Use the keywords you just chose for your blog posts, type them into Google, and read every single one of the top 20 search results. Review them for:From here, dedicate 20 minutes to nothing but brainstorming and ideation. Put yourself in your readers’ shoes: What would they absolutely love to know about this topic?This is where the terms from your keyword research and the notes from your competition research come together to outline a comprehensive blog post on your topic.That word comprehensive is super important for your success. It means you’ll publish a complete, blog post covering the topic in its entirety—the only one your audience would ever need to read to learn everything they need to know to become rock stars. Word count doesn’t matter.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Want To Draft Your Outline? Here’s How:Honestly, the process up to this point will ensure that you create better content than anyone else on the Internet. It will help your evergreen content get noticed and continue to flourish well into the future.Flesh out your outline with in-depth, actionable advice and step-by-step how-to information.The process you’re about to learn about is something we call historical blog post optimization at CoSchedule. We could have just as easily called it the update-content-and-get-lots-more-traffic-from-it-with-less-effort method.You see, this is what a historically optimized evergreen blog post looks like after you repost it like a brand new blog post:When you republish your evergreen content, you’ll see a spike in traffic, then more daily traffic than before you republished.Even when you publish evergreen content, search engines still seem to reward the marketers who update that information periodically. So not only do search engines like older content, they like freshness, too.Republishing blog posts is an awesome way to help you make the most of the work you put into that content originally to get more traffic and more email subscribers. So this is a win-win-win.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You just learned how to find awesome keywords for your evergreen content—and that you can and should target multiple related keywords per post.Those older posts may only target one keyword, so historical optimization gives you the opportunity to understand what your older posts are missing so you can include new sections targeting those relevant keywords.Follow the advice from step #2 to research your keyword and competition to understand what your existing content is missing. Then create a new outline of your blog post to add those new sections into your existing content.As you do more competitive research, you’ll probably find a few ideas you didn’t think of when you wrote the post originally. And with a little more experience since you published your post, you could probably also flesh out your original ideas with a lot more actionable advice, tips, and guidance.Look at your revised outline and make notes where you could flesh out your ideas further with even better information, modern data, and relevant stats.Another way to look at this is by including more visual content in your blog posts. Pages with images get 94% more traffic than those without, and video is growing rapidly. Plus, both of those visuals will help you optimize your social shares to get even more traffic.The simplest approach is often the best place to start. So when you’re ready, here’s the easiest way to republish a blog post in WordPress:This is an example of how to republish a blog post with WordPress.Pretty cool, right?The term repurposing content applies very nicely to evergreen content: Reuse it in different ways to make the time you invest into creating it and keeping it fresh totally worth it.Here are a few ways to get even bigger results from your content:Content upgrades are related content you give away from your evergreen content in exchange for your blog readers’ email addresses. Common content upgrades include templates, worksheets, infographics, and bundles of all of these.This process is one of the tactics you can use to grow your email list by 552% in one year.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This is the same process content marketing all-stars like Neil Patel use to turn traffic to blog posts into email subscribers to keep their readers coming back.Neil Patel uses LeadBoxes from LeadPages to gather subscribes from inline downloads.Do you have a couple older evergreen posts that are pretty similar?Chances are, you could combine those posts together to create one comprehensive post. Then all that’s left is to redirect your old URLs to your new post, and you’re set!Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This is a practice we’ve started implementing at CoSchedule to help us reuse our older posts that haven’t been quite as successful:For example, Devin recently wrote a post about writer’s block. She knew people were searching for information on it because they were likely experiencing it.So she found a couple older posts—one on overcoming writer’s block that wasn’t ranking well or bringing in traffic to the blog—and combined that with a lot of new information on the topic of getting rid of writer’s block.So far, the results have been fantastic. The process helped us recycle older content that wasn’t performing by turning it into a traffic-generating machine.You create lots of awesome evergreen content that would complement itself nicely when packaged together in a different way—especially in longer formats like e-books and courses.The first step is to define your story flow:For example, we recently wanted to create something that would really help our audience keep their editorial schedule on track. We had a lot of evergreen content we compiled in order according to a story flow, then turned all of that into four lessons we included in a comprehensive course.That course—made from strategically repurposing our best content in a logical order to solve a very specific problem—got more than 2,000 subscribers in less than two weeks. And it continues to bring in new subscribers every day, which is a pretty cool success story for repurposing content.Click To Tweet

							Content marketing enthusiast, brand advocate, and blogger. I love new ideas, strategy, and continually learning how to work more efficiently.If you want to build and execute a data-driven, agile content strategy to get massive results from your content marketing, this post is for you.Need help creating more effective content, more easily? Download these 21+ marketing templates, each designed to help you do your best work now.Hey there! Great post, and lots of useful content here. I am totally amazed but a little confused about adding -2 in WordPress permalinks. Can you clarify something? Using your screenshot above as an example here: Let’s say you leave that second post as a draft with the Feb. 17 publish date. Would the new, updated content be published at the -2 permalink, or would it populate into the original URL (without the -2)? If it creates a new post with a different URL, is it an automatic redirect? Any implications for SEO? Sorry for so many questions — would love more info and I can’t find anything elsewhere online.Hey @kristin_doherty:disqus, that is a great question!I actually found out this hack by mistake once, so this is what I know:You already have an old post with an existing slug. Let’s say it’s coolblog.com/awesome-sauce. You can write a brand new post, and make the URL coolblog.com/awesome-sauce and hit save. WordPress will change it to coolblog.com/awesome-sauce-2 automatically because it knows your new post will overwrite the old one.Change the date and time of the new post to when you want it to overwrite the old one. You can leave it in draft mode, and when that date and time roll around, the post will show the new content from your draft, but on the old URL of coolblog.com/awesome-sauce and without the -2 at the end.There is no redirect, so I don’t believe there are any SEO implications.If you test it out, let me know how it goes! That example was real on the CoSchedule blog—so it definitely has worked for us in the past.I’m confused on this, too.  I actually have posts with numbers appended at the end like that and, to the best of my knowledge, they’ve not overridden each other.  That’s a GOOD thing, because otherwise it would be entirely too easy to overwrite an old post of the same name by accident!This post inspired me to start a Google doc of the steps I need to take to create this evergreen content machine at my company. So helpful. Thank you!That’s awesome! I think you’d love the Evergreen Content Kit, too! Its filled with great resources to help :)I love you guys, and there’s a lot of good information in this post, but those are terrible examples of time-limited content, for two reasons.1) Although it’s focused toward New Year’s, it isn’t really New Year’s-specific.  I wouldn’t NOT read that because it’s now May.2) Calling seasonal content non-evergreen is shortsighted — especially for those in niches that perform well on Pinterest.  A seasonal post may be more relevant at a certain TIME of year, but it may still be relevant year after year after year.  In other words, evergreen.  The “catch” is that you have to be willing to wait a bit to see the results of an accumulation of posts.  (Which does mean you don’t want that to be ALL you post!)  Some of my top-performing posts are holiday-related or seasonal.A non-evergreen post would be posts about the Presidential election or Taylor Swift’s new album — things that will be irrelevant in a year, or six months, or maybe even next week.Hey @rachelramey:disqus, good points here!I can definitely see what you’re saying about seasonal content performing well on Pinterest, too. Really makes sense for that audience, and especially since Pinners often share more content every day than any other social network.Maybe I should have made the point this way: If you have limited resources and want long-term results, evergreen content is a great place to start.Thanks for reading, Rachel!Just informative & valuable post. Great effort! Following for next post. ThanksThanks @thewoodcutter:disqus! I promise, we’ll do our absolute best with all the other content you see from us, too!I love how thorough you are in this – excellent post. I’ve certainly noticed an uptick in my blog post views now that I’m actually posting answers to questions my target audience has!Hey @angelaford:disqus, super nice to chat with you again! Yeah, Q&A is definitely something we’ve seen work for our content, too. I hope you continue to get that traffic!© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,9

											There’s a new feature in CoSchedule that helps you batch create social messages in a matter of seconds that we’ve called social templates.The concept is simple: Set up a posting schedule for a blog post, then save that schedule as a template you can use later for other content.I could write about it, or you could make it easy on me and just watch this video:
In this post you’ll learn the traffic-driving formula that’ll work amazingly well every time you use it with your social templates in CoSchedule. Rest assured though, you can rock the information from this post however you schedule your social media—whether it’s in CoSchedule or not.Just download your social media posting schedule kit to get started.Here we go.Anxious to see social templates in action? Watch the demo webinar now!Your social media messages are invitations to attend the party happening on your blog. No one wants to hit up a lame party, just like no one wants to click through on an unappealing social message.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Think of each message as a call to action:You’ll learn how to write social messages that’ll have the potential to draw 31.8% more clickthroughs than typical messages. That’s just from the message itself!Here’s exactly how you’re going to capture that traffic in your social media posting schedule:This is a practice Upworthy is especially well-known for using with every blog post they publish. They’ve found the more headlines they write, the later ones get better and better than their first.Where Upworthy stops at 25 headlines, there’s a reason to write 30 blog titles as a content marketer: How to, question, and list posts tend to get the most social shares. And hey, more social shares means more clickthroughs when you optimize those headlines.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?So write 10 headlines for each of the most-shared headline styles, then choose the top one from each category to use in A/B/C tests with your social messages.Sound hard to get started? I wouldn’t give you advice without helping you put it into practice.Here are 10 templates of each headline type to get you started with your next blog post right now (just copy, paste, and tweak):How ToQuestionListFrom here, you can run your headlines through the headline analyzer to choose the best ones for your social media posting schedule.Here’s a social media hack you can use from this process to increase your clickthroughs:You’ll learn how to schedule your A/B test here in a couple steps. For now, let’s continue learning how to write compelling social messages that get clickthroughs.There’s a lot of hoopla that asking open-ended questions helps continue a conversation. While that’s definitely true, those questions actually hurt your clickthrough rate when you use them in your social media posting schedule.Let me explain.I analyzed a bunch of social messages that looked like this (open-ended questions):Then I compared the amount of clickthroughs of those social messages to ones like this (close-ended questions):The result? Close-ended questions get more clickthroughs than open-ended questions.In fact, on average, close-ended questions get 255% more clickthroughs than open-ended questions. Craziness.You may ask the open-ended question, “Why would close-ended questions get more clickthroughs?” (See what I did there?)The answer involves a very simple psychological idea: People fear missing out on something.Linda Sapadin, Ph.D takes to the World of Psychology blog to explain:Missing out? But on what? On what other people are doing. They’re having exciting experiences that you’re not.Close-ended questions suggest that if you say “Yes” or “No” in your head, improvement is just a click away to experience the better results others are already rocking.Want to be a marketing pro?

There’s nothing noteworthy about it, just black and white in a field.Now, imagine you see a purple cow. That’s pretty remarkable and could cause you to stop to take a look at this super interesting animal that stands out from the crowd.You’ve probably heard that idea before from Seth Godin in a TED Talk like this:The thing is, sharing remarkable social media messages in a sea of me-too shares will make your content stand out like a purple cow in a herd of black and white.And, according to our research on social media posting schedules, it’s the social messages that stand out—that are different than the rest—that get the most clickthroughs.Here are a few different types of social messages you could write to take your audience off guard:It’s tough to hear that something you thought you knew was wrong.And, it turns out, turning the tables on something that is generally accepted as true can increase the amount of clickthroughs you receive from your social messages.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?So what can you do to write messages that appeal to that feeling? It’s called controversy, and you can write these types of social messages based on anecdotal information in your blog posts.Well, that might sound kinda scary, but it’s not. Let me explain:1. Controversial content doesn’t necessarily offend people. And in fact, if you want to get clickthroughs from your social messages, being offensive isn’t what you’re shooting for.You’re looking to connect to the three Bs, as Gregory Ciotti explains: Behavior, belonging, and beliefs.So, if you create division within someone’s behavior, beliefs, or feeling of belonging, they will seek to either confirm your stance or disprove your stance, but either one is good for you because it creates buzz.Confirming or disproving? That needs a clickthrough to learn more.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?2. Anecdotal information is the stuff that’s based a lot on personal experience that’s not necessarily true. You can find anecdotal inspiration in your own blog posts to write better social messages:For example, Sujan Deswal wrote a blog post that mentioned it’s OK to build upon the great ideas others have already come up with. So he built upon Austin Kleon’s idea that nothing is original, which definitely ties into beliefs that people would like to either confirm or disprove.Sharing that anecdote in social messages influenced tons of social shares and clickthroughs.Nothing is original. Now it's time to publish better #content than anyone else. http://t.co/bwWk7ESvSi pic.twitter.com/nMJTuDoZ8l— CoSchedule (@CoSchedule) October 3, 2015According to research from the New York Times‘ Customer Insight Group, 49% of people share content when it’s entertaining. Indeed, our own tests have verified that humor increases social shares and clickthroughs.So, how can you include humor in your social messages? Julie has some advice:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?For example, if I wanted to complement this post with a GIF in a social message, I would use a GIF website like Giphy or Popkey to find something silly that relates to the actual message I’d like to share.Maybe like this:And then I’d complement it with a social message like this:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You get the idea.Ah, the classic question your readers ask themselves to justify how worthy your content is of their time.Show the benefits your social followers will experience if they simply click through to read your content. These are some of the oldie-but-goodie types of messages:Chances are, you did a lot of research before you started writing your blog post that you’re promoting with your social media posting schedule.So pull a quote from an influencer you referenced, and use it as inspiration for a social media message.Complement the quote with the reason why your followers should click through to read your content. I guess that’s also known as a call to action.Peter Drucker said, 'What gets measured gets managed.' Here's how to do it. #marketing https://t.co/W7nCv9t7jh pic.twitter.com/cgur2tjNVB— CoSchedule (@CoSchedule) November 5, 2015It’s easy: Copy the quote from your article and include who gave the quote (@ing them on the social networks works well for this). Then write something like, “Learn how to do it yourself now!” and link back to your blog post.Think about the unique value proposition behind your post—the problem you’re solving for your readers through the gift of your content.Remember, your social media followers are selfish (not in a bad way). They just care about themselves a lot more than anyone else, and they click through to read content because of an emotional need to improve themselves.That process will help you write social messages that will connect with your audience’s emotional reasoning to click through to read your content.If you look at that example, you gals and guys don’t care as much about perfecting your social media posting schedule—you actually care about the outcome behind getting that process in order: More traffic, time savings, and getting organized would all make for perfect social messages that would complement this post.This one’s pretty simple: Grab a cool sentence from your post and share it as a social message.Good #writers have to be able to analyze their own ideas and the ideas of others. https://t.co/RofqZewSFw pic.twitter.com/3tmfraqH61— CoSchedule (@CoSchedule) January 12, 2016If you use the Click To Tweet plugin, you’re already used to looking for shareable soundbites from your blog posts to embed as visuals right inline in the context of your content:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Use those as inspiration for your own social media posting schedule, too.Oh, and if you aren’t using the Click To Tweet plugin, it’s free. It helps you get more social shares for your hard work. And you should use it. Get it for your WordPress blog right now.This is probably one of the coolest social media features you’ve seen in a long time, so hear me out.You just learned that these types of social messages get the most traffic back to your content:Let’s say you want to share these seven types of messages in your social media posting schedule for every blog post you publish. Because, ya know, these are proven to drive traffic back to your blog.You can now write your messages with social helpers in CoSchedule to easily reuse your messages multiple times:Let me reiterate: Now you can write a batch of social messages once. Then you can reuse those messages multiple times throughout a social media posting schedule of days, weeks, or even months after publishing your blog posts.And all of that without copying and pasting, without logging in and out of multiple networks, and without being available to schedule to your networks at all hours of the day.Pretty cool, right?So this is your next question: How should I add these super awesome messages into my posting schedule? Here ya go:A majority of you—67% to be exact—spend at least 2–4 hours writing a blog post. Then you spend 30 minutes crafting your social messages.And after all that hard work, 77% of you only share your blog posts 1–3 times on social media.What’s going on there? Why all the effort and barely any promotion?The good news is that by this point, you’ve written at least nine distinctively valuable social messages you can use to share your blog post more than one to three times without annoying your social media followers.Here’s how to add those messages into your posting schedule:It just makes sense to schedule your social messages at the times when you typically get the most traffic from social media.So as you start developing your posting schedule template, use this Google Analytics custom report to find when your own audience is most active on your social networks.When you first use the report, you’ll see a landing page with a list of your networks. These are sorted according to your highest-trafficked social networks according to page views.Judging from this data, Facebook is the highest-trafficked social network.Click through to any of your social networks in that list to find the specific time when you get that traffic. This data shows in military time with 0 being midnight and 23 as 11 p.m.This data shows that sharing to Facebook at 10 a.m. would be a smart thing to do in your social media posting schedule.You can use this information to plan a data-driven posting schedule using the template in this post:By this point, you know you’ll write at least nine different types of social messages for every blog post you publish. And you know the best times to post those messages to get more traffic.Now it’s time to set up your posting schedule to promote your content for an entire month after it publishes. Use your own data to plan a posting schedule that looks something like this:There are a couple things to keep in mind when you get started:So now that you’ve set up a social media posting schedule for your brand new blog posts, it’s time to explore peak social sharing frequency to help you add in more social messages for your older evergreen content.This will help you share your content more often to get more traffic, but all within the generally acceptable standards for each network.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This is actually one of the most popular CoSchedule user questions we hear: How often to post on social media per day for each social account?As with a lot of topics surrounding your social media posting schedule, there is a bunch of data to sift through to truly find the perfect amount:Buffer came up with a fantastic set of guidelines, based on research and collecting data from others, on how often to post to specific social accounts.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Email newsletter provider Constant Contact also did some research and came up with their own recipe for daily social sharing. It’s not identical to Buffer’s approach, but you may spot some similarities. This recipe is calculated on a weekly basis instead of daily.These recipes may or may not be to your liking based on how well your followers engage with it combined with how well you can keep up these frequencies and still create great social posts. There is no gold standard.To top it off, Hubspot did some interesting research looking at social posts based on industry, and found out that not every industry (i.e. type of audience) was looking for the same thing.Some industries required fairly high posting frequencies (e.g. marketing) while others were less so (e.g. business and financial services).We took a look at tons of different research from lots of different sources on how often to post on social media, and guess what? Their advice varied, and sometimes very significantly:But. We punched the numbers on all of their suggestions—minimum and maximum social media posting frequencies—to come up with solid numbers you can start with, then test your own results to adapt for your audience.This formula is based purely on data from experts and may serve well as a starting point for building your audience on the specific networks:Twitter: 15 tweets per dayFacebook: 1 post per day, 2 posts per day if your audience is more than 10,000 friendsLinkedIn: 4 posts a week, nearly 1 every weekdayGoogle+: 2 posts every weekdayPinterest: 9 Pins every dayNow, you’ve learned a lot. The big takeaway is this: You can fill up your posting schedule—and share the optimal amount of messages every day—by sharing your older content.You can get more traffic from your posting schedule by sharing a few more messages every day.Even though you’ve added lots of variety to the messages you write, it’s also helpful to share a wide range of content that will make your networks’ news feeds look diverse, too.Social shares are like upvotes for your content—they help you understand which blog posts your audience finds so helpful, entertaining, or interesting that they want to share them with their own followers. You can use that information to help you decide which blog posts to continue sharing after your initial posting schedule for new content runs out of messages.Here’s a simple data-driven process to help you know which blog posts to share again:Look at your last two month’s worth of blog posts. Collect the shares information either from your CoSchedule social media editorial calendar or from the social shares plugin you likely already have installed on your blog.Find your social media shares in your CoSchedule social media calendar or use your post-share counter.From there, find the average shares a typical post gets by using this simple formula: sum of all blog post shares ÷ number of blog posts in your sample = average number of shares per blog post.Now, when a blog post runs through its original social media posting schedule, simply look at the number of shares it received. If it got more than your average blog post, schedule more social shares for that blog post.For example, if I used the formula and found that an average post gets 250 social shares, then I’d reshare content that got more than the average of 250 shares.This is an example of a good posting schedule you could follow with your own older content:This is the same process Devin, our social media marketer, uses at CoSchedule to strategically choose which content our audience (that would be you) likes the most so we continue to share only the best stuff that you find extremely valuable.You can do it, too, and you’ll see growth in followers and more traffic to your blog content.Still, you might have other evergreen blog posts that just keep bringing in the traffic when you share them. Share those again to fill up your daily maximum social sharing frequency.Here’s how to find the content your followers would love to see again:Look at your most-shared blog posts using the top posts feature in CoSchedule. From there, you can easily see which content of yours is most popular and quickly schedule a new posting schedule for these blog posts.Use the top posts feature in CoSchedule to find your most-shared content.You can also look at your Google Analytics to see which posts are getting the most page views and sessions. From there, you know which blog posts are naturally bringing in traffic back to your blog, so it just makes sense to share those posts again with a new posting schedule.Use Google Analytics to find your top-performing content to share these posts again on social media.To make this process really efficient, block off time on your to-do list to find multiple old blog posts to schedule your shares at once.That doesn’t mean you’ll share all of the messages right now or at the exact same time. Rather, it means that you’ll dedicate time once to schedule several days worth of social shares so you can set it and forget it.To do that, you might want a few posting schedules to help you share your older blog posts so the shares stagger well:The good news is that you can set up as many social templates in CoSchedule as you need to follow all of this advice:You can get started now with your 14-day free trial of CoSchedule to schedule better social messages than ever.Let’s review what you just learned to help you share to social media better than ever:You’ve got this! When you’re ready to push the easy button, try out the new social templates feature in CoSchedule to put all of your work to great use super easily.Click To Tweet

							Content marketing enthusiast, brand advocate, and blogger. I love new ideas, strategy, and continually learning how to work more efficiently.Everyone knows what hashtags are. However, not everyone knows how to use hashtags well. Be a hashtag expert and increase your social media reach here.Do you know all the best times to post on social media? In this post, we've crunched the data from 16 studies to find the best times for each network.I have always wanted to try setting up a schedule like this…but I can never find the time to write out that many social posts!Hey @eastlackmedia:disqus, it’s a lot easier now that you know which types of messages to write and you don’t have to schedule them all individually. The social template we use helps me write 12 or so messages in about 15 minutes and spans out over the course of a month. 15 minutes = well worth it for a lot of variety and ROI.Excellent post and so comprehensive! Thank you.Hey @robertdwatkinsbob:disqus, I’m really glad you liked the post! I hope you have a ton of success with your social media posting schedule.Awesome information in this post. I learned a lot, took notes, and pinned!Hey @disqus_E2F1jVgSpQ:disqus, that is excellent! Thanks for reading and sharing!Very comprehensive post thanks. I love coschedule so much. Haven’t tried using scheduling templates yet, but will give it a try with my next post. Thanks.Hey @lifestylemavens:disqus, that sounds awesome! Feel free to follow the formula in this post as you build your social template in CoSchedule. Thanks for reading!Yet another epic post!Hey @halona_black:disqus, thanks so much for reading and commenting! Good luck out there!O.M.G. This post was PHEnomenal and action-packed. I love posts with clear implementation plans. I have all this piecemeal information about how to structure the content, what works, when to schedule blah blah blah but you put it ALL in one post AND offered a tool to help facilitate the suggestions. LOVE. And I’m sold! I will no longer be looking at CoSchedule on the sidelines. You deserve a little raise because you’ve convinced me to finally sign up.Hahaha, so glad to hear that, Tawanna! Enjoy the new feature!Wow @tawannasmithmpp:disqus, thank you so much for the kind words! Glad to hear this post was exactly what you needed—all in one and full of actionable advice. Good luck!So…let me come in here and give you all of my side eyes. How. Long. Have. I. Been. Telling. You. About. Coschedule.?!? THIS IS WHY WE CAN’T HAVE NICE THINGS, TAWANNA! So glad you finally got on board. I’m still mad at you though.I loved this post, but the download doesn’t work. :(Hey Lynn, thanks so much for reading! Which browser are you using?

2016-05-05,http://coschedule.com/blog/stay-focused-on-what-matters/,5 Simple Questions To Stay Focused On What Matters,"The free blog post headline analyzer will score your overall headline quality and rate its ability to result in social shares, increased traffic, and SEO value.If you asked me what the most important core principal at CoSchedule was, I would probably tell you that it’s our ability to stay focused.This means staying 100% focused on what matters most to our company, customers, and product—no matter what.Of course, this is a learned skill and definitely, easier said than done. When you work in a company with a lot of creative people, there are always a ton of ideas popping up. There is also the temptation to continually chase down those new ideas and make them a reality. After all, we’re a startup, right?But, chasing down our whims would take us out of focus, and that would be a bad thing for everyone.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Around our office, you’ll hear the phrase “that’s a thing we could do” at least several times per day. It indicates when we’ve come across an idea that we could work on, but instinctively know we shouldn’t because it would be out of focus.As a company, we have a roadmap for our product and distinct metrics that we’re working to improve. If we chased down every idea, there’s a chance we could lose our focus and miss our clearly outlined goals.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?But, this isn’t the only thing we do to stay focused. As a leader, I have worked to instill our team with the necessary tools for battling “scope creep” and staying focused.Author John Maxwell says that good leaders ask great questions, and that advice has become very powerful for me. I’ve come to adopt a few key questions that cut through the crud and help our team stay focused like a laser beam.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Here are my top five questions for keeping our team (and myself) focused 100% of the time:This is the essential question that frames everything we do at CoSchedule. With every blog post, new feature, or web page, we continually ask ourselves what’s in it for the reader, visitor, or customer.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?We’re kind of obsessed with it.The beauty of this simple question is that it constantly drives us toward focusing on providing more value. It’s simple—the more value you provide your readers or customers with, the more likely they will be to reward you with their attention and business.I would say that it’s the single most important question for our modern economy. If you aren’t focused on providing value, you aren’t focused on anything at all.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Learn to ask this question at the beginning of any new project to keep your work focused and on point. You might be surprised at how much clarity it brings.Does everything you ship meet your team’s one true standard of performance? This question allows your team to constantly review their own work and evaluate how it compares to the quality level your entire team has committed to.Even as a tiny startup, our goal has been to provide a best-in-class experience for everyone that comes in contact with our team. We expect ourselves to perform as well, or better, than the top five companies in our class. No matter how limited our resources are.For our content marketing team, this means that they literally focus on writing the absolute best blog post on a given topic every time. This doesn’t mean the best blog post they are capable of; it means the best blog post on the entire internet. It means that they have to push themselves further every time.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?They do a ton of research, they read “competing” posts, and then assemble a post that goes at least one step further than others on the web. They even go back and rework posts that are later determined to have fallen short.This is, of course, only possible because the team has clearly defined their standard of performance. To use this question effectively, this is also something that you will need to do. Keep things simple, and ask the question often and you should be fine.As a team, you should define a clear “standard of performance” and constantly ask yourself if you’re meeting it.While it may feel a bit contradictory to my recent statements about quality, we also frequently ask ourselves how we can get things out the door faster and sooner. This question is related to the concept of the minimum viable product made popular in the book Lean Startup by Eric Ries.Many people associate this concept with sloppy or unfinished work, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Rather, our team uses it as a way of splitting large projects into smaller and more manageable chunks.It’s all about shaping a project to ensure that we approach it with clear goals in mind.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?An example of this comes in a recent redesign we started for this very blog. Rather than building it all at once, we opted to make some of the backend and functional changes first using our current design. That gave us an opportunity to test them out and work through the kinks before the big launch.This prevented us from taking on more than we could handle and allowed us to focus on creating something that we could ship in a week—thus taking advantage of some of those changes right away, rather than waiting until we completed an entire redesign.Oftentimes, this question is also phrased in terms of “what can we ship this week,” meaning what small part of the project can be accomplished without waiting on everything else to be done? This attitude allows us to continually focus on moving things forward, rather than getting ourselves bogged down in ultra-huge projects.The idea here is focusing on small frequent wins, rather than the more traditional pattern of infrequent but huge wins. Large projects frequently bog us down, and usually lead to low satisfaction among team members.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?By asking yourself “What can I ship right now?” you will keep yourself laser-focused on continuous improvements that constantly add up over time. This means that everything you do is constantly improving, and that is a very good thing.Some of my favorite startup advice comes from PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel. He simplifies it all by instructing startups to “always seek to build a monopoly.”In a monopoly, the business owns its market. It can set its own prices, avoid the struggle of competition, and maximize its place in the industry.What Peter is talking about here is building something that is unique enough to avoid competition, or has grown so aggressively that it simply leapfrogs the competition entirely.One way that we apply this idea at CoSchedule is to constantly evaluate the impact of the projects we take on. We look at it as 10% versus 10x improvement.It’s a lot like asking if the things you’re doing right now will actually pay off enough to make them worth it. If you consider every hour of your day an opportunity, what is the opportunity cost of working on the 10% when you could be doing the 10x instead?It’s a really great question for staying focused.Rather than focusing on small goals and ideas at CoSchedule, we constantly shuffle our priority list by its potential impact on our company, and our ability to ultimately create a monopoly in our market.You can’t build a monopoly by grinding out 10% improvements all day. You need to stay focused on the 10x growth opportunities, and constantly ask yourself if what you’re doing right now has the potential to result in 10x growth. If it doesn’t, it’s time to find something else to work on.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?As a leader, it’s my job to make sure that everyone who works at CoSchedule has everything they need to be successful. This may sound simplistic, but it’s actually very powerful.One of the things that drive me crazy is to see team members who have not been empowered to do their job. This is not their fault; it’s mine!It may be due to a lack of time or clarity but can often arise from a lack of permission to act as well. Either way, it’s an inefficiency that needs to be dealt with.The problem with someone not having what they need is that they can never achieve clear focus without it.If there are too many things on their plate, how will they ever do anything well?Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?If they don’t have the knowledge required to complete a task, how will it ever get done?Sometimes, this can also be about “permission.” If someone doesn’t have the freedom or permission to do what they need to do, how will they ever be able to focus on it correctly?My job as a leader is to eliminate roadblocks, and this question helps me find out if there are any. It also helps my team reflect on their own needs and expectations.Another way we do this is to simply ask three distinct questions:If you want to stay focused, constantly ask yourself these questions to re-evaluate your own needs or the needs of those around you. If you know where you stand, you will always be focused.These are the five questions I ask our team the most often, but it is far from a complete list. Questions are powerful tools for self-reflection and leadershipWhat questions are you asking of your team to bring laser beam-like focus? Share them in the comments or via social media. We’d love to hear!P.S. This post is part of a new series about CoSchedule’s workplace, culture, and productivity. Join our official email list and never miss a post!Click To Tweet

							CoSchedule Co-Founder, blogger, designer, content hacker and serial starter. Also, a firm believer in the do what you love, love what you do philosophy.What if you could schedule more social media messages in way less time? Social templates make it happen.Wouldn't life be a whole lot easier if you could just manage multiple social media accounts in one place? You can with CoSchedule. Read to learn how.How long will I continue this tactic or strategy before I kill it? In other words I don’t want to keep doing things that don’t work so what does a positive result look like and how long am I prepared to give it to show up before I drop it?Good article thanks for writing Garrett.Garrett- great points and strategies to stay on track with creating a higher level performance.  I like the questions – very specific and targeted.I have hit and ran into many road blocks by not knowing what questions to ask! I learned the hard way. One of my famous ones is a painting job I was doing in Palm Springs. I bid a job and thought it would be more of a day off type of job. That is I could do this after hours when the resort was closed off season. That was not the case, I had a week. I did not budet in labor, however I did complete it on time and did not go broke doing it..
Now on my cheat sheet of questions to ask is: ” When is the project due or need to be completed by?”
Dave
KessAudio.Brilliant post Garret! Gold nuggets here for questions to ask ourselves over and over to keep mining gold and get back to what matters. I particularly liked the last three questions, What’s going well…the best place to start in my opinion, and my approach with my customers; What’s not going well, so tweaking and new approaches can be imagined and then made, What is required for a happy future? Because sometimes stuck in the details or the huge project, that question helps remind us…what’s it all about? My question…”If you could wave a magic wand and have what you want changed, magically changed…what would that look like?”Excellent post! I’m going to share a link to this on my blog and newsletter.

2016-04-21,http://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-manage-multiple-social-media-accounts/,How To Manage Multiple Social Media Accounts In One Tool,"The free blog post headline analyzer will score your overall headline quality and rate its ability to result in social shares, increased traffic, and SEO value.Wouldn’t life be a whole lot easier if you could just manage multiple social media accounts in one place?Imagine removing the hassle of logging in and out of every social network and profile, remembering how often to post to each network and when (and if you did or didn’t), and setting reminders to write, approve, and post social messages without a defined process.Your imagination is probably filling up with rides on unicorns over rainbow bridges at the sheer thought that managing multiple social media accounts doesn’t have to be an organizational nightmare.But it’s true—your dream of getting organized can become a reality. And you don’t need a unicorn (as cool as that would be). So today, let’s take a look at how to manage all of your social media in one place.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Consider this a step-by-step guide toLet’s do this.Chances are, you have a handful of profiles on a bunch of different social networks. And to boot, some of these social media accounts are your company’s profiles, while others are your personal professional profiles.The first step to manage all of your accounts easily is to create a master social media accounts list that you can later enter into the tool where you’ll manage all of your social media in one place.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?At this point, you’re not looking for anything fancy—use a napkin, spreadsheet, or Google Doc to simply list out every one of your business’ social profiles. Make a list of your company’s:Next, create a social media accounts list for your personal profiles where you’ll share your company’s information.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Personal professional profiles are often on LinkedIn and Twitter where you’ve built relationships with your followers to share your company’s content—along with industry niche content.Again, make a list of your personal accounts across your networks:Easy, right!? Your next step is to find the app that supports your social media accounts to help you manage all of them in one place.At this point, you’re pulling together a checklist of requirements to help you choose the tool that will work best for your unique needs.Here are a few requirements to kick off your checklist as you search for your app:Use the list of social media accounts you just created to help you find a tool that supports those networks. The goal here is to find a tool that’ll eliminate the hassle of logging in and out of social networks and profiles.For example, if you use Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest to reach your audience, find a tool that will help you post to those social networks.It makes sense to share access to your business’ social media accounts with the rest of your team. But you probably want to keep your personal profiles private while still getting the benefits of bonus traffic from those accounts.Find a tool that helps you keep your privacy—so only you can post to your personal profiles—while giving the right team members access to your company’s accounts.That will help you stay organized by managing all of your social media accounts in one tool while avoiding any *surprises* on your personal profiles.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Know exactly who posted what, when they posted it, and which accounts they posted to.A historical log to help you see changes, edits, and what was eventually posted will help you keep the team accountable for reaching deadlines while keeping you organized.Chance are, your campaigns run on multiple social media accounts. Find a system that helps you define a workflow to make your content creation and approval process painless while also helping you and your team stay organized.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This way, you can manage everything in one app rather than maintaining a separate project management tool.If you’re creating a social media campaign, you’ll need some help from your team to write social messages, design awesome social media images, schedule your messages, and approve your campaign. A workflow built into your tool—right where you create your social media content—will help you stay super organized with the entire process.Sometimes, it’s nice to help certain people in your company see social messages but not let them edit your hard work.Have a plan to keep those nit-pickers out of your social media messages by letting them just see what’s going on without letting them change your projects.Features like this help with approval processes for those folks in your company who “just want to see everything going out.”Recommended Reading: A great tool will help you plan the messages you’ll share to each social media account before your content publishes.Imagine creating an entire social media posting schedule for a blog post or landing page a week before your content is set to launch. You’d avoid the last-minute promotion frenzy, strategically plan your social messages, and get super organized.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Find a tool where you can see all of your messages for your own content—and curated content—on one social dashboard.For example, social media editorial calendars serve as a perfect way to see every message you’re planning for every single account—including messages that are already published and those that you will share in the future.This type of social dashboard is handy because you can visually see the times, days, networks, and specific accounts in an at-a-glance view.Since you’re looking for a solution to manage multiple social media accounts in one place, I’ll fill you in on a little secret: CoSchedule can help you do just that.CoSchedule is a content and social media editorial calendar that combines blogging, content marketing, social media, and project management all into a single tool. It’s perfect for managing all of your social media in one place—and will help you get super organized.Let’s explore how to use CoSchedule to remove the time-sucking hassle of managing multiple social media accounts:Integrate the accounts on your list into CoSchedule. Simply log in to your social networks, then connect each of your accounts with a couple simple clicks:From here, you’ll have a complete list of your social media accounts all in one place. Now all you need to do is check which accounts you’d like to remain private so only you have access to share content to those accounts:So now you have one list of social media accounts you manage, yet they are separated into public and personal profiles:What’s cool is that the rest of your team can also have personal profiles that only they see, too. That means all of you get the benefits of privacy and still get lots of traffic from employee advocacy.Win-win!Chances are, if you’re focusing on social media, you’re also creating awesome content. So why not plan to share to your social media accounts in the workflow you’re already using?For example, on a blog post like the one you’re reading right now, you’d probably like to share to multiple social media accounts. So create the blog post first, then collaborate with your team to plan how you’ll share the content on social media.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This is what your workflow might look like in CoSchedule:Now simply follow the workflow step by step. And when your team has questions or progress updates along the way, they can check off their tasks and use comments to fill you in.Start by writing your messages in CoSchedule using social helpers:Then schedule your social messages for every account using the social queue. Since you wrote your messages in social helpers, you don’t need to copy and paste, but instead, simply write the tag into new messages to easily reuse what you’ve already written:And finally, add in images and graphics into your social messages with the image selector:Now you have a social dashboard view of all the messages scheduled on all of your social media accounts for a single campaign—complete with days and previews, and best time scheduling so you will get the most engagement possible for your content:If your workflow requires some higher-ups to see your content for approval (but let’s just say you don’t want them to edit your hard work), you can let them see your progress with custom roles.Just build a custom role in CoSchedule, then add them to your team and assign them that role:You can also keep everyone accountable (and keep those big wigs happy) by knowing exactly who did what, when they did it, and to which social media accounts they sent messages with security and access logs:At this point, you have a full list of all of the messages for every social media account for a single campaign. That’s a terrific view to understand how you’re sharing a specific blog post—or any piece of content, really.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?When you step out of the view of working on just one piece, however, it’s natural to want to see every message you’ll send to every one of your social media accounts.So what better way is there to do that than with a calendar that shows you the specific date and time your messages will send?At this point, you can see when certain days have more social messages scheduled than others—and to which accounts—so you can easily drag and drop messages from any account from one day to another.That will help you avoid bombarding your followers with too many messages while consistently connecting with them to get the most engagement.Whatever tool you choose as the app to manage your multiple social media accounts, make sure it helps you eliminate the tediousness of using multiple tools to complete the work that one could really help you do.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Here’s another way to think about this: You could manage your social media accounts with multiple tools, but consolidating and automating at least some parts of your process will help you get organized, stress a whole lot less, and save a ton of time.And if CoSchedule seems like a great place to get started to manage your social media accounts, take advantage of the 14-day free trial to get your feet wet. I promise you, it’s the tool I’d use if I were in your shopping shoes. :)(I know… sorry about the lame jokes.)Click To Tweet

							Content marketing enthusiast, brand advocate, and blogger. I love new ideas, strategy, and continually learning how to work more efficiently.What if you could schedule more social media messages in way less time?

2016-04-07,http://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-collaboration-software/,How CoSchedule Uses Marketing Collaboration Software,"The free blog post headline analyzer will score your overall headline quality and rate its ability to result in social shares, increased traffic, and SEO value.The content marketers at CoSchedule get asked a lot about how we really manage our projects and work together to create our content.So I was humbled when a guest blogger of ours recently shared a bit about his experience working with our marketing team:The amount of preparation done for a post and the superb coordination of their team members taught us a lot on improving our own process.Meeting their high expectations are quite tough, but we are truly honored to have the opportunity to learn from among the best in the business!Since CoSchedule itself is a marketing collaboration software that takes the form of an editorial calendar, I guess it makes sense that you’d like to know how our process actually works. I can tell you from experience that the CoSchedule tool is different than normal collaboration software because it’s designed by marketers to help marketers do what they do better than ever.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?And because of that, we see ourselves—the marketing team here at CoSchedule—as role models for the planning and process behind successful content marketing and social media.So I thought you’d find it interesting to get a behind-the-scenes peek into how we exactly:Sound like fun? Judging by the cheers I’m hearing in my head, I thought so. :)Even for a tech company, it’s nice to get together as a team to collaborate on solving a problem in person. For us, this is one of the best ways for the entire team to come up with creative ideas that will help us reach our 10x growth goals.You see, as the content marketing lead, it would be easy for me to come up with every content marketing idea all by myself and tell the team to execute them. But there is a lot more value when the team develops those ideas because they take ownership in the entire blog’s success—not just their own content.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?And a content planning meeting is a perfect setting for the kind of team collaboration that builds a culture focused on growth. Here’s why:This is how we do it:Some say there’s nothing worse than group brainstorming if you’re looking for innovative ideas. Then again, brainstorming by yourself will only give you ideas limited to your own background.So the first phase of our content planning meeting focuses first on individual contributions to eliminate groupthink. And it’s super easy:At this point, it’s just fun to see the team writing down tons of ideas, working super fast, and wracking their brains for the ultimate best ideas. There’s usually coffee (lots of coffee), laughs, and then dead silence as they get serious about finding better ideas that will really make a difference.By this point, we probably have close to—if not more than—100 or so ideas. The truth? We wouldn’t publish 90% of them because they’re just not quite right for our audience.And that’s just fine because it’s during this grading process that the team chooses which content to publish and which ideas to toss.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?To grade the ideas, I ask the team a couple simple questions:Is this a topic our readers would be deeply interested in learning more about? How similar is this to our other top content?Then we read off each idea one by one while every team member grades the topic from 1 to 3. From there, we simply post the ideas below the corresponding numbers on the marker board.Here’s the outcome from a planning meeting with a bunch of “3” content ideas.A Mistake I Made That You Can Avoid:Until recently, I’d have the team shout off their answers: “That’s a 3, definitely!” “I agree, 3.” “Uh, yeah, let’s go with 3 on that.”I noticed that once the first person spat off their answer, the rest of the team was very likely to say the exact same answer. I found out later this happened because of social conformity, a psychological principle that was discovered decades ago:So The Takeaway Is This: When you do this exercise, read off the ideas, then have each individual write down their grade of 1, 2, or 3 on a new Post-It note. Have them show their individual notes all at the same time for each idea, then categorize the idea as a collective 1, 2, or 3.After this process, we only explore the best ideas—those graded as 3—for content that we’ll actually publish.Where the planning meeting sets the collaborative tone, the editorial calendar in CoSchedule is where the software helps us actually plan and create the content as a team.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?First, we vet the best ideas for keywords, further narrowing our scope of potential content we will create.Then, we add the ideas onto the calendar, naming the blog posts by their keywords and assigning them to their author.We consistently publish two posts every week on Mondays and Wednesdays. Here’s why.Once all of the new blog posts are on the calendar, it’s easy to see which authors might have a bit too much on their plates in a given week. From there, we simply drag and drop blog posts around until we feel 100% satisfied that the publishing schedule is realistically doable for every person on the team.Asking a content marketer to write two robust posts for a single week isn’t very realistic for us. So these posts could flip-flop to make this a doable content schedule.Then we use comments to add in any notes from the planning meeting—including the original idea—so the author has a clear idea of where to start with a blog outline.We use comments in CoSchedule to communicate the main idea from the planning meeting. This way, we leave lots of creative room to use the keyword in the blog post title while still covering the original idea we thought would be successful.Our content development process is ever-changing, and we just gave it a major overhaul recently to:There were lots of benefits for us to get organized in this way, so we started very simply by asking ourselves:What are all the steps we need to do to publish a blog post?We brainstormed all of the steps, then simply put them in chronological order the best that we could to help us know what to do from beginning to end.One collaboration software tool we use all the time as a team is Evernote because no matter where anyone is—or if they’re online or offline—they have access to the information they need to do their work. And, it just so happens, Evernote integrates really nicely into CoSchedule. Anyway, this is what that process looked like as we worked through it in its rough format using Evernote:Here’s a rough look at our first pass at the steps we needed to do to write and publish our content.From there, we had enough information to understand which steps we could group together into a cleaner, condensed workflow. And when we did that, it was easy to understand who on the team would be the best fit to complete those tasks according to their individual interests and skills.We refined the steps in the workflow and created notes in Evernote to define what done means for each task.The only thing left to do was to define when we should complete each task to work far enough ahead to nail every deadline and assign it.This simple exercise gave us exactly what we needed to build the task template we manage using CoSchedule for all new blog posts we write. It gave us a solid definition of what to do for each task. Before anyone who is accountable for a task marks it as complete in CoSchedule, they would first ask themselves if they truly completed the task according to the definition of done.Assign tasks and due dates to everyone on your team with task templates in CoSchedule.Now we know to start writing our blog posts a month before they publish to make sure we have several posts 100% ready to publish on the calendar at any time.We know content that is complete and published is white, and we can see which content is complete by not yet published because it’s yellow and labeled 100% ready to rock.Since we’ve done this, we pay more attention to the details that make a difference toward our goals, everyone understands their roles to know exactly what to do, and we work more efficiently while producing better content.I’ll be the first to say that our workflow—or the task template we built in CoSchedule—looked magical. If we could seriously create content that way with every task checked off on time and in that specific order, we’d be crushing it.But that wasn’t always the case. Especially as we got started with the new process because we had to take a little time to learn.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?And that was OK because our CoSchedule editorial calendar had our back. Let me explain.Traditional workflow and project management tools operate in phases. When someone does step 1, then someone else can do step 2.We all know that doesn’t work 100% of the time. So CoSchedule rocks a task-based workflow that helps the team keep each other accountable for hitting deadlines.Let me explain how this happens:That’s a lot of power for team collaboration. And while being behind is a rarity, this sort of communication may be necessary at first when you’re implementing a brand new process with your team.We use the dashboard in CoSchedule to track a daily to-do list and collaborate with improved team communication. No more endless emails!Here are a few lessons I learned along the way that you may find useful:I like to joke a lot that I’m a content marketer who uses content marketing to market a content marketing tool.While that’s funny, it’s absolutely true. And I wouldn’t be able to love what I do if I didn’t believe the team behind CoSchedule tries harder than anyone else to give marketers like us exactly what we need to boost our efficiency.Naturally, the content marketing team at CoSchedule gravitates toward an editorial calendar as our preferred marketing collaboration software. CoSchedule as a tool helps us collaborate, communicate, create, and promote our content super efficiently.Get your 14-day free trial of CoSchedule to:I hope you’ll join us.

I’ll be stealing some of your ideas, though. ;)Hey @debbierodrigues:disqus, that sounds wonderful!

											The very first step to creating the best social media images is by producing the correct size for each social network. You’re only given a limited space to capture your audience’s attention, so you’ll want to use every pixel you’re given.This can get quite tricky when each network has different ratios and proportions, but if you know the posting sizes for each one, you’ll be off to a great start!Below you’ll find all of the recommended sizes for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Google+ with the preferred size for social posting. Here we go!Facebook is still the most popular social network today with over 1 billion users worldwide. With such a great audience, it’s essential to optimize every single post for top engagement.Facebook images are known to get 2.3 times more engagement than that of a normal post, which is a perfectly great reason to start using social images for every single post.Plus, they’ve found that 87% of a Facebook Page’s interaction comes solely from image posts.In recent news, Facebook now allows you to post several images for one post, appearing as an album. There’s been some discussion whether a single image or multiple images perform better, but according to Convince and Convert, using multiple images can increase clicks by 1,290%!Facebook’s Three Golden Rules: Facebook’s Recommended Image Sizes:Profile Photo: 180 x 180pxCover Photo: 851 x 215pxShared Image: 1200 px 630pxShared Link: 1200 x 630pxHighlighted Image: 1200 x 717pxClick To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Twitter, one of my personal favorite networks, sends out 500 million tweets per day.Adding images to your tweets not only gets you 18% more clicks, but also 89% more favorites, and 150% more retweets! Talk about an engagement boost!Plus, Twitter has kept their network posting consistent in size, so there’s no question that a 440px by 220px image is the best size to reach the most people.Twitter’s Three Golden Rules: Twitter’s Recommended Image Sizes:Profile Photo: 400 x 400pxHeader Photo: 1500 x 500pxIn-Stream Photo: 440 x 220pxClick To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?While LinkedIn is one of the older social networks, it has continued on throughout the years and thrives with its 414 million users. LinkedIn’s focus on business professionals creates a perfect space for business-specific content to be seen and viewed across the world.Although, post with caution.According to Jeff Bullas, being ‘too professional’ without first creating a relationship can actually be a common mistake when using LinkedIn. This idea seems to validate just how important using images can be for establishing that desired connection and relatability.LinkedIn’s Three Golden Rules:LinkedIn’s Recommended Image Sizes:Banner Image: 646 x 220pxStandard Logo: 400 x 400pxSquare Logo: 60 x 60pxHero Photo: 974 x 330pxProfile Picture: 400 x 400pxBackground Image: 1000 x 425pxRegular Post Image: 531px wideClick To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The average time spent on Pinterest per visit is 14.2 minutes! Multiply that by the 176 million registered users, and you’re looking at one very powerful source of information and inspiration. With all of that collective time spent on Pinterest, that also means it’s one of the fastest growing websites, creating the greatest opportunity for your business to grow along with it.Similar to Instagram, Pinterest is highly visual, but rather with an emphasis in sharing content with strangers and friends alike. In order to have the best Pinterest images, avoid using faces, use red or orange, and rock a less distracting background.Pinterest’s Three Golden Rules:Pinterest’s Recommended Image Sizes:Profile Picture: 165 x 165pxPin Board Large Thumbnail: 222 x 150pxPin Board Small Thumbnail: 55 x 55pxPins On Main Page: 192px widePins On Board: 222px widePins Expanded: 600px widePins Enlarged Pin: 500px wideClick To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Instagram is unique in that it solely allows photo-based posts. With an imagery-focused platform, it draws visual connections that make both a memorable and human impression.“Instagram’s per-follower engagement rate for top brands is 58 times higher than on Facebook and 120 times higher than on Twitter,” according to Forrester, which might be why 85% of top brands are adopting it to grow their business.Just recently, Instagram opened their strict square ratio image size up to a variety of landscape and portrait options in addition to increasing their resolution to 1080px for top clarity!Surely, Instagram is a great place for both connection and business.Instagram’s Three Golden Rules: Instagram’s Recommended Image Sizes:Profile Picture: 110 x 110pxPhoto Thumbnails: 161 x 161pxPhoto Size in App: 1080 x 1080pxClick To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?While Google+ may very well be slowly disappearing, it still has a lot to offer if used correctly. After all, its partner in crime, Google, is our greatest source of information across the internet, one of the highest sources of revenue for a lot of businesses, and one of the greatest companies worldwide.Everyone knows and loves Google. For that reason alone, it’s no surprise that Google+ has 375 million active members. With that large of an audience, it’s best that your images are set up for optimal performance.Google+’s Three Golden Rules:Google+’s Recommended Image Sizes:Profile Picture: 250 x 250pxCover Image: 1080 x 608pxShared Image: 426 x 255px wideShared Link Thumbnail: 150 x 150pxClick To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?There you have it! A complete guide to the best social image sizes, with the most important recommendations for each and every network.Find the size you’re looking for, and use that when you begin the creation process with your images. Simply choosing the correct size at the beginning, will save you so much time when you’re ready to save and export your images for the world to see!While several factors go into making an image its very best, color is one of the most essential ingredients. Color psychology has proven time and time again that we can convey emotions simply by using a particular color!Last year, I did a two-month study on the popularity of a given color in CoSchedule’s graphics. Since we typically use a three-color palette for our blog graphics, I was able to give appropriate rankings to each of the three colors used to see how they each performed.I quickly realized that certain colors might be performing better simply because we use them more often, so I then compared the popularity percentage to the usage percentage to find an overall color grade.Basically, I nerded out and used data to see what colors performed the best.Use a graph like this to review and test your color schemes.At the end of my study, we found that blue and green were our highest performing colors! If we look at color psychology, both of these colors reflect a calm, clean, comforting presence which seems to be the perfect match to the experience we want our readers to have, especially if they’re new to the CoSchedule blog. Blue is also one of our brand colors.The other two top-performing colors were none other then red and orange. While blue and green provide a safe, calm place for our readers, orange and red are perfect complements because they grab our audience’s attention and spark their interest.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Psychology tells us that red and orange represent passion, energy, and success. I couldn’t imagine a better pair for blue and green’s calm, comforting presence than the passion and success of orange and red. Together, they seemed to make a dynamic duo, so I tried using those color pairs over the past year…Out of our top 10 posts, 8 of them have either blue or green as the main color. The remaining two blog posts have orange as their main color. Absolutely none of our top performing posts contain any other main colors! By understanding which colors performed better, we were able to help increase our page views by 833.76%!You can do this, too!Simply follow the steps below to see which colors work best for your brand:While everyone has different colors that match their brand and audience demographics, it’s essential to test out the waters and find the colors that work best for you! But when in doubt… use blue or green.Now that you know your target image size and top-performing colors, it’s time to decide what type of image to use. While almost anything can be an image—screenshots, illustrations, photos, quotes, GIFs—there are a few standout images you can depend upon to receive the most engagement.Quotes come in all shapes and sizes. Maybe it’s from a speaker, conference, or a book that you’ve recently read. Or, maybe it’s from an article or blog online. No matter the form or social network, quotes can be an excellent way to reach your audience with images.Simply find a quote you like and pair it with a color or simple background. The dynamic duo will allow your readers to ponder, identify with, and in return, share your quote.For example, at CoSchedule we started sharing quotes from our blog authors on Facebook, and we received 98% growth in engagements and 91% growth in clickthroughs. Facebook isn’t alone!Here’s another example from Twitter:20 Ways To Be Creative When You Don't Feel Inspired https://t.co/JS5YcKZFoQ pic.twitter.com/hRaof4lPfV— CoSchedule (@CoSchedule) January 16, 2016This tweet received 2,107 impressions and 38 engagements because the quote had insight, intrigue, and direct application. It not only complemented the content topic of creativity, but gave further information that could be easily shared with their family and friends.Quote images are a perfect way to give something to your audience that they can share and be proud of, all the while giving your content more traction. Try them out!GIFs are one of the CoSchedule office’s favorite things both in our work chats and on social media because they perform well, all while bringing a smile. Even in challenging situations, GIFs can bring a delight to those who would rather be frustrated.Here’s an example:Uh, oh. #facebookdown In the meantime, enjoy a cat gif! pic.twitter.com/34o2LYk61a— CoSchedule (@CoSchedule) September 28, 2015By using a GIF and bringing a humorous moment to a normal circumstance, we received 15,953 impressions and 381 engagements! We’ve also found that tweets with GIFs tend to get 22.3% more engagement than tweets with plain images.Here’s an example:Are You Excited? You Can Now Pin To Pinterest With CoSchedule https://t.co/014yRye9xG pic.twitter.com/uo6Kenojn6— CoSchedule (@CoSchedule) March 8, 2016Just by turning a static image into a motion-filled GIF, the tweet received 1,328 impressions, 77 views, and 15 engagements! Plus, this tweet isn’t alone! When tweets contain GIFs, they get 166.6% more clickthroughs. GIFs allow motion to make your social posts stand out, get even more attention, and bring delight.What are some of your favorite GIFs?At this point, it’s no secret that infographics are one of the most popular and highest shared content types in today’s digital world. Not only do they get shared more often, but they’re also 30 times more likely to be read than a purely textual article!If that wasn’t good enough, infographics are also the perfect pair for one of the top-performing visual bookmarking site: Pinterest.Infographics get a lot of attention on Pinterest because they tend to be longer in format, which fits Pinterest’s 4:5 image ratio that receives 60% more Repins. Here’s an example of our top-performing pin:;Is it a surprise that it happens to be an infographic? I think not.You work really hard to find the perfect headline for your content. You search for keywords, words filled with emotion, then use the headline analyzer to find the precise, most-effective title. So why not take advantage of that in your social image?At CoSchedule, we reviewed some of our top-performing tweets, and found that they all included a title image. Our top tweet in December received 2,280 impressions and 12 engagements, our top tweet in January had 3,486 impressions and 51 engagements, and in February our top tweet got a total of 5,419 impressions and 79 engagements all with title graphics. That’s an average of 3,727 impressions and 30 engagements from using a title graphic within the tweet.December Example: Remember to put email signup opportunities at the end of your content. #blogging https://t.co/EMWHSNg0JD pic.twitter.com/kNfscXsTw1— CoSchedule (@CoSchedule) December 4, 2015January Example:

As you can see, titles extend beyond the written context, and can certainly be effective within the graphic itself. Find the title of your blog, announcement, or event, and use that in the image to see the top performance.Social media images can take quite a few different forms, colors, and sizes—but with this data, you’ve found exactly what equation works best for each social network.If you happen to be in a rush or maybe you’re just starting out, use a 2:1 ratio for your image size, incorporate blue or green with a pop of orange or red in your color scheme, and stick to the four main image types: GIFs, quotes, titles, and infographics. Without much time at all, you’ll be on your way to success!What colors, sizes, and image types have worked best for you? Share below!Click To Tweet

Be a hashtag expert and increase your social media reach here.What if we said 77% of you reading this post could get 192% more traffic by following this social media posting schedule? This post will show you how.Very helpful post. Thank you!You’re very welcome, Mary! Thanks for reading!Ashton, what an amazingly detailed and helpful post! I am definitely going to bookmark it and reference it. Thanks so much for sharing.Wow, that’s great to hear, Benjamin! Happy to help!Thanks for aggregating all of this in one location. One of the all-time most useful blog posts ever!You’re welcome, its my pleasure! Happy to be one of the top, what an honor!Am I missing where to download the Photoshop action, though?EDIT: I SWEAR it wasn’t there when I first checked. Thanks!Hey Casey, thanks for reading! The Photoshop action is in the Social Media Images bundle along with some other resources that can be found either on the side of the blog or right away at the top within the post itself. See it?Yeah, totally do now. Don’t know why I didn’t before — thank you :)Haha, no worries! Make sure to read the ReadMe.txt file in there with instructions so that your images turn out perfect! :)Thanks for sharing the valuable information, Hope it will be very helpful to starters like me who are depending on digital marketing.Yes, that’s perfect! Glad I could help!so do you not recommend setting up an auto-post (I do it from within WordPress) to social media sites so that a person can share the content with the different image sizes for each social media platform?Hello, thanks for reading! I haven’t personally used Auto-Post, but I would say continue to use it if it already auto-sizes your images correctly for each network. Otherwise, I’d recommend using the Photoshop action in the download bundle or custom sizing your images for optimal presence on each network. What I found was that each social network had such different proportions and sizes, that one size didn’t necessarily fit all, which creates quite the challenge. Fortunately, the Photoshop action really saved us a ton of time in order to reach that goal of having correctly sized images for each network.Hope that helps!thank you! the auto-post does not resize the images. that would be nice!Thank you Ashton for this article. Very informative and helpful!Thanks so much, Riva! Happy to help :)Great article Ashton. Definitely important to have the proper size images for each network.Visual quotes have been working really well for us.Yes! Important and also a challenge if each post has several images (but hopefully something I was able to help with in the free bundle!). Glad to hear quotes are working! We’ve definitely found good success with them, too. Thanks for reading!Great article, super useful for a newbie like me. Now, about filing, what do you recommend? Do I file images per platform (one folder for FB, one for Instagram …), or do I file images per topic (say a post about gardening, with all the FB, Instagram, etc. images in it)? Thx!Great question, Christine! It’s soooo easy to save all these images and then later be left with a mess to dig through (and lets be honest, nobody wants that!). For CoSchedule we use this naming convention: Blog-AuthorName-Keyword-Title.png.So for example, this post was ‘Blog-Ashton-SocialMediaImages-Twitter.png, Blog-Ashton-SocialMediaImages-Facebook.png, Blog-Ashton-SocialMediaImages-LinkedIn.png’ etc.This way, when I look back over time, I can search my files either by author’s name or by keyword. Everyone has their own strategy that works for them, but this is what has been working for us thus far! We’ve even created a folder for each author so its organized further that way.Hope that helps!Great article. Wish Coschedule offer multiple image posts through the site. Since it doesn’t, right now I’m having to choose between uploading more than one picture (or video, Coschedule also doesn’t support video uploads) or having the share loaded into Coschedule where I can get analytics, etc. :(Hey Jeana, thanks so much for reading! We’d love to have some more image gallery + video features, so I really appreciate your feedback on that!Awesome post which sums up perfectly. As a soloentrepreneur though I think I’ll stick to use a 2:1 ratio for my image size. Is 1024x512px then the best size or do you recommend another size for “one size fits all”?In relation to title images do you then recommend to use the same font(pair) as you use for your normal content, or are you more loose about that?Hey Torben, thanks for reading! That image size looks good, and fits the 2:1 ratio as you mention. If you want to use the Photoshop Action included in the download, a 1500px by 645px is the magic number for your starting image. From there, it’ll size everything else correctly for you with a click of a button!For title graphics, every brand has the freedom to be different, but speaking on behalf of what we do at CoSchedule, we have a style guide that includes 3 core typefaces with their primary uses—one of them being titles and headlines. By using the same typefaces in certain use cases, it creates a nice consistency that our readers enjoy.Hope that helps!Great Ashton. I use Canva so I won’t be using the Photoshop Action included (but I’ll take a look for sure). I know that Canva can do a magic resize for other sizes but I want to keep things simple, so for now I stick to the so called “Twitter Post” in Canva which for some reason still has the dimension 1024x512px?!Ah, yes, Canva is awesome! From what I’ve seen, Twitter’s finished size is 440 by 220px so I think anything that is a 2:1 ratio should work for it. Nice work!@ashtonwirrenga:disqus speaking of colors: do you recommend to use the same green and blue colors for every image or (as I think you do at Coschedule) to use different kinds of green and blue from image to image?Super helpful post! Thanks so muchNicole | The Professional Mom ProjectYou’re very welcome, Nicole! Thanks for reading!this is a plethora of informationHey Shelley, thanks so much for reading! Happy to help!FANTASTIC post – bookmarked for…forever!Wow, thanks so much!So much awesome info… but, I’m not understanding how the action is supposed to work. None of the steps says for which social media network it is sizing to and the saving options aren’t working. Am I missing something or is there a tutorial somewhere?Hey Jenny, thanks for reading! The instructions for the Photoshop action are in the .txt file named ‘ReadMe’ that was included in the download folder. Basically, any image that’s 1500 by 645px will be automatically sized down for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+! You’ll see which network each image is for based on the saved file name. Hope that helps!© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,2

They also schedule more than 48 posts, 5 podcasts, and 4 newsletters each month.Crazy, right?Since their beginning, they’ve been pushing out quality content and giving folks what they need—simple digital marketing advice.Demand for their content grew at an insane rate and continues to grow. The need for a marketing project management software tool became quite apparent.Let’s introduce Jess…Before CoSchedule, Jess, the managing editor at Convince and Convert, worked through spreadsheets, email threads, and a less than stellar WordPress calendar. With their previous process, “… it was hard to wrangle all the content and get it onto a calendar that was actually up to date,” Jess said.Now staying on top of content is seamless and has even saved them nearly 10 hours each month. Here’s a look at how a small team like Convince and Convert consistently produces exceptional content with the help of CoSchedule and how you can, too!As marketers, we know staying organized is a huge pain point. When managing umptillion moving parts and a team of people, having the right marketing project management software is essential to keep everyone on the same page.Recommended Reading: When C&C chose CoSchedule to manage their workflow, the impact was tremendous. And not only did it save them gobs of time, they were able to effectively manage their remote team and conquer a very content-heavy schedule!“Most of us have our full-time jobs and then we also work for Convince and Convert; having the calendar empowers my team to quickly jump back into the process without needing to be in the calendar every day.” —Jess OstroffThe best solution is to choose one tool to manage the process and refine the workflow. And that tool can be anything, from an old-school calendar to marketing project management software like CoSchedule. What’s important is that you adopt a system and stick to it.Once you choose a tool, you must have a set workflow that keeps everything organized and moving in the right direction. With the calendar, Jess and her team work autonomously while still staying in sync. They’ve developed a workflow that’s associated with each piece of content, so there are no questions as to what each person is supposed to do or what their responsibilities are. They just know!Get your team involved early on. Folks will own it if they have a hand in the planning process.Things to keep in mind when you plan a brainstorming meeting:Next, create a one-sentence statement to help define the purpose of your meeting. This sentence will create a clear picture as to why and what needs to be accomplished.During the meeting:Create an environment that encourages ideas and minimizes groupthink. Not sure where to start?Once you’ve got a list of all possible tasks in the workflow process, start prioritizing them.Tips for going through your list:Recommended Reading: How To Choose The Perfect Blog CategoriesAfter you’ve cleaned up the list and defined the purpose of the project, it’s time to implement a timeline with deadlines to accomplish your goal.In order to figure out your timeline:This is where over-communication comes in handy because we all have our own definition of what “done” means.Save your team hours of wasted time and miscommunication by clearly defining what complete means for each task in the process.Next, designate a specific person or role for each task.Again, over-communication and clarification are crucial in the beginning. Make sure you have a clear framework and that you designate tasks to each person. It will empower your team and help them create a rhythm within the process.Recommended Reading:Now add the Super Mario effect to your already stellar task workflow.Once you define your tasks, build a task template in CoSchedule. You’ll save an immense amount of time with this step.Use this exercise to build your task template inside of CoSchedule:You can easily create a new project and add all the necessary tasks with your handy-dandy new task template. There’s no need to recreate the wheel each time you start a new project!Lastly, test, revise, and test again. You won’t have the perfect process right out of the gate. It takes a little trial and error to find the perfect flow. Focusing on a couple success factors will make the revision process easier.Review each person’s tasks and timeline: Like C&C, you can review each person’s tasks to see their progress toward 100% complete.Anyone falling behind? Perhaps you estimated too little time, they’re getting sidetracked, or the current definition of done isn’t clear enough. Meet with your team, then edit your task template.Recommended Reading: Working with huge levels of content always adds a level of complexity, but with CoSchedule’s workflow functionalities and all-in-one calendar, staying in sync and on schedule is easier than ever.Since switching over to CoSchedule, the C&C team has saved nearly 10 hours every month! Managing all their content in one spot has eliminated endless hours of email hunts, and piecing together the details. Now, Jess and her team can focus on the important stuff—publishing exceptional content!

											Table of Contents:You may have heard rumblings that SEO is an outdated practice. You might have even heard that basic search engine optimization is completely unnecessary in 2016.However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, SEO is as important as ever. Furthermore, if you’re not paying attention, you might not be getting all the traffic you could be. While search engine algorithms and SEO best practices are constantly evolving, it’s still important to know the basics and not rely on luck to get your content to rank.That’s where the following tips come in hand.Keywords are essential to any sound SEO campaign. Search engines need them to understand what your post is about. Users need them to help find answers to their questions. Your goal is to create great resources that answers common search queries.The Google Adwords Keyword Planner is every marketer’s trusted warhorse for keyword research. It’s useful for uncovering keyword search volumes and generating additional keyword ideas. Check out this video below to see how it works:We love this free keyword tool from SERPs.com. It’s fast, effective, and incredibly easy to use.Here’s how it works:It’s as simple as that.If you have a paid Moz subscription, then you know how useful their Keyword Difficulty tool can be. However, what if you can’t afford a premium SEO software suite?Enter SEMRush.While they do offer paid plans, you can easily use their Keyword Difficulty tool with a free subscription:1.  Sign up for a free SEMRush account.2. Find Keyword Difficulty in the left-hand navigation.3. Enter keywords you’d like to check (up to 10 at a time)We’ve covered how Google’s Keyword Planner is useful for gauging keyword search volumes.However, you can also use it to generate keyword ideas based on your competition:1. Start with a fresh search for keywords based on a website:2. Enter a competitor’s domain or landing page URL to use as a basis for keyword ideas:3. You have now generated tons of keyword ideas based on what your competitor could potentially target. Consider going after these keywords before they do, or check to see if they’re already ranking on these terms.SEMRush is another useful tool for uncovering competitor’s keywords.1. Log into your account and click on Organic Research:2. Enter a domain and see which keywords it’s ranking for:Using this process, you might be able to find keywords you wouldn’t have thought to target.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Meta tags are snippets of text that exist in your website or blog’s code. According to Search Engine Watch:HTML meta tags are officially page data tags that lie between the open and closing head tags in the HTML code of a document. The text in these tags is not displayed, but parsable and tells the browsers (or other web services) specific information about the page. Simply, it “explains” the page so a browser can understand it.There are two meta tags you need to customize for every post on your blog. They are the title tag and the meta description tag.The title tag tells users and search engines what your web page is about. Meanwhile, the meta description tag provides readers with more information about your page. Both are displayed in search engine result pages (SERPs).Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Here is what they look like in the search results:There are three essential elements (plus one that’s optional) to writing a quality title tag:Meta tags should give readers a reason to click your search result. Think of them as ad copy for your blog post.Here are a few important technical items to remember when writing meta descriptions:BONUS TIP: Want to see what your title tag and meta description will look like before publishing? Use a free online SERP preview tool. Here are three different options:A SERP preview tool can be useful for seeing how your search snippets will appear before publishing your blog post.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You’ve probably heard the cliche “content is king.”We’ve heard this line repeated more times than we’d like to count. However, the sentiment behind this phrase rings true. You can’t have an SEO strategy without quality content. Follow these tips to write copy that’s well-optimized for search engines without sounding spammy or mechanical.It’s important to make sure your primary keyword is included in several different places in your post. This is one of the most basic elements of on-page SEO.Longtail keywords are longer variations of your primary keyword.For example, if your primary keyword was “content marketing,” some long tail variations might include:These are just a few hypothetical examples.Latent Semantic Indexing refers to the way search engines look for relevant themes on web pages, rather than just keyword densities. According to long-time SEO expert Bruce Clay:In latent semantic indexing, Google sorts sites on the frequency of a variety of terms and key phrases linked together instead of on the frequency of a single term. Though your text content should include your main keyword or phrase, the content should never focus solely on that keyword or phrase. There is a possibility that Google may see the page as being over-optimized and penalties or a dip in rankings may result.In other words, use synonyms and phrasing variations of your primary keyword. Don’t just repeat your primary keyword ad nauseam. This will look redundant and spammy both to readers and search engines alike.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Moz CEO Rand Fishkin does a great job of explaining how to use semantically connected keywords:Always write content with your audience in mind. If something sounds overly mechanical and over-optimized for search engines, readers will notice.This means you need to avoid keyword stuffing.Don’t stick keywords everywhere possible in your post. Instead, spread them out naturally throughout your post. Odds are, you’ll include long tail keywords naturally as you write anyway.Here’s an example of a well-written sentence including the keyword “burrito recipe”:“Read more to learn how to make this excellent burrito recipe at home.”Here’s an example of what keyword stuffing might look like in this instance:“This is the best burrito recipe for awesome bean burrito recipes on the Internet.”One of these sentences reads clearly and includes the primary keyword in a useful way. The other sounds unnatural and over-optimized.Comprehensive blog posts should be as long as needed to thoroughly cover a topic.Studies show that blog posts with at least 1,500 words rank best. Another study from Neil Patel ups that claim to 3,000 words. These studies tell us two things:1. Search engines want their users to have a great experience.That means that you’ll need to help them find the right information fast.For this reason, search engines prefer to rank content that thoroughly answers a user’s question about a topic. Ideally, they want your content to tell them everything they need to know without having to check another search result listing (which slows down the user and creates a weaker user experience).2. It takes a fair amount of words to really cover most topics thoroughly (somewhere in the 1,500 t0 3,000 word range, or more).This doesn’t mean you need to pad your content with filler to hit a high word count. That won’t help you create useful content or rank highly in search engines. Do the following instead:SEO experts have been telling people to create unique content for years. However, they don’t always follow up with what “unique content” really means.When it comes to content marketing and SEO, unique content:Here are some ways to ensure your content is unique:Using correct heading tags makes your posts easier to read. It also makes it easier for search engines to accurately interpret and index your content.You can find your heading controls in WordPress here:Search engines can’t “look” at your images to determine their content. Instead, they use a handful of other data points to understand what your images are.File names are important element that search engines need to accurately interpret image content. Follow these guidelines:Here’s what a well-formatted image file name might look like:You get the point. This is something that’s often overlooked, but it can help you rank in image searches. It can also help support the overall SEO performance of your blog posts.You might notice that WordPress fills in image titles by default.However, there is some debate around how useful they are for SEO. After all, if you’ve given your image a descriptive file name and alt text, users and search engines alike should have all the information they need to understand your image.Including title tags isn’t likely to hurt your SEO. It won’t help much either, and it could cause your images to appear over-optimized (by trying to stuff too many keywords in your image data).Alt text essentially provides alternative information to describe an image’s content.You can easily edit image alt tags in WordPress here:
Alt text is important for two reasons:Bloggers often upload large images into WordPress, and then adjust the display size within the CMS.However, this slows down page load speed because it forces WordPress to resize the image as it’s trying to load the page. Since page load speed is an important SEO factor, that can cause a problem.The solution is to upload images with the exact dimensions you want them to appear with. That way, your CMS won’t have to work as hard to load your images.For example, the column width of the CoSchedule blog is 770 pixels. Therefore, we upload our images at 770 pixels wide (or less).If you want to find the exact column width of your own blog, try using this Page Ruler extension for Chrome. It makes it easy to measure pixels:Search engines use links to determine relationships between different pages and web sites. That’s why it’s important to earn backlinks from high-quality sites to improve your SEO. It’s also important to make sure relevant pages and posts on your own site are linked as well.However, going overboard with optimizing internal links can get you in trouble with search engines. Follow these two tips to make sure you don’t overdo it with internal linking.This tip requires some explanation about what follow and no follow links are.Google doesn’t want to see you creating garbage content just to get links. Readers don’t either.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?To combat this, Google issued a warning to bloggers to make author box links no-follow. Even if your guest posts are legitimate and high-quality, making bio box links no-follow avoids creating the appearance of spamming (because search bots sometimes have difficulty telling the difference between what’s legitimate and what’s not).Anchor text refers to the highlighted words used to link to another page.Search engines use anchor text to help them understand relationships between linked pages. For example, if your anchor text is “burrito recipes,” search engines can infer that the page you’re linking to is probably related to making burritos. It can also understand that making burritos is relevant to the page where the linked text exists.It’s important to make sure your anchor text is not over-optimized. This is especially when linking internally to your own posts.Here’s why:However, you need to be careful not to use anchor text that is an exact match for the keyword the linked page is optimized for. For example, let’s say you have one page targeting the keyword “burrito recipes” and another page targeting “burrito catering services” (please bear with me and my burrito obsession here).If you were to place a link (or worse, multiple links) from your burrito recipes page to your catering page, using the exact-match anchor text “burrito catering services,” this would be considered SPAM.There’s a good reason search engines consider over-optimized anchors to be spammy, too. The tactic has been over-abused over the years because it’s an overly easy way to tell search engines, “Hey, I’m trying really hard to get this page to rank for this keyword.”Instead, follow these guidelines when selecting anchor text:1. Use a sentence fragment incorporating text that is relevant to the page being linked to, but is not an exact keyword match.2. It’s okay to use brand names or proper nouns as text anchors.Keep these two points in mind, and you’ll have smooth sailing ahead for your internal linking efforts.WordPress has a number of unique SEO considerations. Follow these tips to make sure your WordPress blog plays nice with search engines.If there’s only one WordPress plugin you use (aside from CoSchedule), make it Yoast. It’s packed full of powerful functionality for improving your SEO.Here are some things it can do:Once installed, you can find the Yoast control panel at the bottom of your post within your WordPress CMS.Download Yoast here. Then, watch the video below to learn how to use it in under 30 minutes:Mobile web traffic is gaining ground over desktop usage. That’s why Google gives preference to mobile-optimized sites when calculating mobile search results.That means it’s more important than ever to make sure your blog looks great on mobile devices.The easiest way to do this is to use a mobile-optimized WordPress theme. A quick Google search for mobile optimized WordPress themes should generate tons of different options to choose from.Search engines use keywords in URLs to help them determine what your pages are about.However, WordPress uses weird, non-optimal URLs by default which usually look something like this:www.RandomBlog.com/blog/?8973834What you want are URLs that look more like this:www.RandomBlog.com/blog/awesome-keywordThat keyword is going to make 100% more sense to search engines than a question mark followed by a random string of numbers.Watch this video to learn how to implement SEO-friendly permalinks:Broken links won’t necessarily lead to problems for your SEO. However, they do create a poor user experience (even if you have a really funny 404 page). That can hurt your overall SEO efforts indirectly by causing visitors to leave.Fortunately, broken links are easy to fix. The Broken Link Checker plugin makes it easy to identify and resolve 404 errors.You can also use another useful tool called Screaming Frog to tackle this task. Download it here, then follow their detailed step-by-step instructions on fixing broken links.It’s important to know whether your SEO initiatives are making a difference. By tracking the right metrics, the right way, you can make sure you know if you’re on the right track. You can also more easily identify areas for opportunity.Google Analytics is one of the best tools for measuring the success of your SEO. If you’re just getting started, consider importing the New Google Analytics User Starter Bundle from Google. It’s packed full of dashboards that are set up to monitor SEO performance (and a lot more) with minimal effort.Follow these steps to get started:1. Find the bundle in the Google Analytics Solutions Gallery.2. Click Import.In two easy steps, you now have all the dashboards you need to measure your success.When it comes to SEO, marketers tend to focus on rankings.However, rankings are not a strong key performance indicator (KPI) on their own. This is partly because personalized search makes it difficult to accurately track rankings across all users. It’s also because rankings are a means to an end (driving traffic to your blog), rather than an end by themselves.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Instead, focus on traffic, conversion rates, and revenue (or leads generated, depending on which is more applicable to your situation). These metrics will tell you much more about your SEO success than rankings alone.SEO software subscriptions cost money. However, they’re worth it if you can afford them.These services allow you to do the following (and more):Here are some popular options to consider:Tools like Moz Pro feature tons of functionality to help manage your SEO efforts.SEO is a deep discipline. It covers a broad range of tactics, strategies, and best practices.For this reason, it’s impossible to cover all there is to know in one post.

Just one question, why do I need to separate words in image file names with – (dashes) and not with _ (underscores)?That’s a good question. Dashes are easier for search engines to read through than underscores, and they’re what Google suggests using in their own image publishing guidelines. This video from ex-Googler Matt Cutts offers a more detailed explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQcSFsQyct8ThanksHey Ben,I thoroughly enjoyed reading your post – it was packed with useful tips!
I was a little surprised about the ‘Image Title Tag’ being left blank; I’d not heard about that. Why does WordPress have a slot for it if it can cause problems? I’ve always filled that in, often with the same as the Alt Text. Eek!! Is this info based on your experience or has Google mentioned this themselves?Thanks for a great post!
– DavidGreat question, David. The main issue is that Google just doesn’t pay much attention to image title tags, preferring to use image file names and alt tags as stronger ranking signals (title tags are more for users than search bots). The secondary issue is that if you have your keyword in the file name, alt tag, and title tag, there’s a small chance it could look like keyword stuffing if they’re all identical. This can be avoided by making your image title tag sufficiently different than your file name and alt tag (in my experience, WordPress duplicates the file name as the title tag by default). I’m not sure why this is the case, though, and I’d be curious to know as well.Google’s own advice is a little less clear. In their image publishing guidelines, they recommend making image title tags “descriptive,” but they don’t stress them as an important ranking factor (although they do suggest they help provide some context to what images are about): https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=enHowever, here Google says they look more closely at alt text, and suggest using title tags only if they provide value to users: https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2007/12/using-alt-attributes-smartly.htmlTitle tags appear as hover text over images for users in Firefox and Opera, so they do have a small amount of value that way. Since image title tags have little essential upside though, but do have a small amount of potential to make your images look spammy if they’re not implemented correctly, I personally recommend leaving that field blank. That’s not necessarily a consensus opinion though, and others might suggest otherwise (and that’s okay).TL;DR –  as long as you’re careful to differentiate your title tags from your alt text and file names, you shouldn’t have anything to worry about. I’m just personally more comfortable excluding non-essential image elements to avoid keyword stuffing (especially when there’s not much clear benefit otherwise).Hope this helps!Also, to avoid possible confusion, when I say “title tags” in this context, I’m referring specifically to “image title tags”.Sure, understood!Thanks Ben!
Google never make it clear do they? :-)
I’ll take note to keep this clear of different from henceforth.Well done! Relieved to have known most of the things on the list, but am still bookmarking to try some of the recommended tools. Thank you so much!Thanks for reading, Laura!I wanna thank you for this tools…. I see it as a record breaking….Glad you found this useful, Peter! Thanks for reading (and we’ll keep the record-breaking content coming).The keyword planner doesn’t work for me. It keeps wanting me to create an ad campaign which I don’t want to. How do work around that?Hey MzViolette, I’ve run into this issue before, and it can be a pain to figure out.

											Organization isn’t necessarily the fun part of writing. However, getting organized now will help you get more done later. Here are a handful of tips and ideas to help you make the most of your limited working time.Let us quickly state the obvious: different writers work differently.This extends not only to how we work, but where we work best. If you’re working in an office environment, you may or may not have flexibility on where you get your writing done. However, if you have the option, it’s worth working in different types of spaces to find what suits you. Whether you prefer busy coffee shops or a quiet corner space in your office, being in the right environment can make a positive impact on your productivity.You probably use a wide variety of tools in your blog writing workflow. However, there are a few ways to make sure you always have quick access to what you need.If you need help avoiding digital distractions, consider using a minimalist word processor. Each of these options can be used to block out everything on your screen, except the words you’re hammering out:Here is a screenshot of Focus Writer in action. It features several different selectable background themes.Before you can write your blog post, you need to know what you’ll write about. This entails:Let’s get started.It isn’t easy to consistently come up with content ideas your readers will love. However, here are some guidelines to follow to help you come up with more ideas, more quickly.This ever-trusty standby needs to be in every content marketer’s arsenal. Here’s to leverage it to find awesome post ideas:1.) Create an account. Even if you’re not paying to run any ads, you do have an Adwords account, right?2.) Select the first option pictured below:3.) Enter a keyword or topic:4.) You’ll now have two tabs full of ideas. One is for ad groups, and the other is for keywords.5.) We’ve now taken one broad topic and spun off 800 possible keywords.Brainstorming with a team is one of the most efficient ways to generate blog post ideas. Plus, it doesn’t have to take too long, either. Follow this process to generate tons of ideas quick:By the time you’re done, you’ll have a mountain of ideas to work with. Plus, by getting multiple team members involved, you’ll likely come up with more diverse and innovative ideas.Running an online survey or poll is an excellent way to do audience research and gather original data. Survey Monkey and Polldaddy are both easy to use tools just for this purpose (we use Polldaddy here at CoSchedule).Follow these steps to run a survey:Follow these steps to make use of your data:By the time you’re done, you’ll have a solid understanding of what your readers want. You’ll also have a good idea of who your real audience is (and we’ll touch on that more later).Once you have a strong list of content ideas, it’s time to validate which are best. This process will help you zero in on the blog topics you absolutely have to write (and the ones you shouldn’t).Use the Google Adwords Keyword Planner to check how often keywords related to your idea get searched. If you used this in the previous step, you should already have this data.Google Trends is a handy tool for seeing how often a topic is getting written about. Here’s how it works:1.) Enter a topic you might want to write about:2.) If you see increased interest in your idea, then you know you might be onto something.This is probably the simplest and most direct way to get feedback for your idea. If you get a strong level of engagement, you’ll know your audience is interested in your topic. You can also incorporate their questions and comments into your post.To create a post that’s both comprehensive and useful, you need to go in-depth on a narrowly defined subject. This means pinpointing one specific idea with laser-like focus.For example, let’s say you manage a blog about car maintenance. This could be a personal blog, or you might manage this blog for a company in the automotive industry. In this instance, something like “How To Take Care Of Your Car” would be an extremely broad topic you could cover.However, a better question to ask might be, “What specifically could I write about when it comes to car maintenance?” A hypothetical short list might look like this:Follow these steps to refine your idea into something super-specific people want to read:Here’s a quick example from another post on the CoSchedule blog that does a great job of focusing on a very specific area within a broader topic:Immediately, you know exactly what this post is about. You also know which problem this post will help you solve, or what it’ll help you know more about. That’s the goal you want to achieve.Once you have your idea solidified, it’s time to go deep on your research.In most cases, you can find what you need with nothing more than a search engine (most likely Google or Bing). However, if you really want to take your research to the next level, it might be worth going beyond the Google search box.Remember, the Internet is a big place. You’ve got a lot of resources at your fingertips, and depending on what your blog is about, there may be other useful research tools out there for you.Here are some basic things to remember when doing any kind of serious online research:If you’re familiar with advanced Google search operators, then you know how helpful they can be.They’re best understood as the punctuation you include in a search term to help the search engine understand exactly what you’re looking for. For example, they can be used to search for results only within a single site, or for sites that only contain certain terms.Here’s a short list of useful search operators to help you do detailed searches on Google:Search Specific Site: site:[URL] [Search Term]
Search Related Sites: related:[URL] [Search Term]
Search Multiple Words: [Search Term 1] OR [Search Term 2]
Get Info About A Website: info:[URL]
For most bloggers and marketers, research starts and ends with Google. In most cases, that might be all you need.However, if you really want to dig deep, it’s time to go beyond the world’s most popular search engine. Consider starting with some of these options.Wolfram Alpha is an extremely powerful research tool. It’s like an encyclopedia, calculator, and search engine all rolled into one. To use their own words, it works “by doing dynamic computations based on a vast collection of built-in data, algorithms, and methods.” In plain English, it’s useful for calculating and comparing differences between different topics and pieces of data.Here are some things Wolfram Alpha can do:This is just a short list of possibilities. If you really want to leverage what Wolfram Alpha can do, start with their tour of the basics. This video from founder Stephen Wolfram himself offers a good introduction:There are tons of useful archives and databases out there, especially if your blog has an academic focus. Consider the following:These types of resources may or may not be useful, depending on what you’re writing about. The idea is simply to think beyond obvious sources to find information that hasn’t already been repeated a million times elsewhere on the web.You’ve got to plan to succeed. That’s where writing your blog outline comes in.Writing without an outline is like driving without a map (or to use a more modern metaphor, your smartphone). You’ll be fine if you’re going a short distance.If you’re going to be covering a lot of ground, however, you need to know where you’re going. Otherwise, you’re likely to get lost, waste time, and probably yell.In most cases, this simply entails listing your introduction, and then your subsequent section headings. Each heading should represent a main point you want to elaborate on. Here’s what a simple outline structure could look like:It doesn’t need to complicated. It just needs to be quick to put together and effective in guiding your writing flow.Once you’ve established each section of your post, it’s time to drill down even deeper into your sub-points. Identify which points you’ll cover, underneath each section heading.Now, your outline might look something like this (this is an actual outline I wrote for this post):Your outline doesn’t need to be polished. Nor does each section heading need to be final. It just needs to provide a guide for you to follow as you write, and it can be changed as you progress.If speed is of the essence, and you already have strong knowledge of your topic, then consider skipping the outlining phase. You might be able to cut your research a bit short too, in that case.However, you’ll likely find that sketching out a quick outline will save time in the long run. Furthermore, while avoiding outlines may allow for creative freedom when writing fiction, blog posts (at least the kinds of blog posts we’re talking about right now) need to be focused.You’ve already done a lot of work, and you haven’t even started to write your post yet. However, everything you’ve done up until now will make the rest of your blog writing process much easier.Write at least 20 to 30 different headline options. Some of them will be junk. Try to narrow it down to just one you’ll use. You might also choose a few alternate headlines to test in social media posts.Here are some more quick tips for writing headlines:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?First impressions matter.A strong blog post introduction has the power to hook a reader for the long haul. However, a poor intro can lead to a high bounce rate and send your traffic away.Here’s how to write an intro that sticks.Consider starting with an interesting fact. Things that are true but sound counterintuitive or difficult to believe are good.Another option is to start with your ending. This can help build suspense and make your reader curious to know how you’ll reach your shocking conclusion.If appropriate, add a personal touch with a real-life anecdote. Start by telling a short story about an experience you’ve had. Then, tie it into the premise of your post.Ask a question. This works well with how-to posts. Start with a question you know your audience wants to know about. Then, explain how you’ll answer it.Not literally. We mean start with a cliffhanger. Build suspense, then stop right when you’re about to explain what happened. Then, in the body of your post, work your way back to the beginning.Controversial posts can get you a lot of attention. However, you need to get your tone right straight away. The goal is to catch your audience’s attention with something they might disagree with. Then, gently lead the toward what you think is a better conclusion. Stand behind your convictions, but be careful not to be condescending, insulting, or unnecessarily abrasive.Ideally, your introduction should have set the stage for your body content to shine.Follow your outline to ensure your posts follows a logical flow from start to finish.Feel free to make changes, but if you frequently find yourself deviating from your outline, it could be your idea needs a little more polish before it’s ready.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Paragraphs in a blog post should be brief and to the point.Where appropriate, use single sentences to add punch behind statements (see above). Keep paragraphs down to two or three sentences for crispness and clarity (and avoid more than five at the most).This will keep your writing easy to read and skim through.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Give each section a descriptive heading.This is a good time to take the headings from your outline and turn them into something more attention-grabbing.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Here are some tips for writing sub-headings:Beneath each heading, you should have several sub-points that support the section’s theme or idea.Take each bullet point you put beneath each heading in your outline. Then, add a few paragraphs on each one in the appropriate section. If you get on a roll and uncover more relevant information, add it into your post.Summary: Let’s pull this all together to ensure you’re equipped to write awesome body content for your blog post.This simple yet effective process will ensure your post follows a logical structure.Make sure your section headings follow a logical hierarchy by using proper heading tags. Use only one H1 tag per page (WordPress generally makes post headlines and H1, or “Heading 1”).Then, make each sub-heading an H2, and subsequent sub-headings beneath those with H3, H4, H5, and H6 tags.In WordPress, use the dropdown menu under “Paragraph” to format your headings.It’s important links to other posts related to your topic.Links help readers find more information about your topic, help show where you’re finding your information, and increase the odds other sites will link back to you (and send traffic your way).[Tweet “Are you linking to other content inside of your posts? #blogging” ]Links also help search engines determine what your post is about by drawing associations between linked content.Here are a few additional points to remember about links:Remember the keyword research we did earlier? Make sure you’re including your primary keyword (along with other variations of that keyword phrase) throughout your blog post.Don’t go overboard and stick keywords wherever possible. Instead, just make sure they’re present. This will help send a stronger signal to search engines to help your post rank in organic search.A good conclusion should tie your blog post together.At the most basic level, your conclusion should do the following:That’s it. However, if you want to make your conclusion more helpful, consider taking these steps:Recommended Reading: How To Write A Blog Post: Your 5-Point Checklist To Rock A Perfect PostHere are some tips to add value to your blog writing process.If your goal is to write a comprehensive blog post, then the best length is however long it takes to say everything you need to about your topic. While studies show posts around 1,500 words rank best in search engines, your post might be dramatically longer than that if you’re really going all-in on going in-depth. On the flip side, it could be shorter too, depending on how long it takes to exhaust your topic.Forget words counts. Focus on being thorough instead.If you tell readers to do something, but don’t follow through on instructing them how to do it, they might leave your blog feeling frustrated. This a common and self-defeating trap for how-to blogs.That’s why it’s important to give your reader all the information they need to perform a given task, or develop a complete understanding of your topic.Here are a few tips to keep in mind if you write how-to content:Are you simply rehashing other people’s content? If so, step back and think what you can do differently than your competition.Take a look at some other posts on your topic and ask yourself these questions:Once you’ve answered these questions, you’ll have a clear picture of how to make your blog post unique.Write what you really believe. Don’t put anything out there you don’t think you or your company can stand behind. You’ll be more confident about what you write.Authenticity isn’t something you can fake and it’s not something you can leverage for status. All it takes is writing what you believe to be true, and being willing to defend it in the court of public opinion.That’s it.Surly Brewing, an excellent craft brewery in Minneapolis, follows the philosophy that “beer for everyone is beer for no one.” They know who their customers are, and they don’t try to make anyone else happy. As a result, they’re one of the most well-respected breweries in the Twin Cities.Marketers and bloggers can follow a similar approach to become a real topical authority.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Follow these guidelines:Your title tag and meta description are what appear in search engine results. They’re the first thing people will see before visiting your post through a search.Here’s how to write strong title tags and meta descriptions:It’s hard to read long blog posts with nothing but walls of text. They also look … well, pretty boring.While this is a post about the writing process for blog posts, let’s touch on a few points about graphics and images.If you work with a designer, this is the point in the process where they’ll work their magic. Here are some tips to make this process easier:However, if you’re working alone and don’t have design skills, you’re not out of luck. Try some of these ideas:You now have no excuses for not including some visual content in your posts.Good writing is often the product of good editing. It’s an essential element of any blog writing process.Your first (or even second or third drafts) aren’t always going to be golden right away. That’s assuming you even have time to write multiple drafts.It’s important, however, to ensure that everything you write is looked over before it’s published. While it’s always possible to edit mistakes or patch up omissions later (thanks to the Internet), it’s better to get things right the first time. If you want to be seen as an authority, then your work needs to be polished and presentable.Notice we said “polished” and “presentable.” We didn’t say “perfect.”That’s because chasing perfection is an unattainable goal. There are always going to be things you want to change or things you think you could have done better. Use those moments of reflection as learning opportunities. Then, improve the next post you work on. That’s how you get better while still getting things done.If you have the benefit of working with an editor, consider yourself fortunate. Having someone on your team who can help elevate your standards for quality is extremely valuable for creating top-notch content.If you’re writing your post for another blog as a freelancer or guest blogger, then knowing how to work with an editor will be extra crucial to your success.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Here are some tips to get the most from your writer-editor relationship:If you don’t have an editor, don’t worry. There are plenty of ways to edit your own work. Even if you do have an editor on your team, you should still know how to self-edit too.Follow these tips:Click To Tweet

Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Congratulations on making it to the end of this post!We’ve covered a lot of ground. Here’s a brief recap:Here’s one last takeaway we’ll leave you with: writing processes and routines are as diverse as writers themselves.Haruki Murakami gets up at 4 am every day to write. Kurt Vonnegut swam to build the mental and physical endurance to write daily. Khaled Hosseini never writes an outline. You can bet that every writer, blogger, and content marketing thought leader you admire has some similar creative quirks.The point is that everyone has their own approach to their work. That includes you.This post is a framework for creating above-average blog posts; the kinds of posts that will establish you as an authority with the most comprehensive content anywhere in your niche. Ultimately though, you’ll have to determine what works best for yourself. Feel free to change up the order of the steps in this post and create your own blog writing process. You can omit the parts that don’t fit your needs, and tweak the parts that do.Now go out there and share your expertise with the world!Click To Tweet

Your CoSchedule social media calendar now automatically uses the science behind best times to help you easily schedule social messages to reach more followers on your social networks.…and you don’t even have to read this post to get smarter about when to share on all of your social networks.Let me repeat that: Save yourself from doing the homework of figuring out the best times to share social messages. Use the all-new best time scheduling feature in CoSchedule to put this science on autopilot for your posting schedule:
Alright, for those of you who’d like to try this the more manual way, read on!Find Your Best Time To Post:After digging around the Internet a bit and analyzing our own data here at CoSchedule, I compiled some research from within the past year and more recently, breaking it up into more palatable chunks of information. I’ll be referencing several sources in this blog post, including:In addition, these are a few bonus sources that may be slightly older than a year:Let’s get to it.Did you know that Arizona doesn’t practice daylight savings time?It’s timing nuances like these that make finding the perfect times to post even harder. Before we delve into the best times to post on social media, let’s take a look at the best time zones.50% of the U.S. population is in the Eastern Time Zone, and the Eastern and Central combined represent almost 80% of the U.S. population.In theory, the Eastern or Central timezone would be the best time to base off for a United States audience to reach the most people through your social media shares.Click To Tweet

Engagement is about 3.5% lower on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. And people seem to be happier on Friday (small wonder), so funny or upbeat content will fit right in to that “happiness index.”According to Patel, early afternoon is the optimal time to post on Facebook. 1 p.m. will get you the most shares, while 3 p.m. will get you the most clicks. Anytime between 9 a.m.–7 p.m. will always be better than content shared outside of that window.Elle & Co.: The best days to publish on Facebook are Saturday and Sunday with the peak times at 1 p.m. on those days. These posts get 32% more engagement than workweek posts. According to Elle & Co, the best time to post on Facebook is between 1–3 p.m.SurePayroll: Wednesday at 3 p.m. is the best day to post on Facebook.

Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?As you can see, not everyone agrees as to the best timing for social posts, and when they do, it’s often because they’re referring to the same source. Even using data doesn’t provide a perfect answer, because it doesn’t take into account:So, putting this data to work for you in an attempt to find optimal social media posting time involves four possible outcomes:You might decide to use one of the sources listed in this post and stick to what they found. Consistency in approach has its benefits; certainly your audience gets used to what to expect.However, you may not see the success you could. Maybe you picked the wrong one, or are limiting yourself too much.You could use a broad swath of ideal posting times, mixing together the days and times of several of the data sources in the hopes of finding a fit by covering a wider range. For those of you wanting to do this, check out the summary that combined the results of the data covered.This approach might work, but you’ll have more ground to cover and more work to do in order to create and publish posts to cover larger blocks of time.By this, you might start with one set of research, stick to it, measure it, and note the results. Then adjust that with different days and times, and do the same measurement and data recording.In other words, test it out. See which one works for you. Not every industry is the same. Patel even noted, for example, that the fashion industry sees better success on Pinterest with a slightly different approach.The data from this post is built right into your best time scheduling feature in CoSchedule. The timing best practices will help you reach more followers, get more reshares, and grow traffic to your blog—all while putting this data into use on autopilot.You read that right—you can reap the benefits from everything you just learned without actually having to remember it all.

							Content marketing enthusiast, brand advocate, and blogger. I love new ideas, strategy, and continually learning how to work more efficiently.Everyone knows what hashtags are. However, not everyone knows how to use hashtags well. Be a hashtag expert and increase your social media reach here.What if we said 77% of you reading this post could get 192% more traffic by following this social media posting schedule? This post will show you how.I was thinking exactly about it this morning, Julie.
I did some changes in my planning that already granted me some results, but I have a feeling that there is more.
I think I will print this post and hang on my walk to brainstorm about it.
Thank you so much for putting all this information together. I wouldn’t know where to start without the tips you guys share here.Hey @debbierodrigues:disqus, I’m glad you found this stuff useful. I think some of the most interesting data in the post, when you read in detail, is simply the dead zones when posting gets the least amount of interaction. That’s even another way to think about this!Good luck, and let us know if sharing at specific times impacts your goals!Hey there! First of all, I love your work guys! Pretty freaking amazing how you put soooo much effort into the articles, so, Congrats!
Second, almost all of the statistics refer to US wich is a bit … well, I don’t want to name names :D
So my question is, how do you apply this data for the rest of the world? Asia, Europe? Does this data work for specific countries as well (outside of US obviously)?
Im in Romania for an instance, and I am not sure how to make use of the information….Thank you and keep rocking!Hey @EugenCPopa:disqus, I hear you. The studies we were able to find all targeted data within the United States. I will say that one of these sources went into really great depth in regards to Twitter, and I’d suggest reading much further into that for your Romanian audience: https://blog.bufferapp.com/best-time-to-tweet-researchAgain, while that post targets Twitter only, there is a wealth of knowledge there that can help you choose the best times to tweet. If we decide to conduct our own study of social media use from CoSchedule data, you can bet that we’ll include information from users around the world.Thanks for the compliments, for reading, and for being a CoSchedule fan, Eugen! We appreciate it!Pleasure is all mine!
Thank you.
PS: I am considering starting a content marketing source website in romanian. What is your policy on translating your work?
Thank you.Hey Eugen, that’s an interesting question. If you’re talking about syndication, please contact me directly at nathan [at] coschedule.com. Thanks!Wow, what a comprehensive review. I will be adjusting my Facebook posts of my paintings, posts and cartoons accordingly! Thanks!Hey @johnpatrickweiss:disqus, thanks so much for reading, and good luck! I’d love for you to check in a bit later after you’ve tested out these times to give us some of your advice. Have fun!Nathan- So I experimented with a Sunday evening post promoting a Sunday blog post I released. I also sent out my blog newsletter on a Sunday evening. Reader responses increased. Very interesting! I’ll be experimenting further, but so far your advice has been quite beneficial! Thanks.Wow, John, that’s great news! Sundays are an interesting time, I think, because they aren’t a typical day to publish posts and share them (not normal business hours). That’s all speculation, of course! I’m super happy to hear about your success!Nathan- I think my audience likes to relax with Facebook on weekend evenings. My results are limited and anecdotal, but still interesting. Thanks!OMG. Within one day of a single question and a whole, fully complete post about when to post. Thank you so much for this. You have saved me a lot of time. Really appreciate this. :)Haha, @Helperer:disqus, not a problem! I’m super glad you’ve found some information here to help you post on social media at the best times. Good luck!Awesome information! thank you! I was wondering if these times would be fairly consistent across different countries and time zones.  so for example here in Australia would our Australian audiences be on a similar ‘schedule’ (for want of a better word).  CheersHey there @invintagedmiss:disqus, that is an excellent question. Nearly all of the studies we analyzed—more like, could find information on—were indeed based on the US market. That said, I do think the data would hold true if you start thinking about the times when people use the networks (on breaks/before and after work).If I were in your shoes, I’d test it out and look at the data for yourself. There really isn’t anything to lose!Thanks for reading!I think I agree, we humans are creatures of ritual the world over and it makes perfect sense that people might, for example, be checking Twitter for quick, easily absorbed bursts of information on their commute home at 5pm regardless of where that ‘5pm’ is happening in the world… If that makes sense.  Thank you for replying! Thank you thank you for this! Finally someone who actually addresses timezones! Hey @marianney5:disqus, I’m glad you enjoyed the read! I’d say there is definitely some testing you can do yourself, too, to know what works. You may want to check out some of those tools listed in the post to see how your own posts are performing on certain social networks.Anyway, thanks for reading, and gooood luck!I do need to do that, just one of those things on the list that keeps getting pushed down ;) Thanks again Nathan.What a wonderful post! Thank you so much for this. I’ll be changing my social media posting times and see what happens!One word for this post “EPIC.” So much work and effort, and incredibly valuable. I love how you choose to not just create amazing content, but also reference other places where I can find it as well. For me this puts you on top of the list to go to first. You realize that savvy people are going to search several sources for the information they need, and by providing more sources you are making their lives easier.  A huge thank you!awesome post!Thanks for reading, Max! What times work best for you?Amazing work and very comprehensive information. Good stuff !Thanks so much, Lincoln! Happy to help!But teens are different again. Would be nice to see this breakdown. Hey @tarynbashford:disqus, I’d love to answer your question. Could you elaborate? Just wondering what you mean exactly.I mean these are the breakdowns of best times to post for adults, not teens. Would be good to know the difference. Teens are online at different times, I’m supposing.Hi there, Nathan Ellering!

When I asked Nicole how she gets more followers on Pinterest, this was her very first piece of advice:The general consensus seems to be Pin really great content that you love, and your followers will, too.That’s an awesome place to start.

											While your Pins are likely some of the first things potential followers see from your brand, Neil Patel notes it’s super important to optimize your Pinterest profile to help you get more followers.This is likely due to the halo effect, which is the psychology behind first impressions and physical attractiveness—something super important for the visual audience who loves Pinterest. In its most essential form, the halo effect suggests that when people have a positive experience with you, they’re more likely to expect positive experiences in the future.Whoa! So if you make a good first impression, doesn’t it make sense that you could get more followers because they’ll expect favorable outcomes in the future?So filling out your profile helps potential followers see you’re not a fly-by-night Pinner while giving you the chance to share information about your blog, brand, and your other social networks.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?While there are a lot of different fields to look into while fleshing out your Pinterest profile, here are the ones that will make a difference for getting more followers. Go to Settings to get started:Start with your Business Account Basics and slide the Search privacy button to No. This way, Pinterest will allow search engines to crawl the content you Pin which could help you get more visibility in image searches with popular search engines like Google.Help Pinners find your content through search engines by changing your Search privacy setting to No.Then, in the Profile area, fill in your Business Name and Location.The Website field is one of the most important things Pinterest uses to verify your site, which will boost your credibility via the halo effect.You can also connect your other social networks directly into Pinterest. Mitt Ray, a Pinterest expert, took to Social Media Examiner to explain that this simple practice can “attract your Facebook and Twitter friends and followers to your Pinterest account.”Simply sign in to your company’s Twitter handle. Then slide the Log in button to Yes. You can also connect to Facebook and Google+, but since those accounts are typically associated with a single person and not a business page, your Pinterest followers will be directed to your personal profiles.Connect your social profiles like your company’s Twitter handle to your Pinterest account.When you connect your social profiles, you’ll get the added bonus of having them appear in your Pinterest profile, which is a great way to offer your Pinterest followers the opportunity to follow you on other networks, too.When you connect your Twitter handle (or Facebook and Google+ profiles), the icon will show up in your Pinterest profile to help you get more followers.Nicole suggests having Pin it and follow prompts on your site to help convert the traffic you get into Pinners and followers.For example, Social Media Examiner uses the Pinterest follow prompt on their blog:Social Media Examiner uses the Pinterest follower button to convert blog visitors into Pinterest followers.And when you click on that button, an appealing window opens from Pinterest to help you convert your visitors into Pinterest followers:This is what your followers will see when you add the Pinterest follow button to your blog.Getting that follow button—and the Pin It button—is easy. When you’re on your home page, click the gear icon and select Make a widget.Navigate to your Pinterest home page, then select the gear icon to make a follow widget.Then, in the popup, click Learn More.Click Learn More in the widget popup.Now you can create Pin It buttons for specific blog posts and also grab a follow button you can embed in your theme.Create a follow button by entering in your Pinterest URL and embedding the code on your blog.Recommended Reading:This idea is an extension of what you just learned about the Pin It and follow buttons but relates much more directly to your blog posts.Pinterest now makes it easy to embed Pins and board previews right into your posts to help you get more followers from your blog visitors. Follow the same instructions from the prior step, and embed your Pinterest content like this:You should probably hit that follow button. Come on, you know you want to! ;)When we recently embedded a board like that into a blog post, we received a 640% boost in Pinterest followers that week.Some of your followers on other social networks may also like to follow you on Pinterest. It is definitely some people’s preferred discover tool, as Nicole pointed out to me.And it turns out, Pinterest is smart enough to help you share your Pins and boards on your other social networks easily.Share your Pins to followers on other networks to encourage them to follow you on Pinterest.You can use that functionality to share your Pins with your Twitter and Facebook followers to encourage them to follow you on Pinterest, too.Advertising isn’t very effective because it talks to your audience, not with your audience.Communication is different than mass marketing because it is a real conversation between people and isn’t one-sided. That’s how Pinners demand participation. And since that’s the case, it’s a great lesson to keep in mind as you try to get more followers on Pinterest.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Nicole says:Don’t be spammy. Pin at least 50/50 ratio of other content to your own. Treat Pinterest like its own entity, so get creative and CURATE.And that says a lot. Pinterest is an information discovery engine: Like a social site fused with a search engine. Pinterest feeds on curation, and Pinners demand conformity to the culture for its participants.Still other Pinterest experts suggest Repinning even more content by following the Pareto principle of 80% Repins to 20% of your own original Pins.Regardless of your approach, here are the major reasons why Repinning will help you get more followers:As Aaron Lee explains, “Following 5 to 10 people a day can make a huge difference compared to waiting for people to follow you.”That makes sense, especially since you know Pinterest relies on participation—and especially at first, you might have to make the first move to grow your following.Find Pinners to follow who have already shared your content by using this query: https://www.pinterest.com/source/YourDomain.com/. These Pinners would all make for great folks for CoSchedule to follow on Pinterest.Just click through to see those Pinners’ profiles and follow them.Nicole says:Make sure that you trust the source you’re Pinning from. If it’s spammy or not legit, you can be flagged as spam and land in Pinterest jail. So watch who you follow because spammers are rampant there, and only Repin from trusted sources.So how can you tell if a potential person you’d like to follow isn’t that great? Spam accounts might look a little like this where they share the same things over and over:You can learn a lot from Pinterest Analytics including:The Activity tab in your Pinterest Analytics is probably the best place to start to find new potential followers. Simply scroll through to find the Pinners who gave you your top Pin impressions, and the boards that were most popular for your content.Pinterest Analytics can help you find popular boards from Pinners who share your content, which can help you find new followers.With that information, you can find the Pinners who created those boards—and those who follow them—to start building your community.You can learn a lot from the Pinners who follow the popular boards that share your content.Everyone seems to have their favorite social networks, so why not reach out to your existing friends to see if they’d also like to connect with you on Pinterest? It turns out, Pinterest thought that was a pretty good idea and created a Find Friends feature right in the tool itself.Since you’ve already connected your other social profiles like Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ into Pinterest, just navigate from your Pinterest profile to the Find Friends page.Navigate to the Find Friends feature from your Pinterest profile.From here, you can follow the people you already know from your other networks. Mitt Ray elaborates on this tactic on Social Media Examiner, “As you follow people you already have relationships with, they’ll be very likely to follow you back.”Use Pinterest’s Find Friends feature to follow people who already know, like, and trust you. That will encourage them to follow you on Pinterest.When content marketer Matthew Barby decided to start a food blog from absolutely nothing, he wrote about his experience getting his initial followers. One tactic that worked for him involved researching his top competition and following the boards of his competitors’ followers.Matthew walks through those steps:This process, combined with solid content strategy, helped Matthew get an initial 515 Pinterest followers for a very competitive niche. The best part is that you can follow his advice and experience similar results.Here’s another Pinterest tip from Nicole:Get into GREAT group boards, but don’t go crazy with Pinning. When people follow those boards, they see your content, which could influence more shares. You want to find group boards that have high followers and relatively low contributors.When you join a group board, you will instantly have access to more followers—to every Pinner who already follows that group board. Seems like great advice, so how can you find group boards that are right for you to contribute to?Start with PinGroupie. It’s a database site dedicated to helping Pinners find group boards. You can sort tons of boards by category, then number of followers to narrow the group boards to that of your niche that have a larger following with fewer contributors.PinGroupie will help you find group boards to grow your following on Pinterest.Group boards are especially helpful for getting more followers because when a Pinner chooses to “Follow all” of the boards from the creator, they also subscribe to receiving Pins from you through that group board.While existing group boards are a great way to tap into the leg work someone else has done to grow their Pinterest following, you can start a group board yourself and invite Pinners you already respect to join you.Just create a new board by hitting the + Create a board button, then invite other Pinners to contribute to your board.Creating a new group board will help you tap into the followers your friends already have.Now, most group boards have ground rules and structure. A good place to start is by building the board out with a following using all of the advice you’ve learned from this post, define your rules for participation, then invite others to join you once they can see the benefits of Pinning with you are worth it.Here are a few things to consider as you come up with your group board contribution guidelines:Write your guidelines up briefly, then add a note into your board description on how people can contact you to join.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Let’s start this off by acknowledging that Pinterest is a bit wary of contests in general because marketers have abused them in the past. To run a successful contest and not end up in “Pinterest Jail” as Nicole calls it, follow their acceptable use policy:If you’re thinking of hosting a Pinterest contest, know the rules first.While that sounds like a lot of things that you shouldn’t do, that leaves you with a few creative ways that focus on real engagement (which is, after all, what your potential followers really like anyway):However, a contest like this can help you increase your engagement and build a community that will inevitably turn participants into followers.You can start with Popular Pins, a category that Pinterest creates with Pins that get a lot of engagement. Find a couple that you have experience with, and comment on them to share your perspective.As Mitt Ray notes, you’re looking for more than easy comments like “Nice Pin.” Provide your take on the Pin, additional advice it’s missing, or takeaways you’ve learned on that topic. Mitt says that this tactic can help you increase your visibility—and the potential of earning new followers—because you’re commenting on the most popular content on Pinterest.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?While that sounds smart, another very targeted way to reach more people is to comment on Pins from those who’ve already shared your content. Build trust with people who already know who you are by showing them the real personality behind your blog or brand.Here’s a reminder on how to find those folks: Check your Pinterest Analytics domain tab or search this query for your domain: https://www.pinterest.com/source/YourDomain.com/.Consider mentions an extension of commenting and Repinning.Mention Pinners to spark a conversation.You can use mentions in Pin descriptions and in comments, which “can be a great way to attract their attention and get them to follow you.”An easy tactic is to ask someone a question via a mention to spark up a conversation. The more interaction, the more likely they’ll be to follow you.Remember when you read that Pinterest is a fusion between social and search engines? That applies into the names and descriptions you use in your boards to help potential followers find your Pins.Rebekah Radice suggests that Pinterest boards should be direct, descriptive, and personal to help you get more followers. And a few of the defining elements that make good boards stand out to new followers are solid cover images, keyword rich names and descriptions, and a niche focus.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Let’s explore each of those areas to help you get more followers by optimizing your boards:iFabbo, a resource for fashion bloggers, knows a thing or two about catching people’s attention.They offer some simple advice for choosing your cover images to make your boards stand out:You can create an image specifically for your board cover following those guidelines. First, Pin the image you’d like as your cover. Then go to your Pinterest profile, hit Edit on your board, then on Cover, hit the Change button. You can choose any Pin you’d like as your cover image.Your blog likely has a content core: The magical place where you strategize what you want to say with what your audience wants to know. The process looks a little like this:Use the words your audience uses to describe that niche in your board descriptions.When you defined your target niche, you likely also found several sub-topics that you could cover. Use those topics in your board names to help Pinners find your content.Some kinds of content perform significantly better than others on Pinterest. So it makes sense, then, to use the experience from others to improve your own Pins:Nicole explains the art behind designing images and graphics for Pinterest:Make sure you are using vertical collage-type Pins, which perform much better on average than regular verticals because they take up more space on a user’s screen. And always, always, always consider how it looks on mobile. Small and ugly text on photos can end up being totally unreadable on a mobile device. And a lot of people are mobile pinning.And, of course, Nicole is right. 75% of Pinterest’s users rock Pinterest on their mobile devices. That means if you don’t consider mobile in your design, you’re neglecting how three-fourths of your followers prefer to experience your content.You’ve already found keywords for your blog posts that you’re Pinning. Use those same keywords in your Pin descriptions to help potential followers find your content.Target keywords in your Pin descriptions to help potential followers find your content.Pinners are more active on certain days and times than others. When we analyzed 10 studies to find the best times to post on social media, the data told us:That’s the sweeping general answer. You can Pin a lot every day, so what are really the best times when your audience is using Pinterest? After all, you are probably trying to attract new followers that are similar to your existing fans, so sharing at the peak times when they’re online could help you get more followers.So grab this Google Analytics custom report to find the best day to Pin based on your own audience (the report is also available in your kit that complements this post). When you use the report, you’ll see a list of networks. Click through on Pinterest.Choose Pinterest from the list in your Google Analytics custom report to see the best day when you get traffic from Pinterest.Now you’ll see the list of days of the week when you typically get the most traffic from Pinterest.These are the days of the week when you get the most traffic from Pinterest. So these are the days when your followers are most active.You can drill in even further to find the specific best time to Pin to Pinterest on any day of the week.This is the best time of day to get traffic from Pinterest specifically for the day of the week you just selected.Or use this second Google Analytics custom report if you’re looking for a bit more general information just on the best time to Pin when you typically get the most traffic—omitting days (this report is also in your kit).Just like the other report, click through on Pinterest and you’ll see the times when you typically get the most traffic. 0 is midnight and 23 is 11 p.m.The Google Analytics custom report shows the times when you get the most traffic from Pinterest. Use this to gauge when your followers are most active and schedule your Pins accordingly.How many times to Pin a day? It’s a good question because if you Pin too little, there really isn’t a reason to follow you, while if you Pin too much, you just get annoying.So is there a magical number of times to Pin a day to help you get more Pinterest followers?That was the question I explored recently analyzing 10 different studies to find a recommended minimum, maximum, and a solid starting point for how often to Pin.Here’s what that research uncovered:Pinterest is a high volume sharing community—so error on the side of more engagement than less.With her more than 1.6 million followers on Pinterest, Kim Vij knows a thing or two about building an audience. She says:It’s probably the quickest ways to lose followers if all you do is pin tons of pins at the same time and focus most on you and your most recent post.Mitt Ray agrees with Kim, saying:Don’t share everything at once: Instead of clouding your followers’ feeds with your pins all at once, time your pins to go out at regular intervals.So, what’s the best approach?Here’s an example of what your daily Pin schedule could look like to help you visualize your work:By this point, you’re pretty much a follower-generating machine. You know how to:Now go build an audience that’ll help you grow your blog. You’ve got this!Click To Tweet

They can help increase the visibility of your messages and boost your social shares. When used inappropriately, however, they can negatively impact your credibility on social media. This can have the inverse effect of decreasing your social activity.The issue is more complicated when we look at hashtag used beyond Twitter, where they’re most popular.Let’s take a moment to clear up some confusion.Click To Tweet

											Twitter first introduced hashtags to the social media world in 2007. They’ve been confusing marketers and media professionals ever since.This video provides a decent historical rundown of hashtag history (if you can bear with it for more than 30 seconds):In practice, hashtags are used to categorize social media content into easily navigable lists. By including the #[INSERT KEYWORD] in a tweet, it then becomes visible inline with other posts using that same hashtag.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Sometimes, the best way to use hashtags is to find ones that already exist.Before you can get started, though, you need to actually find those hashtags. Fortunately, there are a number of tools out there to help with this process.Let’s take a look at a handful of useful options:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?What The Trend is a tool that can help you find the top hashtags from the last 30 days. You can get new viewers by finding creative hashtags that fit your content and are recently trending.Twitonomy can help you find personalized hashtags that revolve around the content you post on your Twitter accounts. It can also show you the most powerful influencers using a given hashtag, as well as who’s engaging the most.You’ll need a premium to unlock this tool’s most useful functionality, but fortunately, it’s reasonably priced.RiteTag is a hashtag power tool for discovering hashtags. It also offers up-to-date usage data to show you how hashtags are performing in the real world. While the premium plans offer more functionality, the basic free plan still offers plenty of utility.In short, RiteTag is like a Swiss Army knife of deep hashtag research and tracking. This video provides a good run-down of what it can do:Hashtagify.me is another great tool for finding trending hashtags on Twitter. Plus, it also has an option to get email updates on trending hashtags as well. It offers free and premium plans for all sizes of companies, from individual users up to enterprise accounts.There is a list of what is currently popular and a link to all the related tweets on your main feed on the left hand side of your Twitter newsfeed.You can also use the search bar to find hashtags to know what folks are currently using. This is a great way to hone in on hashtags that are super relevant to the content you want to share.When you open the Instagram app, you should see a magnifying glass on your home screen:Here, you can browse trending hashtags:You can search hashtags in the Facebook search bar:While it may be helpful to monitor the trending topics that appear to the right of your News Feed, these are not necessarily hashtag-based.When you go to insert a hashtag in your post, Google+ proceeds to give you a list of top hashtags related to your post. This can be a useful means of finding more hashtags related to your post topic:Pinterest search supports hashtags as a tagging and discovery engine.When you search a hashtag, pins with similar keywords in the description will show up in the results (along with pins that have the same term in the URL, photo name, or product page tied to the Pin).Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?YouTube uses hashtags in comment sections. Try searching for videos related to the topic of your video to see which hashtags appear popular.Clicking on hashtags on YouTube used to bring you to a Google+ page with more related posts. However, they now bring you to a page within YouTube:
A better question might be, “Should I use hashtags on Facebook at all?”Data shows hashtags on Facebook do not help boost engagement. That means you might be better served by leaving hashtags off entirely. In one study, posts with hashtags received only .80% viral reach, while posts without hashtags had 1.30% viral reach.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Plus, Facebook doesn’t recognize hashtags in the search bar. The only way to find hashtags is to directly click on the hashtag in a post.Stick to one or two hashtags per post since that tends to grow engagement on your content by 21%. When you start using 3 or more hashtags per message, you lower engagement by almost 17%.Photos with 11+ hashtags seem to get the most interactions. However, they can also look like spam when they’re overdone.Master the hashtag like photographer Matthew Hodgeman. While he uses hashtags heavily, he keeps them relevant:Matthew tagged the area he was in, along with the topics that his audience would be interested in. That targeting got almost 20 more likes than the rest of his photos from that week.Pinterest hashtags lead to search results for the keyword in your hashtags. That means if you have a hashtag in your Pin description, your Pinners can click through to find similar content for those keywords, not necessarily only for that hashtag.There’s also no guarantee Pinterest will index the hashtags you choose to use.If you do decide to use hashtags on Pinterest, then less is more. There is evidence that Pinterest will even demote the value of your Pins that have too many hashtags. Furthermore, some say the best way to use hashtags on Pinterest is to use your own customized hashtags that people click to see your own related Pins instead of directing traffic to see a broader category around a topic.Google+ hashtags are automatically assigned to your posts. However, you can edit them, or add your own.Google+ lets you include them in your comments as well. This gives your posts more opportunity to be seen.Usually, a total 2 or 3 hashtags is a good target here.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?According to SproutSocial, hashtags on YouTube are most widely used in the comment section. You can use hashtags to categorize your content to be found by topic, using your keywords as the foundation for your hashtags.There are times when you might want to create your own hashtag. You might want one to  complement an event so attendees can track social posts. Or, you might have a unique marketing campaign that needs its own hashtag (rather than jumping on one that already exists).Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?In these cases, follow this advice:A good hashtag is:Strike a balance:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Instagram hashtags are often more geared toward topics or descriptions. However, Twitter hashtags tend to be more focused on a topic or conversation. Get familiar with how your specific audience uses hashtags on their networks. Then, participate in the conversation accordingly.It’s tempting to jump on every hot trending hashtag out there. However, it’s better to stick to using hashtags that fit your brand. Use some common sense and ask yourself if a hashtag actually fits your image, message, content, and audience. For example, if your brand primarily serves customers over 40, then using a hashtag heavy on youth slang will probably look awkward.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Running a promotion? What better way than to spread the word through hashtags. Here’s one example for National Walking Day:Twitter only allows you 140 characters, so if your hashtag takes up too much room, people won’t want to use it because it will take away from their content and links. By overcrowding your tweet, you’re going to lose attention, not grab it.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The same principle applies to other networks as well. Even on platforms where length isn’t a concern, staying memorable is (and in that case, the shorter and snappier they are, the better).#whenyouputmanywordstogether in a single hashtag, the letters can become all jumbled up and difficult to skim through.#ButIfYouCapitalize the first letter of each word, it’s easier to distinguish each word and read at a glance. Hashtags are not case sensitive, so when you combine multiple words together in your hashtag, distinguish them by capitalizing the first letter of each word.Twitter chats are online events centering an entire conversation around a hashtag. They’re a great way to build relationships with your audience, and encourage engagement with a branded hashtag.Some of these tips are basic. Some you may never have heard of. But one thing is clear: If you make these mistakes, you’ll miss out on the engagement you were hoping to get from your social messages. Use #SuperBowl not #super bowl. Your social networks will only recognize the first word. Don’t use punctuation marks, but you can use numbers as long as you complement them with a bit of text (like that #smmw16, for example).Your hashtags aren’t designed to tag your network’s users. So combining both a hashtag and an “at” symbol will only tag the person/user, and you won’t send a hashtag at all.#How #Annoying #Would #It #Be #To #Have #To #Go #Through #And #Read #Thirty #Hashtags #And #Try #To #Find #Out #What #It #Is #Saying.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?There are websites, brands, and individuals that use popular hashtags and just throw them in their social messages with no context, just for the sole purpose of helping other accounts to find them.This plan may seem to work in the short term, but just when Instagram did a complete clean out of any account that seemed to be linked with spam, these individuals lost hundreds of thousands of followers. Their hashtag plan completely backfired.Pizza brand DiGiorno Pizza made a huge mistake when they jumped on the viral hashtag #WhyIStayed. DiGiorno didn’t look up the context of the hashtag.#WhyIStayed pertained to people who were sharing their domestic violence stories to raise awareness after Ray Rice punched his then-financeè Janay Palmer. DiGiorno tweeted “#whyIstayed You had pizza”. Within a minute, the tweet had been deleted, but the damage had already been done.If there is a symbol or punctuation in or after the hashtag, you will break the hashtag. Grammar police beware. If you want to post #I’mback, your hashtag will break after the I. You can tell where your hashtag broke when the blue line turns into black text.Take a look at “#it’s” in this example of a Tweet scheduled with CoSchedule. The preview here shows that the apostrophe is breaking your hashtag.If there are letters or numbers before the hashtag, it will break it before it even starts. So if your hashtag is 123#abc, abc won’t link to a hashtag.If the hashtag is made up entirely of numbers, the hashtag will not hyperlink. But if you include letters with your numbers, the hashtag will work correctly. So #12345 won’t work. but #123abc will.Let’s take a look at some super successful hashtag strategies to inspire your own.Over the last few years, Jimmy Fallon has become a master of using hashtags to engage his audience. He even has a segment on his show every week where he asks his audience to submit their stories using his hashtags.Let’s check out a few:@jimmyfallon I once got a text from my mom where ""You're amazing"" autocorrected to ""You're adopted"" #momtexts— Stefen Colalillo (@StefenColalillo) October 2, 2013One year, I got the book ""He's Just Not That Into You"" from FIVE different people. Message received. #worstgiftever @jimmyfallon— Dani Dudek (@fancypantsLATX) December 10, 2013Direct quote: ""Can you tip me in cash, bro?  I think I'm getting fired in about 20 minutes.""  #myweirdwaiter— Kyle Molin (@kyle_molin) January 8, 201484% of people will share content because it makes them feel like they’re supporting a cause. This principle is what helped the #LikeAGirl campaign go viral.When Always created the campaign that asked girls and boys to do things “like a girl”, teens tended not take the message seriously. However, younger kids really took it to heart. The aim was to show that as kids get older you get, the world instills in them negative perceptions about how girls should act.The campaign was an overwhelming success. Since debuting in June 2014, this video has had more than 80 million views worldwide, which was helped in part by the #LikeAGirl hashtag that complemented the campaign:Here’s another great example from Esurance.Last year, they saved $1.5 million by buying air time for their commercial right after the Super Bowl was over. They promised to give away that cash to one person who included #EsuranceSave30 in a tweet. 2.39 million users tweeted with the hashtag, elevating awareness of the Esurance brand (for a lot less than the cost of traditional advertising): Hashtags can make or break your social media messages and engagement.It’s super important that you understand where, when, and how to use them. Now you have a bunch of tips to get you started in the right direction!Click To Tweet

							Ben is a Content Marketer at CoSchedule. His specialties include crafting long-form content, email marketing, SEO, and more. When he's not hard at work helping people do better marketing, he can be found playing bass guitar, drinking fine beer, and chasing his dog around the house.What if we said 77% of you reading this post could get 192% more traffic by following this social media posting schedule? This post will show you how.Do you know all the best times to post on social media? In this post, we've crunched the data from 16 studies to find the best times for each network.This was very informative. I have used hashtags mostly on instagram, funny how #kitten #cat gets lots of attention. Of course, they are pics of my critters so it fits. Curious about using hashtags within blogs, any ideas?
http://skincarsolutions.tuscanyskinspa.info@disqus_PuaVmqf4I6:disqus Now that I think about it I’m not sure. Let me look and I’ll try to get back to you with some data! Thank you for reading!Twitters own research shows that while hashtags increase engagement and reach, they actually significantly decrease clicks.One needs to really consider intention when crafting a message. Is your goal to have the most people see the message itself (not the item you’re actually linking to) or is it to drive people to a link? For the majority of businesses posting on social, the goal is to drive people to a link and thus they’d be better off leaving out the hashtag.@BenBrausen:disqus I totally agree, it’s amazing as a marketer everything you do should be with purpose and that is a great post. No matter how much data you have, and trust me I read a lot for this post, you need to be very mindful of what your personal goals are. Thanks for sharing!Hey Ben, I’d love to see that research if you could find the post and share it with us here.Hey Nathan, I wrote about it recently. The story has links to a number of Twitters own studies on how hashtags and mentions both increase reach but also decrease clicks. Because of this, Twitter recommends against including mentions or hashtags in paid promotions, as they distract from the main purpose which is getting users to click.http://benbrausen.com/social-media/twitter/get-more-clicks-by-dropping-the-mentions-and-hashtagsThanks for sharing Ben. It would be interesting to see data about the break-even point, i.e. when do you have enough followers gained to drop using hashtag. Because the way I see it, you need high reach to attract interest and followers, right?There’s certainly a point where reaching more people isn’t the main goal anymore. It’d be interesting to know how people decide they’ve found that point.For our main accounts, there has never been a focus on growing the following but rather increasing the engagement of the current following (we see growth through paid ads which bring in plenty without as much need to focus on follower growth as you would with purely organic).A study published this month by Ascend2, titled Social Media Marketing Trends Survey Summary Report, showed the most important social media marketing strategy objectives according to marketing professionals worldwide. Just 15% of respondents listed increasing audience size as a priority (same percentage as increasing search ranking), the lowest on the survey. The most, with 64%, listed increasing audience engagement, followed by increased brand awareness at 54% and increase lead generation at 41%.Based on the responses to the survey, it would seem most are more focused on the audience they currently have, rather than attracting a larger audience.Ben, that is super interesting data. I’ll have to take a look!Ben, just read your post as linked above. Interesting and raised some questions that I want to look into further. My initial reaction is to think that the difference is between using mentions and hashtags strategically when the focus is organic reach, and avoiding those for paid reach to targeted audiences. Perhaps worth exploring, and maybe even doing some further testing. Thank for your observations.Really awesome article and full of pratical, easily digestible tips. Thanks :-) #AwesomeContentHey Ryan, thanks for taking the time to read. #YoureAwesomeThanks for including “Don’t use hashtags if your account is private.” That is one of my biggest pet peeves!Hey Audrey, glad this resonated! Thanks for reading. :)Taylor, interesting and well done. Made some points that I had not seen in other articles about the same topic, so definitely added to the discussion. One thing that I have noticed is that sharing Instagram posts on Facebook seems to have increased the incidence of hashtags on Facebook.  The one place I do see them as useful on Facebook is when they are branded hashtags or contest hashtags. A well executed branded hashtag makes it very easy to create collections of posts.Awesome & useful post! FYI, looks like you’ve got a typo in your infographic: best practices #4 “memorable,” not “memoriable.” ;)Thanks for the catch!I second that. Thanks for calling this to our attention!Hey, your blog is not only informative but also impressive. I was not aware of value of hashtags that you have mentioned above.I will always keep in my mind your advice.

											The answer to this question is a little more complex and less obvious than what we expected to find.Marketer Rohit Bhargava is credited with coining the term back in 2006. According to Bhargava, we can define social media optimization (SMO) as:The concept behind SMO is simple: implement changes to optimize a site so that it is more easily linked to, more highly visible in social media searches on custom search engines (such as Technorati), and more frequently included in relevant posts on blogs, podcasts and vlogs.Using this definition, SMO is similar to search engine optimization, in the sense that your goal is to maximize visibility and traffic to your site or blog from social media. That sounds straightforward enough, but we also need to keep in mind that this definition is nearly ten years old.If SMO is anything like SEO, then we can expect that some of those tactics which were relevant a decade ago, may no longer be relevant today.Our questions led to more questions before we started to find some real answers. We’ll dig into optimizing your social channels in a bit, but there’s something else we need to touch on first.Recommended ReadingYou have a few social media channels set up for your blog or business. You’re posting content on a consistent basis (and you might even be using CoSchedule to help manage that process).There’s always more you can be doing to make sure you’re earning as much visibility on social media as possible (and we say that because we can always do more).Like with all things social media, once you stop moving, you start to sink. You have to keep active. Always crossing your T’s and dotting your I’s every single step of the way.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?More specifically, SMO is important because:Once you’ve read this post, you’ll be prepared to tackle the following goals:Most of these recommendations pertain to small changes you can make on your blog, website, and social media profiles. The focus here is on technical mechanics, rather than on the art and craft of creating content.Now, let’s get to work.The first place to start with social media optimization is directly on your blog and/or website. This entails that you have a handful of items in place to make sure your site or blog displays content attractively when shared on social media. You’ll also want to make sure it’s easy and intuitive for users to share your content as well.You’ll want to make sure your site or blog displays content attractively and is easy to share on social media.If your site or blog doesn’t have them already, it might be time to add social sharing buttons. While there is some debate over the best placement for social media buttons on blogs, or whether people actually use them, they do make it easier for users to share your content.Need a plugin to add social sharing buttons to your blog? Blog posts are inherently shareable on social media. If you didn’t think your post was worth sharing, you probably wouldn’t have written it in the first place.Static website pages are pages on your blog or website that are static (like an “About Us” or “service” page).It can be difficult to make static pages interesting enough for people to share. And that isn’t because they aren’t important. It’s because, there typically isn’t much on those pages that make folks want to like, share, tweet, or pin them.What’s the solution then?The solution is to add value to your static website pages with linkable content. That means adding valuable content that can easily be linked in social media posts. This provides something of value that people are likely to share with their followers.What can you add to your static pages to draw social media attention:Create content that adds value to a page and gives readers a reason to share it.You could even consider creating hub pages with a ton of downloadable content all in one place. Our own Resource Library is just one example of what this idea can look like in action.Adding a click-to-tweet button in your blog posts can help give your content an extra push on Twitter.Alternately, you can also use the awesome Click-To-Tweet WordPress plugin built by our very own team at CoSchedule. Here’s what they look like in action:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Adding Twitter Cards and Facebook Open Graph markup to your web pages and blog posts can help you control how they appear when they are shared by others online.Twitter Cards are simply a few lines of HTML that allow you to specify photos, videos, and other media that appear when a page is shared on Twitter.There are four different types of cards you can choose from:Here’s an example of what a Summary Card with a large image can look like:In short, Facebook open graph markup is code that is added to your blog or website to help control how pages and posts appear on Facebook when people share them. It lets you control the image, title, and description that appears when a URL is shared on the platform.Twitter Cards are easy to implement on WordPress sites using the Yoast SEO plugin.Follow these steps to set yours up:Install the Yoast plugin, if you haven’t already.Find Yoast SEO in the WordPress dashboard on the left-hand-side navigational bar.
Scroll down to Social and then select Twitter. Here, you can add Twitter card data to your site. You can also set it up to use a Summary Card or the Summary Cards with Large Images in your default option.Now that you’ve enabled the Twitter Card functionality, you’ll need to specify which data and images you want to appear.For this step, we’ll need to open the Facebook tab and fill out the Open Graph data. This information will be used when your home page is shared on both Facebook and Twitter, so you’re knocking out two birds with one stone here.Yoast also allows you to add Twitter cards to individual blog posts. Just scroll to the bottom of your blog post in WordPress, find the Yoast box (it should be easy to spot), and then click the button shown below to find social media options.
You’ll be brought to a screen where you can add or edit the Open Graph data for Facebook. You’ll also be able to create a card for Twitter here.That’s all it takes.Now that we know what social media optimization is, and we understand why it’s important, it’s time to get down to brass tacks and start implementing some tactics and best practices. Let’s get started with one social media platform (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, and Youtube) at a time.Let’s get your Facebook page looking its best. Even if you’ve already filled out your profile, there is always room for improvement.There’s more to having a good cover photo than just slapping something in there with your logo.Facebook gives you seven different call-to-action button options that you can use.These include:Here’s an example of what these call-to-action buttons can look like:See the signup button? It takes users straight to our homepage, where they can choose to sign up for a 14-day free trial with CoSchedule. (P.S. Do you see how we used the cover photo to point to the sign up button?)You could share a link to:To get the most from your cover photo:Don’t skimp on filling out your bio (or the rest of your profile).Being thorough in completing your profile can help your Facebook company page rank in the search results.If you have a business with a physical location, make sure the address and phone number on your Facebook page match your website.Also make sure your website or blog URL is correct.I know, these might really seem like minor details, but you’d be surprised how often these are omitted or left incorrect. Sometimes the devil is in the details and if you aren’t careful those small things will group together into something larger.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This is sometimes overlooked, but remember image captions offer another place to add a link. It’s a small detail, but it can help add a bit of traffic back to your blog or website. This goes for your cover photo too.Here’s an example from our Facebook page (and in case you missed it, yes, we really did give pizzas away! :)Video is growing in importance for content marketing, with YouTube dominating as the online video platform of choice. Facebook has taken steps to be more competitive as a place to find prime video content.For this reason, Facebook prioritizes and favors video posted directly into Facebook, versus video shared from YouTube (or somewhere else).To get the most reach from your video content on Facebook: Try posting video files directly into Facebook. Even if you usually share videos on YouTube, you still can (and should) like usual, but consider sharing that same video directly to Facebook.This is another great way to increase the reach of your Facebook video content.For tips on how to embed Facebook video into WordPress, check out this video tutorial:Here’s what an embedded video from Facebook could look like on your blog:// <![CDATA[
(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));
// ]]&gt;Do What You LoveWant to know what it’s like to work at one of the fastest growing startups in North Dakota? We’re building a product and a company that people love. Here’s how we do what we love and love what we do every day!http://coschedule.com/jobsPosted by CoSchedule on Tuesday, October 6, 2015There are a lot of ways to optimize Twitter as a traffic driver. Here are a few you can put into use right now.There’s an art to writing a good Twitter bio, and it isn’t easy to do in under 140 characters.Some things to keep in mind:Here’s the bio on the CoSchedule Twitter account. It’s nothing flashy, but it clearly communicates what our product does and why it’s beneficial.We also have a separate Twitter account that is focused on our blog. For this account, we’ve written a bio that accurately describes the topics our content covers.For proof that spending a little time on your bio can make a difference, here’s what came up when we did a Twitter profile search for “content calendar”.You likely know that hashtags are essential for helping content get found on Twitter. However, it’s important to use hashtags that people are actively using, and that are relevant to your content.Here are a few helpful tools for doing hashtag research:Again, this may seem like a no-brainer. However, it’s worth mentioning here that Google shows tweets in its search results.Therefore, ensuring that you’re posting links to relevant content you’ve created on a consistent basis can help you leverage Twitter and Google together to drive more referral traffic.
Work for a business with a company page on LinkedIn? Here are a couple tips to help draw attention to your profile.One great way to draw attention to your blog content on LinkedIn is to participate in groups.Now, we aren’t suggesting you join a bunch of groups and spam them with your blog posts.Rather, make yourself a valuable member of those groups by engaging in genuine discussion. Then, when you have something that can legitimately answer a question or be of use to the group, go ahead and share it.This video features some good tips on finding groups relevant to your niche:Be thorough in completing your entire profile for your business.Incorporate keywords in your company description. If you write a quality description of your company, it’s likely you’ll include keywords relevant to your business or blog naturally. However, it’s still a good idea to double check, and consider adding one or two phrases here and there at a minimum.Social Media Examiner’s LinkedIn page offers a good example of a well-written bio (with relevant keywords listed in the Specialties section):Google+ is often joked about as being a social media ghost town. However, it does have an active user base, and there are topics and niches with highly engaged audiences.Google+ conveniently offers a section for relevant links to other web properties.If you’re a solo blogger or freelance writer, you can even add links to websites you contribute to. Plus, you can include links to any other website you’d like, and give it a custom label (for example, a writing portfolio you might keep separate from your main blog).
While Facebook tends to reward shorter post copy, Google+ is just the opposite. Posts on G+ are treated almost like short blog posts, so feel free to write a few paragraphs if you need to.To make your posts easier to find and read, use Google+’s semi-secret text formatting options.Include keywords and structure your posts with bolded headers. It can help your posts appear in searches easier (both via Google search and internal searches on Google+).This Google+ cheat sheet from Moz shows you how to bold, underline, and strikethrough your text:If a user is logged into their Google account and follows your Google+ page, your G+ posts may appear in their search results. Sharing your content on Google+ will help attract more attention to your content (and help you take up more space in the search results).Pinterest is interesting from a social media optimization standpoint. It’s a highly visual platform, but also one that comes with some unique SEO considerations. Plus, did you know you can now schedule Pins to Pinterest from CoSchedule?Make sure your Pinterest profile is set to public so search engines can find it (and potentially rank your posts in relevant search results). To do this, simply go into your account settings and switch Search Privacy to “No.” If you’d like to keep certain boards private without blocking your entire profile to search engines, however, you can. Here’s how:1 ) Go to the board you’d like to set to private and click the Edit Board button:2 ) Then, set that board to Secret:
Simple as that!Pins are also indexed within the site itself so people can find content through the internal search bar.SEO tips to help your boards and Pins get found:These are just a few tips to get you started. If you’re ready to take a deeper dive, this guide to Pinterest SEO is a great resource.Adding a Pinterest widget to your blog or website can help draw more attention to your boards. Here’s an example of a board I made for demonstration purposes (featuring a food product I hold dear to my heart).
To create a Pinterest widget, first click here:Then, click Make A Widget:
 Then snag the code and paste it into your post.
 YouTube is considered the second-biggest search engine on the Web (even ahead of Bing and Yahoo). Make sure your YouTube videos rank well in search results and drive maximum traffic to your site or blog by following these tips.Keywords included in your video descriptions help YouTube (and Google) understand what your video is about.Think about including a full audio transcription in addition to a simple introduction (about a paragraph or two long). If you don’t have time to transcribe audio yourself, consider using a service like Rev.Have you ever watched a YouTube video and noticed a window with a link pop up? Those are annotation links, and they’re invaluable for driving traffic from YouTube back to your blog or website.For more information on what these look like and how to implement them, watch this video:For more information, you can also follow the steps listed in Google’s official support documentation for implementing annotation links. Instagram doesn’t have a ton of functionality outside of its mobile app. However, we do have one tip that can help increase the visibility of your profile while making your blog posts more visually appealing.If you’d like to share an Instagram post on WordPress, all you need to do is copy the embed link and paste it straight into your blog post wherever you want the image to show up.Find an image on Instagram using a desktop browser. Here’s a screenshot of some image examples. See the Tootsie Rolls? That was one of our images.Let’s say we want to paste the Tootsie Roll treat bag into this very blog post. Easy enough. We’ll just click that image, which will appear like this:Click the three dots where the blue arrow is pointing and grab the embed code:Finally, copy the code that appears and paste it directly into WordPress (using the Text view, rather than Visual). It’ll look like this below:I love working at #CoSchedule! They are so sweet!

Pretty cool, huh? This can help add visual flair to your blog while extending the reach and visibility of your Instagram content.A lot of the tips and tactics that we’ve covered here might seem really small or only mildly consequential on their own.

However, not everyone knows how to use hashtags well. Be a hashtag expert and increase your social media reach here.What if we said 77% of you reading this post could get 192% more traffic by following this social media posting schedule? This post will show you how.I just started to use social media heavily to promote my contents. I found this social media optimization tips and tricks valuable. I will implement some of this tricks on my blog and see what result they will bring. Thanks.Glad to hear you’ll be putting some of this info to use. Let us know how you do!Love how complete this is! and love that  you touch on Pinterest SEO as folks do not talk about probably the best part of Pinterest which is your pins and boards can be found in Google which is fantastic for service based businesses wanting to get found in their local market. I teach Pinterest SEO and glad you bring up important points here and great link to wishpond’s tips too. One quick tip for local SEO is to name boards with town names instead of biz name so Myrtle Beach Wedding Photographer instead of Feuza Reis Studios is what I do. and of course rich text in pin description. I love the FB embed video tip, will try that out thank you.I absolutely agree that Pinterest’s benefits for SEO really don’t get talked about enough. Optimizing for local searches with Pinterest is something I hadn’t even thought of at all, so thanks for adding that tip as well.ah you are welcome, yes especially for Google Images and if searcher is closer to you location wise your pin and board if optimized can show up up and now Google Image Search just launched new color filters which reminds me of the Pinterest Search Results when it adds the suggestion results etcGREAT article Ben! Thanks for adding Social Warfare to the list of sharing plugins! It may be helpful to note that It also does easy Click-to-Tweets (much like the one by Today Made) and handles the Open Graph customization (like Yoast) and Twitter Large Summary Cards. :DAh, we completely missed the boat on calling out Social Warfare’s click-to-tweet and Open Graph functionality! We always want to inform our readers about more options for getting things done, so thanks for calling that out here (and thanks for reading too).No problem Ben! One of our goals was to eliminate the need for multiple plugins and I was using Today Made’s Click-to-tweet plugin before we built our own into Social Warfare. Although we still use Yoast for SEO-related stuff, we’ve built Social Warfare to take over the social graph data so it’s a bit more streamlined. However, if you’re using Yoast’s options, our plugin will play nicely and submit to your preference.What about  adding a particular pinterest pin just like an Instagram post does it work ?..Hi Asma, You absolutely can embed individual Pinterest pins into blog posts. It isn’t quite as simple as it is with Instagram, but here are a couple different options:1. Use the official Pinterest widget builder (choose Pin in the top navigation and follow the directions from there): https://developers.pinterest.com/tools/widget-builder/?type=pinIf you go this route, definitely be sure to copy the additional line of code (where it says, “Don’t forget to include pinit.js once (and only once) per page!”) and paste it at the bottom of your post, using the Text view editor. It’s kind of weird, but required to get embedded pins working.2. If your blog is on WordPress, you can also use this plugin to build widgets for embedding individual pins: https://wordpress.org/plugins/pinterest-widgets/Hope this helps.Thanks Ben!. I’ll try it out.Another fantastic article – just what I expect from CoSchedule :) It’s so easy to simply shove content to social media, but this post reminds us how important it to do some minor tweaks so that you social media profiles are an extension of your website© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,4

											In this post, we’ll teach you how to:There isn’t a secret involved. There is, however, a smart methodology behind our brainstorming process. It just involves a little bit of quick thinking and intuitive judgement to make the best use of your limited time.Creative ideas don’t always appear out of thin air.Sometimes you’ll have the most awesome inspiration when you least expect it. Some of us do our best thinking in the shower, or right before we head to bed at night.However, bloggers and marketers don’t always have the luxury of waiting for inspiration to strike. Your boss likely expects brilliance from you all the time (doubly so when deadlines are approaching). You have no excuse not to deliver, either. Consistent creativity keeps you paid and keeps your content efforts moving forward.Establishing a formal brainstorming process is the best way (or at least the most reliable way) to never run out of ideas. It achieves the following three things:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The first step is to write down as many ideas as you can think of. This works best with a whiteboard and markers, Post-It Notes, or anything else you can pin up on a wall later.Don’t worry whether your ideas are any good right away. The goal is to simply get your thoughts out of your head and out into the world. If in doubt, write it down anyway. You’ll have time to sort out what’s good and what’s not later.Now it’s time for some constructive criticism.If you wrote your ideas down on note cards or sticky notes, now is the time to paste them up on a wall. They can be posted anywhere as long as everyone can easily read them. Here’s what our board looked like after using this process:Position all your ideas on the left side of the wall or white board. Then, to the right, make three columns labeled 1, 2, and 3.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?There are two ways you can approach this. Let’s walk through each one.Method One: Read Your Ideas Out LoudThis approach lends itself well to collaboration. It gives the team an opportunity to discuss why they think an idea is good or bad.However, it also has a tendency to encourage group-think. Members might hear another person say “3” and be compelled to follow suit. This makes it important to stress honesty with each answer.Method Two: Score Ideas SilentlyThe advantage to this technique is that it provides more honest feedback. When people can’t hear what other people are saying, they tend to respond the way they truly think, without outside influence.However, it also cuts down on collaboration and discussion. This makes this approach faster, but sometimes, added communication can be beneficial for sorting out the best ideas.We’ve used both Method One and Method Two. Generally, our content marketing team prefers Method Two. It produces slightly fewer ideas overall, because less ideas get scored highly. However, these ideas tend to be stronger. Both approaches are effective, however, and Method One might be a better choice if having a higher quantity of ideas is important.You’ve now generated a ton of ideas in 30 minutes. Now, the final phase of this process is to sharpen your best concepts.For our team here at CoSchedule, we usually leave a brainstorming session with around 30 to 50 ideas. From there, you’ll narrow down the best ones that you’ll actually write about.Review your final list of 3’s and identify the following for each idea:The goal is to make sure you have a clear picture of what each post will look like.We need to further clarify what makes a topic a 3 (versus a 1 or a 2). A 1 does not satisfy the following requirements while a 2 might satisfy one or two (but not all four).Strong blog topics that should qualify as a 3, however, meet the following standards:Strong blog topics are unique. In this context, we’ll define “unique” as something you haven’t already written about. If a given topic is something you’ve covered previously, you’ll need to ensure you’re taking a different angle, or are exploring a different facet of that topic.Strong blog topics match your audience’s interests. If you’re just starting out, you might not know what your audience is interested in. However, if you’re getting a lot of questions about something, that’s probably a good topic to write about.Strong blog topics fit within your expertise. Your ideas should fit within the topical scope of what your blog is about. For example, a great post about how to change your own motor oil wouldn’t be a good fit for a food blog. Strong topics are well aligned with your expertise and with what readers expect from you.Don’t let this deter you from thinking outside the box. Just be sure that the topics you choose are:The strongest blog topics are those you can do better than anyone else. This ties into the previous point about staying within your topical area of expertise. In order to write a blog post that’s going to drive organic search traffic and kick up a storm on social media, it needs to be good.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?In fact, it needs to be better than good. It needs to address its given topic with more and better information than at least 90% of what else is out there. If you’re in a competitive niche, this might mean using the skyscraper technique to build off what larger competitors have already done.The main takeaway is to ask whether you can write a better post on a topic than any other post that already exists. If that answer is no, the next question to ask is “Can you can write a post that’s different from any other post out there?” That could mean your post introduces a new perspective on a topic. It could also mean your post adds information or provides findings from your own original research.Let’s say you’re working alone. If you’re a one-person blogger or marketing department, then how do you make this process work?The short answer is much the same as you would with a team. The only difference is you write and rate your ideas yourself. However, there are a few tips to keep in mind:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The more you run through this process, the more efficient you’ll get. You’ll also likely find yourself coming up with better ideas over time, too.In order to get the most from this approach to brainstorming, there are some things you’ll need to keep in mind.Once you’ve invested your half-hour into your blog topic brainstorming process, the next step is to do some keyword research. If you have a team member who is particularly interested in SEO, this is a good additional task for them to take on.The goal here is to find keywords related to your topics that you can use in your blog posts.This may take a little bit of additional time. However, it’s worth it to ensure your blog topics drive traffic. Use these three quick keyword research tactics to gauge which of your proposed topics are best:1. Use the SERPs.com Keywordini tool:2. Then, copy the keywords from the CSV export:3. Next, paste those keywords into the Google Adwords Keyword Planner:Need help with the keyword planner? Watch this video:4. Try using those keywords in searches on Facebook or Twitter. Then, see what discussions are happening around those keywords. This will give you an idea of what kinds of words and language people use when discussing your topic.5. Manually search those keywords in Google as well. Review the top 10 results. Next, ask if the posts that currently exist for that keyword accurately match the same idea behind your topic.For example, let’s say you want to write about carpet cleaning. That could mean home carpet cleaning or commercial carpet cleaning. If it turns out that most people who are looking for that keyword want their home carpets cleaned, but your business only works with commercial clients, then you might need to find a better keyword.You might have an idea that you know your audience would love, but isn’t relevant to any keywords with strong search volume. Does this mean you should abandon that idea?Not necessarily.Writing a blog post without backing it up with strong keyword data is a risk.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You could spend a lot of time creating something that gets a strong initial push on social media and email but then fails to drive sustained traffic from search engines. However, it’s possible that your idea doesn’t get searched a lot because it answers a question people don’t know they should be asking.In these cases, it’s helpful to find a way to align your idea with something people are searching for.Here are three tips you can follow when you’re struggling to find good keywords (when you know you’ve got a strong topic):You’ll now have five fresh blog topics related to your main idea. These hypothetical ideas may include keyword variations or other verbs or adjectives, too. Those additional words, combined with nouns related to your topic, may create keyword phrases you might not have thought of.Try taking some of the variations this tool produces, and look them up using Google’s Keyword Planner (or another keyword tool). It’s possible you could come up with some strong keywords after all.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This process provides us with roughly a month’s worth of ideas each time we run through it. Depending on how often you publish, you may need to try going through these steps more often. However, one thing that’s for certain is you’ll never run out of blog topics.Try putting this process to use with your own team. Then, come back and let us know how it went.

											When all is said and done, writer’s block is really just a mixture of feeling stuck, having a lack of good planning, and maybe a hint of procrastination, which throws us into the downward spiral of being stuck. Which is usually when writers say, “I have writer’s block!”I love what writer, Neil Gaiman, says about writer’s block:“If you turn around and go, ‘I am blocked,’ this is just something writers say because we’re really clever. It sounds like it has nothing to do with you: ‘I would love to write today, but I am blocked. The gods have done it to me,’” he said. “And it’s not true. Cellists don’t have cellist block. Gardeners don’t have gardener’s block. TV hosts do not have TV host block. But writers have claimed all the blocks, and we think it’s a real thing.”It makes sense doesn’t it?Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Ever since I heard him say that, I knew he was right.I know that I’ve given myself the excuse that I can’t write because I’m blocked. When in actuality, it’s because I haven’t planned out what I am writing well enough.That’s what caused me to be stuck in the first place. That’s probably also what is causing you to be stuck, too.An unhealthy dose of “being stuck” + lack of good planning + procrastination = Writer’s BlockImagine if you got your foot stuck while hiking. Would you just lay down there and say, “I can’t move because my foot is stuck?”Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?No… you wouldn’t.I know you wouldn’t.You’d get your foot unstuck. And that is what you have to do when you get stuck with your writing. Instead of saying, “I have writer’s block,” it’s important to see the culprit behind the phrase writer’s block for what it truly is.You are stuck.But, you might be asking me, “But Devin, how do I get unstuck? I’m really struggling here.” I totally know how you feel, so here are some helpful ways to get unstuck. Being stuck is hard, but you can always get unstuck.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Take a good look at your situation. What is it that is causing you to be stuck?Whether you are scared of what people will think or scared of being great, I can only think of what Marianne Williamson said about fear:Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.Click To Tweet

Stop painfully waiting for it to write itself.Whether it’s for work or your own writing, it’s important that you continue doing the work. I went to a writing conference a few years ago and saw this video. It clearly pictures what happens when we’ve gotten past the “inspiration” part of writing something or working on a project.A time comes when you have to just get into it and finish it. It’s hard, but you can do it. (Promise me you’ll watch this video. It’s seriously amazing!)A Note On Inspiration: Writers usually work really well when they’re inspired, but once the inspiration goes away and you are left with bringing the project to completion, that’s usually when people claim that they have writer’s block. Or that they are stuck.That’s just a sign that you need to pull on the work boots and muck into the deep of it all so you can finish your work.Write and finish it.There comes a point in every writer’s life where we have to ship what we’ve written. Are you grasping onto your writing and worried that it isn’t perfect?If you said yes to any of these points, follow me to the next section. You’ll soon be unstuck with plenty of brilliant ideas.Here are some things that’ll help you get unstuck so you’ll be able to continue creating awesome content.Ask yourself these questions:If your answer is that you don’t know, then it’s time to open the books and website pages to research your topics a little bit better.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Unstick your brain by getting off the computer.Go for a walk and get some fresh air. Stanford researchers found that walking really improves creativity. You’ll be amazed when ideas come to you while your away from the desk.So make sure you bring your phone with you so you can take notes if ideas come to you.In The Power of Full Engagement, Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz said that:…between 90 and 120 minutes, the body begins to crave a period of rest or recovery. Signals include a desire to yawn and stretch, hunger pangs, increased tension, difficulty concentrating, an inclination to procrastinate or fantasize, and a higher incidence of mistakes.Here are some other ideas on what you can do to get some energy away from the computer:If you’re finding it really difficult to work on what you’re writing, switch it up and spend a little time writing something else. You can do this by:Writing For Social MediaWriting For EmailWriting For Content UpgradesIf you want more examples of what kinds of content upgrades do well, make sure you check out our Resource Library!One way you can get to know your project better is by brainstorming. It’s a creative way get more ideas. It also really helps with this so-called “writer’s block”.When I’ve been writing a lot and staring at a computer screen, I need to turn off the computer. I grab my favorite pen and notebook, and then I find a nice sunny spot where I can brainstorm and write.There is just something special about writing by hand and seeing the ink soak into the paper. I think it really helps you sort things out in a deeper way.Paul Bloom, Yale psychologist, said, “With handwriting, the very act of putting it down forces you to focus on what’s important… Maybe it helps you think better.”That’s so true.Sometimes you might be hashing out all your ideas on the computer, and when nothing comes together, you give up on the post. It’s so easy to throw the towel in and walk away from an unfinished project that has potential, but that lost its shiny excitement.If you ever feel stuck, get out your notebook and pen. Brainstorming takes many different shapes and forms. First though, you need to figure out what you are writing about and why.What problem are you trying to solve for your audience?If I wanted to write this post “8 Social Media Best Practices That Will Save You 25.5 Hours In A 2-Week Sprint“, what would the problem be?The problem I’d want to solve is= “My readers are spending too much time on social media when they’d really like to be working on the things that are truly important to them.”My next step would be to think about the steps they’d need to “save time on social media”.You can also do this, too. Start by following these steps:The steps will look something like this:After you’ve figured out the skeletal system for your post, you’ll be able to flesh it all out. Go in depth and make it actionable.You can do this two different ways.Either you could brainstorm a list of things that are related somehow and put those into a blog post, or you could use this brainstorming activity to help you create a list of different writing ideas.Steps to brainstorming with a list:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?We’ve all done this kind of brainstorming at one time or another. Remember those bubbles that you used to draw in elementary school that would connect to other bubbles filled with similar ideas?It’s still pretty much that simple. It’s a great way to get your ideas all out in front of you.Are you ready?Recommended Reading:Take all your thoughts on a certain topic and write them down on 1 sheet of paper. You can also do this to come up with tons of great writing prompts.For this kind of brainstorming, you don’t need an outline. No bubbles or lines leading to other points. Unless of course, you want to do that.This is a safe place to just percolate on your ideas. Write it all down.Steps To The 1-Sheet Brain Dump:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This is a form of brainstorming that I use to come up with fresh and exciting writing prompts. It will also help you flesh out your ideas quicker.Ever thought of brainstorming out loud? If not, follow these steps:Now I know that sometimes brainstorming works perfectly on the computer, and for those moments, you don’t want to brainstorm on paper—just go onto the computer.There are many great places to brainstorm on your computer and online. Here are some great programs that I love using:Scrivener: It is a great program with many different settings for writers. If you haven’t heard of it, make sure you check it out!Index Cards: A wonderful app that allows you to organize digital index cards in a way that will help you sort your thoughts. You can also sync your index cards to Scrivener.SimpleMind+: It’s an app that you can use on your iPad to make mind mapping easier.CoSchedule: I really love working with CoSchedule when I am brainstorming a new project.There are so many great ways to use CoSchedule for brainstorming your blog post ideas. It gives writers a way to organize their ideas and follow through with publishing them.Steps To Brainstorm In CoSchedule:After you’ve used all of those brainstorming ideas, keep track of your ideas in a writing prompt library. You can do this by storing them in an Evernote note or even on Google Docs or Sheets. (You also get this in the bundle that complements this post.)It will look something like this:Fill in the columns in the spreadsheet. You’ll be asked these questions:If there is something else you want to track in this writing prompt library, add to the columns at the top and track away.You know that the real culprit behind the phrase “Writer’s Block” is really just an unhealthy mixture of “being stuck” + lack of good planning + procrastination.Even though it can be a real bother to be stuck, you now know how to get unstuck.You might have a set of brainstorming techniques that you are excited to start using. I hope this post helps you get unstuck and writing!Click To Tweet

											A call to action might be as simple as asking someone to:A call to action might be at the beginning of a blog post, at the end of a blog post, or sprinkled throughout a landing page. As a marketer, you use a call to action in any medium—videos, advertisements, blog posts, landing pages, and even social messages.Whatever form it takes, and wherever it appears in your content, a call to action is you providing your reader with some form of actionable task and usually appears as a button, link within text, or an image of some kind.Whatever form it takes, a call to action provides your reader with an actionable task.Click To TweetContent marketing is creating content, but with a purpose.All content has the purpose of establishing your expertise and being helpful to your reader so that they come back to you for more. And of course, content has the purpose of bringing in new readers through search engines.So you must include purposeful elements in your content that specifically ask your reader to do something tangible instead of merely feeling warm fuzzies about your brand. You must regularly ask your reader to do something.A call to action not only gets your reader to do something that commits her further to what you are ultimately selling, it’s also something you can measure. And, if you can measure it, you can test, tweak, and change it so you learn more about your audience.Without a call to action, you’re wasting your best efforts.Click To TweetWithout a call to action, you’re wasting your best efforts and goodwill on readers who probably would take action and who probably would buy but you’ve never pushed them to.Without writing a call to action, the most you’ll know about your reader is hits, page views, and bounces. You’ll spread lots of goodwill. But you’ll never make a sale.Recommended Reading:When it comes to a powerful motivator for your call to action, FOMO, or the fear of missing out, is hard to beat. This is about exclusivity, which generally works in two ways:That fear of missing out taps into several human emotions (some of which we’d rather not admit to). It’s more than just fear because that fear is based in something else:Most of us are almost compulsively driven by these emotions.When you write a call to action, you must tap into these kinds of emotion—the ones that are so connected to exclusivity—because they’re what drive people to act when it comes to selling.And when you’re selling something people don’t need (i.e. food, water, shelter, new washer) and are instead trying to create a want (i.e. you just bought a new shirt, but why not get a few more?), you have to find another motivator for them to part with their money (or their email address).And, oddly, the fear and subsequent emotions that are tied into exclusivity are good ones to use.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Exclusivity rides on one main idea: If you don’t do something now, you’ll never be able to do it again.You can hint at exclusivity through the words in your call to action.Think of any word or phrase that suggests now:You get the idea.With FOMO, there isn’t time to think. The language all points to action immediately. So Call now is much better than Call anytime.Recommended Reading:Fear isn’t the only way to get people to act, though it’s one of the most powerful. Hope can do the trick, too.First you need to create a sense of desperation. Illustrate just how big a problem your readers have, and the hope to change it will suddenly make sense.While driving around town and checking errands off of my to-do list this past weekend, I took note of the billboards and signs outside of the stores and restaurants. I said to my friend, who was with me, that there was absolutely nothing that I needed, yet here I was, buying stuff.“I wouldn’t be dissatisfied with my life and possessions if they didn’t tell me it ought to be so,” I said, a bit annoyed.“You can’t sell to people who aren’t dissatisfied,” my friend replied.With dissatisfaction comes hope. Or it should, if you’re writing your call to action correctly.To tap into hope, you first must suggest hopelessness. By that, I mean you must show the reader that there is a problem, it’s a serious one, and they have it.And then you provide the solution and the hope.“You’ve tried everything to lose weight, but nothing worked,” is easily countered with, “Try this safe and proven method that returns results every time, risk free!”In this call to action example, you assure the reader by using the words “safe” and “risk free”, and give them hope by suggesting it’s “proven” and “returns results”.Big problem. Big hope. Once you’ve established this pattern, end with your simplified call to action. “Start now and lose 10 pounds in your first month.”Recommended Reading:Is it possible that certain words get more conversions than others? It’s a good question that has some research behind it—to an extent.So I took a look at five well-researched articles to pull together a big list of call to action words that will help you get more email signups, trials, and sales. This data comes from five researched articles, and even includes some words that have helped CoSchedule get as much as a 27% conversion rate from our own calls to action:Now, many of these sources suggest testing your own calls to action on your blog and website to see what words perform best with your audience. That is great advice you can put into practice by using a tool like Visual Website Optimizer. Start simple:The results may surprise you, as they’ve done with us at CoSchedule.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Call to action examples are everywhere, so where would you start? I figured we’d take a look at a few of the top companies in the world according to Fortune’s 500 list (there has to be a reason they’re so successful, right?), then dive in to some specific examples that are a bit more content marketing related.Let’s do this.Like the simplicity of their products, Apple keeps their calls to action short, clean, and to the point.Learn more and Trade up to a new iPhone are unmistakable in letting Apple’s audience know exactly what they’ll see after they click through the call to action. Apple also doesn’t clutter the design: There are clearly only two options to help their users focus on making a decision to click quickly and easily.While the design is super busy compared to Apple’s example (do I click on Save with Our App, App Store, Google Play, or on the phone itself?!), CVS focuses on the value proposition in their call to action.Save with Our App focuses CVS’ audience on the perceived benefit of using the tool, which connects into hope to resolve the dissatisfaction of spending so much money.The headline here—Unlock extra savings with app-only deals!—also suggests exclusivity, that you can only experience those benefits if you get the app. They also include the word exclusive in the description, which is a powerful motivator for the fear of missing out.Lesson Learned: Keep your design clean so your users know where to click. Brainstorm the value proposition to answer your readers’ inherent question, “What’s in it for me?” and tie that into your call to action.Who said you had to write a call to action? The behemoth Amazon focuses on compelling imagery to entice action.In this example, there is really no traditional call to action that usually begins with a verb. However, Amazon does rock some powerful words with the visual: Now and Limited time offer. Talk about inducing urgency and appealing to the fear of missing out.The visual tells the rest of the story, helping Amazon shoppers envision themselves in front of an amazing TV with a bowl of popcorn and a couple glasses of champaign.Would you like to chillax like that, too? Heck yes, you would. And that’s why the visual creates a powerful call to action.It’s noteworthy to mention this: Amazon doesn’t even show the product they’re selling (other than the remote) and focuses the visual mostly on the experience you’ll feel when you click through the call to action to purchase it. People don’t buy products, they buy experiences. And that’s why Amazon crushed it with this call to action example.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Wondering how to apply calls to action into your blog posts? Write a post that helps your readers do something without you, then when you can help them do it even better, let them know.Code School helps people learn how to code. So when they wrote a post called Why Python? that covered reasons to learn and use the language, they ended the post with a call to action to learn more through the courses Code School offers.The call to action appears as the last paragraph in the blog post, and invites readers to Check out a couple new courses. It’s simple, informal, yet informational to teach their audience about the possibilities Code School offers to help their readers improve.Do you embed videos in your blog posts? With Wistia, you can add a Turnstile into your video to collect email leads during video play, and you can also include a written call to action and link to related content at the end of your video.Turns out, you can also write a call to action right into your YouTube videos, too, if you’re not a Wistia user.Anyway, this call to action example shows up at the end of a video that explains one element about making post-product process simpler—something Wistia’s audience cares a lot about. Wistia then links to more information on the topic to help their viewers learn more about post-production—which is a part of the video process Wistia as a tool can help make more efficient.The video appears in lieu of a traditional blog post header graphic. That means Wistia’s audience sees a video right away (which also likely boosts on page time and engagement quite a bit), Wistia shows their quirky brand personality, and they display a strong call to action immediately.This is a great example of leading an audience deeper into the funnel from inbound marketing to demand generation content that positions Wistia as the solution to the problem. Brilliant.Have you seen blog posts that offer something free in exchange for your email address? Somewhere along the lines, marketers started calling those things content upgrades. And they are a super smart way to include a call to action in every blog post to turn the traffic you get into email subscribers.In this call to action example from Backlinko, Brian Dean includes a written CTA in the introduction of his blog post. That is brilliant because a majority of your audience will read the first 100 words of your post, then maybe skim the rest.Anyway, this call to action is very smart because it relates specifically to the content at hand and not just a generic give-me-your-email-address kinda CTA. Brian relates directly to the challenge his readers want to resolve by writing Get More Email Subscribers, then he uses a powerful word with download.He also promises that what his readers will get behind the call to action will help them quickly execute the 17 strategies from this post, which is very important for the Backlinko blog in particular because Brian creates such long-form content. This way, he captures the interest of the too-long-didn’t-read (TLDR) audience while also turning them into email subscribers.To top it off, Brian targets another call to action for the 20% of his audience that makes it through the entire blog post to the very end. This time, he lets the visual speak for itself with the power word download, and includes the emotional word free to describe his content upgrade.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?No matter what motivation you use (fear or hope), there are some common ways that you should use when structuring your call to action.Verbs are the action words that make it clear to readers what you want them to do. Instead of saying, “Ready to get started?” simplify it to “Get started now” or “Start saving now”.Some verbs are stronger than others. This has to do with the cacophony of the word (hard K, G, D sounds) coupled with the strength of the action suggested in context.The word “buy” feels stronger and more urgent than “purchase”. “Get your copy” is more cacophonous and powerful than “Download your ebook”.Starting with verbs means starting phrases and sentences, sure, but also the placement of links and call to action buttons. They come first (or nearly first) and should be prominent. Buttons to buy or sign-up should be above the fold, no scrolling required. They should be before the long chunk of explanatory text.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Adverbs and adjectives can get in the way of the action you want your readers to take.You should have already done the work of convincing people to take the action before presenting your call to action to them through blog post or landing page copy. Try your best to avoid words ending in -ly. “Click here” is better than “Click here quickly.”There are exceptions, though. For example, you might hint at exclusivity by saying “Get your custom ebook now” instead of just “Get your ebook”.Use words that are simple, common, and not too long.This isn’t because you think your reader isn’t smart enough to handle anything else, but because you’re trying to prod base emotions. You don’t want anything to get in the way of those simple emotions, particularly requiring readers to consider complex thought processes or scenarios which could distract them or lead them down a path of thought away from taking action.Avoid buzzwords, jargon, and any word that feels “empty” and can be ignored by the reader. If you use enough ignorable words in your call to action, your entire call to action runs the risk of being ignored.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?If you must use descriptive words, use simple and common words that are emotionally effective.This is no time to go crazy with a thesaurus and impress the world with your vocabulary. The language must not get in the way of the emotional prodding you’re trying to achieve. Save your thinking words for your blog posts, and focus your call to action on words that are powerful persuaders.Remember simple, basic, and primal words—and not too many words overall—when you make the big request.It’s not just the language of the request that you need to make simple, but the request itself must be easy. One or two clicks to completion. As little pain as possible.If you need more information than a name and email, try to break it up so you capture that email first, get the user into the purchase or into their account, and then collect the rest later. The reason is that you don’t want to give your reader time to change their mind.I don’t know how many times I’ve been at a big box store and, because of too few checkout lanes available, seen people abandon full carts in line and walk out the door. It’s the same with your call to action.The more complicated you make it for readers to complete it, the more likely they’ll find a way to change their mind or forget the driving reason you just convinced them they needed to take action.“Buy now!” doesn’t feel like “now” if you make them fill out lots of information, answer a small survey, and click on a reply email to verify. That feels like buying later, and it brings into question the urgency you insisted was necessary to get a reader to take action.Click To Tweet

For the past months, I have build some changes on my site, also with my CTAs. I’ll leave things as but I am getting a better idea of what’s working and what not.
Thank you so much for the tips on the verbs, adverbs etc. I will keep them in mind.
Another very helpful post, Julie.Such a colourful, enjoyable read! I love the psychology of marketing and language in particular.@michalistiritas:disqus Thank you for reading! Keep your eye out we have another post coming soon about psychology and color that I think you will enjoy. We also have http://coschedule.com/blog/color-psychology-marketing/ that you might be interested in as well!Hey Julie,
Language is such a powerful thing isn’t it? I read another article recently by Josh Earl about creating Twitter Cards and a short line in the post about the CTA said;“use a positive statement written from the viewer’s perspective, like “I’m In!” or “Give Me My Tips!”I’ve developed a recent tendency to use that in my CTA buttons for optin forms etc. I don’t know the psychology of it exactly but it I’ll see how it turns out. I guess it’s a perspective thing.When I’m writing content, it always comes back to presenting the offer in terms of giving the reader an opportunity to move away from a negative or towards a positive. The CTA always needs to be “here, do this and you’ll avoid failure” or “here, do this and you’ll win big time”, either way, as you said above, when we do this we can tap into the base emotions of the buyer. It all goes back to knowing your customer inside out, right?Great article thanks for posting.-LarryLovely Post@ekta_kamlani:disqus thank you very much, thank you for reading!Hey Julie,I love this post, really simple and actionable. The FOMO framework is easy to remember and you’ve laid down the key principles of persuasion (like scarcity). Also, I believe that using simple words is also crucial to crafting great CTAs. Most of the people are really bad at writing copy (but who could blame them, it’s nothing we learn at school…) and often using complex language that their target audience can’t / doesn’t understand. Including simple, effective power words that are tied to specific emotions is a great way to better connect with readers while getting them to act. I’ve laid down a full list of 190 trigger words here: http://www.pptpop.com/list-of-persuasive-trigger-words/Hope it can help your readers,ClemenceSo true! People are afraid of missing out! Happy blogging!WOW! That was so thorough and informative. Thank you. My CTA is clearly too boring, since my conversion sucks. I keep ’em on my site at a ratio of 1;3 views, but no conversion. I’m armed with new info and hoping my conversion gets better. Thank you!© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,4

							CoSchedule's product marketing lead/coffee expert/startup enthusiast.What if you could schedule more social media messages in way less time? Social templates make it happen.Wouldn't life be a whole lot easier if you could just manage multiple social media accounts in one place? You can with CoSchedule. Read to learn how.Hello Kathryn,
thanks for that nice article about the best scheduling time. Are you work with social media tools with a scheduling function? I prefer to work with blog2social. It’s an easy tool to schedule and post automatically to the various
social media, while at the same time it allows you to customize your
postings for each network’s requirement. Also you can select the image
you like to go with your post.Hey @disqus_1rhZwQ9wkJ:disqus! Thanks for the comment. I haven’t heard of blog2social yet, but we’ll have to check it out.As far as CoSchedule goes, you can schedule messages for your own content—and curated content—all on one social media calendar so you can manage everything in one place. CoSchedule also helps you share images with your messages.Thanks again, Marina! Good luck out there.Do you recommend using best time scheduling instead of Buffer?Hey @BackdoorSurvival:disqus! Buffer has a feature that staggers your messages throughout a day. Where CoSchedule differs is that we’ll stagger your messages throughout the day, but the times we choose to send your messages are smartly chosen according to the best practices for your specific networks.For example, you could simply schedule a message to send to Facebook tomorrow, and we’d automatically make sure to send it when Facebook users are typically most engaged. Data shows that this should help influence more shares and clickthroughs to view your content.I hope that helps!How much account is taken of Time Zones around the World? 7AM in San Francisco is not 7AM in London, Dubai or Melbourne. Does your method take account of when the best time for engagement has historically been for individual account holders?© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,7

											Fortunately, we’re here to help you figure out which tools are most essential for the majority of content marketers and bloggers.Before we go any further, we need to clarify a few things.This post is not:This post is:The majority (but not all) of these tools are options we use ourselves here at CoSchedule. By the time you’re done reading, you’ll have everything you need to fill your content marketing toolkit.Use this table of contents to navigate:Ready to take a deeper dive? Let’s do this.You’ve probably heard the quote, “Failure to plan is planning to fail.”Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?It’s a borderline cliche, but it’s also completely accurate.Knowing what you’re going to do in advance is important. Proper planning up front will help guide your efforts throughout your entire workflow, and can make or break your content’s chances for success.To get yourself organized (and to stay that way), it’s helpful to have some productivity tools on hand.Recommended Reading:Getting organized as a content marketer or blogger doesn’t have to break the bank. Here are some essentials for your toolbox.There’s no easier way to manage a meeting and event calendar with a team than using Google Calendar. It’s free and ensures everyone has visibility to when people will be unavailable and when meetings are scheduled.It’s free and it works well. It also eliminates team members from saying they didn’t get the memo on when a meeting is happening.Schedule your meetings, conference calls, client appointments, or anything else that’s helpful for your team to know about (or just for yourself to remember). Plus, you can connect CoSchedule to your Google Calendar (although your calendar content will be read-only).If you haven’t tried Evernote, it’s time to change that. Evernote is an extremely powerful note-taking and task management app. It also syncs across desktop and mobile devices, so you can access your notes and documents no matter where you are.The free plan offers a useful amount of features, but premium plans are reasonably priced and worth considering for greater functionality and flexibility.Evernote offers a secure means of storing and sharing notes and allows you to work on documents with your team.Evernote has an enormous number of applications that are useful for marketers and bloggers. Here’s just a handful of ideas on how to use Evernote with your content:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Recommended Reading: How To Use Evernote For Blogging To Boost Your EfficiencyConsistently generating awesome content marketing ideas is one of the biggest challenges we all face as content marketers.It’s a good thing there are a lot of useful tools and hacks out there that you can leverage to come up with more quality ideas faster than you can rather than just relying on sheer imagination and mental power alone.Here are some of our favorite tools and techniques:Feedly is a news and blog aggregator that pulls in feeds from selected sources into one place. Think of it as a successor to the sorely missed Google Reader.Not only is it a good idea to keep tabs on the latest news and trends in your industry or niche, but it can also be a good way to stoke your own creativity. When you know what topics are trending and what other forms of content are being created, it will help you identify what you can do better, or what unique perspective you can add on to your own blog.Twitter’s direct applications for content marketing are pretty obvious. What might be less obvious is how to use Twitter to monitor trends and come up with hot content marketing ideas.Twitter is essential for sharing content, interacting with influencers, and following your interests. That much you probably know. However, there are a few ways to use Twitter as a tool for generating content marketing ideas that you might have overlooked.The best ways to use Twitter for content ideation is to:Recommended Reading:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Want to find the top-performing content on a keyword or topic? Then you want to use BuzzSumo.It’s extremely effective at surfacing the best content on a given topic or keyword quickly. Once you know what you’re up against, you can strategize ways to make your content better from what already exists on the Web.You’ll see what other content is already out there on a topic or keyword to help spark your imagination.Ever wish you could just pop a few words into a form and get a week’s worth of content ideas in an instant? If so, then HubSpot’s Blog Topic Generator is exactly what you’re looking for.It’s a quick and easy means of kickstarting your creative process, even if you don’t end up using the exact ideas or headlines it suggests.The uses for this tool go beyond just generating ideas for blog posts.Try expanding out from using the topic generator to get more than just new blog title ideas. Why not try it to include downloadable guides, landing pages, slide decks, or other types of content?It’s better to think of the suggestions it provides as a starting point for brainstorming rather than something that will produce the final concepts you’ll build content around.Keyword research is difficult to do well. However, it remains a vitally important piece of any content strategy.After all, if content marketing is all about serving users the information they need when they’re looking for it, then it helps to know which terms and topics are being searched (and making sure you have content to address those areas).It’s hard work, but using these tools can help.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Free and easy to use, Google’s Keyword Planner belongs in every content marketer’s toolset.Back in the day (re: 2013), Google’s keyword research tool used to show exact keyword search volumes for specific terms. Now, it shows the number of times a keyword generates a paid ad in the SERPs (search engine result pages). While that’s great if you’re into paid ads, this has led to some criticism around its usefulness if you’re targeting organic search (as opposed to bidding on pay-per-click ads).The two main uses for this tool are to generate lists of potential keywords, and estimate how many people are searching for specific keywords.
Keywordini is a free tool offered by the SEO software service provider SERPs.com.It offers another data point for your keyword research. The results it provides also appear to be slightly different than what you’ll find in Google’s Keyword Planner or Moz’s Keyword Difficulty Tool.This one is simple: Type in a keyword or topic and it’ll spit out a ton of related keywords, along with their estimated search volumes. It’s like having the ability to find related keywords and search volumes from Google’s keyword planner in one screen rather than two.While Google’s Keyword Planner gives you an idea of how competitive keywords are, the Moz Keyword Difficulty Tool (included in Moz’s premium software service suite, which we’ll talk about in more detail later on), can give you a bit better of an idea on exactly how hard it’ll be to rank for a given keyword.It’s one thing to target keywords with high search volume. It’s something else entirely to actually succeed in that goal. Sometimes, targeting keywords with less volume and less competition can be better than going after the most popular search terms.Once you’ve got a list of keywords generated from other tools (like the Keyword Planner, Keywordini, Keyword.io, Ubersuggest, or any other tool you prefer), use Moz’s Keyword Difficulty Tool to determine your odds of ranking for those keywords. The higher the difficulty percentage, the more work you’ll have to do to rank.Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you use the tool to choose your keywords:For more information on how to leverage this tool, check out Moz’s detailed Keyword Difficulty Tool help guide.Before the Internet, great writers relied on nothing but sheer grit and determination to improve their writing. They also walked 15 miles uphill both ways in blizzard conditions to the nearest library to find reference material.Those were dark times (the depths of which have been only slightly exaggerated).Fortunately for you, there are now tons of tools available to help you improve your writing. Here is a handful of essentials:The free headline analyzer has proven popular. Not only are we grateful that so many people find it helpful, but we use it ourselves every time we write headlines for a blog post.Your headline is what will get the attention of your potential readers. The headline analyzer gives you an idea just how strong your headlines really are, removing any editorial guesswork.The best way to use the headline analyzer is to write tons of headlines in succession and compare your scores and grades.Being able to hand your copy over to Ernest Hemingway would be nice for feedback. Since that’s impossible, using the Hemingway app is the next best thing.Hemingway can help you test the readability of your content, ensuring your message doesn’t get lost in overly complex or poorly structured language.Once you’ve downloaded the app, just copy and paste your text into the window. You’ll get an instant critique of your work. There isn’t much more to it than that. Easy peasy!Plagiarism sucks. Copyscape makes sure your text doesn’t already exist word-for-word elsewhere on the Web. You don’t want people thinking this about you if they find out you plagiarized them:Plus, you could get in a lot of trouble. So stay away from plagiarism with Copyscape. Grammarly also has an option to check for plagiarism.You don’t want to create the appearance that you stole someone else’s work (even if the inverse is actually true). Also, duplicate content is a major issue for SEO, since it makes it more difficult for search engines to know which page including that content to serve in search results.Depending on what kind of blog or business you run, dedicated landing pages can be an excellent way to target keywords or create attractive destination pages for social media, email, and PPC campaigns.LeadPages is a simple software tool you can use to build lead-generation landing pages without knowing any code. Instapage is another landing page company that offers a free version.One of the main reasons to use LeadPages is that the results it produces are impressive, especially considering its ease of use. If you’re looking for a way to build a landing page with a contact form in order to build your email list, then look no further.If you have a piece of content like a downloadable white paper or ebook, building a landing page with gated access (where users exchange their email address for your content) is a great way to build your email list and promote your content at the same time.Want to know how to do this exactly? Check out LeadPages’ own email list building video course:Having strong visual content is non-optional if you want to create strong blog posts.However, not all of us are designers by trade. Nor does every content marketer or blogger have the privilege of working with someone who does possess a proficient design skillset. Fortunately, there are plenty of tools that can help fill this gap (many of which we’ve covered on the CoSchedule blog in the past, and for good reason).You can’t talk about Web-based design tools without talking about Canva (which is probably why we’ve been talking about them a lot). It’s simple, easy to use, and gets the job done with minimal fuss.The biggest reason to use Canva is that you need a variety of graphic styles to fit all kinds of different content formats (social media, email headers, website headers, and much more), but you don’t have the time to design original graphics with pro tools like Photoshop yourself.Here’s an example of something you could make with Canva relatively quickly (note this is just a default template):Whether you’re creating images for a blog post, social media post, presentation, website banner, or even print collateral, it offers a flexible platform with an impressive level of customization for a template-based tool.Recommended Reading:While you can create infographics with Canva too, Infogr.am is another option to consider if you’re looking for something that builds infographics specifically.People love infographics. They provide an easily digestible way to visualize data, and Infogr.am makes them easy to create. Alternatively, you might also want to try Piktochart out, too.If you need to build an infographic for a blog post fast, this is your go-to tool. It’s also helpful for potentially getting some extra views on your infographic, since what you create is searchable in Infogr.am’s index:While Photoshop remains the reigning king of industry-standard graphic manipulation tools, it’s worth giving a shout out to GIMP here, too. If you’re unfamiliar, GIMP (which stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free and open-source alternative to Photoshop that works in much the same way as Adobe’s staple imaging software.The clearest reason to use GIMP over Photoshop is that it’s free. It’s often said to be a little less intuitive than Photoshop, and professional designers used to working with an Adobe software may find it limiting in some ways, or just difficult to relearn. However, for the budget-conscious (and we know a good portion of our readers are working on limited budgets), GIMP is impressively full-featured and packs enough power for the majority of folks out there to accomplish what they need.You’ll need to develop some actual design chops to use GIMP well, but if you can’t afford Photoshop, it will be a godsend. If you need help getting started, try reading these official GIMP tutorials.Recommended Reading:Search engine optimization isn’t easy, and it’s even tougher to do it without the right resources.SEO Book makes a variety of tools available for free. Here’s a quick look at what they offer (members only tools are available by signing up for free):The biggest appeal here is cost. While the tools provided aren’t as fully featured as premium alternatives, they also won’t cost you anything. Plus, they’re enough to get a surprising amount of work done.One of the most useful tools SEO Book offers is their Rank Checker. It’s a free FireFox extension that allows you to check your search rankings on a given keyword. Check out this video to see how it works:This tool does have some limitations. You have to put in keywords one at a time, and it’s only available for FireFox. Plus, its results can be misleading (since the tool counts local search listings the same as normal search results, it might say you rank 13th, even though you rank 10th).If you can’t afford Moz, Raven Tools, or something similar for keyword rank tracking, it’s the next best thing.Widely considered the industry-standard when it comes to WordPress plugins for SEO, Yoast is a must-have for any blog.Simply put, it’s probably the single most essential SEO plugin that every WordPress blog needs.At its most basic level, Yoast is useful for custom editing your blog post title tags and meta descriptions.It’s also handy for quickly analyzing your on-page optimization efforts and showing where you can improve your post for SEO. If you’re ready to get more technical, it can also be used to implement XML sitemaps, edit your robots.txt file, create breadcrumb navigation trails, and more (if none of this makes sense, Yoast provides a good overview of the features on their website).Moz is a premium all-in-one SEO and content marketing software platform. In addition to checking keyword ranking difficulty (like we mentioned earlier in this post), it lets you track keyword rankings, analyze backlinks, diagnose technical issues, check important on-page factors for SEO, and much more. If you can afford it, it’s well worth the asking price.If SEO is critical for your business, then having a dedicated platform can quickly pay for itself. While there is a lot of competition in this space, Moz is perhaps one of the most widely recognized options available and is easy enough to use for any content marketer to figure out without sacrificing power or capability.Having a full SEO platform (whether you use Moz or a similar competitor like Raven Tools) at your disposal puts an incredible amount of power at your fingertips.There are many different things that Moz lets you track. We aren’t going to get into how to use each and every one of these aspects of Moz, because you can find out more on how to use Moz from them.The biggest reason to invest in something like Moz is that in most cases, it’s more cost effective than trying to perform these tasks manually, or trying to cobble together a useful toolset solely from standalone tools that just perform one or a few of these tasks (although those types of tools have a place, too).Keep in mind that Moz is a complex tool that offers an incredible amount of power. While we don’t have room to walk through all of its capabilities, Moz’s Help Hub and Q&A Forum are both great resources to find assistance.Backlinks from other websites remain crucial for strong SEO in 2016.Ahrefs (as well as competitor Majestic, which can be equally recommended) allows you to go in-depth with analyzing links that point back to your blog or website, as well as helping you identify opportunities to earn fresh links.While Moz, Raven Tools, and other comprehensive SEO suites offer similar functionality (in fact, Moz and many others integrate with Majestic for backlink data), Ahrefs offers more dedicated power to link-related tasks. Plus, the cost isn’t too exorbitant to justify investing in another tool in addition to other SEO tools you may be using.The main use case for something like Ahrefs is to take a deep dive into your backlink profile, as well as to do competitive research who’s linking to your competition. It’s also useful for finding top-performing content on a given topic (similar to BuzzSumo), detecting crawl errors, and uncovering which keywords your competitors are ranking for. It’s all good stuff to keep tabs on.Doing social media marketing well has never been more challenging or more important. However, marketers and bloggers have never had more tools at their disposal to give themselves a competitive edge, either.We have an obvious bias here because we built CoSchedule to make managing and scheduling social media promotion for your blog posts easy.You’ll be able to easily schedule social media posts and to promote your blog posts all in one dashboard. That’s a big time saver.Our tool is built to have a multitude of uses throughout your content marketing workflow. However, when it comes to social media marketing, one application for CoSchedule you may not have considered is scheduling standalone social media content that isn’t connected to a blog post.You might just want to schedule social media posts on their own, or even drop curated content into your content calendar to publish in the future.WP Open Graph is a WordPress plugin that lets you add Open Graph meta data to your blog posts so you can better control how they’ll appear when you share posts on that platform.Ever tried sharing a blog post on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Google+ and got frustrated when you couldn’t quite control their appearance without a hassle? That’s why it’s worth considering using this plugin.You’ll be able to control the appearance of your blog posts on Facebook.However, it can also be used on static pages on your WordPress website as well. Simply find the plugin here and install it on your WordPress blog. From there, WP Open Graph works in the background with minimal work, automatically pulling your Featured Image in to ensure your blog posts look great on social media.If you aren’t currently doing any email marketing, now is the time to get started. Email delivers unbeatable ROI, and with the right tools, it doesn’t have to be too difficult or time consuming.MailChimp makes it easy to build visually appealing e-newsletters. The free version offers an impressive amount of power, while premium plans allow you to add features and send an unlimited number of emails.If you’re sending straight-forward text email newsletters without any visual styling (which may work for you), then you’re missing an opportunity to make your emails more eye-catching.One creative way to use MailChimp is to integrate it with your LeadPages landing page, feeding your email leads straight into your mailing list in MailChimp. Be sure to read MailChimp’s help and getting started docs.Recommended Reading: 21+ Easy Ways To Build An Email List That Will Skyrocket By 552% In 1 YearWhile there are a lot of advanced email marketing platforms out there, Campaign Monitor is the one we use at CoSchedule. We like the simplicity of its editing tools and ease of use when it comes to managing our email list.Campaign Monitor makes managing monstrous email lists easier.The use cases for Campaign Monitor are essentially the same as MailChimp, but for when you need something more powerful that allows you to manage a larger subscriber list. They have a ton of helpful resources to get you going.Think your ears are burning? Know who is talking about your blog or brand on the Web with a couple simple tools.Google Alerts is free to set up and will send you email notifications when certain keywords appear in news articles or blog posts. It sometimes misses things, but works well for the most part.It’s important to keep tabs on who is paying attention to your content and your brand. It can help you identify potential brands to partner with, keep you notified of potential linking opportunities (say, if someone mentions your name but doesn’t link back to your blog, you can always reach out to request a link).Create a short list of names people might use to refer to your brand or blog, put them into your Google Alerts account, and let the mentions roll into your email. For more on how to use it, Google has a help doc on that here.You can also use Google Alerts to get ideas for content curation. We covered a few other tools that will help with content curation in a post on social media best practices.If you need something more robust than Google Alerts, Mention should fit the bill. It goes beyond simple Web monitoring and adds social media monitoring for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, and more.Not only is it important to see what people are saying about your blog or brand, but it’s also important to respond to those folks (when and where appropriate). That’s a lot easier to do expediently when you have one place to log into.When you want to go beyond what Google Alerts can offer, and want to pull in brand mentions from across the Web and your social channels all in one place, Mention is your go-to tool. Mention has a bunch of great tutorial videos you should check out on YouTube.Modern marketing is all about data. While big data platforms can be expensive and far out of reach for many solo bloggers and in-house marketing teams in small business settings (which is the majority of our readers), you still have options for gathering data to help drive better business decisions.Google Analytics is the one data platform that every blogger and content marketer needs to be paying attention to, with 75% of our 2016 Better Marketing Survey takers saying they use it to monitor their performance.If you’ve neglected setting up Google Analytics (it’s not too difficult to get up and running, but configuring and customizing it properly admittedly can get tricky), it provides an incredible wealth of data about your blog and/or website.One way to get the most from Google Analytics is to use custom dashboards that will help present specific data you need for certain purposes. For example, if you wanted a way to just analyze referral traffic from social media, you could set up a custom dashboard with relevant social media data.If you need help, Google provides plenty of user-created custom dashboards and templates that you can download and use without having to configure them yourself. Take a look around their Analytics Solutions Gallery to find what you need.When sorting through our 2016 Better Marketer Survey data, we expected a lot of readers would report using Google Analytics. However, we were surprised to see just 16% of respondents use Google Search Console. That could be partially due to confusion because Search Console used to be called Google Webmaster Tools (a title some people still use to refer to it conversationally).It’s invaluable for helping to diagnose technical issues on your blog or website.Here are just a handful of applications inside Google Search Console:If you need help getting started, Moz has created an excellent Google Search Console guide that you may find useful.Want to pull all your social media stats into one dashboard for free? SumAll is what you need.It’s a convenient no-cost tool that helps you measure your social media performance. It’s an automatic report generation that is particularly useful and efficient.Just sign up, connect your social media accounts, and wait for all that sweet data to roll in. It’s a fairly simple tool that can help save time by letting you see everything in one place. While SumAll used to offer a free plan, it now requires a paid subscription.By now, you should have a solid grasp on the essential tools that every blogger and marketer needs. Hopefully, you’ve gained a better understanding of how to use them as well.Click To Tweet

											To answer your question of how often to blog, it’d be all too easy for me to just say, “Hey there, just do a blog schedule of one post per week,” and call this post complete.But. I’m a nerd. And I don’t believe that every blog is created equal, nor does it have the same audience. So there is no one clear way to answer that question other than to use your own data to help you find the perfect frequency and consistency that will help you grow.And to do that, we’re going to use maths. Yes. Maths. Now, I know you’re a creative person and if you’re anything like me, you probably loathed any class that had anything to do with numbers when you were back in school.So I’m going to walk you through how often to blog by helping you fill out your content calendar template that will translate your raw data into some super cool insights. When you’re done reading this post, you’ll know:This is the exact process we’ve used at CoSchedule to grow traffic to new blog posts by 299%. The idea is simple: Replicate the success from your best-performing content to improve every new post you publish. And you can do it, too.Get out your calculators because it’s about to rain numbers up in here. (See, I can’t even make a good math joke.)Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You’re about to go through a few steps with your data. To keep you from becoming overwhelmed, just know that the final outcome of this process will be the exact number of blog posts you need to publish to reach your goals.When you follow these steps, you’ll solve the frequency problem which leads directly into solving the consistency problem.Brainstorm the reasons why you’re blogging. It sounds silly because it might feel obvious, but the practice will help you hone in on the right ways to measure your success.For example, let’s say you use inbound marketing through your blog to sell a product. That’s terrific! While that’s your big picture goal, think about how your blog can actually contribute to that goal through traffic, email subscribers, and trial conversions.For the sake of this post—and to give you an example to follow through this process—let’s say you choose to measure your success through increasing traffic. Judging from the data you gave us in the Better Marketer Survey, that’s why you blog—to introduce your business to lots of people online.So: I am blogging to increase traffic.Now it’s time to understand the exact metric you’ll measure and find the tool that will give you that data.A robust and free tool to start with is Google Analytics. The tool will help you track general traffic metrics and also helps you track your conversion steps for goals like email subscriptions and trial signups.In the case for the example you’re following, you can use Google Analytics to measure increasing traffic with the metric of page views.So: For my broad goal to increase traffic, I’m going to measure success with this specific metric: page views.Look at the past several months to find the average amount you receive for that metric. You’ll use this data to help you understand how the changes you’ll make in frequency and consistency are helping you reach your goal.For example, if you’re measuring page views, take a look at your past three month’s individual contribution to that metric. Then average the three numbers to gauge an average month’s performance over the past quarter.So: I’m going to look at how many average page views I got per month over the last three months.Now all you have to do is gather the data for your metric and find the average. Use this equation to get started: __________ {sum of all metric in the sample} / __________ {# of months in the sample} = __________ {average month contribution}.You just did some math. Very nice.You need a baseline number from an average blog post. That means that you’ll need to review the same metric from several blog posts, giving them all the same opportunity to be successful.In other words, you need to find out the amount each post in a sample contributed to your metric within a certain period of time.Back to the example you’re following—you need to look at a nice sample size of blog posts (10 at least), and review how many page views each post delivered in the first 30 days after being published. The 30-day period means each post got an equal opportunity (more or less) to contribute to the metric.So: I’m going to look at how many page views 10 blog posts received in the first 30 days after they were published.Now it’s time to gather the data. Grab your content calendar template and enter in all of the URLs of the blog posts you’ll include in your sample, then grab the data for your baseline time period for each of those URLs.Find the average metric number for all of the blog posts in the sample by using this equation: __________ {sum of metric from all posts in the sample} / __________ {# of posts in the sample} = __________ {average post contribution}.This is where it gets really fun. :)Now you can actually set real goals based on data so you know they will be realistically achievable while also helping you shoot for growth.If you set goals before this point, you have no data-driven way to understand how each post you publish will contribute to your larger picture. It would be a guess—which will make your content calendar feel a whole lot more stressful.Anyway, SMART goals, as it were, stands for:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The good news is that you’ve done nearly all of this already by walking through this process right now. It’s the aspirational side of things that makes a great goal and pushes you into continued growth.A good goal is at least 10x growth month over month to keep you focused on projects that will help you truly grow. That means, you’ll want at least a 10% month-over-month increase with your metric.Back to your example: Let’s say you get 10,000 page views a month. 10% more than that is 11,000, so that’s your aspirational goal for next month.Do this: __________ {average month contribution} × 1.__________ {% aspirational growth} = __________ {new month contribution goal}.By this point, you know your aspirational goal for your content calendar for next month. Luckily for you, you also know how much each blog post contributes to that metric.So now you can simply add up how many blog posts you need to publish next month to reach your goal.Following your example, let’s say an average blog post of yours gets 2,500 page views. To exceed your monthly aspirational goal of 11,000 page views, you’d need to publish five blog posts next month (and you can realistically predict you’ll get 12,500 page views).Just follow this equation: __________ {new month contribution goal} / __________ {average post contribution} = __________ {# of posts needed to reach your goal}.Note: This formula completely leaves out long-tail metrics from blog posts you’ve published in the past. It is, however, a useful guide to help you understand how much more frequently you could blog to reach your goals.Use your best judgment to understand how much more you’ll need to publish and remember: SMART goals have to be realistically achievable.You’ll learn how to plan your calendar for long-term growth in a second, I promise.Now, this process will always suggest that you need to publish more content—increase your publishing frequency—to reach your aspirational goal.Like doing anything new, there is a learning curve that suggests adding more new things to your plate takes a bit longer initially than after you master the craft.You know those marathon runners? They don’t start out by running 26.2 miles on their first day. They train themselves by running shorter distances to build up the tolerance to make it all the way through the marathon. They’re strict on their running schedules and commit to success.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You need to have a similar commitment with your content calendar if you’re going to experience 299% more success than you are today. And that also means you need to schedule time for yourself to build up your publishing endurance.Back to that example: Let’s say you normally publish four new blog posts that each earn 2,500 page views a month—one every week that bring in a monthly total of 10,000 page views. To reach your aspirational goal of 11,000 page views, you’d like to publish five posts next month. That means you’ll publish one extra post next month to exceed your aspirational goal of 11,000 monthly page views by actually hitting 12,500.See how that works?Plan content in your calendar so that you can build up the tolerance to publish much more content:After you successfully publish your extra content, reflect on the process by asking yourself three simple questions:Constant iteration and improvement will help you build up your publishing endurance to help you increase your blogging frequency while also sharing content regularly and consistently.But what if you don’t want to publish more content, but rather, get more results from every blog post you plan to publish? It’s totally possible.You’ve probably had a post or two hit it out of the park. So wouldn’t it be great if every post you wrote from this point forward had the same success?It’s a question we asked ourselves at CoSchedule and figured out the process to help us strategically choose content to create that we know you’ll dig to help us reach our goals faster and make the effort of writing a blog post pay off that much more.And, it’s a process you can do with your content, too. How? You ask. Well, allow me to show you step by step.Whip out your content calendar template and create a list of every one of your blog posts’ URLs from at least the past nine months. You can go longer if you want—the point is to get a large sample.Critically think about what makes a successful blog post on your site.For this exercise, I scrutinized CoSchedule content and came up with four categories I felt made our content successful. You can start with these questions for your blog, too; or if you feel there is something else unique about your blog that makes your content successful in a different way, swap out a question.Keyword: Successful posts target a keyword and are optimized to rank well for that keyword to continue bringing in long-term traffic from an audience who often doesn’t already know you. By optimizing your content from the get-go, you continue getting traffic and building your audience well into the future without additional promotion.Question to ask yourself: Was the keyword well-chosen (for search volume and difficulty) and optimized throughout the post to help me get long-term traffic?Topic: Next, successful blog posts connect the keyword people use to find your content into the angle or unique value proposition for a problem they’d like to resolve. This shows your audience—even newcomers—that you’re deeply in tune with their challenges and you’re dedicated to helping them overcome their hurdles.Question to ask yourself: Was this a topic my readers would be deeply interested in learning more about?Research: Successful content backs up its claims with thorough research that proves why your advice is credible and worth following. Your credibility will build a following of readers who keep coming back.Question to ask yourself: Was this post deeply researched to share unique and better information than any other source on the Internet?Comprehensiveness: Call it complete, in-depth, or actionable. Comprehensiveness has nothing to do with word count, but rather, when you decide to tackle a topic that you give it everything you’ve got to go deep into the detail instead of just publishing catchy blog titles with content that barely scratches the surface of the promise you make in your value proposition.Question to ask yourself: Did the post turn the research into actionable, exhaustive how-to advice and end only when the entire story was complete?Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?At this point, you’re basing all of your thoughts on gut instinct: Was this post successful or not? There’s no data involved whatsoever yet. You’re just aiming to translate your gut into a grade. Kinda like a teacher grading your homework.For each of the questions, rank every post in your list on a 1 to 3 scale for each of the four categories of successful content: keyword, topic, research, comprehensiveness. 1 means the post is a stinker in that category whereas a 3 means it’s totally awesome.Go ahead and use your content calendar template to grade your content in each of the four categories you feel make your content successful. When you’re done, add up each blog post’s grade with the highest score a single post can receive being a 12 and the lowest possible being a 4.Now it’s time to find the contribution each blog post delivers to your aspirational goal. In your content calendar template, track the metric for the first 30 days after a blog post publishes.Additionally, grab the data from the following two months to give you a complete quarter’s worth of data.From here, you can measure the return on investment for every blog post after its first month’s worth of performance to help you predict how your blog posts will contribute to your goals a full two months after they publish. This is where you’ll learn more about that part I noted for residual long-term metrics and can add it into play as you improve your content calendar.Go into your content calendar template and sort your blog posts according to the grades you ranked them (12 being the highest and should be at the top of your sorted list).Go ahead and highlight your top five blog posts with red (#1), orange (#2), yellow (#3), green (#4), and blue (#5).Now sort all of your posts again according to the first 30 days they contribute to your metrics with the highest contributing post at the top of your list.You can see from your color coding how your gut actually translates into your most successful content. If your gut translated correctly, your top five posts should still be red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.So… Were you right? Were you wrong? Either way, there are lots of lessons you can learn from this process with the two biggest ones being:Do you see where you’re going with this?No more guessing. No more getting close but not quite right.Dissect the top five posts according to their contribution to your aspirational goal and replicate the success from your top-performing content.Here are a few questions you can ask yourself as you review that content:You get the picture. Figure out all the reasons why your audience loved those posts and repeat those elements in the new posts you plan on your content calendar.This process will help you get more out of every blog post you publish so you don’t have to publish more content, but rather, improve the quality of the content you publish.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Well, you’ve just gone through a lot. You know:But here’s the thing: You just found your best-performing blog posts that you can optimize even further and republish to get even more out of them.This simple republishing process will help you:Yeah, sold you, right? Finally: Something easy to fill up your content calendar. :)Lucky you! You already found your top-performing blog posts according to your aspirational goal. The only other qualifier for republishing is to make sure that the post you choose is at least six month old.The older, the better, since you don’t want to accidentally share something that’s somewhat new with your audience who may have already seen it.Adding more relevant content into your older blog post adds tons of value for your readers—even if they saw the original piece in the past. And according to Brian Dean’s research on the top 200 ranking factors Google uses in its search algorithm, Google also likes to see you refreshing your content.To top it off, when you add more actionable advice to your content and increase the length of your blog post, you have a higher likelihood of ranking well in search engines.Add new data: There came a point when you had to publish the post originally. There were probably other sources of data that you didn’t include in your initial content because you didn’t find them at the time or they didn’t even exist because they’re so new.That type of research can help keep your advice relevant—or could even help you make a couple new points that you didn’t think about before.Replace outdated information: When you continue researching your blog post, you might find new information that disputes your original suggestions.For example, in a post we republished called “25 Growth Hacks That Will Amplify Your Content Marketing“, I found out that one of the growth hacks from the original post wasn’t valid anymore because the website we referenced went out of business. I replaced that outdated information with a new growth hack that was similar but much more timely than the original idea.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Add more awesome advice: With time comes more experience. Think about how authors re-release their books several years after their original version with new edits and insights they’ve learned after getting published. Use the same process to add additional advice that builds on your original thought process to add more value.A way we do this at CoSchedule is by analyzing all of the how-to information in an older blog post before we republish.If we give advice on, say, “make an infographic to get more social shares”, we’ll back up the claim with new data that proves infographics still get more social shares than any other type of visual content. Then we’ll also give the step-by-step guidance on how to create that infographic (or link to a new blog post with lots more detail).See what I did there?You can apply the same process to your blog post before you republish it by analyzing areas you can flesh out with further step-by-step, actionable guidance.Optimize the post for keywords: Yeah, you probably targeted a keyword in your blog post originally. But the keyword game is changing a little bit, and it turns out you can target multiple related keywords in one blog post to get traffic from several different search terms.While I’ve taken a stab at keyword optimization, I’ll let Rand from Moz teach you how to do this because he’s wicked smart:Essentially, based on your original keyword, find synonyms or related keywords that will help you rank for a category-type of search.Optimize for email subscriber conversions: A lot of you are building your email list to keep your readers coming back for more of your awesome content. That’s a terrific idea, so you’ll love hearing that adding content upgrades into your blog posts can help you increase the number of email subscribers you receive from any blog post—including the ones you’re optimizing and republishing.Let me explain a bit about content upgrades: Since we started including bonus content like infographics, templates, worksheets, guides, and checklists in every blog post we publish here at CoSchedule, we’ve been able to increase our email subscribers by 552% in one year. Seriously.And you can experience similar success:Here’s how Neil Patel does this exact content upgrade process using LeadPages’ LeadBoxes:Neil Patel uses LeadBoxes from LeadPages to add content upgrades into his content to turn traffic into email subscribers.You can do it, too. And it’s especially handy for turning your high-trafficked posts into subscriber-generating machines.You can keep the republishing process simple to work through these projects faster than you would when you’d write a brand new post. This is how to republish a blog post in WordPress:Now, if you’d like to get a little picky about your blog and have that republished post show up on your home page, you could always go into the original post and change it to a time in the recent past (like say 30 minutes ago).Just be weary about accidentally changing the date on your already-published post to republish in the future—it’s no good unless you’re Michael J. Fox. :)Listen, I know this sounds like a lot, so hear me out:Why this process is worth every second you spend doing it even though you’re probably scared of what you read.You’re thinking right now:This guy’s crazy. I don’t have time for this!To which I’m thinking:How will you be able to improve without knowing how what you’ve done—and what you plan to do—has impacted your goal?And my bro Abraham Lincoln is backing me up:Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.If you really want to throw efficiency in the mix, consider this: Productivity is only as good as the content you produce and how it reaches your goal. Using your time to create effective content is far better than being efficient with your time.Using your time to create effective content is far better than being efficient with your time.Click To TweetHeck, Todd Henry sums it up best in his book, The Accidental Creative: How To Be Brilliant At A Moment’s Notice:We must learn to spend our time effectively rather than obsessing about efficiency.Do this, and I guarantee your content calendar will deliver the results you’re looking for.#RantOverI wouldn’t give you any advice I wouldn’t follow myself. This process is exactly how we plan our content calendar at CoSchedule, and it’s helped us keep our content calendar on track and reach our aspirational goals to grow super fast.Good luck with your content calendar!Click To Tweet

											What’s super cool about this sample of articles is that the research varies from studying billions (yes, seriously) of emails to more than 20 million, from case studies to roundups. The data is diverse, but there are dots to connect that’ll help you send emails on the best days and at the best times.Here are the studies:And here’s the analysis:According to these studies, prioritize your send days in this order:I’ll note: Some of the studies mentioned high opens and clickthrough rates on Saturdays and Sundays. Well, those are also the days when the fewest emails are sent. So while the open rates may be higher in general, the actual number of emails opened is way lower.Not every study had visual representations of the data in them, but you’ll find it interesting to see the similarity among the graphs that were present. It’s noteworthy that most activity happens during the middle of the week with only minor outliers. Here’s that data:GetResponse found the peak inbox activity happens on Thursdays. The second highest peak was on Wednesdays.Data from GetResponse.MailChimp also found high open rates on Thursdays, with a second peak on Tuesdays.Data from MailChimp.Further data from MailChimp and Wordstream suggests that Thursday and Tuesday are the best days to send emails.Data from Wordstream and MailChimp.Tuesdays get the most emails opened compared to any other day of the week though Saturdays may also be a good day to send email for its high open rate, according to data from Experian and analyzed by Customer.io.Data from Experian and Customer.io.HubSpot found that Tuesday is the best day to send email, followed with a tie for Monday and Wednesday.Data from HubSpot.MailerMailer found Tuesdays win for opens, with Wednesday coming in at a close second. For clicks, Sundays win, with Tuesday coming in second place. Note that since Sunday has lower opens, it’s likely easier to get that high of a clickthrough rate.Data from MailerMailer.Data from Dan Zarella and provided through GetResponse suggests sending emails on Saturday and Sunday and that it’s best for both clicks and opens.Data from GetResponse and Dan Zarella.While many of the studies found varying results, here is how you can prioritize your send times based on data:Take a look at the similarities in these graphs for a lot more detail on the analysis.Morning between 9–11 a.m. is definitely the best time to send email according to Campaign Monitor’s research. It looks like there is a peak at 10 a.m. Campaign Monitor sums it up by saying that 53% of emails are opened during the workday between 9 a.m.–5 p.m.Data from Campaign Monitor.MailChimp confirms with Campaign Monitor that sending emails later in the morning between 10 a.m.–noon will get you the most opens. It looks like the best time to send email is at 10 a.m.Data from MailChimp.Surprisingly, different research from MailChimp and analyzed by Wordstream suggests there may also be a peak for opens in the afternoon. Wordstream says 2 p.m. is also a peak time to send email.Data from Wordstream and MailChimp.Data from Experian and cited through Customer.io suggests a similar approach to Wordstream’s analysis to send emails later in the day. Customer.io found that email opens are highest from 8 p.m.–midnight, with a second peak between 4–8 p.m.Customer.io suggests that while it’s a common practice to check email in the mornings, most people are just beginning their day and may likely avoid email marketing in favor of productivity.Data from Experian and Customer.io.HubSpot researched open times to find late morning tends to get the most opens. Send emails at 11 a.m. for the best results.Data from HubSpot.Data from MailerMailer also suggests that sending emails in the late morning during work hours gets the best percentage of opens. Send your emails at 10 a.m.Data from MailerMailer.Dan Zarella’s research, as analyzed by GetResponse, suggests 6 a.m. is a peak time to send emails, followed by late in the evening from 8 p.m.–midnight.Data from GetResponse and Dan Zarella.Every one of the studies this post analyzes mentioned in some way that the best times to send emails depends on your own audience.Here’s a memorable quote from Megan at Wordstream:That’s the advice. Now ignore it.If that’s true, then why do so many studies offer similar information that suggests sending emails on Tuesdays at 10 a.m. will be the most successful?Still, it does make sense to use these days and times to start a test for your own audience. As John from MailChimp notes:But keep in mind, the primary driver of engagement for your list is you: your content, your industry, the list you’ve uploaded.Both Megan and John are right, though. And that’s why you can use your own data and Google Analytics to help you send email more effectively.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?There are two phases to understand the best times to send email to your audience:It’s really simple if you plan your work, then work your plan.Follow this outline to test your days and times to send email. Regardless of how many emails you send during a week, you can walk through this process from first email to last email over the time frame that works best for you.It’s like a checklist for the days and times you’ll send your next 12 emails:That is now your plan for the next 12 emails you’ll send to your subscribers. Keep in mind, research also shows that 23% of your subscribers will open emails within 60 minutes after you send them. So It’s fine to schedule your emails to send 30 minutes prior to the peak time.What you’re really after is understanding how much traffic your emails are contributing to your blog. After all, these are your most loyal readers who read, share, and bring additional traffic to your site.So while you could go into your email service provider’s dashboard to look at your open and clickthrough rates, an easier way to gauge the performance of your test is by using Google Analytics and reviewing your referral traffic from email.When you first open this report, you’ll simply set the start date and end date to the times when you ran the test. Then select Email.Choose the date range of your test, then select “Email” in the Google Analytics custom report.Once you click through to filter your data to show only referral traffic from email, you’ll see the best days that are giving you the most traffic listed in order according to page views. From there, you can click through again to see the best times by hour when you receive that traffic.This view shows the days of the week when you get the most traffic from email. Click through to see the best times on these specific days.This is probably the best place to start with your research. Something that has stuck with me from this analysis was a comment from Mark Brownlow all the way back from 2009:
Another trap is to think of “best day” and “best time of day” as two separate issues. The best time to send depends on the day you send it. And vice versa.
That seems like good advice.Just like the first report, enter in the date range when you did your email test, then filter to see only referral traffic from Email.Set your date range of your test, then filter to see email only in your Google Analytics custom report.From there, you’ll see your best times to send email based on data from your own audience.Review the best time to send email by hour according to your own traffic data.It’s that easy to set up your email test.But you want even more traffic than you’re already getting… so a good next step would be to get more opens. And the best way to improve that is by writing even better email subject lines.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?It’s no secret that one of the primary drivers of opens is your email subject line. It’s the part that usually stands out the most in your subscribers’ inboxes right from the get-go, making your first impression for the content you’re sending.So if opens lead to clickthroughs, and opens come from awesome email subject lines, let’s explore a few data-driven ways to write those subject lines so they help you reach your goal to get more traffic.There is a lot of advice out there to help you write better subject lines. Upon review, a lot of that advice has a lot in common. This analysis breaks down the best information I could find and compares it to some of CoSchedule’s open rates, too:Let’s get started.A while back, Garrett analyzed more than 1 million headlines and found that how to, list, and question headlines get more social shares than any other type of blog title.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Not surprisingly, the research for email subject lines suggests that these same three types of messaging tend to perform really well for getting opens.Examples:Recommended Reading: Here Are The 101 Catchy Blog Title Formulas That Will Boost Traffic By 438%There’s an old adage that helps marketers get into the heads of their audience: What’s in it for me? Judging from the data, answering that question in your email subject line is an awesome way to increase your open rate.You could call this a benefit, appealing to self-interest, or sharing your value proposition. The point is this: Make it clear what your audience will get if they just open your email to experience something they really desire.Examples:Social proof helps your subscribers see themselves being successful—which works especially well when they see others rocking your solution. So use your email subject line to appeal to the benefits of stories, case studies, examples, and testimonials scattered throughout your blog post.Examples:A lot of successful email subject line examples suggest that uniqueness gets opens. Think of including jokes, humor, or something unexpected in your subject line—anything that arouses curiosity beyond the same-old, same-old.Examples:Recommended Reading: How To Build Your Brand With Humor So You’ll Feel Like A HumanThe fear of missing out is a powerful motivator because it gets your subscribers thinking, “What do they know that I don’t?” Showing a deadline, appealing to a sense of urgency, or even suggesting scarcity in your email subject line can help you increase your opens.Examples:It’s true that blog posts that feel fresh or essentially reporting on the news in your niche get some of the most social shares of any type of content. In fact, news posts get the most social shares of any type of content (yes, seriously).When you write content that appeals to recent events in your industry, use those facts, subjects, and teasers in your email subject lines to spread the word quickly.Examples:LengthThere is an old-school rule that email subject lines should be about 50 characters long. Since 54% of emails are opened on mobile devices, that seems like it’s still a pretty good idea: The shorter your email subject line, the better.CaseHubSpot calls it the “e.e. cummings subject line” and it’s something copywriting master Joanna Wiebe of CopyHackers does consistently: Write your email subject line in all lowercase.Joanna says this approach is more like how a friend or family member would email you, and she offers this advice for email subject line writing:So do yourself a favor and repeat after me:Nobody actually wants to hear from me.They only want to hear from their friends.Your task, then, is to sound as much like their trusted friends, colleagues and/or clients as you can… without being tricky… or gimmicky… or lame.Follow that exercise for every subject line you write, and you’ll get the opens you’re shooting for.Nearly every email service provider lets you send A/B tests for your subject lines. You can do this same exercise for your own subject lines to help you understand why your audience opens and improve all of your future subject lines.Simply write down your winner and loser from the test, the difference in the results, and scrutinize the reason why your winner performed the best:You can see from these examples that we’ve been trying to strongly appeal to the benefits behind opening the email. Nearly all of these subject lines reuse the blog titles to test for the best-performing headlines. There is still room for improvement!Recommended Reading: We A/B Tested Our Email Subject Lines For Months. Here’s What We Learned.Once you get that email open, how can you get the most clickthroughs from your subscribers to read your blog post? It’s a good question that deserves a simple and data-driven answer.While your email subject line is one of the primary ways to get email opens, the design of your email can also impact your success.Data says that Neil Patel’s plain text email will get more opens and clickthroughs than MarketingProfs’ HTML-enhanced email.You might think that a designed email—or HTML-enhanced with a theme of some kind—would increase your opens and clickthroughs. But when HubSpot researched the idea of HTML versus plain text emails, they found that HTML emails actually decreased both their open and clickthrough rates.They summarized their findings with a very bold statement:Aside from proper list segmentation, nothing boosts opens and clicks as well as an old school, plain-text email.Super surprising, right?Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?But HubSpot wasn’t the only one to come to that conclusion. DIYthemes also testing a plain text version of their e-newsletter which their subscribers absolutely loved.And when we at CoSchedule tested several HTML-enhanced emails for the ones we use to announce new blog posts, we found that our plain text versions increased the amount of opens by 3.5% while decreasing our clickthroughs by 2.12%.At first, you might think that data is a bit misleading, but that 3.5% increase in opens means that more overall subscribers are clicking through to read our content, despite the slight percentage drop in clickthroughs.So why is that?To bring up Joanna Wiebe’s awesome point from writing subject lines, it’s because plain text emails look more authentic and less spammy than HTML-enhanced emails. HubSpot came to the same conclusion in their research, hinting that email filters may be strong enough to weed out over-enhanced emails.If Joanna and HubSpot are right on those assumptions, then data backs it up. More of your subscribers see email as a 1-to-1 communication tool that plain text messages seem to reflect while HTML-enhanced emails scream mass marketing.Another reason HTML-enhanced emails may perform slightly worse than plain text emails could be due to the fact that the message in the email itself often begins with gibberish.Let me explain.This is what HTML-enhanced emails look like before you open them:These three examples are HTML-enhanced emails before being clicked through. You can tell there’s something odd about them from their introductory text.And this is what informal plain text emails look like before you open them:Here are two examples of plain text emails with intriguing and informal introductions.No one wants to feel like you’re marketing to them, but rather, that they’ve opted in to receiving information that will help them. Email is a way for you to build trust with the audience that is the most likely to convert into real customers. So, how can you build that trust?Just write like you would to a friend. It’s just fine to start an email with Hey there. Let people into your lives a bit like this example of many from Noah Kagan:Noah Kagan uses email to build relationships with his subscribers. You feel like you know him through his informal writing and humor.Now, I’m not saying you have to be super whimsical like Noah, but I know that he’s built lists that have added up to seven figures of email subscribers (yes, that means more than a million subscribers). So how does he retain those email subscribers? By treating email as an avenue for a relationship. You read his emails and feel like you know the guy even if you’ve never met him.Focus your message on explaining the value your subscribers will get when they visit your blog post. Now, the value isn’t the same as what your post covers, but answers the question, what’s in it for me?There are a few ways to do this:Now, if you don’t know those things, chances are… you probably don’t know your audience very well and that may reflect in your content. Here are three simple ways to get the information you need to write more effective emails:Another email writing tip involves a bit of simple psychology: Write your email in a way that helps your subscribers feel like they’ve already made the decision to click through to read your blog post.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?What does that mean?It means using proven phrases like these……because those phrases assume the subscriber will act on the advice you provide or they will feel the cognitive dissonance of knowing they should have done something but they chose not to.That technique leads directly into a call to action your subscribers can envision themselves doing. For example, here’s what that could look like for this post specifically:You see how each of those examples suggests that you will do the action, and that when you do, you’ll solve a problem and get the benefits.Recommended ReadingYou just learned a ton of information that will help you get more traffic from email marketing.

Schedule Pins on your calendar for any future date/time and they’ll post themselves to your designated board.This is really cool and a welcome integration.  Good job.Why can’t I use this from my currently paid plan?

The Pinterest integration is available on any non-legacy calendar. You can calculate your upgrade options in the billing section: https://app.coschedule.comHope this helps!Hi, so as I understand it this is only available if existing users upgrade to a new plan? (Also can you schedule pins to different boards, including secret ones?) @verushkaaneditor:disqus Pinterest is available on any of our current pricing plans, so if you’re in one of those, no upgrade necessary! Also, re different boards: you can’t Pin to secret boards, but you can schedule Pins to any public board. Hope this helps!Seriously amazing amazing, all we need would be ability to save some pins from pinterest itself to pin later? or can the chrome extension do that! because then that would save up  some money for many bloggers, just did my blog post draft about you guys, at 1000 words right now so would love answer to this question because then it is even better than expected!@feuza if you want to curate Pins to schedule for later, the Chrome Extension is the perfect tool for that!but can you curate right inside pinterest though? so tailwind allows you to save pins to secret board then you schedule them out, so with the extension can I save other folks pins inside pinterest so it gets repined to boards later?@disqus_7DSvDTupmO:disqus right now Pinterest’s API doesnt allow repins directly from Pinterest or secret boards. If anything changes we’ll let you know!Are you guys using Pinterest’s API because Tailwind is and thus why I had preferred them vs Boardbooster so the pins look likes it from inside pinterest and not out etcthanks for your quick replyBest news of the week! Saving me some $ as well!Is there any limit to the number of pins you can set? And as someone else mentioned, is there an ability to schedule repins or is it just new pins?Hey @misfitalexa:disqus Pinterest’s API currently doesn’t support repins. As for # of pins scheduled, no limit :) My only recommendation, avoid looking spammy, Pinterest will flag boards if the same pin is posted over and over again.That was the missing piece that I needed!!!  Love all that great features, the knowledgeable staff and your newsletter :)I’m so happy you are enjoying our content and features! :) Happy blog planning!I purchased my account on an annual billing program less than a year ago. Yet that plan was declared “Legacy” and I don’t get to use any of the new features without paying more.  I think that’s a very lousy thing to do to a customer. If you’re going to offer an annual plan, you should keep that customer up to date for the term of the plan.  Doing otherwise is poor business.© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,0

											Who are the 100 million people who use Pinterest, with more Pinners coming in every day to make it the fastest growing website by overall member growth?Your audience is present. You just need to share great stuff to discover their interests and help them find you. From there, you can use minimum viable data to understand what they’re looking for. Then you’ll be able to share even better content.Focus on publishing really good content that’ll establish you as an expert in your field.The same applies for gaining traction on Pinterest and for growing your follower base in general.Your content core is a special place where you take into consideration what your audience really cares about and combine it with what you want to say.On Pinterest, your boards are where you share your Pins, so name your boards in a unique way.Pinterest suggests you should set your boards up like window displays. You want them to appeal to your audience’s tastes and also keep them coming back for more. Here’s a basic look at it from their perspective:Rebekah Radice takes Pinterest’s advice one step further with a few great ideas that’ll help you choose awesome names for your boards. Make them eye-catching, keyword rich, and content specific.She’s right.Start With:Something like 80% of the content shared on Pinterest are Repins.When Pinning, abide by the 80/20 rule: Share 80% of other people’s content and only 20% of your own.For every piece of content that you share, that is yours, Repin four Pins from others.Click To TweetAs you begin, your goals will be:If you look at your blog, I’m sure you’ll find that you have some awesome visuals that are Pin-worthy. There are probably also a few images you could improve.Steps To Improve Your Visuals:After you’ve gone through all your posts, you’ll be able to share the ones that have great visuals to Pinterest. Easy!Recommended Reading:You’ll need to have high-quality imagery to get noticed. That doesn’t mean you have to be an artist or designer. It just means you have to take some visual guidelines into account when you use Pinterest for marketing.In this day and age, stock photography is out and custom imagery is in! According to Pinterest, Pins should be helpful, beautiful, and actionable. So get creative and use some awesome tools.Your graphics will help you stand out from other brands, so when you create your imagery, remember that images without faces receive 23% more Repins than those with faces.Curalate found a few key characteristics that can make your Pinterest images successful. Red and orange colored Pins get twice as many Repins than images that are blue—and Pins with multiple dominant colors, too. Color can be vital to your Pin’s success, so do a little research on the emotion behind color, and you’ll do great!Lastly, Curalate found that Pins with smoother, less distracting backgrounds received more traffic. This follows the idea that simplicity in design is more. Plus, it’s great for mobile viewing!Recommended Reading:Another element you can add to your imagery is an overlay. Text overlays can be great for clarifying an overall message of the Pin since your photo might have a broad context.Overlays can also be handy when you use them in embedded Pins outside of Pinterest (say embedded into your blog posts).Keep in mind the size of your visual so it displays nicely on Pinterest.When you design your image, choose 735 pixels as your width. You can choose for your Pin to be any length that you’d like it to be.Curalate found that Pins with a 2:3 (1,102 pixels tall) or 4:5 aspect ratio received the most traffic. Test out which size works best for you. At CoSchedule, we like to design graphics to specifically complement our blog posts, so in cases such as an infographic, the longer the better.While it’s important to make your images look awesome, it’s even more important that you understand your content, and the message behind it. Experiment with your Pins so you can stay true to your brand. Don’t be scared to try new design tools and to share new ideas.Mitt Ray writes about Pinterest a lot. And he compiled some pretty interesting data to help you write better descriptions for your Pins so you can get the attention your content deserves.Mitt suggests that by writing a great Pin, your audience will have a better chance of finding your awesome content.Writing An Awesome Pin:Vincent Ng took a stab at describing the value hashtags provided on Pinterest and how to use them efficiently, coming up with a handful of solid tips:Recommended Reading: How To Make Writing For Social Media Work For Your BusinessOnly about 75–100 characters actually show up in your Pin description in the grid view on a board, so don’t bury the lede: Put the most important information in your description first.Did you know that?Besides the typical ‘Normal’ Pin and Repins, Pinterest also has Rich Pins, Buyable Pins, and Promoted Pins you can use to enhance your reach.Rich Pins are normal Pins that you can add additional context to, thus the name ‘Rich’ Pins.There are five categories that Rich Pins fall into: product, recipe, article, movie, and place.By creating a Rich Pin, you get to define what the open-graph meta tags are so your Pins automatically populate in the Pinterest categories and searches. That’ll help people find your content faster and easier than ever.This can make quite a difference for brands who are trying to sell their product, especially when two million people save Rich Pins to their boards every day!Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Buyable Pins are one of Pinterest’s newest features!Buyable Pins have blue buttons that are located up near the ‘Pin it’ button. They help you to make a purchase right there without ever having to leave the Pinterest app.Source: Business for PinterestPinterest does this to keep people on Pinterest, so they don’t “take a cut from your sales and you still get to handle shipping and customer service the way you always have.”Today, any business that uses Shopify has access to Buyable Pins, and those that use Demandware should see this option soon.Pinterest has continued to make changes and updates to promoted Pins in order to make them work even better. Promoted Pins are similar to Facebook Promotions since you can purchase them to reach more followers.Promoted Pins increase engagement rates up to 2–5% and are cost-per-click. Promoted Pins are only available in the US and in Canada.Did you know that over 80% of all Pins are Repins?Cision noted that several studies have found that you can optimize your Pins for Repinning by using 200—300 characters in your Pin description.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?When we Pin at CoSchedule, we include the headline that we created with the headline analyzer in our Pin description. Then we create a Repinning task in our marketing calendar specifically to remind us to Repin great content marketing content to our board. More than half of our traffic comes from Repinning alone!While Pinning is the first step to growing your presence on Pinterest, these four different kinds of Pins can greatly impact your followers, sales, and traffic. Consider what your business is trying to achieve, and pick the one that works best for you!Remember, though, never stop Repinning. Repinning works, and should be a daily practice.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Well, you’ve learned a lot about creating the best content for Pinterest—including how to design your visuals and how to write your Pin descriptions. You even know the right types of Pins that’ll work best to help you reach your marketing objectives.So now it’s time to optimize your work to make sure you reach the most people every time you Pin.Makes sense, right? If some categories get more browsers, you’ll get more attention for your content when you categorize them accordingly.Here are the most-browsed Pinterest categories:About a year ago, Pinterest also released the most popular categories per day:And if you’re feeling like any of this just isn’t what you need for your marketing, Pinterest has a great resource for you to see what categories are popular any day you’d like. I’ve found as you refresh the page, new categories appear, which could inspire some ideas for your categorization.We recently took a look at the top 10 studies on the best times to post on social media. The research has a handful of takeaways to help you get the most out of your new Pins.Quick Sprout suggests that the best day to Pin is on Saturday. Neil Patel’s deeply researched post says that 8–11 p.m. on Saturdays should get you the best results. Neil also pulled together some information from several sources that suggests 2–4 a.m. and 2–4 p.m. are awesome times to Pin.Elle & Co. and SurePayroll agreed with Neil’s findings, saying that 8–11 p.m. on Saturday is a great time to Pin. SurePayroll also found that anytime on Saturday morning and Fridays at 3 p.m. are great times to Pin, too.Data from Pinerly and presented by Social Fresh suggests that anytime from 2–4 p.m. and 8 p.m.–1 a.m. are good times to Pin.Comprehensive Data Says The Best Times To Post To Pinterest Are:That seems like a lot of good times, right?The data for Pinterest’s best posting frequency differs quite drastically depending on the source.So what’s the verdict? It’s perfectly acceptable to share lots of content every day, including a rich amount of Repins from other Pinners mixed into your overall sharing strategy.Sujan Patel even confirms that Pinning regularly can help you grow your followers.Buzzfeed found out that “When a reader comes from the Pinterest app on mobile, we show the ‘Pin it’ button right on top of the image. We found that this increases Pinning by 10 times!”Yikes, that’s a big change Buzzfeed saw when their Vice President Of Growth And Data, Dao Nguyen, and her team added a Pin it button to their graphics.We have also noticed on our blog here at CoSchedule that when we include a hover button over the images, that we tend to get more Pinterest shares. SumoMe has a great tool to help you do this yourself.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?It’s pretty easy to embed single Pins or even entire boards right into your content to help you prove a point. And this is a way to get more Repins for your content simply because you’ve made it easy to share:;Simply use the Pinterest code generator to grab the widget and embed it right into your blog posts. Done.Brian Honigman provided a Pinterest marketing tip that Peg Fitzpatrick and Rebekah Radice taught him on Social Media Examiner.Essentially, create a great visual in a blog post, schedule a Pin, grab the URL of that Pin, and share it on Google+. In your Google+ post, share the link to read your blog post, and also suggest that people Pin the image if they don’t have the time to read it now so they can save it for later.While Rebekah uses this strategy for Google+, I’m sure it would also work well in emails, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more.Pinterest itself gives this marketing tip, suggesting:Get into a regular cadence of saving Pins to your boards. That way, your audience gets fresh content in their home feed (and they get to know what your brand is all about).As you plan consistent content with your editorial calendar, it just makes sense to share your content consistently on Pinterest. And now that you can schedule your Pins with CoSchedule, there’s no reason to hold off.You’ve learned a ton about how to use Pinterest for marketing.You now know:Now, go and implement what you’ve learned into your own content on Pinterest.Click To Tweet

							Ashton is CoSchedule's graphic designer who takes written content, throws it through an unbelievable design brain, and makes everything we do even better. Photographer, designer, artist.Everyone knows what hashtags are. However, not everyone knows how to use hashtags well. Be a hashtag expert and increase your social media reach here.What if we said 77% of you reading this post could get 192% more traffic by following this social media posting schedule? This post will show you how.Thanks for this amazing Pinterest Guide! I’ve learnt so much with this article than in 3 years :-) Thank you!Thanks so much, Rocky! Happy pinning :)Every time I hear about putting URLs in the pin description, it seems to flip from “do it” to “don’t do it.” Is there any evidence on which actually works? The naysayers say it discourages repins. Inquiring minds want to know ;)Personally, I don’t mind Pinning pins with URLs in the description – however, I refrain from that myself as it looks promotional. I’ll see if I can find more data on which strategy works best. What I do is enter the link in the website field, then put the title in the description box. Other pinners like writing more here, but I find that the shorter, the better. Below is a screenshot of a blog post I wrote that received more than a hundred rePins in the past 3 weeks. I find that the “Visit” button works just as well even if there’s no URL in the description.Thanks for your input! Just a thought, if you have article rich pins, you don’t need to add the title as it’s pulled in automatically – and in bold type. Gotta love that.Congrats on the repins!I play around with it because lots of folk say to do it, if you think about it Pinterest is a buying platform as they have rich pins which show more data like price and inventory as well as buy now button right inside of Pinterest so I feel Pinterest does not mind that as they add more info on rich pins even, true question is how does the user like it so I keep tossing back and forth with it too. I do like calls to action.Amazing stats here, Ashton. Thank you for sharing it with us. I’m usually on Pinterest (it’s my fave next to Facebook) so it’s no trouble for me pinning a dozen or more a day. I love it!Agreed, I absolutely love it both for business and my personal life… which is probably why it’s so popular worldwide haha. Thanks for reading!Great info but I found a typo, it should be pins WITHOUT faces and not with faces receive 23% repin, I am so glad you guys have integrated Pinterest now, game changer and I scoped about it yesterday Also if you apply for Rich Pins and you sell products online, then they become product pins so they will automatically add price for you which is great and you don’t have to list price in descriptionThat’s great to know! By ‘product pin’ do you mean promoted or buyable pins? I’d like to know more about that.hum thought I replied to this so I mean e commerce sites that have rich pin or site that shows price etc, usually rich pin picks up that info and adds it if site has signed up for rich pins, buy pins are the blue ones and differentHey Fueza, thanks so much for reading! I appreciate the typo catch, and have update the post as mentioned. We’re so excited about the feature, and I’m glad to hear you are, too!you are welcome, no worries and yes so excited about thisHi there – wonderful, wonderful guide. I think the graphic is slight wrong too? It says as point ONE to use faces in your images, and it should be NOT to use them – this is definitely the advice I have had from Pinterest up until now. Thanks again for a great resource, HelenHey Helen, glad you enjoyed it! Yes, the visual should be updated too, thanks for the reminder!That’s a masterpiece of a guide. I’ll take all of these recommendations for a s-pin [pin intended (ok, I’ll stop here)]. But I meant it though. Great blog post.Hey Yuval, thanks so much for reading! Glad we could help :) Happy pinning!Awesome, when people follow these tips, they know your serious about Pinterest!That’s the hope! Thanks so much for reading, Alecia :)Great guide!I’ve been hearing, and even read awhile ago, that Pinterest is demeriting pins with links & hashtags in the description.  Above, you encourage including a link in the description.What’s a girl to do?~KeriDef no hashtags. That info is very outdated.Hey Louise, thanks for reading! I think our main point in the blog was that hashtags don’t work the same on Pinterest as on Twitter, and that if they’re used at all, to use the tips mentioned by Vincent Ng. Hashtags on Pinterest definitely aren’t for everyone, but in the case that they are used, there’s a few tips to keep in mind.Thanks for adding that Pinterest says posts with hashtags will be suppressed. Using 2-year-old info about social media (Vincent’s post is from Feb 2014) is pretty much like going back to the dark ages. Usually your posts are amazing so I’m sorry to be critical here.When it comes to Pinterest, I think like the average user and practice my best judgment. Although I do promote my own stuff, I keep in mind that apart from a digital marketer, I’m also an avid Pinterest fan. I think putting ourselves in our audiences’ shoes help big time. After all, aren’t we all customers at some point, too? Perhaps the same things that irritate us apply to most of our audiences as well (i.e. i don’t add hashtags because I don’t pin stuff with hashtags either).Yes, I couldn’t agree more! If we ourselves as marketers ask ourselves if we’d appreciate our actions as a consumer—that should be our rule book for best practices.This came right as I was about to revamp everything for Pinterest, so thanks a bunch!  Started Rx on my boards even after reading your first tip, as I realized I needed to be even MORE specific on my board names and topics.Hey Jennifer, I’m so glad to hear it was good timing! At CoSchedule, we recently made our boards more specific, too. Hope it works for both of us :) Cheers!Awesome post. Very comprehensive. Thanks so much for the great tips!You’re very welcome, Nikki!

											Here are a few reasons why:In this post, we’ll cover the most essential basics for blogging-focused readers. If you’ve never worked with HTML before, this will be a perfectly paced primer to get you started.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?If you have a bit of experience with web coding, you’ll still likely pick up a new tip or two (plus, be sure to download the free HTML cheat sheet to use for future reference).If you’re a marketer or blogger working with WordPress, and you’re intimidated by the mass of “who-knows-what” you see when you click into the Text editor in your CMS, this post is for you.While you can accomplish most of the tasks outlined in this post using the standard WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) WordPress editing controls, knowing how to do things the old-fashioned way is still beneficial (especially when things go wrong and those editing controls seem powerless to help).The standard WordPress kitchen sink offers a lot of power. It isn’t always perfect, however, and sometimes it’s faster to edit your content’s formatting manually. That’s where some basic HTML knowledge comes in handy.HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It forms the structure of a website and has been the backbone of the Internet since the dawn of time (or at least the dawn of the modern Internet).HTML is used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is used to control the appearance of a website. For the purposes of this post, we’ll focus just on HTML, and only on a small handful of tags any beginner can put to use.This video provides a simple overview of how HTML documents are created (watch this before you proceed):It’s okay if that seemed like a lot to wrap your head around. We’ll walk through much of the information here in a bit.Pro Tip: You can view a website’s source code in most browsers. This can be useful for seeing how websites are built by observing the code itself. Here’s how to do this using several popular web browsers:Here is an example of Google’s home page with the Show Page Source option selected in Safari on Mac OS X.If you’ve ever tried to edit content in WordPress, then you know the formatting functions fail to work the way you want them to sometimes. That’s because WYSIWYG editors don’t always work as well as intended. For example, a bulleted list may appear with extra spaces. Your text might not copy and paste correctly. You might want to change the color of your blog theme, but you might not know how.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?These are just a few issues you’re likely to run into. However, if you know a little HTML, they’re issues you can fix. You’ll become a more capable marketer and a more valuable employee.In general, you’ll gain more control over your content’s structure and appearance.Here are some specific tasks bloggers and marketers can tackle with HTML:These are just a handful of helpful things you’re about to learn how to do. If you’ve never touched the Text view section of your WordPress posts, you’ll probably feel a bit more confident in your skills too.If you haven’t yet, we highly recommend downloading the HTML cheat sheet that accompanies this post. It’s useful for you to have on hand so that all the common HTML tags are readily accessible.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Ready to write and edit some HTML yourself? You could get started now using the Text editor in any WordPress post. However, you can also use Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or Sublime Text (Mac, Windows, Linux) and your web browser of choice.Follow these steps to create a simple HTML file:1) Create a blank file .txt file. Write your HTML. Then, save your document as an HTML file.Here is an example of a quick HTML file we created:2) Click File in your top navigation bar. Then, scroll down to Open File:3) Select your HTML file and click Open. It’ll look something like this:Now that you have some understanding of what HTML is and how it works (and you’ve downloaded the HTML cheat sheet, right?), let’s get started on some basic HTML tutorials.Let’s start with some basic text formatting.HTML uses six different levels of section headings. They are structured like this:Here’s what they look like on the CoSchedule blog:A few things to note about header tags:If you’d like to make text bold, use this tag:In the past, you may have seen bolded text created using the <b>Insert Bolded Text</b> tag. While the <b></b> tag still works, it’s considered outdated. For this post, we’ll stick with best practices and recommend the <strong></strong> tag instead.Similar to making text bold, there are two different tags you can use to create italics. The emphasis tag is the best one to use:You may have seen italicized text using the <i>Insert Text</i> tag, but once again, this tag is considered outdated.To create a text paragraph, use <p>Insert Text</p>. Here’s an example:If you’d like to force a space between two lines of content, consider using a page break. Simply add the <br> tag between lines of content, like this:We don’t actually think we’re geniuses, and I’m certainly no Shakespeare. We just wanted to make sure you were still paying attention.If you have a quote that’s a few lines long (or more), it should be formatted in a block quote. You could do this in WordPress by clicking here:Or, you can wrap your text using this tag: <blockquote>Insert Text</blockquote>.Here’s how block quotes appear on our blog:You’re probably thinking, “WordPress makes it easy to create links, doesn’t it?”However, there is still value in knowing how to manually create links. Plus, there are some things WordPress can’t do when it comes to links, that need to be performed manually.Let’s go over how links are built in HTML, how to link between different sections of an individual post (this is a handy way to build a table of contents), and how to add no-follow attributes (which are potentially powerful for SEO).To create a text link, you’ll need to use the “href” tag. It looks like this:Place your desired URL (this will be the page you link to) and anchor text (the linked text a reader will click) where noted.Here’s an example:Here’s what the end result looks like:Let’s say we want to change the anchor text in the example link shown above. In this case, simply open the Text view option in WordPress. Then, delete the existing anchor text, and rewrite it:That’s all it takes.If you know a little bit about search engine optimization, then you likely understand follow versus no-follow links.In short, search engines use links to determine the importance of web pages. When a site links to another site, they see this as a vote or an endorsement saying, “This content is useful, and related to the web page linking to it.”However, there may be times you don’t a link to pass authority to another website. Here are a few examples:The more high-quality website links that you have, the more likely you are to rank in search engines. However, because of this, there are people out there who try to spam search engines with manipulative linking practices (including buying links and writing junk blog posts just to get backlinks without regard for content quality).For more information straight from Google on why you should use no-follow links for guest blog posts specifically, watch this video from Matt Cutts, former head of Google’s web spam team:To add a no-follow attribute to a text link, add the code rel=”nofollow” to your href HTML:It’s as simple as that.Now you know how to add a link to another web page or website. However, how do you link to another section within a single blog post?Follow these steps:Here is what this code looks like in WordPress (we’ve used Lorem Ipsum filler text, just for demonstration purposes):Here’s what the end result looks like:Now, we can navigate from the top of the page to the next section in one click. However, there is one problem: we can’t get back to the top as easily.Fortunately, there is an easy solution.We’ll add a “Back to Top” link underneath the “Here’s Something About Lorem Ipsum” section. We will also add a destination anchor at the top of the page with no anchor text (this way, the link will direct to the top of the page, but no unwanted text will appear to readers).Here’s how the Back To The Top link appears:Since we did not specify anchor text for this link destination, nothing appears to the reader. However, clicking “Back To The Top” still directs to the top of the blog post.There are two different types of lists you can create using HTML. These are bulleted (or unordered) and numbered (or ordered) lists. Here’s how to create each one (knowing how to build these manually can help you edit them more easily by hand in case WordPress messes up their formatting).It’s easy to create a bulleted list (or an “unordered list”) using the appropriate button in your WordPress tool bar:You can also build one manually:Here’s what this code looks like in a web browser:Have you ever tried creating a bulleted list, only for WordPress to somehow mess up your formatting? Sometimes, minor formatting issues are easy to fix using the WYSIWYG editing bar. However, sometimes it feels a little bit more like this:In cases where WordPress won’t cooperate, it’s probably faster to edit your list HTML manually.To create a numbered list (or an “ordered list”), follow the same directions as shown above, but change the <ul> and </ul> tags to <ol> and </ol>.Here’s what this list looks like:The deep linking technique described above can be used to build a table of contents.Let’s walk through how to do this, using another recent post on our blog as an example:When complete, your code should look something like this:This looks something like this on our blog:Then, the end of this section features a link back to the table of contents.This process is repeated throughout the post to build a working table of contents. To see how this table of contents works in action, visit our post on time management strategies and try clicking around.Tables are useful for many different purposes, such as building simple image galleries or creating comparison charts. While WordPress doesn’t provide a built-in means of quickly creating tables, they’re easy to build on your own.This image illustrates how tables are constructed using HTML:
Here is what the end result looks like:
If you’d like to adjust the alignment or appearance of your table, it’s best to use CSS. Since we’re sticking to HTML in this post, we’ll have to cover this topic at another time.You now know how to format text and build tables in HTML. If you want to add an image, use the HTML image and the Alt Tag attributes:<img src=“Insert Image URL” alt=“Insert Alt Text”>Let’s try adding an image to our table. Follow these steps:1.) Add an image to WordPress and find the image file URL:2.) Paste the image HTML tag into your table in WordPress. Then, paste your URL and write your alt tag in the appropriate spots until you have something that looks like the following:3.) Here’s what the end result looks like:Armed with this knowledge, we think you can probably create something more interesting than a repeating logo. This is just a quick test to walk you through the process.Have you ever tried pasting text from a Word document into WordPress, only to have your formatting get screwed up? That’s because copying and pasting from Word (or another similar word processor) will usually include a lot of hidden formatting.There are three ways to get around copy and paste issues in WordPress:We recommend doing this the easy way (option 1 or option 3), but we’ll show you how to do it the hard way too (option 2), in order to best explain what happens when you paste text from Word into WordPress.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Copying and pasting text from WordPress into the Visual editor in WordPress will add non-breaking spaces to your text. This is probably one of the most common sources of headaches for bloggers when pasting text from Word.Let’s dig into what these are and what to do about them.Here is some sample text we’ll try pasting directly into the Visual view in WordPress:Now, we’ll copy and paste this directly into the Visual view in WordPress:Hmm. That doesn’t look quite right. Odds are, you’ve encountered an issue like this at some point. Let’s switch to Text view to see what’s going on here:See the weird &nbsp; tag? This is called a non-breaking space. It forces a space to appear and prevents the formation of another line of text in its place.The issue with copying and pasting from Word is that the text carries non-breaking spaces along with it. This causes an additional space to appear. Sometimes you can delete these spaces in the Visual editor, but when that fails, you can delete them manually in the Text editor.Now if you notice weird and seemingly unmovable spaces in your WordPress text, you’ll know what to do.You’ve read through this post. You’ve downloaded your HTML cheat sheet. You’ve started experimenting with troubleshooting common WordPress formatting issues. If you’re interested in taking your HTML knowledge to the next level here are some recommend resources to continue your learning:Remember, everyone learns differently, and some people learn more easily from different types of content. While this post may provide you with a good starting point, you might find a book or video series more helpful for your purposes.There’s a lot to learn when it comes to HTML. However, we hope this HTML cheat sheet and step-by-step guide has provided you with just enough tips to make your blogging life a little bit easier.You now know how to do basic blog formatting with HTML. You know you can create and edit text links, control paragraph structure, fix broken links, build tables, and remove unwanted spacing. Knowing these HTML tips are going to help you tons and you’ll be super thankful for the cheat sheet.Click To Tweet

Download these 21+ marketing templates, each designed to help you do your best work now.I use sections a lot. Even though my regular posts are not that long, it always make the life of the readers easier when they come back for the info.
HTML is so straightforward. I love it! But CSS… That’s another story.Absolutely, including clear formatting and content sections can definitely make posts easier to read. Knowing even a little bit of HTML can help make cleaning up that formatting easier too. Usually, it’d be best to learn HTML and CSS side-by-side, but for content editing and formatting purposes, a little bit of HTML is enough to go a long way.Your link to the HTML cheat sheet just sends me further down the page.Hey John,Apologies for any confusion with those links. They’re intended to bring you to the “Get It Now!” button where you can download the cheat sheet. Give that a try and let us know if you’re still running into problems.Hey John, the only place the words “Get It Now” appear on the page is in your comment….maybe you forgot the HTML for the button (sorry, couldn’t resist!)Ok, found the button….it’s on the right side.  It is requiring my email address, but the reason that I know that this post exists is because you EMAILED me about it….annoying to say the least.ARGH!  Now it’s GONE.  Done.  I think I’ll have my 14 year old teach me about HTML.Hmm, this definitely sounds a little bit strange (the button actually appears in the middle of the post, near the top after the post introduction, so I’m curious what could cause it to appear offset to the right).I’ll look into what could be going on with this.Hey hsmom3, We’re unable to duplicate these issues on our end, but we suspect there may be a browser issue preventing the button and cheat sheet from displaying correctly. The cheat sheet should appear as a .txt file in another tab in your browser, but I wonder if a pop-up blocker could be preventing it from opening. Your browser or device might not want to open a .txt file too, but it’s difficult to diagnose without much further knowledge.It definitely sounds frustrating in any case, and we want to make sure you get the cheat sheet. I would recommend sending an email to our Customer Success team at support@coschedule.com, and we’ll make sure you get your download.I apologize for all the headaches!Thank you for this.

It just takes time to really absorb the basics, but once you’ve got it down, it makes life working on the web a lot easier.Yes. I know it’s very important. That’s why I’m determined to nail it! Oh my gosh – THANK YOU, Ben!!  I’m filing this in my Pinterest #CMGR folder for reference.  This is fantastic!Glad you found this helpful, Mellissa!This is nice article, I agree to you that blogger or Digital Marketer needs to learn HTML which will help him in later associations with templates editing!Thanks Harsha! Knowing even just a little bit of HTML definitely makes editing in WordPress a lot easier.This is awesome!! But where it’s hyperlinked to get the HTML cheat sheet nothing is happening not sure if that is on purpose.Same problem here….It’s fixed now!Glad this issue appears to be resolved!And more importantly, thanks for reading.And more importantly, thanks for reading.Hey Ben, I’m just going to say it outright – Goddamn! this post is awesome and I wish I had a resource like this an year back when I looked for HTML and CSS tutorials made for marketers and laymen :) Cheers and thank you for taking the time to write this.P.S. I’m counting on the fact that you’ve got more of such posts planned and coming our way.Thanks for the kind words, Sujan! We didn’t think there were enough HTML guides that showed marketers and bloggers just what they needed to know, and explained why and where to use certain snippets of code to get things done. We’re glad to hear we hit that target, and we’ll definitely keep this kind of feedback in mind when we plan content down the road.The link to download HTML cheat sheet does not work. Please advice. Thank you.Hi Lyly, We’ve been hearing similar feedback from some readers and couldn’t figure out what was causing this issue. However, I’ve think I’ve gotten a bit closer to figuring it out: depending on your browser, the location of the download button for the cheat sheet could appear in one of two places:1) After the introduction to the post (in this case, clicking a text link within the post will bring you to the button to get the download).2) Or, it might appear in the floating box along the right-hand side of your screen (in which case, clicking a text link within the post won’t help much). However, in this case, you’d be able to grab the download using the form that way (you might need to scroll up from this comment to get that box to appear).I apologize for the confusion, and hope this explanation clears that up for you. If you still run into problems though, please let us know. We definitely want you to be able to take advantage of the cheat sheet!Taking back to the Ol’ Skool, cause I’m an Ol’ Fool, That’s sooo cool! (“Whoot there it is” lyrics) Just like this aeesome HTML Cheat Sehhet post :)I like your style.Hooray for HTML!!

											Understanding how color works isn’t just for artists dipping their hands into paint and pigments all day long. Anyone in content marketing needs to understand the basics of color theory because no matter what you are using color in your content.Primary colors are the three colors that make all other colors. They are red, blue, and yellow. These three colors can be used to create the next level of colors, called the secondary colors.Secondary colors are purple, green, and orange. They are created using the primary colors. If you look on the color wheel, you’ll find the secondary colors in between two primary colors.Tertiary colors take secondary colors one step further. They are the “two-name” colors, such as red-purple, red-orange, yellow-green, etc.They are created by adding more of one primary color than the other creating not a true secondary color. It ends up being closer to the primary color.Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, without the addition of white, black, or a third color, are pure (or saturated) colors. They are intense, bright, cheery, and untainted colors.These are the colors of children’s toys, daycare decor, and summer clothes.When white is added to a pure color, you get a tint. Some people refer to these as pastel colors. They are lighter and paler than a pure color, and not as intense.Tints range from slightly whiter to almost-white.When black is added to a pure color, you create a shade. These darken and dull the brightness of pure colors, and range from slightly darker to almost black.When gray (black + white) is added to a pure color, you create a tone. You often hear people saying that a color needs to be “toned down”, meaning it’s too intense and they want to drop the level of intensity.Adding black and white in different amounts to a color subdues the intensity quickly.Whew! So there we have it: a complete color wheel with primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, plus their tints, shades, and tones. You can see how it all fits together on the color wheel below.Cool colors are all on the left side of the wheel, in the blues and greens. The warm colors are all on the right side of the wheel, in the yellows and reds.Now that you understand color theory and the color wheel, you can start to use color purposefully in your content marketing.When it comes to color techniques, the use of contrast is particularly important, and it’s probably the one that will lead you to butt heads with your designer the most.Contrast is how one color stands apart from another. It’s what makes text or objects distinguishable from the background. High contrast is when colors easily stand apart from each other. Low contrast is when they don’t.Often, people assume a difference in color is what creates contrast, but that’s not true. You might have two colors that are completely different but have no contrast at all because their tone is the same. To test out your colors contrast, turn them into grayscale and review their contrast.Colors, in their pure form, have inherent differences in how light and dark they are.Yellow is bright, for example, while blue is darker. Yellow and orange have little contrast with each other, despite being different colors. When different colors have the same tone (level of gray as you just learned), they will not have much contrast, either. It isn’t enough to simply pick two different colors when making decisions about contrast.Generally, high contrast is the best choice for important content, because it is most easily seen. Dark on light or light on dark–it’s the easiest to read. It might not be exciting, but it is readable.Designers often prefer low contrast techniques. They like to make things look beautiful, but beautiful isn’t always the best for readability. Tone-on-tone similar colored combinations are very popular and while their subtlety is quite attractive, they are also difficult for people to read.In order to use similar colors, while getting the contrast you desire, create a color scheme with both complementary and analogous colors. What’s that? Let’s keep reading!Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The color wheel can help you choose great color combinations for your call to action button, your infographics, and your lead collection pop-up.Keeping your color combinations simple will help you in the long run.A study from the University of Toronto showed on how people using Adobe Kuler revealed most people preferred simple color combinations that relied on only 2 to 3 favorite colors.People like simplicity; it makes your content easier to understand if they don’t have to interpret it through many colors. And remember, color has meaning so each color adds or takes away from your message.Too many colors make for a confusing message. So how do you choose those 2 or 3 colors? The color wheel can help.Complementary color combinations make things stand out.Complementary colors are “opposite” colors. They are opposite of each other on the color wheel, meaning the one color they lack is that one opposite of them.They are geographically and color-wise the opposite, and provide a kind of visual tension because they are so opposed to each other.You might even notice that some of your favorite sport teams use complementary colors. From football to hockey, opposite colors are used for some great color combinations.Blue is the opposite of orange.Red is the opposite of green.Yellow is the opposite of purple.Opposites attract!When the human eye sees a painting full of different kinds of greens, any bit of red is going to stand out amazingly well. Why?Because red is the opposite color of green. When the eye has been looking at a lot of the same color, it wants to see the opposite for a visual break. Using complementary colors is the easiest way to get something to stand out. Use them with caution to keep your content from being too visually jarring.You don’t want 50% orange and 50% blue because neither color wins and it causes distress to the eyes.Let’s look at the CoSchedule homepage as an example. What colors do you see?It’s mainly dark blue, but our most important button, the “Get Started Now Free” button, is orange. Orange is the opposite color of blue. In a sea of dark blue, your eye is going to naturally notice orange faster than any other color. We also ensured that the orange button contrasted from the dark blue to make it even more visually present.A quick word of caution: Red and green, two complementary colors, present a sticky problem. Some people have color blindness and cannot distinguish between certain colors, and red and green are a common problematic combination.Colors with heavy amounts of red and green in them get bungled up, too. Did you know that Facebook is blue because Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind? He sees blues the best.The above example shows the three types of color blindness: Deuteranope, protanope, and tritanope. Similar to Mark who sees blue best, it’s no wonder why blue is one of the more popular colors as it stretches even beyond color blindness.To help with color blindness when using complementary colors, remember there must be high contrast. Try to never use a color solely as the information source. Include text in graphs and infographics whenever possible as well.High contrast and additional text will ensure that even when color blindness is present, your visuals will be both readable and enjoyable to see.If you want to use three colors instead of just two, using split complementary color schemes is a way to capitalize on the power of complementary colors but add a third color to your palette. To use it, you’ll choose one color as your base color, and then the two colors adjacent to its opposite.A split complementary color scheme doesn’t have quite the same level of tension that a complementary color scheme does, but it’s still visually exciting for your eye. It also adds a level of variety to your color scheme that can be used in a very dynamic, meaningful way.Analogous colors sit next to each other on the color wheel. They are “related”, a kind of family of colors that creates pleasing and relaxed visuals. They aren’t jarring, opposite, or clashing. They also don’t stand out from one another. Analogous colors can create subtle and beautiful content, but you may need to add a complementary color to get any particular item to stand out.Monochromatic colors are a single color, with its tints, shades, and tones. They are even more soft and subtle than analogous colors since it’s a color palette based on one single color. Monochromatic colors work great when paired with a single complementary color. On the CoSchedule website, we use monochromatic blue colors with orange for the content we want to get noticed.Most designers—when using complementary colors—pair a rich collection of monochromatic colors with a single complementary color.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?It isn’t difficult to create color combinations that stretch the boundaries of the easy power of complementary opposites and the related analogous and monochromatic palettes. All you need is a triangle, rectangle, and a square.These three combinations can be visually noisy if you’re not careful. The best application is to use one color as the dominant color, and the others for highlighting content. The triangle combination is particularly vibrant; three is a “stable” number and using three colors is visually stabilizing.Color is an essential tool because it has an impact on how we think and behave. Color directs our eye where to look, what to do, and how to interpret something. It puts content into context. It helps us decide what’s important and what’s not. That’s precisely why, as a content marketer, you need to understand what colors mean to people.While color psychology has been studied and analyzed over time, the psychological impact of color is still moderately subjective.We don’t all react the same way to colors, as we all have previous experiences with colors from significant events, cultures, people, and memories. However, there are a few generalities about how people respond to color, and that’s what we’re going to look at.Red is a very powerful, dynamic color that reflects our physical needs whether to show affection and love, or to portray terror, fear, and survival. Red is also a very energizing color that can portray friendliness and strength, but can also be demanding and show aggression depending on its context.Overall, if you’re looking to have a really powerful presence or get someone’s attention fast, red is your go-to color. Just remember to use it sparingly to avoid the extreme negative reactions it can so easily awaken.Orange has a very interesting psychological meaning as it combines red’s power and energy with yellow’s friendliness and fun. The mix makes orange a good representation of physical comfort in our warmth, food, and shelter. (It even stimulates our appetite so watch out if you’re hungry!)Orange is also known to be a color of motivation, lends a positive attitude, and general enthusiasm for life. Overall, orange is great for bringing comfort in tough times, and creating a sense of fun or freedom in your visuals.Yellow is the epitome of joy, happiness, cheerfulness, optimism—you name it. Anything happy is almost always yellow. The wavelength of yellow is particularly long, making it have one of the most powerful psychological meanings, while also being the easiest color to visibly see. (Did you know yellow is the first color infants respond to?)Whenever you need to lift someone’s spirits, increase their confidence, or provide inspiration, use yellow. However, avoid using yellow too much because it’s also known to make us more critical causing self esteem issues, fear, or anxiety. Find the right balance of yellow to motivate rather than bring others down.Green is a color of balance and harmony. It lends us a clearer sense of right from wrong since green incorporates a balance of both the logical and emotional. Green is one of the most-seen colors in nature reflecting life, rest, and peace. It is also a sign of growth, whether that’s in a physical object like plants or in our income and wealth.Overall, if you’re looking to portray health, rest, and to relieve stress, green is your color. While green does have minor negative aspects like over-possession and materialism, it has a more positive affect than most other colors.Blue is known for its trust and dependability. It’s reliable, responsible, and mentally soothing. For that reason alone, it’s one of the most-liked colors across the entire world.Unlike red, blue lends a more mental reaction rather than physical that allows us to destress, calm down, and think of the most ideal situation. Unfortunately, it also is one of the last colors to be seen, and can be perceived as distant, cold, or unfriendly if used it great amounts.Overall, blue is a well-liked color that can bring a sense of calmness and trust when building relationships, especially in marketing.Purple is most commonly known for its imagination and spirituality. It possesses the energy and power of red, with the stability and reliability of blue, making it a perfect balance between the physical and spiritual. Purple is often used to show luxury, loyalty, courage, mystery, and magic.It’s a very intriguing color as it soothes, but also presents space for mystery and new ideas. This is why creativity is most often associated with the color purple. When using purple, avoid using it too often as it can also cause too much introspection or distraction as thoughts begin to wonder.Pink is a softer, less intense version of red that creates a sense of compassion and unconditional love. While it’s a very physical color, it soothes rather than stimulates, making it a perfect color for caring, understanding, and nurturing those in need.Pink is a sign of hope. It is also known to be very romantic as it shows empathy and sensitivity. If too much pink is used, it can be very draining, show a lack of power, and even immature. Overall, pink can be a great counter-option to the color red when used appropriately.Brown, while maybe not the most visual stimulating color, is a great sign of structure, security, and protection. Whether it’s family, friends, and material possessions, brown offers constant support.It’s also a very serious, down to earth color you can use where black might be too intense. The downfall to brown is that it’s the most safe color and can seem reserved, scheduled, and boring. Overall, use it when necessary, but don’t depend on it too heavily.Gold has quite a few different meanings depending on your culture. Across the world, though, gold consistently represents some variation of charm, confidence, luxury, and treasure. It also can have an element of friendliness, abundance, and prosperity that is naturally attractive. Too much gold, however, can seem egotistical, proud, and self-righteous. Similar to colors like brown and black, try to use gold more sparingly to highlight rather than be the main attraction.Black is a color of sophistication, seriousness, control, and independence. Although, it can also be used to show evil, mystery, depression, and even death. Black is a very reserved color that completely lacks any light as its an absence of all the colors. It likes to stay hidden, in control, and separate from others. For this reason, black is a great color for high contrast and easy legibility. Unfortunately, since its a very powerful color, too much black can cause sadness and overall negativity so use it sparingly and in your text more so than the visuals itself.White is color that is complete and pure, making it a perfect example of purity, innocence, cleanliness, and peace. White can also represent new beginnings, providing a blank slate, and gives refreshment for new ideas. Since white has an equal balance of all the colors, it can exemplify several meanings, with equality outweighing them all. White is a great color for simplicity, cleanliness, and idea creation; however, avoid using too much white as it can cause isolation, loneliness, and emptiness.Faber Birren, a 20th-century color researcher and author of Color Psychology And Color Therapy, discovered something interesting about general color groups.He found that bright light and bright colors promoted “big muscle” activity, while softer and deeper colors promoted mental and visual tasks better. He also discovered that red stimulates our nervous system while blue relaxes it. Red and related colors also caused people to overestimate the passage of time while cooler colors like green and blue were the reverse.That means that:Click To Tweet

According to researcher Joe Hallock “Eskimos use 17 words for white as applied to different snow conditions, where in the Northwest United States there are only 4 or 5.”Every culture understands a color differently. It has a role to play in religion, politics, ceremony, and art. The culture your audience is in affects how they understand deeper meanings of color. Even the context you use the color in affects the meaning of color. For example, in India, red means purity, while in the U.S. it denotes passion and specific holidays.In a survey, people were asked to choose the color they associated with particular words.Blue is clearly a color people are positively drawn to, but beyond that, little else can be said.Depending upon the context of the rest of your content, black can mean high quality and trust, or it can mean fear and terror. It can’t do it on its own, but surrounded by your content, a color choice can bump up your intended meaning a notch.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Compiling the results of many studies, the Kissmetrics blog came up with an excellent infographic on how men and women experience and react to color differently. Men and women have different color preferences.According to both the Kissmetrics blog and Hallock:Women see more colors than men, generally. They are more aware of slight color differences within a color range.This may explain why men simply call the color blue…blue. Women, on the other hand, see cerulean, sky, teal, turquoise, and all sorts of varieties of blue. Perhaps it is a combination of being able to visually see more differentiation and considering it worthy of a more specific name. Perhaps men are better able to tolerate both colorless and bright color palettes because they aren’t as sensitive to the nature and nuances of the color as women seem to be.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?What does this mean for you?Well, is your audience mostly men or is it women? What age are they? Do the colors you’re using in your content marketing attract or repel that audience? If your audience is women, in particular, you must carefully choose colors that are not too raucous. If you are selling a luxury product, you want to avoid colors that are seen as cheap.There are a few generalized understandings of what specific colors often mean to a large cross-section of people, with each color having negative and positive emotions associated with it.How people behave when they see color has a direct effect on your conversions. Will they click the button on your CTA? Will they read your pop-up graphic? Will they notice your email subscription box?According to the Institute for Color Research, people make a judgment about your content in 90 seconds or less. And, up to 90% of that judgment in that brief amount of time is influenced by the colors they see. Blogger Neil Patel gives further proof of how colors affect your conversion rate, revealing that 85% of consumers base buying decisions on color, and that full-color ads in magazines get recognized 26% more often than plain old black and white ads.In fact, color helps people recognize your brand by up to 80%. It’s important to choose your color carefully, and stick with it.When it comes to getting people to click a button or sign up, it’s not a question of which color is magic and makes it happen all the time. It’s a question of passive and active colors, of high and low contrasts, and of opposites, like our CoSchedule example where the orange button stood out from the blue.And it’s a question of which color tested best for you.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The color combination of orange and blue is a powerful one. It’s fairly safe in respects to color blindness, and repeatedly gets favorable marks by people as a combination.But is it enough to just pick a great combination?Not at all; you need to know how to use those colors individually. Let’s look at CoSchedule and our Facebook promotions as an example. We’ve created several designs over the last year, some with a blue backgrounds, and others with orange backgrounds.The promotions with the orange backgrounds consistently made people more likely to click than those with the blue backgrounds! It made sense, though. Think about Facebook. It is a predominantly blue network, and so our orange image stood out more than our blue image did.This doesn’t mean that orange is the color you must use. It means we tested our two colors and found that orange worked the bestClick To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?It means we tested our two colors and found that orange worked the best for us on Facebook. It might even vary from social network to social network so make sure that you do your own testing.What worked on Facebook might look different than Twitter. You need to find out if your red button beats your green button (as Hubspot discovered) on your own. The color of the rest of the page, your content, and the placement objects will make your results different from what someone else has discovered.Color in general is fascinating to study, from both a theory and psychological standpoint.From Newton, Goethe, Itten, Hering, Young-Helmholtz, Birren, or Müller (yes, there have been many theories on color throughout history), the lowly color wheel has been considered and reconsidered again and again. The effect color has on us and our behavior has been studied repeatedly.When it comes to choosing colors, you must test. You cannot know how your audience will respond to your colors in your content and layout without creating thoughtful A/B tests to determine which color combinations and placements generate the most leads and traffic in your content.Click To Tweet

Will test them too!Just the refresher I needed on color theory. Bookmarked!Wonderful! I’m excited to see what you think about our updated info!We like orange and red!We use orange quite often as a brand color, and it seems to be a high-performer. Thanks for your feedback!Thank you for the ‘colorful’ insights. ;) I really like how the basics were spelled out — kudos! I definitely agree that selecting appropriate and contrasting color combinations for context and audience are an integral part of great design.
But I will play devil’s advocate; as stated in the article, “The psychological impact of color is subjective. We don’t all react the same way to colors.” As a designer, I take these color meanings with a grain of salt because of color’s subjective nature. IMHO it’s far more important HOW colors are used than the color itself. So in the FB promo and A/B example, the orange version was attributed with 6x higher click thrus. I’m going to poke a hole in that conclusion because it’s more likely that the design LAYOUT of the blue version wasn’t as strong as the orange:
-typography, contrast, spacing: there is a clear hierarchy and contrast of importance of the text and visual elements in the orange version, plus the calendar graphic is much smaller and allows for balanced spacing in the layout. For the blue version, all the elements and text barely contrast or stand out from each other – they’re competing for importance, plus the enlarged calendar bunches up all the visual elements creating a busy layout.Just my humble opinion…Great thoughts, all of those things certainly play a part. With those two ads, though, everything was pretty much the same other than the background color. We also saw identical results with pop-up ads, web banners, and Twitter Ads. Somethings the color just makes the difference.I have to disagree with you on the sameness of the two. The calendar on the blue layout was clearly larger than the one on the orange layout. And the word “Co-Schedule” was (needlessly) enlarged on the orange layout. For what its worth, I prefer the blue version.“red + blue = purple
blue + yellow = green
red + yellow = orange” – this isn’t correct. It’s been known to not be correct since the 19th century. Red and Yellow make an okay Orange, but if you mix purple or green from the above, you will have atrocious, muddy, grey colours. People who mix colours from these ‘primaries’ often find themselves having to add purple and green from bottles to keep their colours bright.Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow are better primaries. You can make Blue from Cyan and Magenta, and Red from Magenta and Yellow. That proves these colours to be secondary.Use this tool – http://www.juicysatsuma.com/paintmixer/ – to work out how to mix your colours correctly.Hi Sean,It’s definitely true that color mixing varies. Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow are the colors used when talking about light and also in some printing scenarios (if you add in black for CMYK). RGB is familiar to designers who work on the web with monitors, etc. As a painter, I know that the kind of green and the kind of red make a difference. Phthalo blue with cadmium yellow medium, for example, will give you more of a turquoise than a true green. Alizarin crimson and phthalo green make the perfect black. Ultramarine blue might be the better pigment to use as your mixing blue as long as the paint company didn’t dilute it with black or other fillers, and crimson is probably the better choice than a cadmium red, which tends to veer towards orange. And so forth. It really depends on what medium you are using when deciding what to use as your primary.The idea with this post, though, is not to use it necessarily as a color mixing guide, but as a way to understand how colors work with each other across the color wheel and how our eyes look for opposite colors. There are many color wheels and approaches to color theory, but this is a good general start to understanding the “math” behind color.This is so awesome I love this site its really helped me to do my workGlad to hear, Nathan!

											Every official definition of a marketing objective you’ll find on the Internet is a jargon-filled mouthful that doesn’t really make sense. So I’ve taken the liberty of writing a definition you’ll be able to get your head around:“A marketing objective is the goal you set for how many people you want your product, service, or piece of content to reach or convert.”They can be set for both the long-, medium-, and short-term, and will be completely unique to your business.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Sometimes it can be difficult to figure out what you want to track. Here are some ideas:They’re specific, measurable, and time-bound goals you want to achieve for your business or blog. Which, seamlessly, brings me to the next section…There was always one teacher at school or college that used to go on, and on (and on) about SMART goals. And your eyes would glaze over and go back to looking for stupid pictures in your textbooks. Did you ever tell your friends that someone in the photo looked like your teacher?Okay, maybe that was just me.I swear one of my teachers looked like Henry the VIII.But still… it turns out, teachers are right, SMART is a brilliant way to structure your goals, especially for marketing.If you’re not sure what it is, or you just need a refresher, here’s a simple breakdown:You might remember the A in SMART standing for Achievable. But, based on research by Locke and Latham, for a lot of people that has changed to Aspirational.Now that might seem like a lot of goal setting and writing to hit every single point. But, in reality, you can sum it up in just a couple of sentences. Like if I wanted to set a SMART goal for this post, it could look like:“I want to have 10,000 unique views in one week through Facebook and Twitter using only the CoSchedule channels.”Specific? Check. Measurable? Check. Aspirational? Check. Realistic? Check. Time-bound? Check.Google Analytics can have a big impact on how effectively you measure your marketing objectives.It monitors everything through a feature called Goal Tracking, which you’ll learn how to set up in a bit. First, take a minute to watch this short video from Google about what Goal Tracking is and why it’s effective:Whether you watched the video or not, it’s important to understand the concept of macro and micro goals and how they relate to the SMART goals you set earlier.Your SMART marketing objective is your overall objective. It’s what you want to achieve from that specific page, content, product, service, or whatever it is you’ve chosen.And, in a way, that’s the same as your macro goal in Google Analytics. For example, let’s say your SMART goal is to get 10,000 email signups in the next six months. Your goals might look like this:Micro goals help Google understand the process you want people to follow in order to achieve a goal. It can tell you where people are losing interest or where they aren’t converting. Then you can fix the problem in your funnel.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Imagine this for a moment:Your reader goes to a blog post you’ve written and spends 90 seconds on that page. But they don’t convert into being an email subscriber using the popup.If that happens, you’ll need to see how effective your popup is. It’s probably not doing its job.When you see people aren’t converting to your list, test, retest, and refine your process over and over again to increase your conversions so you’ll be able to reach your marketing objectives.Okay, so now you know why the Google Analytics Goal Tracking feature is an essential piece of the puzzle to figure out your marketing objectives.Let’s set it up.Recommended Reading:If you’re not already set up with Google Analytics. You can find the Quick Start Guide from Google right here. It’s free and awesome. You’ll love being able to see how the work you’re doing impacts your goals.Click on Admin.Then you will see this page. Click on Goals. Add a new goal by clicking the red button.Then you’ll see this goal description page.Name the goal so you’ll remember what you are tracking.For example, if you want to track email signups, name it: Email Signups.Click Destination.Once you’re done with that, click the blue continue button.Then you’ll see this goal details information pop up.Type in the ending of the URL you want to track. (If you want to track your e-mail newsletter subscribers, type in the last part of the URL. Example: /blog/thank-you)Make your goal track the link people are sent to after completing their email confirmation.Click on the gray box to the left of the link box and choose ‘Begins With’.Press save and start tracking.If you’d like to see this step-by-step walkthrough in video format, here is a good one:But It Says ZERO? Why?If you just created your new goal, you’ll have to give it some time. Processing latency takes 24-48 hours, so it will start collecting data but it will take a bit of time. If it still hasn’t tracked your conversions, check the URL you’re tracking to make sure it’s correct.That was awfully simple, wasn’t it?Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?From here, I’m going to show you what to look for, and how looking at the small data can create a whole tidal wave of results for your marketing objectives.Yup, we’re going to explore that for a bit here so you can figure yours out.It’s important to stay realistic. A way to stay realistic is to find your baseline before jumping into goals that are unrealistic and unachievable. And how can you know where to shoot if you haven’t set up a target? Like really?Steps To Figuring Out The Baseline So You Can Track Your Growth:To find your baseline, wait for the amount of time you want to test your growth. And then compare the two, after you’ve done your test.For example, if you want to measure the growth of your email subscribers when you do something new (like add a new popup to your blog), first track what a normal two-week period looks like for new subscribers, then make your change. Review the data two weeks later and compare your new results to the baseline.How Do You Figure Out Your 10X Growth Goal?Start with the total conversions from your test period (Example: 1 month = 1,000 new email signups). What is 10% more than 1,000?That would make your goal for next month = 1,100 new email signups.Marketing objectives have a habit of just floating around in your head.You’ve agreed to them. You’ve committed to them. But you’ve never written them down. And that’s the mistake…By writing your marketing objectives down, you’re at least 42% more likely to achieve them. If you’re part of a larger team, don’t just write them for yourself either; get everybody to write them down. Keep them somewhere where your team can see them.In their annual research, Content Marketing Institute also found that B2B companies that documented their strategies were more effective than those who didn’t.It doesn’t matter if it’s for a specific post or for a year-long strategy—get everyone involved and write it down.Actionable Tips:There is a ton of data for you to devour inside of Google Analytics.It can be a bit intimidating, especially if you’re not really a numerical person. I am definitely not. That’s why I went into a writing career. :)“What data should you be looking for?” Because once you know what to look for, it suddenly gets a lot easier.The answer, in short, is the small data. Those little facts and figures that usually get lost in the noise.As Kissmetrics rightly says, tracking page views and traffic isn’t really that important in the big picture. You can get thousands of page views. But if you aren’t converting any of them, it doesn’t really mean anything.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?It’s in the small data that the answers to reaching and surpassing your marketing objectives all are.When you delve into the smaller, more targeted data—like conversions from different social media channels—you start to see opportunities to reach your objectives or improve your experience more rapidly.Take, for example, the image creation site Share As Image.They originally considered themselves as a Chrome Extension with a useable browser app for other customers. However, when they looked at their Google Analytics URL Goals of getting people to use the extension, they noticed something interesting.More people were using the browser app than the extension itself. In fact, it was a lot more. So they changed their marketing objectives, and strategy, to fit more of an audience that doesn’t really use extensions. They’re currently working on a rebrand called Stencil, which is a relaunch of their product that will fit this audience more effectively.If they were only looking at the big data, like pageviews and traffic stats, they’d have missed this altogether. Another place to look for smaller, more refined data to boost your marketing objectives is through social media, too.Recommended Reading:The CoSchedule Google Analytics Integration is a tool that allows you to see how much traffic you get through your social shares. You can measure your success with your own Google Analytics Dashboard.It’s a way to understand who is on your social channels and what content is most popular. Now that you know how effective small data can be, it will help you achieve your marketing objectives.Social media is a large part of any content marketing campaign. After all, 93% of marketers use just Facebook alone, while 63% of them want to learn more about how to use it more effectively.By using the dashboard with your CoSchedule and Google Analytics integration, you can track:Refine your approach, by using the marketing dashboard. It will help you push forward with marketing objectives on and off of social media.How To Refine Your Approach:You made it. Congrats for sticking it out!Hopefully, by now you can see the importance of marketing objectives, how Google Analytics can take you there quicker (and keep you on track). I also hope you enjoyed learning about how the marketing dashboard will help you get even more from your social media.Let’s recap what you just learned:Now that you know how to set up Goals in Google Analytics that are specific, measurable, aspirational, reasonable, and time-bound, you’re on the road to success. Especially if you put into practice everything in this post.Click To Tweet

											In this study from KISSmetrics, Dan Zarrella, Search Engine Land, and HubSpot, we can learn a lot about blog publishing times. Goals for your blog post should be taken into account when determining optimal publishing time.Of course, there are pros and cons to publishing at the height of popular times in the day. Sure, you’ll get lots of visitors, comments, and engagement. But at the same time, you’ll get higher bounce rates and end up being buried in social newsfeeds along with all the other publishers taking advantage of popular posting times.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Do your content goals include social shares? If so, then TrackMaven’s study gives you the insights you need.What they found was that posts published during non-popular hours tended to get the most social engagement and shares. Posts published on Saturdays and Sundays received the most social shares, as do posts published between 9pm–midnight EST.The higher the social shares on a post published during non-peak times, supports the KISSmetrics study that posts published during peak times are buried in social media newsfeeds. One can assume that during non-peak times, people take more time to read the content that comes through their newsfeed. Then they’d go on to share it with their audiences.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?However, not all studies come to the same conclusion.This study, shared by Social Fresh using data from Shareaholic, found that social shares are highest for posts published on Thursdays and between the hours of 9–10am EST.The story is a little different when pageviews are concerned. If you want more pageviews, then you will need to publish on Mondays and between the hours of 9–10am EST. The pageviews drop off dramatically for posts published after 12pm EST.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Noah Kagan did a study using data from BuzzSumo of 100 million pieces of content to determine what makes content go viral. He found that blog posts published on Tuesday gained the largest total shares. The only exception is LinkedIn and Pinterest shares, which people were more likely to do on Mondays.Of course, publish date and time alone were not enough to make posts wildly successful. He also attributed viral probability on length (long form is best), images, amusement, post types (lists win), the trust factor, and a share from an influencer.Click To Tweet

Let data drive decisions. #blogging #amwriting]One way to help discover the most optimal approach for your own content is to study your own data.All the studies in this post provide the best suggestions on what works in terms of publishing days and times versus the goals you want to reach with your content (shares, links, comments, and traffic).Furthermore, if you’re working with a limited amount of time (which is a common concern for many of our readers), then you probably want to know how you can study your own content quickly and derive some useful insights.Ultimately, it will be up to you to determine what day of the week and time of day will increase the specific goals you have set for your content.To run a test on your own website for pageview and visit goals, you can import custom Google Analytics reports for pageviews and visits (and if you’re not using Google Analytics, now is the time to start). These reports will tell you when you are getting the most pageviews and visits now, and then show you how that traffic changes as you publish new posts on different days and at different times.Then, you’ll know which times work best, and which times don’t. Compare that to what studies say is best, do some experimenting, and observe the results. From there, just do more of what works best for you.It’s easy to overthink these things sometimes, but thankfully, it really can be that simple.The time is in military format, and the days of the week are numerical starting with 0 for Sunday.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?To illustrate how to put your findings to use (working with our own blog without too much effort and for demonstration purposes), we looked at eight posts published over the course of December 2013 and January 2014.Back then, our blog was fairly new, and we were working to establish what would work best for us.Here are the publish times and day-one pageviews we observed:See the 162 day-one pageviews that came from publishing early in the morning? That’s dramatically better than posting at any other time, and we’re able to demonstrate that fact using relatively little data (and without spending too much time).That’s why you can expect new posts from our team early in the morning. That’s not a decision guided solely by what the industry at large considers to be the best days and times, but because it’s what we’ve seen deliver best results. If something else works better for you, go with that, but starting with this simple approach can help get you there.Ultimately, the strongest content reaches its audience.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Once you’re comfortable with crunching the numbers and analyzing your content in this way, you can work on ways to go more in-depth with your own research.Use studies from thought leaders (whether that’s us or anyone else) as a starting point, compare those findings with your own results, and continue refining your own best times to publish blog posts until you find out what works best for you.You might even turn up some new insights that help add to the industry’s understanding of best practices for blog post publishing times.That’s the power of doing original research.There’s one glaring thing missing from all of the above—how to maximize conversions. In the end, that’s really your goal, right?So, what day of the week and time of the day will lead to the most conversions?The answer to the preceding question depends on your ideal customers:Knowing your ideal customer and when they would be most likely to make a conversion can help you determine when to publish blog content with conversion goals in mind.Start by determining which times of day you’re getting the most conversions right now. To do this, you can try out this custom Google Analytics report to see conversions by hour of the day and day of the weekUse Google Analytics to find the best time to publish for your own blog.Similar to the custom report for pageviews and visits, the time is in military format, and the days of the week are numerical starting with 0 for Sunday.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?With a combination of popular studies and your own custom studies, you should be able to determine the ideal time to publish a blog post based on the results you want to achieve. Over time, you’ll get to know your business’s audience so well that you’ll know exactly what they want and when they will most likely want it. That will help you not only build a loyal audience, but keep them engaged for the long haul too.You’ll be there with the right content, at the right time, for the right people. These are your keys to success.

							CoSchedule Co-Founder, blogger, designer, content hacker and serial starter. Also, a firm believer in the do what you love, love what you do philosophy.If you want to build and execute a data-driven, agile content strategy to get massive results from your content marketing, this post is for you.Need help creating more effective content, more easily? Download these 21+ marketing templates, each designed to help you do your best work now.Hmmm – this is so interesting. I’m going to try the Mon morning strategy. I wonder if the same applies to Tweets, LinkedIn posts, Facebook posts etc.? Just out of interest – how long did it take you to research and write this post? The studies suggest that you get more views if you publish twice a day – I struggle with once a week :)Kathleen, it is all about content quality rather than quantity. It is something similar to “The more you speak the less your listener remembers.” Coming up with multiple quality content every day is not everybody’s cup of tea. It is about making the best of what one has and trying to go to next level from there on.That’s a great question @kathleenmcniff:disqus. On most posts, I usually spend a couple hours doing research before I start writing. After that I probably spend at least and hour or two putting things together. It all depends on how many times I get interrupted :)Also, Kathleen McNiff we have a tool that should help your publish social content more consistently :) We also have some data about publishing multiple times here: http://coschedule.com/blog/promote-your-blog-with-social-media/Thanks for reading!Thanks Garrett – I’m having fun with the CoSchedule trial – I’m not working in a team so some of the features aren’t relevant to me. It’s great being able to see the social media shares for each post (but for some reason I can only see the stats for one of my posts). Loving the calendar view and the ability to easily plan a month of tweets and posts – now, if I could just find the button that will write them for me :)I don’t think so that the same time zone is applicable for all the social media networks.I totally agree. Timezone definitely makes a difference. The thing to remember is that it is the timezone of your readers that matters most.Exactly and marketers need to analyze this thing individually, for all social medias.This is such great information! I tweeted all the tweets and I also pinned several of it to refer back to. This has been a long going subject between my friend and I! I think coschedule can help get your content out there whenever you want it too! That’s the best part of it all!:) Thanks for the comment. So glad to hear that it was a helpful post for you!!great to know, I share my blog posts after 12pm
but I like to read emails, articles after 6pm mostly :)Great study Garrett! Appreciate the work you guys are doing and the new improvements to Coschedule as well!Sharing this out :)Glad you are enjoying both Dennis! Thanks for using and reading CoSchedule!Fun post! Financial Samurai always publishes before 4am PST.The one thing I question after six years of publishing is getting the most comments on Saturday afternoon. Saturday is the lightest day for traffic and comments for me. The weekdays, when everybody is at work is the most busy!Bet,SamHey Sam, that’s a great comment. Thanks for reading! Looking at the research, doesn’t it seem like Monday mornings—being the highest reads—would also get the most comments?That strikes me as an interesting point!Please support my blog http://toknowabout-islam.blogspot.com/ThanksGreat advice. Funny how one of my blog posts on anxiety actually went viral on a saturday night, ahh the science of it all…Hey @theanxietyguy:disqus, that’s super interesting! Data like this is useful to plan ahead, but it all depends on your audience.Publishing on a Saturday night is something I’ve never even tried! But weekends are great for social media shares, so that might have influenced some of your success.Plus, there are many other factors at play here, too: Quality content, social media shares, images and design, etc. All of this can influence a post’s success.Very interesting thought; thanks for reading!Very helpful article. As a  newbie to online marketing I have been testing for the best time to post my articles with mixed results.This article may have just saved me some time. Many thanks for sharing.Garrett, for someone with a new blog, do you think there might be a logical sequence to posting for growth over time? For example, when the blog is new, maybe traffic is most important. Then once you get a little traction, you shift to posting for comments. A little later on, you move to posting for shares. Thoughts?Perhaps. I would say that it all depends on your goals. Personally, I generally think of things is terms of audience size, which can be measured in many different ways. Traffic, social shares, and email subscribers are usually the best indicators. I probably wouldn’t bother measuring comments too much as they have changed a lot due to a lot of commenting happening on social these days.This is really a nice study to grow up traffic and engagement both. Everything is fine when you do it on a right time.. Thanks @garrettmoon:disqus
http://www.sharelocalbusiness.com/blogThanks for sharing this article.Keep ordering cake, flower, gift from http://www.sweetfrost.inSome great studies. Useful information. Custom analytics is always the way to go but it’s always nice to see data from other studies. I did have a question about GMT and Eastern Time but now I get it after reading this. I have to publish at my target visitors timezones best peak time to get better reach. Thanks for that Google Analytics info too. Great Post. :)Hey there, thanks so much for reading and for the comment! Time zones are particularly interesting in the context of this post, I agree.On a related note, we just published this post on when to post your content on social media that you may enjoy: http://coschedule.com/blog/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/Alright, Helper, thanks for reaching out!Great tips.. Thanks for sharing. I typically post my blogs Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:00 am (ct). I may have to reevaluate that.Hey there! I’d definitely try some of the tips in this blog, then compare your initial traffic to when you were posting in the first place!If you do that, I’d be curious about your results if you’d like to come back and share them with us!Thanks for reading, and gooooood luck!Thank you so much for this information!  I spent a while analyzing/dissecting my blog with the information I have found here and it was VERY insightful to say the least!  I now have A LOT of work to do.Very cool, @martinejolicoeur:disqus! Thanks for sharing your success with us.We just recently published a post to help you share your social messages at the best possible times. You might also dig this! http://coschedule.com/blog/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/Thanks again!Thank you so much!!!  Happy New Year!This is the most encouraging post I’ve read in a long time. Thank you!Hey @dancoggins:disqus, we’re super happy to help. I’m really glad you were able to grab some nuggets of information from this post!hello, the design of this blog is really nice. I wanted to ask from where do you make these images.Same here! Garett, who designs the images in your posts? I think these times work well for content that is directed towards the business crowd. I would love to see studies that analyze the best times to publish blog content that is not business related. I have tried these times on my personal fitness blog, and the times failed miserably for me, my audience does not search for personal content to consume while they’re at work.  I have found for my particular blog the best time to publish is either super early in the morning (ie: when a mom is relaxing with her morning coffee before the kids wake up), or after 9 pm (when mom is settling down to relax after she’s put the kids to bed).Interesting article. I tend to post on twiiter from 5pm onwards, thinking that is the time people are getting home from work and taking a quick look online. Might try posting earlier as per your data and see if that improves my stats!This may be one of the most helpful posts I’ve read about blogging. Thanks!This information will help my business and organize my strategies. I’ve found so many of these types of posts contradicting each other, so it was nice to see some varying studies compiled in one place.  I think a big part comes down to some difficulty in controls for these studies, in making sure content used at different times is hitting the same audience, with the same level of title-intrigue, etc.  Sure you spot more reliable trends with volume, but I think the variability in content and audience probably accounts for a lot of this.  IMHO, the content itself matters most, and as long as you aren’t posting when it’s 3:30 am for your primary audience, you’re probably golden.  Cheers for the great writeup, Garrett, keep it up!Thank you.great information…………….Great post. However I have a question: Is this applicable Globally or only limited to the United States?© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,7
2016-02-24,http://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-best-practices/,Social Media Best Practices To Save 25.5 Hours In 2 Weeks,"The free blog post headline analyzer will score your overall headline quality and rate its ability to result in social shares, increased traffic, and SEO value.One of the biggest problems you mentioned having in the 2016 Better Marketer Survey was not having enough time.A lot of you might feel like you’re spending too much time or too little time on social media. Well, that research shows you spend around 30 minutes on a social platform when scheduling your content. If you’re spending around 30 minutes on each social platform to share your blog posts, you’re probably spending around three hours a day on social media, which ends up being 15 hours a week.Can you believe that?In two weeks, that’s almost 30 hours.If you incorporate these social media best practices into your schedule, you’ll definitely save time. You’ll no longer feel like you’re wasting time on social media since you’ll be using the time that you do spend on social media efficiently.For each of these eight social media best practices, I’ve placed an estimated amount of time that it could take to do that practice. Keep in mind that the time saved will also depend on your career title, for example, a social media manager could probably end up being on social media longer than a content marketer or blogger, but amidst all that, implementing these social media best practices will help you save time.Okay, let’s jump in.Click To Tweet

											Whether you’re posting to social media consistently or not, tracking how you spend your time will help you see where you should be spending your time instead.Follow these steps to track the time you’re putting into your different projects (example: writing posts, editing, and social media sharing) throughout the day for a week. And then adjust your time so you are spending it wisely.I know from experience that the amount of time you spend on social media is going to be much higher than you think.Being consistent on social media is extremely important for your professional presence.I’ve seen many bloggers and businesses post to social media consistently all to drop off the side of the social media posting planet. Their social platforms are abandoned and lifeless. You don’t want this to happen to you because it will hurt your presence.Instead of going AWOL, schedule posts in bulk to cut back on time you would have spent on this process throughout the week. Instead of scheduling social every day, give yourself an hour now to schedule lots of social messages to trickle social throughout the next two weeks. Then you don’t have to worry about it.To find your top-performing blog posts, go to the left-hand bar and scroll down and click Behavior. Then click Site Content and then All Pages.Then you will see this:It will show up with all of your best-performing blog posts. Schedule more social shares for that content to remind your followers of the content you already know they love.If you use CoSchedule as your social media editorial calendar, you can find your top posts here:And then you will see this page:These are your top posts. Click on the post to schedule more social shares for the next two weeks.Recommended Reading:There are always new social media platforms that enter the stage to compete for your attention. Resist the urge to join every new platform that comes on the scene.Only focus on a couple of social media platforms. After perfecting those, you can add other social platforms to the list.So that begs the question… on what two social networks is your audience the most active? It’s a tough question with a simple answer if you know where to find it.A solid place to start is Google Analytics by understanding which networks are giving you the most traffic, and also checking out which are contributing the most to the goals you defined in Google Analytics.In Google Analytics, cruise to the left-hand sidebar and select Acquisition, All Traffic, then Channels.Now under the Default Channel Grouping, click Social and you’ll see the traffic data from all of your networks.Concentrate your limited amount of time on the networks where your audience is most active and the ones that are helping you reach your goals.Pick the two social platforms where your audience is the most active and develop your game plan for those networks.At CoSchedule, our top two social platforms are Facebook and Twitter.Since we know that, I conducted a Facebook optimization test last month to understand what things would improve our engagement and clickthroughs. You can also conduct your own social media optimization test to help you see what it working and what isn’t:A grab file or swipe file is a great place to store plenty of awesome ideas and it will help you save time like nobody’s business. Think of it as a notebook where you put everything for safe keeping until you want to share or use it.Basically, a grab file is a best practice for storing all your ideas (social media content and more) so it will be so easy to grab and share whenever you like. You can do this in a piece of content in your editorial calendar right in CoSchedule.When scheduling your social media for the week, make sure that you do things that will automatically improve your credibility to your audience. You don’t want to share things or do something that make you seem less professional. Some people take things super seriously, so you want to make sure you do your best to show the right image of your brand or company.Spend 15 minutes checking these things over:Kyle Wiens, CEO of ifixit said on the Harvard Business Review that, “Good grammar is credibility, especially on the internet. In blog posts, on Facebook statuses, in e-mails, and on company websites, your words are all you have. They are a projection of you in your physical absence.” Which is honestly true.Of course, there are the grammar police out there who are looking for mistakes all the time. But if your company is going to be credible, you want to make sure that you are spelling words correctly and using correct grammar to the best of your knowledge.So don’t feed into the grammar police; just make sure you have content that meets your standard of professionalism.Now, you and your team are the ones who get to decide what your standard of professionalism is. Get together with them and discuss this:After you’ve discussed this with your team, you’ll know what the standard is. Or if you have an editor, just ask them.Here are some other things that will help you:Any step that you take to make the user experience better for your readers will only make them love you more.So steer clear of negativity and even the slight possibility of insulting your audience.Dan Zarrella says, “Negative remarks include things like sadness, aggression, negative emotions and feelings, and morbid comments.” He adds, “If you want more followers, cheer up!”Ways to stay away from negativity:This will drive some followers bonkers and may create some unfollows or people flagging your work so they don’t have to see it again.Think about it.Do you like seeing a company’s promotional posts every hour or so?Nicholas Grizzell said, “You can always have too much of a good thing. Even if you’re posting the right kinds of posts—not hard-selling—you can still drive your fans and followers away.”And you really don’t want to drive them away. Especially if you want to make the most of the time you are posting to social media.Cite: AgoraPulseThe number one step to not spamming people: Figure out your optimal posting frequency.When a CoSchedule user asked us the question, “How often should I post on social media?” we started digging really deep into data to find the answer. After analyzing 10 different studies (with data we’ll publish in a post that we’ll release really soon), the outcomes were incredible and will help you perfect your posting frequency right now:Play around with your posting frequency to see what works best for you. Just be considerate to your followers. Find your best times and then schedule around those. Speaking of which…If you know when your followers are on and what they like, you’ll end up saving a ton of time instead of posting at all the wrong times or posting the wrong stuff.Let’s explore the favorite social platforms—Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, LinkedIn, and Instagram—to find out when the best time to share with your followers is.Oh, and if you want to hit the easy button… here is a free Google Analytics custom report to show you the best times to post on social media according to when your blog gets the most traffic. If traffic is your goal, that might be exactly what you need to get started.
Otherwise, onward to discovery.Check Facebook Analytics to find out when your audience is on by clicking Insights.And then… you’ll see this… On the left-hand bar, click Posts.And it will open to this page:This will show you when your audience is the most active. It looks like this exercise shows that 3 p.m. is the peak time to post to Facebook based on our data from CoSchedule.I’d recommend playing with the off-peak times as well. Play around with when you post and test it. According to SocialMediaToday, “75% of your audience sees your message in less than 2 Hrs.”Scroll down in Posts on your Facebook Insights page to discover what types of content and messages are getting the most engagement.Under the Reach column, you’ll notice certain Facebook posts will stand out more than others. Dissect the reasons to help you share better content for your Facebook fans. For each standout post, ask yourself a few simple questions:Analyzing your best-performing posts will help you understand how you can improve all of your future messages, and is a super easy best practice to add into your routine.In the example above, we tested the sending messages about blog ideas because we discovered in our research that coming up with new ideas was a big problem for content marketers. The data in the screenshot speaks for itself.Start with your Twitter Analytics.Then click on Tweets in the gray bar. That will bring you to this page:When in Twitter Analytics, choose the dates you’d like to see the data for. Then press Export data. It will export into an Excel spreadsheet.You’ll get a spreadsheet something like this. I added the shades so you’d be able to see the different days. You’ll be able to see all the times your posts were published in military time.In Twitter, it can be a little difficult to find the perfect times that your audience is on. So if you test the times, messages you write, and watch the engagement rates that you get on your posts… you’ll be able to come up with when your audience is on.You could also do the test (that I mentioned earlier with Facebook) with Twitter.In Twitter Analytics, click the Tweets tab and analyze the performance of your messages compared to one another. What makes some significantly outperform others for Engagements?It looks like the optimal times to tweet are between 12–3 p.m. on weekdays with another peak time at 5 p.m. Just use Twitter Analytics to gauge your own best time based on what you just learned about engagement.By testing your posting schedule and paying attention to the engagement and clicks, you’ll have a better understanding of your audience and when they’re online. This will help you post at the right times so that your standout messages are being seen.Go to Iconosquare.Iconosquare is available in both free and paid versions.On the left side, you will see the overview. Scroll down and click Optimization.You’ll see this, which is my favorite part of Iconosquare:The big round circles show when your audience is engaging with your content. Try posting more at those times.This shows you when the best time is that your Instagram community is interacting with your posts.Then if you scroll down, you’ll also be able to see this…This shows you which filters trigger the most likes and comments on Instagram.It will also show you which hashtags are the most popular on Instagram and also the ones that you use.At the bottom of the optimization page, you will find a ton of hashtag options. The ones on the right are the most popular ones that are being used on Instagram. And on the left are all the ones you’ve used in the past. When you see black highlighted ones, you’ll know those are popular. So use them more often to reach more followers.I recently just found this awesome tool—Timing +—which you can use with Google+. Of course, play around and test the time to see if it’s right for you. Also, make sure to set your time zone on this page.When you scroll down, you’ll learn the best days and times when your audience is on.As a general guideline, technical content and deeply detailed, actionable, how-to content performs best on Google+. So take that advice and combine it with Timing+ to review your Top posts and build upon your previous success.Go to your company page in LinkedIn and then press on the Analytics tab.On this page, you’ll be able to see how well your audience is engaging with your content. If you scroll down from there, you’ll see more on your reach and different kinds of engagement types.Since LinkedIn is a professional’s network, it’s no surprise that the peak times are right after work, right before work, and during lunch breaks. Share to LinkedIn at 5–6 p.m. and during the middle of the work week at 7:30–8:30 a.m. and noon.For this, you’ll have to test with the times like I mentioned in the Facebook section up above. Look at your Updates section in your LinkedIn Analytics to understand which messages are getting the most Engagement. Test to find your sweet spot!While it’s important to save time, you’ll also want to make sure that you are paying attention to these small but important details while scheduling out social media.It really helps to show your humanity on social media, especially if you’re a business that usually shares your own blog posts or products. Do this by sharing images of people with your product as well as graphics. Another cool way to do this is to share videos and images of the happenings inside your company. All of these ideas will help show your humanity.Look at these two images that Coke posted on Instagram. The one with the girl performed better.Caught red-handed. Taste never felt so good. #TasteTheFeelingA photo posted by Coca-Cola (@cocacola) on Jan 19, 2016 at 12:51pm PST
The image with the relatable photo did better compared to just posting a graphic with promotional writing about Coke’s product.This year’s treat for Santa should be chilled, not baked. #MakeSantaHappy #MakeSomeoneHappyA photo posted by Coca-Cola (@cocacola) on Dec 24, 2014 at 8:47am PSTBesides, if you can make the things you share on social media relatable, your followers will love that.Recommended Reading:Neil Patel said, “If you budget 30 minutes daily to find content to post, here’s what will happen: You will save time. You will work faster. You will find great content.” Which is so true!Curating content will help you fill up your social media schedule and form relationships with other bloggers when you share their content. They might just share your content. Your audience will also appreciate what you share with them.Essentially, curating content strategically will help you cut back on the time you spend aimlessly on social media.There are many different ways to find good content to curate for social messages. Here are a few that I’ve found to be quite helpful:If you have trouble finding things to share on social media, spend a little time every day looking for more content like when you read blogs at night. Use Pocket to save them for later. Then just hop in there and schedule social shares during the time you dedicate to scheduling later on.This is a great content discovery website. You can put in what topics interest you to get email updates with blog posts and information regarding those interests and topics.Bloglovin is a great app that will send you notifications when your favorite blogs publish new content. It does half the work for you so you’ll always have fresh, new content coming your way.You can access Bloglovin from your computer, tablet, and phone. This is a screenshot from my phone. You can create collections to organize all your information.And then when you look at your feed, you’ll see all the posts from bloggers you are following.The Evernote clipper is another great way to store your ideas or posts that you find. This works great as a grab file.The CoSchedule Chrome Extension works so that you can press it and schedule to share anything that you find online that your audience might enjoy right on the spot. You can also add messages to your social media editorial calendar to publish whenever you’d like.Recommended Reading:Even though you don’t want to spend all your extra time on social media, it still helps to know how to share your content so your posts have the best influence. It all comes down to telling your audience what you want them to do.Ask yourself these questions when creating your messages:Recommended Reading: It always helps to make your content sharable on your blog so that people can easily share it. You may see us do this a lot with a great click-to-tweet box.Be sure to put a Click To Tweet box in your blog posts like this:Click To Tweet

											Last year, we conducted our first-ever annual survey to understand what you were struggling with. We were then able to get a better idea of what problems you are dealing with and what information would help you do your best work.In 2016, we took things to a new level. After digging deep into the data, we discovered all kinds of fascinating insight into what is most important to content marketers heading into the new year. We came to understand your struggles, your work habits, and also identified where there’s opportunity for us all to improve.We’ve crunched the numbers and information you helped provide, and here are our recommendations on how to improve your marketing the most in 2016.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The more we know about you, the more able we are to provide the kind of information you want most. Before we can achieve that goal we had a few things about our readership that we needed to find out, including:Ultimately, this survey was for us to discover what you need most from us to be awesome at what you do.35% of all survey respondents have been blogging or working in marketing for less than a year. An additional 29% have one or two years of experience under their belt. That means 64% of survey takers are at least fairly new to blogging and content marketing (and that’s likely why you’re coming to blogs like CoSchedule’s to learn more).Key Takeaways:While most participants were bloggers and writers, other titles that popped up included roles related to digital marketing, content strategy, and social media. A small percentage of you said that you were in roles that weren’t directly related to writing or content planning, including graphic designers and general creative professionals.Similar to our findings last year, 49% of you describe yourself as a solo blogger and 61% of you said that you are working on content alone.Now, that header shouldn’t lead you to believe it’s impossible to succeed on your own.In fact, with the right tools and know-how, the truth is it’s far from impossible. However, when it comes to bloggers and marketers working solo, we’d echo the sentiment brewing in the industry that having a team or some sort of support is ideal.That’s because running a highly effective content marketing operation requires diverse skills (like writing, editing, graphic design, coding, and more), and it’s simply too much for one person to excel in every area.Even if you do have the benefit of working as part of a team, you’re probably as aware as anyone that there are only so many hours in the day, and only so much work that can be done. Therefore, it’s important to focus your energy on the tasks that will deliver the biggest impact.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Recommended Reading:We all have challenges we’re working to overcome everyday. Solving problems is part of what we all love about this work, right?As a blogger and/or content marketer, it may feel like you never have quite enough of everything that you might need in order to get everything done that you need done.You have too much to do, and not enough time to get it all done.If you’re using a tool like CoSchedule, making the most of your limited time is likely a priority for you. It’s not surprising that lack of time was one of the most commonly reported challenges facing content marketers right now.Try This:Lack of time is compounded by lack of team support.61% of you told us you’re working on your own. If your goal is to produce quality content that’s genuinely useful to your audience and generates a strong return on investment, then you know that’s no small task, even when you do have a dedicated team to support your efforts.Even among the 39% of you who said you’re working on small teams, you’re still likely facing constraints on your time, budget, and available resources. Plus, effective collaboration with your team is likely to be a concern as well.If your goal is to produce quality content that’s genuinely useful to your audience and generates a strong return on investment, then you know that’s no small task, even when you do have a dedicated team to support your efforts.What’s a content creator to do? Here are a few ideas:Try This:Many of you reported that attracting and retaining an audience is a key challenge. Building a successful blog takes time, patience, and hard work. If this is something you’re struggling with, try following these four tips.26% of you described that your publishing schedule is irregular. If readers know when they can expect fresh content on your blog, they’re more likely to come back.Never create content for the sake of creating content. Make sure that everything you do is tied to a purpose and a real business objective. Offer meaningful value to your audience consistently, and they’ll keep coming back.Coming up with strong content ideas can be hard, but with some simple hacks, you can make sure you’ve always got plenty of inspiration.Coming up with fresh inspiration on demand is tough, but following these steps can make your life a bit easier.A lot of responses in our survey mentioned the difficulty of consistently generating quality content ideas. Fortunately, we’ve written several posts on this very topic that might help.Start with these:36% of you said that you spend under 30 minutes crafting your social media messaging. Another 30% said they spend even less time (less than 15 minutes).That might be a little low, but it’s also understandable given the time constraints the majority of you are working under.However, investing more time into your social media content can help build a more engaged audience and attract more followers. Think about how often you share your content as well. While this may vary depending on the social networks you use, you may be able to get more mileage by sharing your content more frequently, or by re-sharing old content you may have forgotten about.Another common theme that cropped up in survey responses was the challenge involved in creating high-converting blog content.For marketers in particular, creating a blog that converts readers into customers should be your number one overall goal. After all, if you’re not driving revenue, it’s difficult to justify why blogging is essential to your business. So, how do you build a blog that captivates a loyal audience and turns those readers into diehard customers?47% of survey respondents plan on using dedicated landing pages in 2016.Landing pages are a great way to direct attention to your content and build your email list. Solutions like LeadPages make it easy to build landing pages as well as helping you grow your email subscribers.If you’re going to ask people to hand over their email address or make a purchase, give them a good reason to follow through. Give them something extra special, something you’ve really poured your heart into that will help them be better at what they do. That could mean providing access to research, a downloadable infographic, helpful worksheets, or something exclusive to email subscribers.If your conversions on your blog are low, it could be because it just isn’t easy for users to take the desired action. Try experimenting with different placements for signup forms, or different on call-to-action buttons. Heat mapping tools like Crazy Egg can also help you determine if users simply aren’t scanning across your call-to-actions as well.If it seems like the number of content types keeps growing year after year, that’s because it is.There are always new social media platforms popping up and new tactics being touted as “The Next Big Thing”. In other words, there’s always something new competing for your limited time, attention, and resources. The key is to know which things you should fully invest into, and which you should say “no” or “maybe later, but not now” to.Blogging and social media are, expectedly, popular with our audience (this makes sense, given that we build a blogging and social media management tool).However, we wanted to know what else is popular with our readers out there, too. Were there any surprises, or any mediums or platforms being underutilized?Here’s what we discovered.1. Email MarketingIt makes sense that the top three content types you plan on using in 2016 are blog posts and social media content. Given that CoSchedule is built to help you get the most from both of these, that isn’t too surprising.However, we were encouraged to see that 52% of you are using or planning to use e-newsletters as well. That’s because email marketing delivers stronger ROI than any other digital marketing channel.2. Ebooks46% of you plan on creating ebooks in 2016. Ebooks are a great way to go in-depth on a topic.Recommended Reading:3. VideoWhat is slightly surprising is that a full 47% of you plan on shooting video this year.This is an encouraging development given the increasing importance of video content on the web. YouTube has grown so much it’s considered the second largest search engine while Facebook has expressed interest in making video content a priority. Twitter even allows users to shoot 30 seconds of video within its mobile app, which could be another avenue to consider if you haven’t already.4. InfographicsInfographics are holding strong in 2016, with 49% of you planning to produce them.It isn’t enough to just create content. You also have to know how you’re going to get it in front of people. Here are the promotional tactics and channels survey takers said they plan on implementing in 2016:As we concluded, the majority of you are most focused on the tactics and content mediums that deliver the strongest engagement and ROI. However, there were a handful of gaps where we identified opportunities that many may be missing.1. PodcastsPodcasts are positively exploding right now. Audiences want more fresh audio content, and those that can provide it well, should benefit.2. Tools And Mobile AppsJust 11% of you said you plan on building tools in 2016. That’s likely because they require a lot of work and development know-how to pull off. However, when done right, they can prove immensely valuable.For one example, our own Headline Analyzer has become incredibly popular since it launched. It’s something that provides our audience with real, tangible value, and it’s something we get to use ourselves every time we create a new blog post.An additional 8% of you said that you plan on building mobile apps. Again, this low statistic is likely tied to the budget required to build a strong mobile app. However, the benefits are there for those with the available resources.3. Social Media GroupsOne way to support a loyal audience is to give them a place to talk to each other. Facebook and LinkedIn user groups are one way to do that.Our own Facebook user group is just one example (and yes, we’d love to have you join in).4. Virtual Conferences And Live Web Chats14% of you said that you plan on using video conferences and live web chats. These provide a great way to get to know your audience, learn about their challenges, and allow them to share their insight.Even if you don’t host your own conference or web chat, you can always consider participating in those hosted by other bloggers and brands. They’re an awesome way to learn new things fast, and participating in the discussion helps position yourself as an active member of your industry or community.If you’re looking for a way to host a live web chat, Google Hangouts is both free and easy.5. Print MediaWe highlighted print media as one way to stand out last year, and we’re going to repeat that sentiment again in 2016, even though just 0.5% of you planned on using print media in 2015. In 2016, that figure rose slightly to a full 1% (technically, that’s a 100% increase).Not only is print media enjoying something of a resurgence right now, but it’s being adopted by some very large and successful brands. Take Red Bull’s magazine, The Red Bulletin, for example, which promotes the kinds of entertainment and lifestyle the energy drink company wants to associate itself with (similar to the classic strategy that made Nike a world-class brand).Here are some of the most popular options among those surveyed. 1. WordPress77% of you host your blogs and websites with WordPress. 16% of you reported that you are using another platform (like Blogger or Tumblr). That leaves a 7% gap that didn’t specify which blog platform or CMS the others of you use. WordPress powers approximately 25% of all websites, and our findings correlate that it’s still the most dominant blogging CMS around.2. Google AnalyticsAn encouraging 75% of you are using Google Analytics. In the current data-driven age, this is an important tool for any marketer or blogger to get familiar with.Recommended Reading:3. MailchimpOf all the email marketing tools you use, Mailchimp came out far ahead, with 45% of you saying that you use Mailchimp.4. Google SuiteInterestingly, 42% reported using Google’s office suite (Google Docs, Sheets, etc.), while only 37% reported using Microsoft Office or Office 365. While some may certainly be using both, Google’s collaborative capabilities and low cost likely contribute to its popularity.5. Adobe Suite40% are using Photoshop, Illustrator, and/or InDesign, which shows a certain level of technical skill and budget required to make the best use of these professional design programs.6. CanvaFor those without access to professional design skill, Canva is an invaluable tool, used by another 40% of survey takers.While reviewing survey data, there were a handful of tools we were surprised to see weren’t more popular. Some are tools we enjoy using ourselves, while others are listed as alternatives to other popular options that readers may be less aware of.1. EvernoteWe’re big fans of Evernote here at CoSchedule, and so are 29% of survey takers. If you haven’t used Evernote before, its collaboration feature make it an attractive tool for marketing teams. Plus, it integrates well with CoSchedule, allowing you to convert Evernote documents into WordPress pages.2. Google Search ConsoleFormerly known as Google Webmaster Tools, this free service provides a ton of resources for monitoring the technical health of your blog or website.  Why bring this up here? Because just 16% of you are using Google Search Console. That’s a low count for a free and essential tool that can help with all kinds of fundamental technical issues. I’d say sign up for it.3. Piktochart, Infogr.am, And Easel.lyWhile Canva works great for building infographics as well, we were slightly surprised to see just 6% using Piktochart, 3% using Infogr.am, and 2% using Easel.ly. If you’re looking for a tool specifically for building infographics quick, these are all quality options to keep in mind as well.4. MozSearch engine optimization is alive and well in 2016, with 59% of you say that SEO is important for your content promotion efforts. However, just 10% of you use Moz, currently one of the most popular SEO and content marketing analytics services available. Raven Tools is a close competitor worth considering as well.Given that Moz (and other similar services) are premium tools, it’s likely that cost may be a preventative barrier here. However, it’s also a valuable timesaver, and something to consider if you can afford it.If you’re on a tight budget, SEO Book offers some popular free options that can plug some gaps in your toolkit.There’s probably more talk about the important data now than ever. However, it’s important to make sure we’re using the right metrics and the best data available to drive our decisions as marketers and bloggers.So, which metrics did you say you use most to measure success?There are a few interesting takeaways here:1. You put a premium on social media engagement.64% of survey takers said they use likes, comments, and other forms of social media engagement as a measure of success. That certainly makes sense given that it’s a direct signal your content is resonating with readers.2. Interestingly, post traffic came in second.Post traffic came in a close second at 58%. However, combined with total blog traffic (46%) and total website traffic (37%), we can deduce that traffic is a priority for most marketers and bloggers, and that’s a good thing.3. Conversion rates were slightly less of a priority than expected.While creating content that converts was a common theme in the essay question presented to survey takers describing their biggest challenges, just 32% of respondents cited conversion rate as a KPI for success. This could be because conversion rates are typically more important for marketers (who are focused on driving revenue) than other types of bloggers (who may be satisfied with simply driving traffic).If you’re not paying attention to your conversion rates now, however, we’d recommend starting ASAP if it makes sense for your work. That means if you have a sign up form, a Buy button, or any other sort of goal you want readers to complete before leaving your blog or site, then track those actions being taken.4. Don’t forget about bounce rates.Just 36% said they pay attention to Time Spent on Page, and another 31% said they look at their bounce rates when measuring success. If these aren’t important metrics for you now, we recommend monitoring them closely, and for a few reasons.Blogging and content marketing are all about constant learning and continual improvement. You’ll never be done growing your knowledge and sharpening your skills, and it’s okay if you don’t know everything there is to know about every facet of content marketing or blogging.However, if you’re focused on upping your game over the course of the year, then where should you be putting your time and energy?Providing an exact answer to that question would depend on the unique position of the person asking it. However, based on the data we gathered in our survey, here are some of the top areas most could benefit from paying extra attention to.Judging from our survey results, there are a lot of fresh faces entering the marketing and blogging worlds.It’s important to follow the philosophy of walking before you run. While it’s tempting to want to try every hot new tactic you hear about or try to do everything possible all at once, we need to be executing the basics.Many of you reported struggling with consistency. While we’re naturally biased to using CoSchedule to help with this, anything you can do to create a consistent content calendar will improve your overall efforts. If you’re not ready to move up to a paid solution, this free printable content calendar templates may be helpful. A calendar can also easily be created using a Google Sheets document or Excel spreadsheet.There are more blogs popping up and more brands investing in content marketing every day. With competition in so many spaces heating up, one way you can stand out is to focus on a niche where you can position yourself as an expert. Establishing yourself as the go-to destination when someone wants to know about a particular topic. It’s a surefire path to building a loyal audience and driving consistent traffic (two things most of you repeatedly called out as top challenges of yours).If you’re looking to create content that is both unique and appealing to your audience, find a gap Several of you said you struggled with knowing which topics to create content around. This is indeed challenging, and requires having some knowledge of what your audience is looking for, and knowing what you really can be the authority on. Tools like the Google Adwords Keyword Planner, Google Trends, Soovle, and more can help validate your content topic ideas and quantify whether there’s interest in a particular idea.63% said you plan on publishing a lot more content, while 27% said you’d be publishing just a little more. That could be a good thing. After all, with more content being published every day, you’ve got to be able to keep up to be seen, right?Maybe.In our survey data, we saw that a majority of you spend less than three hours per post when creating blog content. That would make sense, given that limited time.Let us put this idea out there, though: is three hours enough time to create truly 10x content?The answer is probably not. That’s because content that’s thoroughly researched, thoughtfully written, and covered in its entirety takes time to create. It can’t often be quickly produced, and things that can be published that quickly are probably easy for a competitor to duplicate as well.If they’re smart, that’s exactly what they’ll do, too. That’s no good if you want your content to stand out from the pack. The answer could be to put more time into fewer blog posts, adding more value to each post, even if it means publishing less.Almost no matter what niche you’re in, competition is heating up in the content marketing game.There are more blogs and publications than ever before competing for the limited time and attention of readers (remember, if you think you’re struggling with not having enough time, odds are your audience is feeling the same way too).So, if you’re going to post something, make sure it’s the best possible post on that topic you can muster.If you’re not familiar, the concept of 10x marketing refers to the idea that you should strive to make your blog post on a given topic 10 times better than the best post on that topic currently available on the Web.It’s tough to quantify exactly what makes a post 10 times better than another, and that certainly will vary depending on the post in question.The key takeaway here, however, is to always aim to make every post the best post on that topic possible. Review your competitor’s content and add something they don’t have. That could mean adding different types of content that are lacking on their page or post (like a video, infographic, image gallery, etc.), or simply going more in-depth. Better yet, create the best post possible on something no one has covered yet (more on that in a bit).Even if you publish less content, that’s okay as long as what you are publishing is substantive, filler-free, and offers something no other post on the Internet can. This will probably take more than 2 or 3 hours per blog post to achieve, but if you can budget the time consistently, the payoff is there waiting for you.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?It’s easy to just follow what everyone else in your niche is doing. However, it’ll take more than that if you want to really stand out.Use the Google Keyword Planner and Google Trends to identify topics and keywords that are popular, and compare those with what you see competitors doing.Then, instead of creating a post that duplicates what someone else has already done, write a post on something no one else is doing.Find hot topics before your competition does and eventually, you’ll be able to position yourself as a leading authority rather than just another follower.Original research is hard to produce. That explains why just 9% of you planned on producing research reports in 2016.This also tells us two things:All the cool facts and interesting insights you read on popular blogging how-to and content marketing blogs start with someone doing their own research. If you want to create content that provides unique value in your niche and positions your blog as an authoritative source, having your own proprietary data is invaluable. Not only will it give you deeper insight into your own audience, it’ll also give you valuable data you can create content around that no one else has.Anyone can copy what someone else says. Only a true authority on a topic can provide something original.Struggling with where to start on doing custom research? Start with this process.A tool like Polldaddy (which we used to conduct this survey) can be invaluable for gathering original data.There are a variety of free tools that make creating surveys easy. For the 2016 Better Marketer Survey, we used Polldaddy, but there are other options like Survey Monkey . If you’ve never run a poll or a survey before though, the process might seem intimidating. Fortunately, following just a few simple pieces of advice can dramatically improve your results.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?When creating a poll or survey, think long-term about what you want to know. Then, write questions that you think will help provide that insight. Data is only as good as your ability to interpret its meaning. Here are some things to look for:Here are some things to look for:Once you’ve gathered your data, there are a number of ways it can be repurposed into various content types to get maximum value from your efforts. Here are few:Here are few:Social Media PostsInteresting statistics and snippets of information from your own research can easily be used to create engaging social media content.Blog PostsIf you’ve found a unique insight or something few other bloggers are covering, consider creating a blog post on that topic.Infographics49% of you said you plan on creating infographics in 2016. That’s because people still love them for how they make it easy to digest complex data. Come up with something truly unique, and you could see yours go viral.White Papers And Research ReportsWhen you’re ready to take things a step further, your data may be able to help you put together a killer in-depth white paper.These are a handful of ideas, but you can see how much mileage you can get from gathering your own proprietary data.We want to thank everyone who participated in our survey. Your feedback really is invaluable, and we promise it will continue going to good use as we create more of the content you want. Here’s to doing your best work in 2016.Click To Tweet

/EmmaWe’re all about making our research actionable, so we’re glad to hear you plan on putting it to use, Emma!Awesome stuff Ben! Really interesting to see where other marketers are spending their time and what they plan on doing in the near future. Puts things into perspective. Great research!Thanks, Ben! What you’ve just said provides a good summary of why we put the work into this (in addition to helping folks identify potential gaps in their current strategies and tactics), so we’re definitely glad you found it useful.Fantastic post & research. However – it gives me chills that 77% of your respondents share their content three times or less on social media. All those hours of work deserve more than three shares!I 100% agree with that last sentence, Pamela. If we’re successful in helping our audience do better work though, that percentage should ideally come down by this time next year. Thanks for reading!Terrific run down on the trends, tools, and approaches for 2016. I’m glad you honed in on the “quality” of content. There are a lot of earnest bloggers but often, once you click on the that tantalizing “How to” or “5 Best Ways To..” headline, the content behind it is common sense advice, or rather pedestrian. If you want to be that purple cow (to borrow from Seth Godin) then you have to craft original, high quality content. And absolutely, knowing your niche is important too. If you’re all over the place, you’ll lose people. Thanks!Hey John, that was one of the most eye-opening stats for me, too. It seems that marketers harp on the idea of publishing quality content, but if time is an indicator of quality, then spending an hour or less per post may be adding to the noise instead of standing out from it. Thanks for reading and for commenting with that insight!Pssst – what software did you all use to conduct your survey, Ben?Hey Brandon,We used Polldaddy. We’ve found it easy to use while giving us all the functionality we need.© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,6

											This is a common question, and the answer is a bit more complicated than it might seem at first.In 2016, social media is as important as ever. However, there is still some debate whether or not social media buttons drive clicks. Part of the reason for that discussion likely derives from how many blogs and sites implement social media buttons ineffectively. It’s not entirely fair to judge a design decision that isn’t set up for success, but we also don’t want to make decisions that can’t be supported by accurate data.That’s why it’s important to make sure you get the design and placement of your buttons correct. It’s not enough that your buttons simply look good, or that they are just present somewhere on your pages. They need to be placed where they’re going to catch your readers attention and make it easy to share your awesome content with their followers.By now, you’ve probably gathered that there’s a lot of chatter about this topic. A quick Google search reveals this discussion at Stack Exchange, which considers whether social media buttons should be placed at the beginning or end of a blog post. Despite all of the discussion, there is little evidence to back those ideas up. Even this conversation over at Moz.com fails to provide solid evidence on the subject.It seems like we may be just guessing. Can’t we do better than that? To start digging, I looked at what some of the most common options are. I started with the question, “Where do some of the biggest sites on the web place their social media buttons?”The answer?Everywhere! Top of post – Do users share before they actually read the article? This is one of the most common placement options frequently used by sites like TechCrunch and Mashable.Left of post – Placing social buttons to the left of the blog post makes a lot of sense, as readers follow text left to right. This is the placement that we use here at CoSchedule.Right of post – This one surprised me, but it is out there. Social Media Examiner is a good example of a site with this placement.Bottom of post – Placing social media buttons at the bottom of the post was very common, and the only place you will find social buttons on Seth Godin’s blog. Is he missing out on possible shares because of this placement?In-line of post – A growing trend is to actually  place shareable content inline with the rest of your content. We do this regularly on our blog using our Click To Tweet plugin.No social buttons at all – This is a surprising and growing trend heralded by sites like the Signal v. Noise blog by Basecamp. Are they hurting their chances for viral success? We’ll look into this in a minute, but for now, that’s the playing field.The question still lingers—where do these sharing buttons perform the best? The answer is, admittedly, a bit hard to find (which may be why so many sites place them so seemingly haphazardly) but there are certainly some big data points that we can examine to reach a conclusion.Popular social sharing tool AddThis provides some excellent insight on this topic.  Their advice to users is as follows:From these tips, we can easily conclude that prominence matters more than placement when it comes to social media buttons.With the wrong placement, readers can easily mistake social buttons as ads or other navigation. This will likely result in lower usage for the buttons. Reading through the lines, we can also see that AddThis advocates keeping social media buttons near the top-left side of the page—a conclusion that is supported by other sources.According to usability icon Jacob Nielson and a study that he conducted in 2006, eyetracking visualizations show that users often read Web pages in an F-shaped pattern: two horizontal stripes followed by a vertical stripe.Readers view your page in an F-style pattern. Keep this in mind when placing social media buttons.The top left portion is the most-viewed part of the web page.  More eyes go there than anywhere else. This supports the idea that left and top are best choices for social share buttons, as indicated by AddThis.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Doug Antkowiak makes a great point about social media buttons on the Search Engine Journal blog. He points out that too many social buttons may negatively impact the speed of your website. This is a big red flag, as site speed has been clearly linked to better readership and SEO performance.The most valuable conclusion that we can draw from this is that we should limit the number of social media buttons that we display to as few as possible. The risks of slowing down our site just isn’t worth it. Social media buttons provide one of those situations where more is not necessarily better.The data here continues:After polling 50 of the most popular websites in the world, Webaholic.co.in found that Facebook and Twitter were easily the most-used social media buttons on the web with Linkedin and Google+ also showing strong results. They concluded that the utility of each of those networks fluctuated quite a bit depending on the audience type for each site.This evidence is backed up by TrackMaven’s more polarizing conclusion after examining nearly 2 billion social shares.Their data concluded that the vast majority of social shares take place on the top two social networks (Twitter and Facebook).Clearly, we don’t need to include all networks to make a good use of social media buttons. In this report, TrackMaven reveals that 38.6% of social shares were on Twitter. Facebook “likes” and “shares” accommodated for another 60.3%.Social proof is a psychological phenomenon where people use the actions of others to guide their own behavior. In essence, it’s the psychological term for “monkey see monkey do.” As one of our own writers, Julie once pointed out:“Social proof is a shortcut in the thought process. We don’t have to think. The others already did (we assume).”The reality is that social proof plays a big role in social sharing and can make a big impact on the success of social media buttons.Negative social proof diminishes the value of the social sharing button.In a now classic A/B test, Taloon.com  (a Finland-based hardware eCommerce store) found that social media buttons were actually hurting their conversion rates.When they removed the social media buttons from their page, they recorded an 11.9% increase in CTA clickthroughs as compared to the original page. If the results surprise you, you can read more here, but social proof gives us a clear answer for this result.Because very few people actually “like” product pages, the near zero results on social media buttons were actually providing negative social proof—preventing users from purchasing what they were perceiving as an unpopular product. As Chris Coyer points out on his CSS-Tricks blog, “low numbers can look embarrassing.”Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?In one of the more complete (but not scientific) studies on the value of social sharing buttons, blogger Joshua Benton concludes that many news organizations receive 20% of their Twitter traffic from Tweet buttons available on their page. That’s actually a pretty big deal!For example, 16.3 percent of tweets to the New York Times in his tests actually came from a Twitter social media button on the site itself. For the Wall Street Journal, the share rate was more like 20.2 percent. Not bad, huh? Social media buttons can help traffic after all.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?One point to keep in mind, however, is that Twitter recently removed the ability for social sharing buttons to display their sharing stats for that platform. So, while the presence of a button to tweet an article may help boost shares, publishers have lost the benefit of positive social proof that comes from having a stat counter.That makes it tougher to see how many times your posts are getting tweeted, but if you have some technical skills, Google has a partial solution using Google Analytics. It won’t let you display within your social sharing widget how may times a post was shared on Twitter, but it can at least help you know for yourself if readers are clicking your Twitter button.Despite the results from the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, not all publications have seen the same success.UK blog Inside GOV.UK reported a paltry 0.2% increase in shares after adding social media buttons to their site. While buttons being placed at the bottom of the page couldn’t have helped, their results are in line with conclusions developed by Luke Wroblewski, who felt that only 0.25% of Tweets were actually attributable to a social media button after analyzing more than 18 million page views.Others, like Signal v. Noise just prefer the way their site looks and loads without them and believes that if someone wants to share their content, they will find a way. To each their own, of course, but there is definitely some truth in the matter.Just a quick survey around the office concludes that most social sharing takes place outside of the article itself, and can be attributed to a variety of other tools. A few examples of this include:The opinions about social sharing buttons are wide, but often not particularly deep.Reality is, that it just depends on your own blog and audience type. But, being the adventurous sort that I am, I think that we can easily answer this question (at least to find what’s true in most cases). And the winner is…Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Because most websites load content on the left side of the page, and based on how people typically look through a site, it’s easy to see that the most noticeable place for this type of activity is in the top-left portion of the page. This requires a few follow up points:We’re sure you have some thoughts of your own on this topic, and we’d love to hear them. Sound off in the comments below.

Try different configurations, keep the one that gives the best result for your audience.Thanks for the tips!Testing is good, although it would be hard to get good data on that unless you make custom buttons of some sort. Totally possible, just a little more work. I think for most people, focusing on the left or top of the page is a good takeaway. Thanks for reading!I love the idea to put the social buttons where you’ve concluded is the best spot but one of my readers reached out and said it hovered over my posts on her mobile phone, which is where she always reads my blog! Since a lot of my readers are mobile I decided to take the social buttons from that location down. PS: I LOVE this blog – great content!Thanks for the comment Sara. Really happy to hear you are enjoying the blog :)Hi Garrett,This is my first time to the site, and I have to say it was an real treat!I knew having social buttons at the bottom was important so that readers could share after they read an article that they were impressed with our just wanted to share for any reason.However, I never thought of putting them into the top left corner and would not have until I saw the heat map above. That absolutely convinced me that I had to do it.So, I jumped immediately into action and added the smaller thumbnail icons to social sites. I get massive engagement on my articles and shares at the bottom, but if I can get more social shares by having it at the top I don’t want be foolish and possibly miss out.In regards to the sites you mentioned that are not using social buttons on their site, if they don’t want them that’s their choice. It makes it harder for me to copy/paste and share and I most likely will not. I did look at Signal v Noise’s site and I have to say that it’s so boring and uneventful I found that to be a distraction and kept me from wanting to read the articles. Perhaps it works well for their target audience and I’m just not in that audience grouping.Anyway, your article was so well written that I will be sharing it on my social media sites and I will be including it on my blog on Saturday when I do my “Saturday Review.”Looking forward to more great content form you!Sincerely,
DonWonderful, thank you Don! I am so glad to hear that you enjoyed the blog and our content. Also, I am glad you were able to apply some of the data to your site right away! I hope it helps.Hi Garrett,I jumped right over to my sight and made the change immediately. Glad I did!Thanks for commenting so quickly,
DonHey Garrett, I loved the article so much I added you yesterday to my Saturday Rewind article with a highlight and link. If you’re interested, here is the link: http://www.unveiltheweb.com/articles/rewind-saturday-top-bloggers-week/Wow, thanks!Hello Garrett, Don Purdum sent me over from his Rewind Saturday  post, and it’s my first time to your site as well. :) You’ll be glad to know that after reading your article, I switched my sharing buttons to the left side as opposed to top/bottom.The only thing that is negative for me is that it’s not “floating” and stays in one fixed position.It’s not a heavy plugin and doesn’t cause a lot of ‘requests’ to the server, so I like it, plus would not want to spend time searching for another ‘light’ social sharing plugin that will transfer all my existing numbers/shares over… Been there, done that, and didn’t like it.  LOLThanks for an action-prompting article!  Will not share this post.  :)Carol AmatoThat’s great Carol! I hear you on the lightweight plugin. Site speed is a really important issue, so you have to keep things in balance with that. Good luck!Update: Angela McCall alerted me to the fact that when she was viewing my blog post on her tablet that the social media buttons were in the middle, and unable to be turned off or moved, creating a very annoying experience. I checked my Google Analytics and I do, in fact, have a small group of readers using tablets, so I’ve decided to go back to my original configuration of top and bottom.  Wanted to let you know.  Thank you Garrett and Angela!  :)Hi Garrett,My first time here as well. I’ve seen your post thru Don Purdum, He’s the greatest salesman around here. LOL. Anyway, I read your post just now from my tablet. And your social sharing button doesn’t show on my tablet. I don’t see them on the side like that now. But it does shows on my iMac computer. The moment I read your post, I added another social sharing button on my top one. I already have it on the bottom but guess it needs another share buttons up there. I’m using AddThis social share buttons coz I tested this one…it works on computer, tablets, and iPhones. So many social share buttons out there that doesn’t work on tablets…I got tired telling people and so on my tablet, I don’t use their buttons but my OWN buttons built in the tablet already. Anyway, people need to know that they need responsive share buttons as well.Have a good day!AngelaGood points here Angela! I think one of the biggest problems is that the sharing experience on the tablet is terrible, even if there are sharing buttons present. Most networks don’t optimize their experience well for the tablet.  In browser solutions also tend to leave a lot to desired too.Good thoughts, thanks for sharing them!Thanks for testing this out for us. I think I am on the right track.Thanks for testing this out for us. I think I am on the right trackShare buttons have been getting some negative attention, but an extra share from an authority profile can be pretty valuable, so I hesitate to abandon them. What about follow buttons, like these: http://www.niftybuttons. Are those going the way of the dodo too? It seems like it can pretty valuable to let your audience know what social networks your company is active on.Thanks for sharing a great points about social media button placement. Points noted, Useful blog. I will implement in my blog now.I might have missed it, but what social sharing plugin does CoSchedule use?Those are Sharrre buttons. :)Thanks for the writeup!  Time to go remove a couple extra social buttons from the blog… :DHey, sometimes less is more, right? Glad to hear our advice is getting put to use.Unless I’m seeing things wrong, Social Media Examiner’s sharing buttons are on the left. Those buttons on the right are their “Follow Us” buttons.You’re seeing things correctly. While the post has a heavy emphasis on social sharing, we didn’t want to leave out follow buttons completely (although they’re definitely not one and the same, and we could have dug deeper into the distinction between the two).Thanks for the post! Finally, something to help settle office arguments on social media buttons :)Haha! We’re always glad to help any way we can.Thanks for the link to the “non-embarrassing” social media plug-in.Excellent overview of share button placement. It’s reassuring to know I got it right :)Some positive validation is nice every once in a while, right? Glad you found the post useful.Thank you for the article Garrett. I haven’t thought about this issues. In a way, you opened my eyes. I always thought that it was enough just to put buttons and people will click on them (or not). As it turns out, there is much more to it than it meets the eye.Glad to hear this post got you thinking deeper about social media button placement. It’s definitely something that’s easy to overlook.This is great. Social Media is also used by MOZ as Domain Ranking factor. I’m not with this guys as they have wild pricing but you can use free SumoMe for their free heat map and content analytics to track your readers.Glad you liked this post, Carl! Thanks for sharing that tip on Sumo Me with our readers as well.Great post Garrett, what about the title of the buttons? We use a standard “Please Share This” title above our buttons. I’ve always thought is was useless but have ZERO data to prove one way or the other. So we just leave it simple and don’t give it much thought. Know of any study/tests that have been done to see whether or not using… I guess you could call it a ‘mini call action’ to focus visitors on the buttons? Or maybe just having familiar buttons are all someone needs to share. Thanks, I’m off to move our buttons. :)That’s an interesting question, and fortunately, we do have some research on our blog that might be able to answer it. Scroll down to point number 4 (Help Your Visitors Share Your Content) in this post: http://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-increase-blog-traffic/As always, It might be advisable to try some different copy options and see what works best in your case. Hope this helps.Excellent, some split testing is definitely in order, thanks the push :)… and the link Ben!Appreciate the effort to create an interesting read, but anything regarding social media is fraught with ambiguity because the landscape changes almost daily.

Either you could make a massive list of the different things you’ve learned this year or you could write a blog post for each idea off the list. Maybe share how to do what you’ve learned or the life lessons that a person could learn from.When working in a creative niche, there are times where the words flow or the ideas bubble up out of you like a fountain. But there are also those days where you lack creativity and really don’t know what direction you want to go with certain projects. This can be hard. Many people give up on their creative endeavors when this happens.Don’t let that happen to you and your art.Maya Angelou once wrote, “There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.” I’ve been told by countless creatives that creativity is a lot like having a child. If major complications happen during child birth, there is a chance that the mother and the baby could both die. The same story could be said for the artist bearing an untold story. If you have a story to tell but don’t tell it, you’re hurting yourself and harming the story. You don’t want the story to die, right?Stay creative and finish your work. Ship.Real artists ship. —Steve JobsClick To TweetShare all the things that keep you creative as a writer, blogger, content marketer, artist, or graphic designer.Think creatively. You could even choose a couple words to use. Check out the Sunday Scribblings blog that set up a new word prompt every Sunday for some inspiration.Productivity is another area in our lives that we are always trying to improve.Something To Think About:It’s good to think about the things that you want to change about your life. It helps you see what you can do to become better at what you do while it will also help your audience see that you still want to improve upon things in your life.Sharing some of your life outside of work, business, and/or your blog will help people get to know you better. Sometimes it helps people to see that you are just a normal person.I love inspiring quotes and especially if they are related to the niche that I’m in. Other people love them for the same reason.Basically, quotes are morsels of knowledge from another person that help with inspiration and encouragement. Encourage your audience with niche-related quotes. It also helps just knowing that others have felt the same way.“There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.” —Ernest HemingwayStart by writing a list of the top things you wish you’d known. Just brain dump all your thoughts into that list. Then use that as the backbone for your blog post.It can be tough to try and visualize where you’ll be in more than a week. So 5–10 years can be hard to see. But this can be a great time to imagine and dream. Try to be realistic, though. Setting SMART goals really helps. You don’t want to feel overwhelmed when you realize how much is on your plate.Writing reviews is a great way to tell companies that you like their products, but more than that, it’s a great way to share awesome products with other people.Do you use CoSchedule? If so, you could write a review and save 50%.A few years ago, there was an open letter that many bloggers partook in. You’ve probably heard of it.It was called “A Letter To My 16-Year-Old Self”. With this, think about all the things you’d tell your younger self to help them through the things you went through.Here’s an example you can check out from Huffington Post.Write up a post using quotes you’ve gotten from experts in your field. People love posts like these, especially if what the experts are saying is new and can’t be found anywhere else online.Go to your Google Analytics and look at your most popular posts from the past few months, for each season, and share them with your followers again in a recap post.What has been the most successful way for you to build blog readers? Write down your steps and share them. Some people think it will harm them if they give away their secrets. But that isn’t true. If you give away your secrets, people are going to trust you and keep coming back to you for more.Find some awesome free images on Unsplash or in this blog post. Look at some pictures and use them to inspire your post idea. This is a creativity-building blog idea.I absolutely love seeing writers’ writing places. Your followers can take away so much inspiration these places.Mark Twain’s writing room via Fuel Your WritingShare your workplace. Artists love sharing and seeing other artists’ studios, while writers love seeing other writers’ offices. Share pictures of your office, too!If you have a turquoise writing desk, I might be jealous. :)Roald Dahl’s writing cottage via BBC and Daily MailShare what made you start blogging.Think of 15 awesome and funny things. You could also use this idea to write 15 things that no one knows about your business or product.Contact them to see if they’d write a guest post for you if you could write one for them.Something to remember: Other bloggers are looking for content as much as you are.Write a blog post on your process for coming up with blog ideas.Make a list and then focus on ways that you can show those unique characteristics and strengths more often.Write a post about it.Share the changes, journeys, and stats. You could also share the top posts from the past year and the top comments. It’s a great way to pull your readers into your blog and to thank them!Have a few posts that talk about a similar topic or continue a longer idea.Share how you found your team. Was there a hiring process? Or did you find them on an outsourcing website?It can be hard to fit all your thoughts into 140 characters. Take the idea that you got from a tweet and share that in post format on your blog.Have you read any great books in your niche? If so, why don’t you write a book review of sorts on the book?Grab some of the biggest lessons from the book that stuck out to you that you think would help your audience. Also, think about reaching out to the author of the book to share your review with them. Authors love it when people contact them to talk about their books. Who wouldn’t want to know that their writing impacted your life?Honestly!!!Example:  Killer Cocktail: How a Popular Drink Could Kill You in Your Sleep (Change it to Killer Content Marketing Cocktail: How ______ Could Kill Your Blog In Your Sleep)Or something like that. Be sure to check it in the headline analyzer.Creating more content like your most popular blog posts just makes sense. Use a tool like Moz to understand the keywords that are helping you crush it and get new blog ideas from your best content.Create a fun way to get your readers excited about your top posts. What else can you do to make them special?When you participate in a blog hop, blog roundup, or a carnival you’ll have to write a blog post that has to do with a topic. Usually the blogger who is hosting the blog hop or setting up the carnival will have an overarching theme. And then you’ll have to write something about that with a topic that relates.Having guest writers is an awesome way to fill up your blog with content. You just want to make sure you go about it the right way. Treat your blog like a magazine, and ask for pitches.How To Craft Your Writer’s Guidelines:When it comes to free e-books out there, there are a ton of them.Self-publishing has opened many doors for writers, but it’s also opened the publishing doors wide open for a whole lot of not-so-good stuff as well. That makes it difficult for a person to find “good” actionable e-books that are actually free.Put together a list post of good free e-books that you’ve found.Do you only write blog posts?Ever thought of writing something different? Think about writing lyrics, a short story, poetry, or even a short script and then share it on your blog.Playing around in different formats of writing will make you a stronger writer.Make a comprehensive guide on a certain topic. Teach your readers the in and out to writing “how to posts” or what ever topic you decide to choose. Remember to also make it actionable.Did someone influential in your life or business pass away?

If so, write up a list of the most helpful tools you’ve found and use.We just recently published a post here on the CoSchedule blog that was a checklist. These are fun posts to write. Just walk your readers through the process of doing something in a checklist format.Have you ever seen those posts where bloggers do the A-Z posts on certain topics? There are a few ways that you could go about using this for blog ideas.First, you could write one post with a list from A-Z and then list words that start with that letter. Or you could write a blog post for each letter. That would be a ton of blog ideas once you got through the whole alphabet.100 things you love, 100 things you enjoy, or 100 tools you swear by.Thank your readers. They’re reading your blog posts, so thank them. Give away something special to them for being awesome. They will definitely be thinking, “What’s in it for me?” every time they read a post on your blog. That’s just something to keep on your mind whenever you come up with new blog ideas.Do you have a lot of blog posts covering a certain topic? If so, compile them into one document. Ask a designer to make a cool cover through Fiverr, Behance or Dribbble, or just make your own with Canva.When you’re done with the book, write up another post covering some awesome tips from all the posts that you compiled into the ebook. Put a call to action in there where people can sign up for the book, and grow that email list.Write a blog post and then write a few quotes from your blog post by hand. Scan it and then upload those into your posts. This will add a new creative twist to your blog post.Turn your posts into downloadable audio mp3 files. This is a fun way to be unique since people sometimes get sick of reading a ton of information.

Having just started blogging again this post is a great help to me. There were many times when I would try blogging and run out of ideas fast, so I just quit. Now I will have many ideas.
I am currently writing 7 different blogs and some ideas will apply to one more than others, but at least I won’t run out for quite awhile.
As a matter of fact I had started writing a blog about the same subject and started doing my research when I ran across your fantastic article. I may add a link if that is OK with you. I am not going to do the newbie thing and request a link to mine.
Keep up the good work,

											This list isn’t an official Top 8 like you hear on the radio. Nobody, not even Google or Alexa, has enough traffic information to create a real ranking.The bloggers on this list are the top bloggers in their niche, or incredibly up-and-coming bloggers, based on detailed research (and lots of coffee drinking).But what they did have to do was meet a certain criteria that looks like this:We care about content here at CoSchedule. And how you can create better content: This research aims to reflect that.I’ve used BuzzSumo’s content analysis tool, as well as my own research, to focus on the content these bloggers have produced and how it’s made them a success.This covers, but isn’t limited to:All with the goal of showing you what they do and how you can do it, too.Each section breaks down a blog, their content, and what they’ve done to become successful—and how to be a successful blogger all by yourself.If you’re ready, let’s get into it, shall we?Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Jon’s blog, Boost Blog Traffic, is a powerhouse in the blogging niche. It covers all the tools and skills a blogger needs to become a success in the least amount of time possible.And, Jon is reportedly making $100,000 per month from this blog alone, which is testament to his abilities as a blogger. Let’s look at how he’s done it…Jon has a strict posting schedule of only one post per week, maximum. And, more often than not, that post is released on a Thursday.While that isn’t concrete—the blog occasionally posts on other days—that’s when he achieves the most success. Which shows his audience knows when to expect content, and is flocking there as soon as it’s released.That consistency doesn’t just apply to when he posts his content. It’s also in how he writes his content. For example, the introductions to all of the blog’s posts (even the guest ones) follow the exact same style. Take a look at this from one of their first ever posts back in 2012:And this one from December 2015:The process may have been refined, but it’s still the same. That’s over three years of consistency just in their introductions. Heck, even the same opening sentences show up from time to time!Be consistent with your content. And, not just when you post it, but the style you write it in, too. Give your audience something to expect, and a style that feels like ‘home’ when they read it. The more familiar and consistent it is, the more likely they are to return.Chiara Ferragni, or The Blonde Salad, is a prolific fashion blogger. And, thankfully, you don’t need to know your Jimmy Choo’s from your Louboutins to understand how she became one.Admittedly, she was employed as a Guess model which gave her some platform to build from. But that doesn’t make what she’s done with this blog any less impressive.Because to consistently get over 2,000 shares per blog post means that your content has to be good.From my research, this comes down to two easy-to-replicate steps:Between Monday and Friday, she posts content of different lengths at least once a day. As Matt Cutts from Google notes says, publishing content frequently can help you build an audience who checks in often to catch the latest information from your blog.While it’s definitely beneficial to get yourself out there on every form of media, it can be more effective to focus on fewer, or as is the case here, just one channel: Facebook.By focusing on building her Facebook presence, Chiara’s able to predict and manipulate a large source of her traffic. Plus it’s much easier to build a following on one channel than on multiple.Which is why her blog’s Facebook page has over 1,192,000 likes and counting.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?If it suits the style of your blog, post content more frequently to drive more traffic back to your site. It doesn’t have to be long; it just has to be valuable and informative. Narrow down your social media focus instead of trying to cover all of them. Build up an authority standing on Facebook or Twitter and then expand.I’ve been fortunate enough to work with Matt on a number of projects. And, in the world of effective SEO, he’s one of the go to guys.From working alongside him, I know three things to be true:So let’s see how that impacts his blog, and how he’s turned it into a success.Matt’s content doesn’t really go viral. In fact, his social shares are some of the lowest here:But what he lacks in social shares, he makes up for in comments and engagements. Matt goes out of his way to talk to, and get to know, his audience on a different level. It’s not blogger to audience, it’s friend to friend.And that’s why his posts regularly exceed 60 comments.He constantly surveys and asks his audience what they want, how they want it, and when they want it.There is no such thing as filler content either. He doesn’t have any fluff that just fills a posting schedule. He only provides long-form, actionable, or insightful content that his audience will benefit from.This level of control for him—and his readers—makes sure that there’s a consistent flow of traffic, and that Boost Blog Traffic style of brand-standard-ness throughout his content.What has truly helped Matt get this blog to such heights is getting out there and networking with other people in the niche. You just need to look at his ‘As Seen On’ page to see just how hard he worked at that:And, all of that exposure has given his site thousands of backlinks from high quality, authority sites:Which helps him bring in over 30,000 sessions a month from Google and organic sources alone.While social shares are important as a metric, they can sometimes cloud your measurement for success with vanity. And, it’s possible to have lots of success without ever going viral. Instead, take the time to get to know your audience—through surveys and emails and polls—to find out what they want and give it to them.While you’re finding out what your audience wants, be sure to reach out and find opportunities to write for other blogs in your niche, too. Not only does this help for SEO, but it helps for your overall branding and drives traffic to your content from other authorities, too.Recommended Reading:Benny Lewis is a language specialist from Ireland. His blog, Fluent In 3 Months, has rocketed him to Internet stardom in recent years. It’s led him to become a published author, and to even give a TEDx talk in Poland.Aside from speaking 11 different languages, he’s managed to build a mailing list of more than 150,000 people.While the BuzzSumo data on Fluent In 3 Months is a little fuzzy, a deeper look into the blog gives you simple insights into how he’s become so successful.Benny’s blog is not about him. It’s not a way to boast about how many languages he speaks or about how good he is at teaching. Instead, it’s all about you and what you want to achieve.When you first come to his site, he asks you what language you want to learn, and provides a tailored email course for you right away:That means he’s never sending junk content to his list. And, he’s getting all the benefits of email list segmentation, like the ones MailChimp found here:So not only is he providing consistent, valuable content to his readers directly to their inbox—he’s laser-targeting them and increasing his opens, and eventual social shares, by doing so, too. An average post gets 780 shares. That’s quite an achievement.The rest of the site is built around what you want, too. Instead of wading through blog posts trying to find the one you want, Benny has set his site up to be:And, because it’s an endless resource with instantly actionable content, that means you stay on the site much longer. It’s simple, but it’s effective. You need to give people a reason to stay on your site, because they’ll easily find a reason to leave.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Where you can, personalize your experience.Segment your email list to fit different sections of your audience and their interests. Whether you’re a retailer, a blogger, or anything else in between, there are different reasons everyone visits your blog. So, do your research to find them.And, make sure your blog is easy to navigate. There is nothing worse than a blog site that’s clunky and hard to find your way around. If not for user experience, do it for SEO. Because the cleaner your site structure, the easier it is for Google to crawl it.John’s blog and site, Roman Fitness Systems, is personal branding perfection. He’s taken what could have been another drab, boring fitness site, and turned it into something spectacular.To give you a little feel of that, take a look at this excerpt from the About section on his blog:Love it or hate it, it’s unique and attention grabbing. And, he also does everything you’ve seen so far in this article, too:He focuses on one social network: Facebook. Remember that this is the social platform that he’s found to work best for him. Play around with your social networks and test them.His site can be personalized to the fitness goals of the user:And, he consistently turns out long-form, valuable articles.But the real takeaway from John’s blogging success isn’t just in how well he does all these things. It’s the personal brand he’s built. Because people don’t just come for the knowledge bombs—they come for him.With a close look at the blog, you can see not all of the content is to do with health and fitness. Instead, he focuses on the attached subjects to it that he, and his readers, care about.Things like:And, not only is this done in an informative way, it’s also done in a charming, funny, sometimes controversial way. Whether that’s through a Facebook post or the headlines he chooses for all the articles on his blog (even the guest posts).He always makes decisions, and chooses content, that builds his personal brand. By creating such a strong, audience splitting tone of voice, he rallies people towards him (or pushes them away from him). Which is exactly what makes his blog remarkable.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Building a personal brand—or a clear brand identity—is a must.It doesn’t have to be as quirky or controversial as John’s, but it needs to be a little more than the usual beige personality that brands go for.Pick a side or a stance on your niche and run with it. Hammer it into all of your content, from the small pieces on your site, through to your blog posts and social media updates. It’ll galvanize people around you and create an aura people want to associate with (or get the hell away from).Recommended Reading:Stuart’s site, NicheHacks, has seen rapid success over the course of the last few years. In fact, in 2 years alone, he’s managed to build this site to generate more than $80,000 a year. Now, as a disclaimer, I’m part of his writing team, so I’m a little bias to the charm of this blog. But the following he’s built over the last few years, and the critical acclaim the blog has started to receive, goes above and beyond any of the nice feelings I get in my belly when I think about it.For example, his Mastermind Group on Facebook alone has more than 10,000 members.So, how has he managed to build such a successful blog?You’ve heard the saying, “Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free?” before, right? Lots of bloggers and marketers believe this to be true. That you need to save your best, and most valuable content for your paid content, because it’s stupid to give away your knowledge for free.But, that’s not a belief he shares.The average length of content there is around 3,000 words (I used to write him a 5,000-word epic each month), and he covers any topic a niche marketer might ever need.Just look at this list of his most popular content. Any of these could easily become a downloadable product to sell to people:While this might not equate to a lot of social shares (his average is only 85 per post) what it does equate to is massive engagement, email subscriptions, and conversions into sales:Like Matthew Woodward, Stuart Walker doesn’t focus his energy on creating tons of social shares for his content. Instead, he focuses on providing valuable information he knows his audience will seriously dig.As odd as it sounds, give away your best content for free. Let people see that you can guide them to success and you have their best interests at heart. And, do it all as frequently and often as possible.By doing this, you build more trust, boost engagement and create a feeling of authority around yourself (or your brand). The more trust you have, the better your bottom line will be.Jeff’s blog is all about the art, craft, and lifestyle of being a writer. And, as you know as a writer yourself, good blogs about that are few and far between.Understanding how he’s built his blog doesn’t require a lot of stats and figures and fancy data breakdowns, either. Even though his stats are impressive—an average post gets 423 shares.What truly makes Jeff successful is how he approaches his content. Because all of it is aimed at empowering you—yes you, sitting there, right now—to achieve whatever it is you want to achieve.He grabs your attention with stories, both personal and of others, to maintain your attention and keep you on the page:His stories are insanely powerful because they give authenticity to everything he does. That also taps a deep psychological need of people. There’s a high level of transparency in what he does, too. He’s open and honest with his readers about everything, and even makes open commitments to his readers.And, he even goes out of his way to nurture relationships with people away from his blog, by communicating with followers, friends, and fans on their own Facebook feeds:So, where a lot of bloggers go for stardom and distance from their audience—like a performer on a stage or screen—Jeff aims to connect and become a friend with them and to get involved with them beyond his blog.Break the fourth wall. Connect with your audience on a different, more personal level beyond the realm of your blog and its posts.But when you are writing your posts, aim to put yourself into your posts. Share stories and events and emotions that come from deep within you, or your brand, too.If you don’t know Gretchen from her blog, you might know her from her book, The Happiness Project.A lot of blogs out there tackle to topics of happiness, habits, and personal development. But few of them do it as successfully and enthusiastically as Gretchen has over the last few years.She has frequency and consistency down to a T by posting every day of the week.But what really makes her content special is the content of her content. She treats herself as a case study all of the time…Where most blogs churn out content like, 5 Ways To Be Happier Today, and the yawn-inducing, 10 Habits Of Happy People, Gretchen grabs the topic by the scruff of the neck and creates content you can use.A few examples of her recent headlines are:She case studies herself, and others, to create actionable real world advice that’s proven. Not nice-to-knows or the occasional motivation booster. These posts work, and have been proven to work. And that’s why those articles get the most traction and shares.What she’s done, remarkably, is break the mould of her niche and create content of a different kind. As Seth Godin would term it, she’s created a ‘Purple Cow’ in her niche. Look at your competitors and what they’re doing. Then, make it better. Improve on it. Break the mould and give them more than they’re getting elsewhere. It’s the only way to stand out in a more and more cluttered blogosphere.That was a monster post, wasn’t it? I hope it was as enjoyable to read as it was for me to research and write.Let’s look at the key points of how to be a successful blogger one last time, so you don’t have to go through the whole post again:#1. Be Consistent: With your tone and with your schedule. When people know what to expect from your blog, they’ll be dying to come back every week.#2. Share Your Advice Frequently: Your audience will come back if they can expect new content often. Plan a blog posting schedule that shares great advice frequently to build a loyal following.#3. Focus On One Social Media Channel: Don’t spread yourself too thin, get a foothold on one channel, and then grow from there.#4. Engage Your Audience: Get to know them. Understand them. And, ask them what they want. It’s better to create a small army that loves you then try and please everyone.#5. Outreach: Get out there and network. Guest blog, comment and share. Make your name known by relevant people with similar audiences. Your next big hit may only be a conversation away.#6. Personalize: Make the experience as tailored to your reader as you can. And, segment your mailing list accordingly.#7. Focus On User Experience: Make your blog easy to navigate and find information. Use blog categories and tags to group similar content.#8. Create A Clear Brand Identity: Take a stance, find your tone and create something unique. Let people flock to you (or run away from you) based on how they feel about it. But always be unmistakably you.#9. Give Away As Much As Possible: Value will never die. And, you need to give it to your audience. The more you’re willing to share with them, the more they’ll trust you.#1o. Going Viral Really Doesn’t Matter: Most of the bloggers, from the biggest to the smallest, don’t have viral hits every time. Their average shares per post are always under 900. So don’t fret about it too much. As long as the number is going up over time, you’re okay.#11. Be Authentic And Transparent: You’re not a movie star. You can connect with your audience on a more personal level. So, get beyond the computer screen and reach out to them and become a bigger part of their lives.#12. Break The Mould: Go above and beyond your competitors. Live and breath what you do and go to a level of depth that nobody else is willing to. It might be harder, but it’s definitely worth it.Now, where are you going to start? Let me know in the comments…Click To Tweet

Download these 21+ marketing templates, each designed to help you do your best work now.Good read. Great article. I totally agree  with the point on authenticity. Sometimes it’s  just  a personal touch that grabs the attention of the readers! (and also shoos them away! ) Hey @georgefelixblog:disqus, I’m super glad you were able to leave with that nice takeaway! Thanks for reading. :)Great advice!   I’m starting my new copywriting blog and needed this. I love the advice because it all seems feasible…except networking. It always seems like the toughest thing for me to do. I will work on commenting and introducing myself to other copywriters in my niche.  Any more recommendations on how to network?  Thank you in advance! Hey @disqus_1VNRA7IMdJ:disqus, glad you found some advice you can use for your own blog here. :)As far as networking goes, blog comments are one way to do it. You can also publish great content on your site, then start networking through providing guest posts much like Matthew Woodward has done to build up his credibility and connections to editors in his niche.Twitter chats might work for you, too, since I know copywriters are fairly active on Twitter.I hope that helps!Mm I have to work my consistency first.Thanks James.Hey @manjuhariharan:disqus, good luck! If you’d like some help, here’s a post dedicated specifically to getting better at consistency: http://coschedule.com/blog/publish-more-consistent-content/Thanks for reading!Great post James.There are so many things that contribute to success.  Of course they are all important but they are only useful if you are persistent as much as you are consistent.  Early on in a bloggers career it can feel like you are pushing the proverbial ‘sh*t’ up hill with no results.  But through patience and persistence and following sound advice such as yours success will come.Thank you for sharing Hey @robynwilliamswrites:disqus, I love the idea of “persistence”. It makes perfect sense to keep going initially because publishing is the only way to improve. I might steal that for upcoming posts. :)Fantastically useful. Thanks. I think my next thing needs to be to focus on developing my relationships on one social media channel (in my case, Facebook). Huge relief, frankly, because one thing that was stressing me out was how to be everywhere, effectively. Good to know I can grow, over time, from one base.Hey @Vega Subramaniam:disqus, I’m with you. We just started focusing in on building a little tighter community on Facebook, and the results so far have been promising. Good luck!Thanks! Glad to hear an emerging-success story! :)Wow! So much specific, helpful info. in this post.  Thanks so much!  I’ll be saving this & sharing it with others.  Wonderful to see you “practice what you preach” in this post too!So happy to hear you’ve enjoyed this post! And thanks for sharing! :)Consistency is key in anything we do do in life. When you hear over night success, it  does it mean it was a 24-hours success. Blogging should be like that also.You guys just have me reading all these posts!

											Research from Chartbeat shows 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. is the optimal time to share on social media, with social traffic being at its highest in the late afternoon:While there is still mileage in posting through the morning (more on that next), schedule the updates you want to convert most with, like blog posts, in this time window.It’s a generality to say that posting in the afternoon is the best way to grow your audience. But there are better times to post on social media than others.To find out when your own audience is active on social networks, grab this Google Analytics custom report we custom-built for you with love from CoSchedule. :)It’ll tell you when your current audience is clicking through to read your content. That will help you understand what your most popular social networks are so you can use your time more effectively. You’ll be able to share your content even smarter.So let’s use your own data to strategically choose the best times to share. First, choose the blog you’d like to apply the report to:That report doesn’t look like much at first, but right off the bat you’ll see which networks are your most popular ones:When you click through to see the data for each network, you’ll see the best days to post on that network. Take it one step further and click through on those days, you’ll see the best times to post on that network, too.That Google Analytics custom report will work with your own data that comes directly from your audience. Use it to schedule your social messages at the best times to increase your traffic and opportunity to get more re-shares that could help you get more followers.The folks over at Beevolve recently posed the question: If you tweet more, will you get more followers?And, well, the short answer is yes:The more you share, the more followers you will get. But as the boffins over at Buffer noted, this could be for a few reasons:But while it’s not clear whether this is correlation or causation, it doesn’t really matter. Tweeting more will increase the amount of followers you have in one way or another.Just be sure you’re not only updating about yourself…In the world of social media, you’re unknowingly categorized into two separate camps:The updates of a meformer are inward looking and have more of the feel of a broadcast:While an informer shares outward-looking, valuable information—a little like this:Now there is nothing wrong with being a meformer. It’s fine to do that for your friends and family on your personal accounts, like the other 80% of meformers out there.However, if you do want to get more followers, Rutgers university found that informers have 2x more followers because their updates and content are of value to the reader.Think of it a little in the terms of blogging. You wouldn’t write a post where you only say, I or me all the way through it. And you’re probably not going to tell them about your cousin’s latest drunken mishap either.So focus on curating valuable, outward-facing social messages with a personal touch.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Being quintessentially British, this is a bitter pill for me to swallow. But, the data doesn’t lie. Dan Zarrella’s research found that the more negative remarks you make, the fewer followers you’ll get:Not only does positivity help you get more followers, Neil Patel also analyzed data that suggests people are much more likely to share positive content, especially when it connects to these emotions:Get the followers and shares your content deserves by sharing positive social messages.According to Lithium, 52% of people who Tweet your brand expect you to respond within one hour (even if you’re a solo blogger, you’re a brand). And, if that’s a complaint, it jumps right up to 72%.If you don’t respond, they’re likely to punish you by either negative word-of-mouth, unfollowing, or other means. While if you do respond in a timely manner:That means not only is responding quickly good for your business now, it’s good for lead generation and the future of getting more followers.While it might not be fitting for your business to share your Man Crush Monday (David Beckham, always), it turns out there is actually an optimal day for everything on social media:Pinterest research found that different days of the week had different connotations for people. For example, starting the week off on a positive high with fitness and ending with chilled food and crafts.Your feed might not fit all of these categories. But, there are specifics like quotes or humor you can use no matter your industry:You want power users to interact with your content. I know every time Jeff Goins likes or comments me on Facebook, I do a little fan-boy giggle.But the truth, as confirmed by Mention, is that 91% of the people who talk about your brand will have less than 500 followers:You’ve just seen that responding to the people who mention you can have a big impact on your business and conversion success. So, no matter who gets in touch with you, be sure to acknowledge them.Research from Canva and BuzzSumo found that large Twitter summary cards create 3x more interactions than any other form of card:While you may not be able to use these for every update because it’s code that has to be embedded into your page, it’s beneficial for:Where you can display them in a larger, more informative manner, like this one:To get this card, simply head to this developer page and copy this code:Head over to your post in WordPress, hit the Text tab, and paste it in at the bottom of your post:Then edit the sections inside the quotation marks. So, for this post, the code would look like:<meta name=”twitter:card” content=”summary_large_image”>
<meta name=”twitter:site” content=”@CoSchedule”>
<meta name=”twitter:creator” content=”@j4meswrites”>
<meta name=”twitter:title” content=”Boost Your Followers Using Science”>
<meta name=”twitter:description” content=”Want a scientific way to boost the amount of Social Media followers you have? Look no further…”>
<meta name=”twitter:image” content=”http://coschedule.com/image-for-this-post-example-only”>Reaching more people will inevitably help you get more followers.The decline in Facebook organic page reach has thrown a big wrench in the engine for social marketers. But, there are still some real glimmers of hope out there.That same research from Canva and BuzzSumo also found that adding images to your Facebook updates will give you 2.3x more engagement.Be sure to do this by uploading the image on its own, too. That way, it goes into your Facebook post through the add photo’s function as opposed to being pulled from the code on your post:While photo posts are great for engagement, Facebook is slowly taking away the ability to reach more followers. In fact, it now has the lowest organic reach of any type of update, with video getting more than double that reach.You don’t have to be the one who created that video content, either. You just need to upload it.Facebook might have been the start, but you can now experiment with video on tons of networks: Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Google+ (well, YouTube) all have ways to use video to reach your audience.In a study of over 4,000,000 tweets, Stone Temple Consulting found that tweets with images had more than double the retweets and almost double the likes of those that didn’t contain images:More retweets equals more exposure. More exposure means more engaged followers. That’s a win/win right there.A big part of getting more followers is keeping the ones you’ve already got; but if you’re guilty of bulk posting (I am), that could be problematic.Research from KAIST university in South Korea found that a big factor for people unfollowing is leaving too many posts at any one time:The survey participants unfollowed those who left many tweets within a short time, created tweets about uninteresting topics, or tweeted about the mundane details of their lives.So, take advantage of social scheduling tools like CoSchedule to space out your (exciting) posts across days, weeks, or even months instead of posting multiples at once.A survey from Nielsen noted that……which is a lot of your follower base. In fact, more than half of them are primed and ready to buy from or engage with you. So take advantage and let them spread the word for you at the same time.Create a competition or offer that involves retweets and shares, and you’ve got a campaign that will draw attention.There’s no way around it. The more shares, mentions, likes, and retweets your social campaign gets, the more followers you’re going to pick up along the way.But, what most social campaigns miss out on is emotion. And by doing that, you miss out on a huge opportunity to get more followers.The big-wigs at Harvard studied marketing campaigns and the emotions that make them go viral. The results? Each campaign evoked at least one of these five:You’ll normally find you can combine two or three of these into any social media message. At the least, your headlines or content should create interest.If you want to see almost all of these encompassed in one sentence, look at this excellent piece of copy from Slavery Footprint:I recently researched what makes the most shareable images on social media, and there was some fascinating research in there. One of the standouts was this:Researchers at Georgia Tech studied over 1,000,000 images on Pinterest and discovered that using red, pink and purple in your graphics got you the most shares and interactions. Because, well, they’re deep visceral colours that create emotions like sexual arousal and failure in people.Try incorporating these colors into your next social media image by making them the focal point of your text, or the main image. The results could shock you.KissMetrics ran an interesting study about how to steal your competitor’s followers. One of the most interesting aspects of that study—that you can use right now—is approaching their neglected fans.By running a competitor’s Facebook page through FanPage Karma, you can see an analysis of Facebook trends, habits, and posting schedules. But, more importantly, you can see how that competitor interacts with their audience. And, you’ll see that a lot of pages neglect their fans:And you’ll find that most of these pages are in the 60%+ for neglecting their fans’ comments. So, you can swoop in by:Then you can usher them back to your page without having to be all comment-link-spammy about it.Most people like authority, it’s just built into them. And, that’s been proven time and time again throughout history. But now it’s also come to the realm of social media.Dan Zarrella found that people who identify themselves as an authority have many more followers than people who don’t.So, don’t be humble in your profile. Identify yourself as who you are in the best possible light, just like you would on your resume.Knowing what you know now about meformers and informers, which of these sounds more appealing?The second one, of course. Because while the other is nice and accessible, the latter lets you make an instant decision on whether someone is worth following.OKCupid discovered that what you write about yourself on their dating site is less than 10% of what someone thinks about you. The other 90% is your profile pictures.And, that’s not just a stat that applies to dating sites either. It works for social media too.As Rand Fishkin found, having a brightly colored background on your profile picture can make a big impact on the amount of followers you will get. Buffer’s extensive research into the psychology of profile pictures also validates that, too.But you might be thinking, “I can’t have a profile picture like that; I’m a business”. For you, a simple logo picture will still be effective.And you can get creative with it, too, like KLM have done here:As much as you might think hashtags are a little silly, especially when you see them for toothpaste or toilet paper, they’re actually an incredible marketing tool. And, they can help you get more followers much more effectively.Hashtags are not only a big part of how we use social media; they’ve even started to become part of how you speak. Or, at least those up-to-date on popular lingo.More importantly, as Linchpin SEO shows, using hashtags can help you get 2x more engagement among other benefits:And, if you want to take a leaf from Marsha Collier’s book, you can join in the conversation other people are having on your hashtag, like she does with the hashtag #custserv.Tuesday Customer Service Chat 9pET ""Is social customer service faster and better than other channels?""#custserv pic.twitter.com/Eq4EnjbY9H— Marsha Collier (@MarshaCollier) February 1, 2016Post Planner picked up on a piece of information from Business Insider and Facebook that could seriously help you boost the amount of people you can reach there.Apparently, when you use the word, congratulations, more people pick up on your post. But this also appears to have carried on over to other milestones, too, such as:And it doesn’t appear to just be speculation, either.When I posted a recent update about visiting Machu Picchu, a milestone event in my life, the engagement I got was huge:That is much more engagement than my standard post at 12 to 20 likes a time. Some of these likes and comments came from people I hadn’t interacted with in years on Facebook, too.Other travelers, I was with reported getting 200 to 300 more interactions than normal on their Machu Picchu posts also. Post Planner also saw similar results from landmark posts when they looked at the most viral posts from Facebook’s top 50 brands, too.Okay, you’ve been hit with a lot of data there. But all of it is easy to do and super valuable to help you get more followers on any social media channel.It doesn’t matter if you’re starting from scratch, or trying to increase your six-figure audience base, all of this data when applied will help you:Now, the only question that remains is, which one are you going to start with to get more followers?Let me know in the comments…Click To Tweet

Thank you so much for putting this together and sharing!So happy you found it helpful!Do I still have to set up twitter card if I’m using Coschedule and I do a manual image upload?Hey Adrian, CoSchedule will help you share out image posts that look awesome already; you’re right. The Twitter card code stuff will help other people who share your content also share images instead of just plain text shares.So, Twitter explains it a little better than me: “Our system recognizes when URLs are included in a tweet, and crawls your site to fetch the Card type and content.” So while you use CoSchedule to rock out with awesome visual shares, this helps other people who share your content do it even better.I hope that helps!@junglefrog:disqus I think the answer above will also help you out with your question on this post.

											A very basic principle in content marketing is to look back at your best content and repeat its success. I’ve recently taken this idea to the next level at CoSchedule to help us use our data from past content to help us plan better content and actually predict future growth.That analysis revealed that top-performing content reflects four key traits extremely well. On the other hand, worst-performing content does poorly in all four areas.Simply rank each blog post according to four questions, giving each question a 1–3 ranking (meaning a top post according to your gut would be a 12 whereas the worst would be a 4.)After you rank them, compare each blog post’s score to its page views to translate your gut into actual data. The results should show that most of your high scoring content ends up being your best performing blog posts. If not, you just learned a lot about how your gut is off, and you can use your new knowledge backed by data to strategically choose to publish better content.You can do this process for your content, too. But the point is: Since the idea of solid topic, research, depth, and keywords define success for content, your blog titles should reflect those qualities to connect with your audience from the moment they see your headlines.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The #1 thing that will help you write successful blog titles is by first creating content your audience will be deeply interested in learning more about. It makes sense, right? That’s why this post kinda started off with that tangent, but it’s coming full circle right now:From there, define the single best value proposition for your content.For example, after a ton of brainstorming, this blog post’s value proposition is to increase traffic. Recent research shows 29% of content marketers measure success primarily through social media and 38% see traffic as their #1 form of measurement. This blog post helps both of those groups of content marketers reach their goals.^See what I did there?The second pillar of successful content is to back up the claims you made in your value proposition with research. This is where you prove to your audience that your blog post is different because it’s actually based on real success they could also experience if they just read your blog post.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Informal research from Canva and Ian Cleary of Razor Social suggests that including numbers in your blog titles can double your social shares. Data from Brian Dean at Backlinko also suggests that including numbers in your blog titles can increase your clickthrough rate by 36%!There are a few ways to do this:You get the picture.The blog post you’re reading right now has several numbers; I chose to focus on 500 words, 100 templates, and the results you could achieve if you follow this advice with 438% more traffic. We drew those 500 words from more than 1 million of the most-shared headlines we’ve seen go through CoSchedule, so I could have also included that number.This is not blowing smoke. Seven of our top 10 posts on the CoSchedule blog have at least one number in the blog title, if not more. And of those seven, six are in the top six positions and they get on average 206% more traffic than an average blog post.The third pillar of awesome sauce content is depth and delivering on the promises you made in your blog title with your value proposition and research.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?When you translate this to your blog title, it means telling the story truthfully and as clearly as you can. If your blog post doesn’t follow through on the value proposition or you can’t back up your number, you’re doing it wrong.This is where you translate your actionable, in-depth, how-to advice into a few words that help your readers understand what to expect after clicking through to read your content:It seems obvious, but it’s incredible how often blog titles don’t deliver on the promises they make.I wanted to include examples of successful blog titles outside the marketing industry to complement this post. Unfortunately, I was super dismayed by the sheer lack of quality behind the headlines I found because they were purely click bait.Here are some things to look out for:I searched for “manage multiple projects” and clicked through to see the headlines:The top five search results promised how to resolve my challenge to manage multiple projects at once, but they barely scratched the surface. You can avoid situations like these for yourself by thinking of searcher intent:If you were to click-through the top five search results for this example, most of the blog posts don’t deliver on these three searcher stories (to use a term from agile project management). In fact, #2 only delivers one mistake instead of the five it promises while all of the others neglect the how to nature they promise.That causes poor reader experience that could increase your bounce rate and cause you to lose fans like my friend John here who commented on a recent post Ben wrote:Good blog titles are only as good as the actionable, in-depth, and how-to advice that follows after the clickthrough.Takeaway: Write blog titles that tell the complete story in your posts, and deliver on the promise you make. If you’re not sure if you’re making this mistake, take a look at your bounce rate in Google Analytics. If it’s more than 5%, you can use the advice from this post to help you work through even better blog titles.The fourth pillar of great content is optimizing it for your audience to find it via search engines. The 17% of you who put 5–10 hours into writing blog posts can get more traffic from your content if you simply optimize it so people can find it when they need it.I say it that way because Google seems to reward longer content with better rankings. And if time is an indicator of length, depth, covering everything having to do with that topic and giving actionable stories, then those who spend more time creating content have more opportunity to get traffic and social shares from this pillar of successful blog posts.Relating that back to your blog titles, Brian Dean recently researched the top 200 ranking factors that make Google tick, and one of them was this:H1 tags are a “second title tag” that sends another relevancy signal to Google, according to results from this correlation study.What Brian is trying to say, is that when you target a keyword in your blog posts, it makes sense to include that keyword in your blog titles for your page title and H1. Brian also notes that including the keyword closer to the beginning of your blog title (specifically in your page title) helps search engines understand the importance of it in relation to your post.Jonah Berger is the author of Contagious: Why Things Catch On, and found there are six STEPPS behind the psychology of contagious content:I’ll let Jonah himself explain his research a little more thoroughly:Neil Patel also researched a few different studies to find five key elements that help influence social shares:And when the New York Times analyzed why their readers were sharing content, they found people share:Now, all of this goes way beyond writing catchy blog titles, and it’s all great advice you can use to craft even better content. But let’s take all of this research and apply it to your blog titles specifically:Appeal to the emotional reasons people would read your content. Understanding your readers’ challenges and suggesting your blog post offers a solution immediately from your headline will encourage clicks and shares.For example, think of headlines that include that will messaging in them: 21+ Easy Ways To _____ That Will Skyrocket Your Followers By 552% In 1 Year.Take advantage of trendy words and appeal to entertainment, amazement, and astonishment. Jonah uses the word remarkable often to describe content that gets shared—so include noteworthy information in your blog titles that shows the remarkable information your readers will get after they click.For example, Neil Patel offers this example for a blog title that amazes: How Spending $162,301.42 on Clothes Made Me $692,500. That blog title also has numbers as proof that you can experience the same success as Neil if you just follow his advice.Write your blog titles to help people look good. Your readers want to feel successful, engaged in the world, and be supportive. Your readers feel as though the blog titles from the content they share—like yours—define who they are as people.A great way to connect this emotion to your blog titles is through uncertainty. When someone reads your blog post, they know the answer to something others don’t—so let them boast their knowledge while also encouraging more clicks back to your content.Do this by asking questions. And not just any questions. Close-ended questions that essentially cause your readers to answer with yes or no. In a recent case study, I found that social messages with close-ended questions get more clickthroughs than any other type of social message we shared. In fact, close-ended questions get 255% more clickthroughs than open-ended questions!For example, write a blog title like: Are You Using _____ To Get 277% More _____? Blog titles like this suggest that the sharer knows the answer and is getting the kind of success your headline promises. It also makes anyone seeing that blog title feel the fear of missing out (FOMO) that will encourage them to click through just to know the answer. And hey, you might get the snowball effect of yet another share.Blog titles that focus on practical value are those that offer how-to, actionable, and oftentimes step-by-step solutions to problems. They cover information that is interesting—not the same-old thing that feels like it’s been done over and over again.You can do this by differentiating your blog titles by including your value proposition in them directly.For example, this blog title includes the value proposition of doing something super quickly (because who has time these days) coupled with a promise of doing it in 10 quick steps: The 10-Minute, 10-Step Solution For The Best _____.So other than focusing on telling a complete story with your blog title and connecting it to your audience’s emotional needs, what specific words make certain blog titles catchier than others?That’s a good question and one that Joanna Wiebe from Copy Hackers has an answer to.Joanna is a copywriting genius. When I read her Headlines, Subheadlines, and Value Propositions book recently, one very interesting point really stuck with me (among tons of others—you should totally check out her book since you’re interested in writing better blog titles):Use the words your audience uses in your blog titles.That’s a very simple idea, and it’s one that can help you connect with your audience immediately because it’s exactly how they think.While planning a headline test with Crazy Egg’s website, Joanna surveyed their users by asking them to describe Crazy Egg in two to three words. From there, she worked the most-used words into her headlines to connect with an audience like Crazy Egg’s existing users. That. Is. Brilliant.So when we launched a new course recently, I took Joanna’s advice and used the words from our audience’s biggest challenges in the headline to connect with their lingo immediately:The words were: on track, organized, and save time. The result? For an initial launch just to our existing email subscribers, 2,181 people signed up with page view to signup conversion rate of 27%!You can apply that same strategy to the words you use in your blog titles by sending a simple survey to your existing email subscribers. Just promise them a reward (a free e-book or exclusive content of some kind is perfect for this), that it’ll only take two minutes, and ask one simple question: “What is your biggest professional challenge as a (insert job title here)?”That will not only give you tons of blog post ideas; you’ll also have their own words you can use in all of your copy—and blog titles—moving forward.Since CoSchedule is a social media editorial calendar tool, we have access to millions of blog titles. Literally. So, being the data nerds we are, we looked at more than 1 million headlines and found the words used most often in the top shared content.From there, we compiled a list for you of those 500 words to use as a tear sheet for inspiration the next time you’re writing blog titles:So you could take all the advice from this post and start writing catchy blog titles right now. You know the background of your four pillars of successful content, how to connect to your audience emotionally, and how to use catchy words in your headlines.Or you could get a little more advice from the headline pros out there with some formulas so you don’t have to come up with everything from scratch.Sound good?Let’s take a look at the best blog title templates from around the Interwebs.Write better headlines with formulas from Joanna Wiebe of Copy Hackers: Joanna wrote an amazing post with every copywriting formula you could imagine. In it, she says she keeps a swipe file handy for when she sees cool headlines she’d like to use for inspiration later on. Might be something for you to consider, too. :)Write magnetic headlines with templates from Brian Clark of Copyblogger: Brian is a genius when it comes to writing pretty much anything. He has some great advice for using social proof, insider knowledge, and appealing to ease to get more traffic.Get attention with headline templates from Michael Hyatt: Michael is a friend of CoSchedule who’s built a platform of 615,597 fans to date. His blog titles definitely tie into the information throughout this post, and his templates—though simple—are extremely effective at getting more readers.Increase conversions with headline formulas from Sherice Jacob on the Crazy Egg blog: Sherice takes the stance that writing great copy is an art and a science. She’s helped a bunch of folks increase conversion rates with her headline writing skillz. Since Crazy Egg—a tool that helps people get better conversions—thought this information was awesome, I thought you gals and guys would enjoy it, too.Get more social shares with a little advice from CoSchedule users: We recently analyzed the 4,302,684 blog titles in our database, focusing on the headline structure behind the 1,000 most popular posts that got the most social shares of any content we’ve ever seen. Those formulas are proven to increase your chances of getting more social shares from your blog titles.To top off that list, I’d also like to share the blog title structures from our top-performing content on the CoSchedule blog:If you start with these ten blog title formulas and write ’em in the headline analyzer, I can nearly guarantee you’ll get an awesome grade and score which means you’ll get more social shares for your hard work. Which brings me to the last step here…Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Woohoo! You made it and understand the best ways to write super catchy blog titles. Let’s just say you’re having a bit of trouble staying inspired. There are some great tools out there to help you out:Impact has a blog title generator that helps you insert a topic you’d like to write about and spits out all sorts of headlines to get the inspiration going.Similarly, HubSpot as a blog topic generator that will help you enter in a couple nouns that you might use in your blog post (think about using the keyword), and generate a bunch of topics based on your nouns.Where HubSpot starts, SEOPressor takes it a step further and literally asks you to enter a keyword into their blog title generator to get the ideas flowing.And if you’re looking for something a little more humorous and trendy, the content idea generator by Portent is the one for you.Last but not least, once you come up with your headline through any of these generators, run it through the headline analyzer (which is now built directly into your CoSchedule editorial calendar, too). While your blog title might be close, you could probably use a few of the lessons you’ve learned from this post—along with the huge list of emotional words—to improve your blog title even further to increase your social shares.You’re a headline maniac now with your 5-step process for writing a super catchy blog title. I wanted to recap with a bit of advice you might have seen from us in the past because if you’re serious about improving your blog titles, this is how to take what you just learned to the next level:You’ve got this. :)Click To Tweet

2015-12-16,http://coschedule.com/blog/cross-functional-team/,How To Create The Best Content With Your Cross-Functional Team,"The free blog post headline analyzer will score your overall headline quality and rate its ability to result in social shares, increased traffic, and SEO value.You can’t make a bridge out of only rebar. You can’t build a house only with nails. A lot of different building materials and the knowledge of how to use them are required.It’s not enough that you’ve already done the work to assemble a great content marketing team. When it comes to your blog, your team is made up of people with different skills and areas of expertise.Your team is made up of writers, editors, and some are great with SEO. Some people are just subject matter experts you need to extract the story from who know nothing about content marketing. Your team runs the gamut and without a concerted effort harness all of these different skills (and personalities) toward a common goal, you may end up with conflict.Cross-functional teams have become more and more common in an age where speed has increased. The need to innovate and create at a faster pace means teams with a broad range of skills have to learn to work together. Gone are the days of large specific teams fussing forever on something before passing it off on to the next team and forgetting about it from that point on. In a cross-functional team, the entire ugly process happens in full view and cooperation of disparate team members.Click To Tweet

											In a 2015 study, researchers found out that 75% of cross-functional teams weren’t actually all that functional. Lead researcher, Behnam Tabrizi found out that these teams were failing on several fronts:They couldn’t stay aligned with a company’s goals.Tabrizi noted that most of these teams were failing because of a specific (and seemingly obvious) reason: An organization lacks a systemic approach. He further explained it in terms of isolated “silos” where different team members (or groups of team members) didn’t work well together. The designers didn’t work well with the writers, for example, or the editors conflicted with the marketers.When leadership doesn’t lead, when accountability doesn’t exist, when communication is foggy, and when goals aren’t clear and specific, cross-functional teams can’t perform.Rest assured, even as we use the word leadership throughout this post, it’s you as the editor and marketer who is leading your business’ content efforts. You’re the one who has the power to pull together the team you need, even from multiple departments and walks of life, to grow your business.Clearly, you don’t want to be a part of that 75% of cross-functional teams running around in circles and never achieving their goals, but how do you avoid it? It seems inevitable that human nature will throw sand in the gears. That is when personality and communication conflicts will arise.This may sound a little odd in an age where hierarchy in the workplace is gone. You must have leadership at the top that decides on complex decisions affecting these cross-functional team projects.Tabrizi uses Cisco as an example, describing how they allowed 100 people to attend meetings, but only a core group of leaders could communicate back to them and tell them their functions. And, one level above this leadership was an even smaller team governing over them.While you probably don’t have 120 people on your team, the idea is one that still has value for the small guy: Not everyone dictates to everyone else about what will happen. Only the leaders do. This may cause some strife in some teams, particularly in those where hierarchy is abandoned.All opinions are valuable. There are times for having brainstorm sessions and problem-solving meetings. But sometimes, the leadership has to lead and the team must follow.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?When you assembled your team you found people who had specific skills that were needed to get the job done. Wouldn’t it be smart to define the roles that those skills and specific people fill?While you don’t want to create a “that’s not my job” culture in your cross-functional team, you do want to be specific about what you expect people to do, and deal with any troublesome ambiguity team members might feel.One of the reasons some cross-functional teams get hung up is because someone is working outside of their role (often trying to be helpful) and that confuses the person who is supposed to do it. They decide it’s no longer their job and get in the habit of not doing it. Have meeting times for your team to brainstorm on the projects you all are working on. This will help each person know what role they are to play in finishing a task.Have meeting times for your team to brainstorm on the projects that you all are working on. This will help each person know what role they are to play in finishing a task.When you don’t clearly define a role, it’s difficult to use a task-based system to progress through the project. Your team members must know what is expected of them so they know when their task is complete.One final note for leadership: If you give a team member a specific role, don’t micromanage and tell them how to do it. Let them do their work, or you’ll both kill motivation and create a sense of doubt.Recommended Reading: 8 Startling Truths About Multitasking And ProductivityGot a system where each team member can get approval to proceed along the path toward completion?It’s funny how we forget about the need for details, such as defining what “done” means. By having a clear definition on what a completed task looks like, you give your team members the ability to make autonomous decisions.This is a good thing. If they can’t do this, they have to run to leadership every step of the way.For example, do your content marketers have a clear definition of what a post draft should look like? How about what an edited post should contain? And what about the final edits and voice your blog is going for?As long as you are clear and specific, each team member can then “self-approve” and mark a task as complete. If, for some reason, you have tasks or roles that require leadership approval (e.g. purchases that fit within a budget), make that part of the definition.As with roles, the more specific you get isn’t about being restrictive but is instead about providing more freedom. You give team members confidence because they know they are doing what is expected of them. This will also help with personal productivity for the whole team.Working efficiently is a tough nut to crack.We have a lot of posts on this blog about efficiency and productivity, but when you’re talking about a team instead of just an individual, it gets complicated.Individual efficiency hacks are fine, but encourage your team members to use what works. Group efficiency is not based on a hack. It’s based on something very simple: deadlines.But deadlines must exist, and deadlines must matter. They must be enforceable and consequently enforced.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?While you may not want to set a deadline for every tiny task (depending upon how detailed your tasks are), you are definitely going to want to set deadlines for major milestones. And, if your team habitually misses deadlines, you may, indeed, need to set them for smaller tasks. It really helps to learn how to meet deadlines as a team.Lack of team efficiency is based on individuals not hitting deadlines. People miss deadlines because they’re overwhelmed.Maybe they’re unable to tell you they can’t get it all done. Missing deadlines is an indicator of exactly that.Remember that working quickly does not mean giving your team less time. You have to give them enough time to contribute, both in the actual work and in communicating with other team members (and you, the leader).Leading a cross-functional team is difficult. Anyone in a position of leadership should determine whether or not they are using techniques to ensure success.Did you clearly define the goals, the parameters, the budget, and the resources before your team got started? A cross-functional team is not the setting to be vague and touchy-feely. Be as specific as possible so your team knows the boundaries and the path. Every project (i.e. piece of content) should have defined parameters.As a leader, do you have a system or habit in place where you can periodically check the progress of your team? It may be simply reviewing what tasks are completed, or having a mid-stream meeting with the team to see how things are progressing and holding team members accountable. If you don’t do these “health checks”, you are leaving project progress to chance, assuming every team member is going to perform properly.Do you have someone who oversees the entire process from start to finish? This isn’t about micromanaging and telling people how to do their job, but is simply about making sure that the work is progressing within specified parameters toward goals, budgets, and deadlines.Do you regularly retune your team’s focus toward project success? The team leader, while encouraging individual team members in their work, should always make project success the goal, not individual success.Do you have a process to evaluate and re-evaluate projects? Not every idea is a great one, and it may be your project or content piece that needs to be scrapped instead of throwing good money (and time) after bad ideas. All projects should align with your big goal.You will have to readjust your parameters as your team changes. Work styles change, expertise changes, abilities change—do you have the ability or a system to keep on top of this? Do you regularly review how well your team is functioning and where the hiccups are coming from?It’s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture, particularly when each team member has a small picture to focus on to get their job done. Without a frequent big-picture check, you and your team won’t stay on track to the common goal. You’ll get caught up in minutiae, disagreements, and so on.Regular communication is the key, basically, whichever format works best with your team.One of the reasons I took a task-based approach to discussing cross-functional teams is because we use that approach for project management, and it works well. A task is simply a signifier of what needs to be done in what order. Once it’s checked as done, it’s a signifier to the next team member to start with their tasks.CoSchedule makes it easy for team leaders to view the progress of each piece of content and do those “health checks” without a lot of effort. The tasks for each project are easily accessed on the calendar, clearly showing what has been done and who completed it. Each content piece shows a task measurement bar that reveals, at a glance, progress based on the percentage complete.By setting up a task template with due dates for each task for each member of your cross-functional team, you’re setting up parameters both in what needs to be done and when it needs to be done by.With CoSchedule, each content piece has its own message board in the form of comments. Leaders and team members can easily communicate there to skip out on endless email forwards.By restricting the conversation to only those who are currently involved, team leaders can help out team members and keep them from being overloaded with messages and emails inside of CoSchedule.Removing a team member who has completed their work on the project spares them from having to see conversations that don’t apply to them. It keeps them from getting into the habit of ignoring messages (meaning they’ll miss fewer messages intended for them in the future).Because CoSchedule is built on flexible features, including the ability to add notes and events to the calendar, you’re able to create a system that works for your team.Perhaps you’ll schedule team meetings as an event on your content calendar or maybe the color-coded notes will indicate must-read memos for your entire team. It’s up to you to determine how you’ll use these flexible tools with your cross-functional team.A healthy cross-functional team is one where diversity in skill is aligned toward the same goal. This requires purposeful leadership devoted to harnessing the power behind that diversity to the same wagon and driving it forward.With cross-functional teams—clarity, specificity, and definition are all going to work for you, even if that sounds anathema to a culture that loathes hierarchy or restriction.Click To Tweet

Love them or hate them, they are a rising content type for reaching your audience. Infographics are also the highest shared content type and therefore, one of the best and quickest ways to communicate data to your audience. As a designer who loves numbers, I personally fall into the ‘love’ category with infographics, but I realize that not everyone has been taught how to make this popular content type.While infographics are easy to digest, they’re not necessarily easy to create, so I hope to enlighten you in how to make an infographic in 7 easy steps from research all the way to publishing.Alright, let’s do this!Click To Tweet

											Before beginning any project, we must begin with two questions: ‘What?’ and ‘Why?’ We should know exactly what the goal of each project is, and exactly why it’s important.If you skip these two questions, two outcomes are bound to happen. Either you’ll start working and get lost somewhere in the middle of the project, or you’ll create something awesome that has no purpose, which is quite sad.Personally, I’d rather make something awesome AND have it reach a goal. Then it’s a win-win for everyone!In order to do that, every great infographic must begin with a good topic.Ask Yourself:For example, at CoSchedule, we noticed that everyone was asking, “What’s the best time to post on social media?” and so we turned that very question into a blog post and then an infographic.Use the three questions above to help you narrow in on a topic that will engage your audience and guide you through the creation process.Want to know how to make an infographic from a post you’ve already written? Skip to step #3Now that you have a stellar topic, it’s time to do research.This step might take some time, but it’s absolutely critical so embrace it and dig in.Find absolutely everything you can around that concept by beginning with the large resources, and then move onto the small bits and pieces that may be hiding. Again, don’t be scared to invest significant time into this stage.Research is the very core of an infographic, so it’s worth it in the long run.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Search for similar counterparts and find out why your topic is essential to what you’re trying to prove. Then, explore the ideas that completely oppose it. This will give you a wholesome perspective, and might even surprise or counter your initial idea. Let the data shape your topic and adjust when necessary.Remember, infographics are first and foremost research; however, boring data designed nicely will still end up as a boring infographic. While it might seem tedious, take the time to find interesting data so you can set yourself up for one heck of an infographic.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Statistics and numbers do exceptionally well on infographics because they’re easy to digest, and they hold a ton of value. They’re both fascinating and can be represented in a hundred different visual formats. It’s a win-win for you and your audience!With all the research and numbers floating around, it’s easy for an infographic to lack a sense of story.Bring it to life by thinking of the big picture, and choose a theme or metaphor that can be consistent throughout all the data. This way your infographic will read like a book from beginning to end, giving your audience a sense of excitement and curiosity as they read.Just when you thought you were done with research…. say hello to visual inspiration!Now that you have all your numbers and stats, its time to clear your head and gather visual ideas for your infographic. Some of my favorite places to begin my search for visual inspiration can be found at Behance, Pinterest, and Dribbble.Take a break, switch your perspective, and let’s talk visuals.Ask Yourself:Remember, the purpose of getting visual inspiration is to prepare your brain for the creative aspects of your infographic, not to simply collect and copy everything you see.Take Your Inspiration And Ask Yourself:You, and only you, have an opportunity to create an infographic better than ever before, so take your ideas and run with them!Recommended Reading:You’ve come prepared with an awesome topic that your audience loves, you have data to back it up from credible sources, and your creativity is ready to explode from all the visual inspiration. Now, it’s time to design! Here are your options…Outsourcing can be a great option if you don’t have design experience or the time to create an infographic. And good news! There are several designers out there who are waiting to work with you. You’re probably wondering, how it works?Recommended Reading: How To Work With Designers With Authentic Advice From CoSchedule’s DesignerYou’re awesome!Way to take your infographic idea head on. Whether you have design experience or are just beginning, here are some helpful tips to get you started:In both of these scenarios, it’s incredibly important to have a good design brief. A design brief is the ‘what’ and ‘why’ written out so your designer knows exactly what the goal of the infographic should accomplish. It should also include any other guidelines or specifications the design must follow. Without clear guidelines, there will be miscommunication and then it’s easy for resources and time to be wasted. Define your infographic, create some guidelines, and then choose carefully. Find a designer you can trust.Way to go, you’ve come so far!Once you have your infographic initially laid out and designed, take a step back and get some feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your peers or friends for honest, constructive feedback so you can refine the design to perfection before hitting publish.Ask: There’s always something to be modified after the feedback stage, and it always makes the end result better.This is your final step.Your infographic is beautiful and filled with awesome data, so now it’s time to add that very essential call to action that will guide readers into doing what they should do next. Should they sign up for something? Or recommend it to a friend?What one thing do you want your audience to do?Give credit. Unless you did a ton of surveys and researching from the ground up, you probably have several sources that deserve credit in your infographic. These will show that your information is not only thought out but also credible. The credits also serve as a way for the readers to find out more information if they choose to.Remember, add the call to action, the credits, and then you’re all set!Time to promote!This is where infographics become very handy, because rather than making graphics to support your content on social, you already have an entire infographic to break down and use for social promotion. Use this awesome social media size guide and then choose the best times to share.Neil Patel also has a very resourceful blog that includes several ways to uniquely promote your infographic. Some of my absolute favorite places to share CoSchedule’s infographics are Slideshare, Pinterest, and our Resource Library. Together, they bring new traffic to the infographic even beyond the blog itself. Some other great places, that are also free, include Fast Company’s Infographic of the Day, Visual.ly, and Love Infographics. Before you know it, you’ll be sharing like a pro and your infographic will go viral.Here’s How To Get Started:So, there you have it. You now know how to make an infographic. Everything from research to design, and design to promotion.Believe it or not, you can make an infographic and use it to reach your 2016 marketing goals. Start with your primary goal or idea, and invest time into the research of your infographic, because every great infographic starts with great data. Pick a design application that works best for you, and consider the story you want to tell. Finally, get some feedback and then share it with the world!

											Curious, I did a search on my own. This is what I found:What’s so great about that, I thought?At face value, it doesn’t look like much. With a publication the size of Forbes, it isn’t much of a surprise that they plan so far in advance. But maybe there is more to it than that.What can we learn from the giants at Forbes about yearly content marketing and blog planning? Should we be doing yearly planning for our own blogs? Here are five lessons that I learned:The pre-planning and pre-publishing of the yearly editorial calendar isn’t a new, or unique, practice. Time, Inc, and Vogue all have publicly available editorial calendars right on their website. Why?For most publications, the reasons are actually very business focused, rather than content focused.Most editorial calendars are found within the “media kit” section of the website, meaning that most publications see them as tools for selling magazine advertising.Simple enough, but what about the content planning implications?There is value in taking a look at your content planning from a yearly perspective. In our own editorial calendar training, we advocate both yearly and monthly planning for most bloggers using an editorial calendar process.The idea is simple: When you force yourself to start at the highest level and work your way down through the food chain (yearly to monthly planning), you see everything from a grand perspective and consider each detail along the way. Ask any painter–there is big value in starting with a broad brush before honing in on the details.When you see a year’s worth of content all at once, you are free to think about the big picture, without getting too focused on the individual details. This lets you create the overarching themes that your smaller (or monthly) blog posts will fit into the whole plan.Some common topics you might place on a yearly editorial calendar are:The goal shouldn’t be to load the calendar up with things to cover, or individual posts. Rather, you should be looking to find overarching content themes that will fit your content for a certain period of time. Like Forbes, it might be advisable to only select one topic/theme per month.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?There’s an old story about a traveler who came across three bricklayers on a scaffold. The traveler asked the first one, “What are you doing?”The first responded, “I’m earning a wage.”The traveler then asked the second one, “What are you doing?”The second responded, “I’m building a wall.”They are doing the same work, but which of the two is laying the better brick?The traveler then asked the third one, “What are you doing?”The third responded, “I am building a cathedral.”The lesson here is very clear—we can all benefit from understanding the bigger picture, even content teams.It’s common knowledge that a team who communicates the big picture works better together. A yearly calendar should help this big-picture thinking develop within your team.All organizations start with WHY, but only the great ones keep their WHY clear year after year. Those who forget WHY they were founded show up to the race every day to outdo someone else instead of to outdo themselves. The pursuit, for those who lose sight of WHY they are running the race, is for the medal or to beat someone else. ― Simon Sinek, Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take ActionYou might be surprised at how much big picture thinking comes out as you and your team develop your yearly editorial calendar, especially if you make it a regular part of your content planning meetings.
Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?When you sit down to write a blog post what usually happens?You start thinking about the individual details of that post.These are important questions, but how do they play into our overall content strategy?Jumping into the details too quickly will prevent you from considering the bigger picture. Follow these steps for too long and you’ll end up without a bigger picture at all.Yearly content planning forces us to make those “big picture” decisions early when they are simple and easy to do. It’s about starting at the high level and working our way down. Choosing a monthly theme (or two) is not difficult.When it comes to planning out your posts for the month, the broad theme should make individual topic selection easier than ever before. Now, you at least have a framework for making those decisions.All you have to worry about are the details when writing the post. Put the big decisions first and that will always make the detailed decisions come easier in the end.Making your life easier is one thing, but how will a yearly editorial calendar impact your audience?If all goes well, planning for a year should boost your audience and grow your blog. With a yearly schedule, your audience will become more likely to connect with your content. There are a few simple reasons why this is so.As you connect your content to the larger trends like the Forbes editorial calendar does, you will help your content become more relevant with what is going on at the time. A good example of this is a simple holiday post that I wrote for Thanksgiving a few years ago.Because we planned ahead and pushed for an emphasis on Thanksgiving, I was able to have a detailed post ready to go when Thanksgiving came around. My post was featured on the homepage of a prominent social media blog exclusively because I was taking advantage of a current trend. Sure, the post only lasted a day or two, but it drove big traffic in the mean time.Yearly planning made the difference on that post.Yearly planning should also allow you to think deeply about the themes and topic categories that matter most to your audience in a new way. This can even be used to reach out to different segments of your audience in a strategic method. For example, on this blog we occasionally rotate between writing posts for “bloggers” and writing them for “content marketers” and “editors”. While they all have similarities, they really are distinct groups with unique challenges and topics to cover.By focusing on a single topic theme, we’re able to reach a specific audience more directly, and build their trust in our content faster than ever before.I know what you’re thinking: This yearly editorial calendar thing won’t be so bad.Here at CoSchedule, we have a set of free paper editorial calendar templates that can help you start the habit of using an editorial calendar to plan your content marketing. This includes a handy template for planning out your yearly calendar. You can download them here.Of course, CoSchedule itself is an excellent way to set up your monthly calendar and comes with a 14-day free trial. Just saying! :)I’ve warned you before about the hazards that come when you plan too far ahead. This hasn’t changed, and it shouldn’t. Even the Forbes editorial calendar makes room for changes when needed. A plan doesn’t mean you can’t change your mind every once and awhile. In fact, it is probably dangerous not to.The key is to use the yearly calendar for what it does best—getting you through the big-picture strategic thinking.As you work the plan month by month, make adjustments and respond to changes in your plan. Nothing can substitute keeping your finger on the pulse of your own strategy. Plan ahead, but never let things go into autopilot.Click To Tweet

											You probably already have a list of blogs and publications that you look up to and hope to emulate one day.Why not start emulating them right away?Have a look at their top posts, and come up with similar ones, but better. There’s a reason why these blog posts did well for them, and if your target audience overlaps with theirs, you can be sure that this will be a win.Backlinko’s Brian Dean calls this the skyscraper technique. Here are four ways that you can make your post superior to the original (Thanks, Brian!):Case in point: I recently noticed that there were multiple posts on beautiful resume designs that topped the first page of Google, but the biggest post listed only 50 examples. I decided to shoot for a list post of 70 well-designed resume examples.This particular blog post ended up becoming our most-viewed article for that week and was shared more than 600 times on our social media channels in the same time period as well. Not too shabby.If you’re not sure which blogs to look at, try entering your topic keywords into BuzzSumo, which will then magically churn out a list of the most-shared related content on the blogosphere:Think that it’s hard to come up with content marketing ideas for your niche? Try doing it for a pool company, and you’ll realize the true meaning of hard.Yet back in 2009, Marcus Sheridan’s company River Pools and Spas was able to use content marketing to dominate the pool industry. His solution for coming up with topics is exceedingly simple: To answer his customers’ questions.“The problem in my industry, and a lot of industries, is you don’t get a lot of great search results [online] because most businesses don’t want to give answers; they want to talk about their company,” he said in an interview with The New York Times.“So I realized that if I was willing to answer all these questions that people have about fiberglass pools, we might have a chance to pull this out.”When brainstorming with his clients over at his online marketing consulting business, The Sales Lion, Marcus reveals that he has “never had a company come up with less than 100 questions in 30 minutes.”There are a number of ways to find out what your customers are asking about in your industry and business:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Your customers might be an excellent source of potential marketing ideas, but they might have missed out on a question that others asked.How do you find out what the rest of the industry is curious about?Find out where they gather to talk shop. Facebook groups, Twitter chats, and forums are some of the platforms that will bring them all together. It pays to become an active participant, as you can get industry-wide exposure over there.Another popular platform that attracts questions across a variety of industries is Quora. According to Marc Bodnick, Quora’s head of business and community, the Q&A website has around 500,000 topics as of 2014. That’s a whole lot of potential blog topics to pick out right there!To optimize your efforts, focus on questions that have a lot of followers, answers, or views, like this one:
With 1,700 followers and over 300,000 views, you can be sure that many people are curious to know what the perfect startup team is. Sounds like a great blog post in the making!You can find most of these high-traffic questions in the topic FAQ:
As a bonus, you can post your answer to the topic with a link to the blog post you’ve written to get a boost in traffic as well. It will drive traffic to your blog in no time. This is because all the followers of a question will receive a notification email as soon as you post your answer. Game, set, and match.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Every industry has its rockstars. Startups have Elon Musk. Designers have Jony Ive. And marketers have Seth Godin.And their success and experience make them a treasure trove of tips, tricks, and advice—things that your readers are dying to learn.To get the most from them, it’s important to know them well first. Here’s where a little journalistic inquiry will come in handy. First, find out what their stories are, and what is so extraordinary about them.Look for content marketing ideas and think about what your readers can learn from them like Contently did when they interviewed Seth Godin on the future of branded content. Come up with topics accordingly.What is their secret to being so productive? How could they do what they do so darn well? What were some of the greatest mistakes they’ve made?Connect their expertise to what you know your audience will dig, and you’ll have a winner.Okay, that sounds like fluff, but hear me out.People love stories. It’s built into us—we can’t help but look for the story in everything. This is because it’s “a way for humans to feel that we have control over the world.”And you are most uniquely qualified to talk about your own stories. I don’t mean for you to make up fictional tales.Talk about your journey, struggles, and opinions. For example, what are your goals, and how are you trying to achieve them? Groove’s Alex Turnbull managed to build out a popular blog out of their singular mission: To reach $100,000 (and now $500,000) in revenue.Think that you have nothing worth sharing? Everyone does, according to John O’Nolan from Ghost:“These posts aren’t just an exercise in narcissism, they can be incredibly useful for other people in your industry. Everyone has to start somewhere, and by learning from your mistakes the next generation can progress even quicker.”Companies like Buffer and iDoneThis have also dedicated whole blogs to telling the inside story.Put the spirit of point 1 into action (publish better content than anyone else), and have a look at what kind of topics these example companies tackle—they could apply to you, too.Every industry has its own set of buzzwords and trends that constantly go in and out of fashion. If you’re quick enough, you can ride these waves and come up with post after post where you can put your two cents worth in.Take the “guest blogging scare” of 2014 for instance. Google’s former head of the web spam team Matt Cutts had denounced guest blogging as a spammy practice, foreshadowing that Google would not view them kindly.The marketing community blew up:One by one, articles which mostly disagreed with Matt started popping up everywhere. The most convincing writers were able to lead the conversation on this topic.Buffer also did a great job analyzing what the change of Twitter favorites to likes would really mean for marketers, just a day or two after the news was released.You can stay abreast of trending topics in your niche by using Google Alerts. Create an alert with keywords that are relevant to you and your company, and have it send updates to you as and when things surface.NinjaOutreach is also an effective tool for finding out what topics are currently hot in the social media world:Also, do keep a close lookout for recent research and studies on topics in your niche as well. A recent study by Constant Science found that roughly 65 percent of participants think that web content is a “hit or miss” or “unreliable.” Research-backed blog posts are an advantage you can easily tap on.For example, we focus a lot on design-related topics over at the Piktochart blog. As such, I check the Visual Design section of Nielsen Norman Group’s website daily to see if there are any great tidbits that I can latch on to.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Not every blog post that you write will be a hit. Chances are that one or two might be, and end up bringing the bulk of traffic over to your site.These articles are your crown jewels. See how you can create updated versions of them that are relevant to today so you can repeat that initial success. Hubspot does this on a regular basis:Also, it’s worth putting in some time to analyze what makes them so good, and see if you can spin some content marketing ideas off of them. Do a blog content audit to find out which of your posts are suitable to do this. As Crew’s editor Jory Mackay found out, it is a tedious process, but well worth the trouble.If your definitive guide to making infographics is regularly bringing in substantial repeat traffic, for example, it shows that there is interest among your readers in the process of creating infographics. Topics like “100 infographic ideas that work”, which comes before the creation process, and “50 ways to market your infographic”, which comes after, might also be attractive to your audience in this case.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?As you can see, content marketing ideas are a dime a dozen. Coming up with them is the easy part. The tough part comes after, when you put pen to paper (or your fingers to the keyboard)—that’s a whole new ballgame with different rules!So don’t get too wrapped up in ideation. Once you have a decent number of topics, get started right away. As Derek Sivers puts it: “To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.”Click To Tweet

Most of our audience is working alone or with a small team, and usually without all the resources required to create all the content they need. The majority of respondents are also fairly new to content marketing and blogging, with 63% reporting they have two years of experience or less.Put that all together, and it sounds like a recipe for burnout.Click To Tweet

											If you’re feeling overwhelmed, however, there are ways you can get in control to tilt the odds for success back into your favor. By optimizing your workflow, leveraging the right tools, and learning to focus on the tasks where you can make the most impact, you can make your life as a content marketer less stressful and more satisfying while increasing your productivity.Here are 101 marketing time management strategies to help you better manage your time, work more efficiently, and get back in control of your content.Table Of ContentsWhen planning your content strategy with limited time, ask “what is the minimum amount of resources and effort each project will take to be successful?” This isn’t the same as cutting corners, however.Think of this process as a way to mentally cut your content down to what’s most essential, and leave anything that isn’t critical to your success on the cutting room floor.Instead of creating completely fresh content every time you sit down to write a post, consider identifying older content you can potentially update and refresh.To do this, use Google Analytics to find your top performing posts.Then, search the primary keyword for each post and see what content is currently ranking on the first page of Google. If those posts have newer or more relevant content than your own post, double down on revising your posts to be even better than theirs. Then, republish it as a new post, or an updated version of the original.This strategy can help you save time by leveraging what you already have, rather than having to come up with something new from scratch. Plus, it can also be a good way to get more mileage out of posts you know already resonate with your audience.Recommended Reading: How To Breathe New Life Into Old Blog PostsIdentify influential sources in your niche you can lean on for content curation and put them into a list you can refer back to later.That way, you won’t have to hunt for sources later.Use Google Trends to quickly gauge searcher interest in a given topic. It’s a free and easy-to-use tool that shows how frequently a given topic is getting searched, which is extremely helpful for validating the worth of your content ideas.If you’re ready to move up to a paid tool, BuzzSumo is a handy tool for surfacing the top performing content on a given topic. It can help you not only determine what’s popular, but also show you what kind of competition you’re up against.While it’s primarily a PPC tool, Google’s own Keyword Planner needs to be mentioned here as well. It’s useful for both generating keyword ideas as well as estimating the potential search traffic they could deliver to your post.Manually review the most recent posts from your top competitors blogs and websites. Look at what they’re doing to get an idea of what topics are hot at the moment. Keep your eyes open for new information that you could add to a post, that no one else has (yet).Portent’s Content Idea Generator is good for at least getting the gears in your head turning on ideas you can use quickly. Hubspot’s Blog Topic Generator is similar and worth checking out, too.Use Feedly to quickly keep tabs on recent news and blog posts. It’s similar to what Google Reader used to be, pulling the latest posts from different sources you find in one place for easy reading.Save time trying to find where you’ve kept all your inspiration filled notes with a tool like Evernote. Alternately, something like Google Keep or any note taking app can also work well.Brainstorm (with a time limit).Have your team write down as many ideas as they can think of in five minutes. Put them on notecards and then post them on a board. Go through them all and rank each idea a 1 (so-so) to 3 (brilliant). Discard anything that is not a unanimous 3. This process can easily yield dozens of strong ideas in under an hour.Recommended Reading: 4 Simple Brainstorming Techniques That Will Help You Write Killer ContentInspiration can come anywhere and at any time, so make a habit of recording your ideas whenever they pop into your head.Use a voice recorder or note-taking app on your phone, or consider carrying around a notepad in your work bag.Subscribe to quality industry email newsletters. Following thought leaders in your niche is a lot easier when you’re getting their latest information sent directly to your inbox.Use internal site search analytics to see what people are looking for on your site or blog. This can be a fast way to identify gaps in your content (if people are looking to you for something you don’t have content for, then you know it’s time to get to work).Turn wasted time into productive time by using your phone to research while waiting in shopping lines, riding public transit, or anywhere else you find yourself waiting (and when and where it’s acceptable to use your phone).Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Listen to audiobooks related to your professional development on your commute instead of music or the radio. You’ll pick up information you can then put to use when you get to the office.Use data from Google Analytics to predict success and avoid wasted time on things that won’t work.For example, if you notice that several posts on a given topic aren’t performing well, consider whether the issue is the quality of your content, or the possibility that the topic simply doesn’t have an audience. If you know certain topics resonate with your readers and you have the data to prove it create more content like that.Maintain a list of content ideas you can pull from in the future. Keep it in a Google Doc, spreadsheet, or Evernote doc that your entire team can access and edit. Then when it comes time to write a post, you can just pull an idea off the list instead of wasting time wondering what to write about.Use a shared Google Calendar to make sure everyone on your team has visibility on meeting times, events, out-of-office requests, and so forth.Establish a consistent naming convention for saving files. This can make finding things later much easier.Recommended Reading: How To Rock A Content Development Process That Will Save You Tons Of TimeGroup similar projects together and knock them out all in a row as sprints. For example, list all the steps required to write one blog post. Then, run through them starting at the top.Also known as the Pareto Principle, the 80/20 principle is the idea that 80% of your output will come from 20% of your effort. To leverage this for your work, start by eliminating or delegating menial non-essential tasks that don’t directly impact results. The more you focus on things that directly affect productivity, you’ll get more done with less effort.Prioritize projects and only take on the ones that are within the scope of your resources and stand a reasonable shot at success.Set progress goals for every project and stick to them. They’ll keep you focused on your end result and help you build discipline.For inner-office communication, a tool like HipChat or Slack can improve efficiency while keeping your email inbox uncluttered.A picture is worth a thousand words. If you need to suggest design edits, sometimes sending screenshots is the best way to go. Use a tool like Skitch, SnagIt, iAt Home, or Awesome Screenshot to take screen captures with notes and arrows.If someone else can do a task 80% as well as you can, and you don’t have time to do it yourself, consider handing it off to another team member (so long as they do have time).Ask for help before you’ve wasted too much time trying to figure something out on your own. There’s something to be said for showing initiative and trying to learn things yourself, but if you know that someone on your team already has that knowledge, just ask. You’ll get more done that way.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Make sure everyone knows where to access files and documents your team will use. This sounds basic, but if you’re using multiple resources to store files, you’d be surprised how easy it is for things to get out of control if your team doesn’t know what goes where.Establish consistent workflows to save time wondering what each person should be doing at each step of a project.To do this:By the time you’re done, you’ll have an effective workflow template you can follow on similar projects in the future, refining the process as you discover what works and what doesn’t.Schedule regular touch-point meetings and stick to them. This removes excuses for not having time to communicate, or for team members not sharing vital information.Create an outline for every blog post. Knowing the structure of your post will help you write it quicker and create more focused content.Think less is more. If you’re feeling overwhelmed trying to create too many posts, try putting more effort into fewer posts. Sometimes having greater focus on fewer things can help rein in some of that stress.Recommended Reading: How To Blog With As Little As PossibleDon’t cut corners on quality, but do avoid chasing perfection. There will always be things you want to change, so focus on shipping and know when to call your work finished.Edit your own work first before passing anything off to a proofreader or copy editor. It’ll help save them time and better endear you to staying on their good side.Break down long-form pieces into smaller chunks and work on one section at a time. This can help you work faster by focusing on smaller portions of the overall post, instead of getting overwhelmed by the full scope of your idea.Deadlines. Set them and meet them. Don’t let your work stretch to fill an excessive amount of time.Don’t have time to do everything yourself? Consider hiring freelance help if you can.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Leverage internal experts within your organization. If you’re working in-house with a business, get buy-in from other team members with unique expertise who may be able to help contribute blog posts.Block off focused and uninterrupted time to write. Distraction-free word processors like FocusWriter or WriteBox can be useful if you really want to get serious about eliminating distractions. This way, you can get more writing done quickly without getting sidetracked.Don’t waste time worrying about hitting specified word counts (unless you’re working with an editor or manager who is adamant about a specific word count).The right length for your post is however long it takes to write a full and comprehensive piece of content on your topic. Usually, that’s going to mean a substantial length (1,500+ words), but not always.Consider accepting unsolicited reader submissions or create a section where readers can write their own blog posts on your blog (this will not necessarily work nor be appropriate for every blog). Moz’s YouMoz Blog is a great example of how to do this well.Having some extra help from reputable contributors can make it much easier to get authoritative content on your blog with less effort from your own team.Want to know if your writing sucks? The Hemingway app will let you know, and help you identify ways you can make your writing clearer. It’s available for both Mac and PC, and is worth its $10 price tag, especially if you don’t have an actual copy editor or proofreader.Use a tool like CoSchedule to schedule your blog publishing and associated social media content ahead of time. Is this a shameless plug? Absolutely, but there’s a reason why we build our product. (If you haven’t tried it yet, get your 14-day free trial here.)Use the Headline Analyzer to quickly write and score headlines. This makes it easy to write lots of headlines fast and choose the best option.Use the skyscraper technique to quickly identify top performing competitor content you can improve on.This simply involves looking at the top-ranking content on your given topic or keyword, identifying what those posts are missing, and then making sure your own content fills those gaps. That could mean including information those other posts are missing, or different types of content they lack (for example, embedded videos or infographics).Repurpose content from your blog posts for other content. Borrow blog post copy for your email newsletter. Turn several related blog posts into an ebook. These are just a couple ideas, but if you need more inspiration, here’s over 50 ideas for repurposing content.Don’t have access to Photoshop? Or, does your team lack a dedicated graphic designer? In either case, tools like Canva, Infogr.am, and Piktochart make it easy to create high-quality images and infographics you can use for your content.While the above tools are definitely useful, sometimes you really need dedicated design and image manipulation software to get the job done right. If cost is the only thing stopping you from investing in Photoshop, consider GIMP. It’s a free and open-source alternative to Photoshop that, while lacking certain features, still packs an incredible amount of power.This isn’t necessarily a time-saving tool, per se, but if you’ve been putting off creating graphics because you don’t have budget for the right tool, now is the time to stop wasting time with excuses and start getting down to work (the payoffs for having quality graphics are worth it in the long run).Don’t forget that one graphic can potentially be used multiple places. For example, try remaking blog header graphics in multiple sizes for email newsletters and social media posts. If you have certain graphic elements you use frequently, consider storing them all in one place where they can easily be accessed.Learn Photoshop keyboard shortcuts. The time you spend internalizing them into your workflow will save you tons of time in the long run.Create your own Photoshop templates for common image sizes and formats you know you’ll be using often, or find downloadable templates online (a quick Google search should yield plenty of options).If you’re a writer or blogger working with a graphic designer, give them an idea of what you want for graphics before they get started. This can help avoid confusion and having to redo images when the results don’t match expectations.For graphic designers, this same advice applies in reverse. Ask your writer what they want up front. Even if they can’t quite communicate exactly what they’re looking for, opening up the discussion early in the collaborative process can be an immense time saver later on.If you’re using WordPress, use the Yoast plugin to quickly check your on-page SEO and make sure your title tags and meta descriptions are well written.If you have a budget, use a dedicated SEO software platform to manage your search engine optimization efforts. Moz and Raven Tools are both affordably priced and fully featured options that will cover most of your bases. Backlink tools like Majestic and Ahrefs are well worth a look as well. The benefits to using these services are that they keep your data stored in one place and make performing SEO tasks much quicker, easier, and more effective.If local SEO has any relevance to your business (meaning, if you have a brick-and-mortar location and rely on search to drive foot traffic), Whitespark and Moz Local are two great tools to help speed up a lot of menial tasks that can otherwise eat up valuable hours of your time.Fixing broken links on your blog or website can be time-consuming. However, it helps to pay attention to them and get them fixed as an ongoing practice, rather than letting them accumulate and having to fix a ton of them all at once. Use Screaming Frog to quickly crawl your site and identify URLs that return a 404 status code.Manage all your social media accounts with one tool. CoSchedule, Hootsuite, and Buffer are all valid options for this task. By logging into one dashboard instead of multiple sign-in pages each time you want to schedule social media updates, you can easily save an enormous amount of time.Automate (some) of your social media content. You’ll want to continue adding a personal touch to your social media posts, but filling your social queues with pre-scheduled content can help you maintain a consistent presence with less active effort and attention.Get rid of platforms that aren’t working. Focus more effort on fewer channels. You’ll likely be less stressed and more successful.Use IFTTT to automate recurring tasks. It’s a cool tool that uses “recipes” to automate processes (and has applications that go way beyond just social media). Here’s a good video tutorial on how it works:Get an email from someone and want quick access to their social profiles? Use Rapportive. It’s quicker and easier than manually searching for their Twitter handle.Use Tomoson to find influencers and brands who might be interested in your product or service. Rather than manually searching for experts on a given topic, it can make finding prospects for this kind of social media outreach quicker and more effective.Eliminate distractions from your personal social media when you’re working. You’d be surprised how much time you might be wasting checking your Facebook updates or Twitter stream.Expedite social media response times. If you don’t have the time or energy to write up a thoughtful response to a social media post, sometimes a simple “Thanks for reading!” is enough to let someone know you’ve heard their feedback.Try writing a few different versions of a single post. Then, schedule those posts out throughout the week. Now one idea for your post has become three.Use Twitter lists to quickly follow influencers on specific topics. You can either create lists yourself to monitor accounts based on topics or interests, or simply search Twitter for lists on topics you’re interested in and follow them.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Use Storify to round up tweets and social media posts quickly.Use social media engagement numbers as a rapid-fire real-time indicator of which content is most popular.Leverage hashtags to easily increase exposure. Be sure to choose hashtags that directly relate to your brand, blog, or content. This may seem basic, but it’s an often overlooked tactic that can help your posts gain more visibility quickly.Write social media posts in bulk and schedule them out at least a week or two in advance.Want to analyze your Twitter performance and find influencers quickly? Try using Followerwonk. It’s free, fast, and easy to use.If you don’t have access to a developer who can build you custom email newsletter templates, then use a platform to manage email like MailChimp or Campaign Monitor (at CoSchedule, we use Campaign Monitor). They’re easy to use and make email marketing management a lot more efficient than going without them.Instead of writing a whole new email, try taking your last email and sending it to anyone on your list who didn’t open it the first time (be sure to wait about a week first).Use automated pop-ups on your blog or website to build your email list fast and convert readers into email subscribers. SumoMe’s Scroll Box is an easy to use tool for this task, available in both free and premium versions.Use content upgrades to entice more email subscriptions. A content upgrade can be defined as a gated piece of content (like an infographic, ebook, video, course, or something else) that requires readers to exchange their email address in order to access the content upgrade. One piece of content can equal tons of subscribers, making this a highly efficient way to grow your email list.If you need to automate a lot of messages for one-on-one email outreach, use Boomerang to follow up on emails.When it comes to your own work email, set time aside to check your email rather than checking it every five minutes. If you took our suggestion of using HipChat or Slack for inner-office communication, you’ll probably notice the amount of email hitting your inbox dropping substantially, too.If you aren’t already, use a content calendar. Any kind of calendar. We’re going to plug ourselves quick here, but using CoSchedule can help save tons of time here.Keep your calendar full for at least two weeks out into the future. You’ll get more done when you’re not stressed over hitting immediate deadlines. That may mean having to work a little extra hard at first to build up enough content to fill your calendar, but once you’ve gotten past that initial effort, you’ll find yourself freer to strategize and work more efficiently.Be consistent when updating your content calendar. Build habits that save time and your calendar will, in turn, help you save time elsewhere in your workflow.If you’re not skilled in configuring Google Analytics yourself, get more utility from it faster using pre-built dashboards. That saves you time from having to learn how to configure everything correctly yourself while making sure your dashboards are designed to be useful.Use SumAll to automatically generate data-driven social media performance reports (note that as of March 1, 2016, this is a paid-only tool).If you’re using Moz, Raven Tools, or any other content marketing and SEO platform, use it to set up automatic reports delivered to your email. That way, you can provide reports to management quickly without having to build out reports manually.Time tracking tools like Toggl work well for this. Or, just use the timer on your phone. Over time, you’ll get a better idea of how much time tasks generally take, and be better able to plan accordingly in the future.Try using the Pomodoro technique throughout your workday. In short, it’s a productivity method where you work in 25-minute bursts, separated by break periods.Even if you don’t use the Pomodoro technique, taking timed breaks is still highly advisable. Your brain simply can’t fire on all cylinders around the clock.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Use a password manager to save time entering passwords or recovering passwords you’ve forgotten. 1Password and LastPass are both solid options.Fail fast and move on. Don’t let the fear of failure stop you from trying something new that may work better than what you did yesterday.Likewise, if something isn’t working, either figure out why it’s not working or ditch it and move onto something else. Bias yourself toward action and don’t waste time overanalyzing things.Stop multi-tasking. Studies show you’ll get more done, more quickly if you focus on one task at a time.Create task checklists to keep yourself on track. Wonder what makes checklists such an effective tool for getting things done? Read The Checklist Manifesto.Plan your meetings and set timers. Never go into a meeting without an agenda or a goal that the meeting is intended to help achieve.Use tools and software services that deliver demonstrable productivity benefits. Ditch any that don’t. That saves time and money all in one fell swoop.Do your most dreaded task first thing in the morning, whatever that task may be, to free up mental space to take on the rest of your day.Sleep. You’ll get more done, more quickly if you’re well rested. Working when you’re tired leads to diminishing returns over time.Learn how and when to say no. While it’s often tempting to take on every opportunity and task handed your way, you don’t want to burn yourself out by taking on too much. Be realistic about what you can accomplish with the time you have.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Leave a time buffer when estimating time for tasks to account for unforeseen hang-ups. This can help avoid missing deadlines. This is important because missed deadlines have a way of snowballing by pushing out timelines on other projects.Set aside time for planning. It takes time, but it also saves time in the long run.Plan your least mentally intensive tasks for Friday afternoon when you’re probably drained. That way they won’t distract from more important work but they’ll still get done.Recommended Reading: What To Do On The Weekend To Increase Your Productivity On MondayUse the end of one day to plan what you’ll do at the start of the next day. You’ll likely be feeling drained around the end of your day, which makes it a good time to write up a simple list of priorities for your next morning. You’d be surprised how much time this can save while making optimal use of your energy levels.Developing better habits isn’t always easy, and odds are, it’s going to take a little while before you can start applying the majority of these time management strategies to your content marketing workflows. However, all of these items are things you can start doing today, taking things one small step at a time until you’ve established more efficient and productive ways to work.Are there any tips, tools, or tricks we’ve missed?

											Here are five specific resolutions that will show you how to improve your blog this year.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Your blog’s permalinks get trashed pretty easily if you’ve been blogging a long time. Maybe you’ve switched blogging platforms or you’ve moved blog posts around. Content is still there, but the permalinks are different.This creates two kinds of rotten, dead links:The first dead link is in your power to fix. You can make sure your blog posts contain links to the new URL on your own. The second type of dead link is a little bit more troublesome. Obviously, you can’t fix an outside site. You can email them and ask them to fix it, but I wouldn’t even bother. Here they are, linking to you and helping you with referral traffic and search engine appeal, and the link is dead. This must be fixed.Head over to Google Webmaster Tools to improve your blog links. (You’ll need an account set up for a bit so data can be collected for a period of time.) Choose your domain. Then navigate to Health > Crawl Errors. In the URL Errors section, click on the Not Found section. Bingo!This site had 829 inbound links that were being completely wasted. Yikes!Webmaster Tools will provide you with a list of the links on your site that are dead.  The example above shows a mind-numbing 829 dead inbound links. Not good. Click on the problematic links to see who is linking to you.Clicking on a link tells you all of the sites linking to it.Create a spreadsheet that matches up the dead links to the correct links on your current site. If the blog post is entirely gone, match it up with the next closest thing, or your homepage.  This spreadsheet is going to be very handy in the next step.You will need to redirect the dead links to the good links.This is where the spreadsheet you’ve set up will save the day. Use a 301 redirect to do the job, using your .htaccess file. If this is completely uncomfortable and scary to you, get someone to help you. You must make sure all inbound links go somewhere that isn’t an error, otherwise you lose SEO benefits and slap new readers in the face with a “hey that page doesn’t exist!” message.You can make your site more visitor-friendly if you know how to improve your blog. It will also help if you know how your visitors actually use it.A heat map shows you which areas of your site have “hot spots”. Hot spots are where your site’s visitors click the most. Heat maps might use color or other indicators to show you this information. You can use a heat map to figure out where your visitors are clicking and if your blog design is distracting them from the call-to-action you wanted from them.There are several services that provide detailed heat map technology, but if you’re already using Google Analytics, you could start there. Open your blog in one tab, and in another tab go to your Google Analytics account. In the left column, under “Behavior”, click on “In-Page Analytics.”
You can watch your website load, complete with analytics and different heat map options, within Google Analytics. If you have some trouble getting it to load, Google will also let you load it on its own tab and that works the same. If you’re not sure how to improve your blog by interpreting the data you’re seeing, click on the Help button in the upper right corner. You’ll get help options that are related to the tools you are using.What’s the point of all this?The results might surprise you. Your visitors might not behave as you expected them to. Let’s look at the homepage of CoSchedule as an example of how you might use a heat map.We might logically assume they would click on the “try it free” button first. Our button is blue (noticeable against the orange), it is to the right side of the header where people end up when reading left-to-right, and it has an arrow (which increases click rate).But look at the heat map. Most visitors are clicking on the “features” (17%) and “pricing” (43%) links on the CoSchedule home page. Before people want to try it free they want to find out about CoSchedule’s features and pricing. In fact, they want to find out about the pricing above all else. Price matters.What happens if we visit the “pricing” page?“Features” gets more clicks, then the link to our homepage, and then “try it free.” And if we visit the “features” page?“Pricing” takes the lead again. Then the CoSchedule homepage, then “features”, and then “try it free.”That beautiful blue “Try It Free” button is getting a good share of clicks, but our heat map tells us something about our website visitors: they’ll try it free, but they want to know what the price will ultimately be, and what features CoSchedule has, before signing up.You can see if your site’s design has gotten cluttered and distracting. It’ll give you some options to try testing out different colors, copy, and location. It might also convince you that all of those ads, “like” boxes, RSS feeds, Twitter boxes, and other fun widgets are doing one thing: splitting your audience.Are visitors clicking because of the color? Because of the question they need answered? Because of the placement? Because of other distractions?A heat map can’t accurately answer all of that for you, but it is a way to measure adjustments you’re making, along with other analytics tools, and how they change conversions and traffic. It is also a very visual interpretation of what people do when they are on your site.First, rethink your use of tags. Some WordPress bloggers and themes use tags for specific reasons that mean they must use them. But most bloggers don’t need tags. It’s likely you don’t need them at all.But categories? Definitely, use categories.Set up your categories so that you have no “uncategorized” default option. Decide which category would be the most common category (look at old blog posts and see which category gets used the most) and make that the default option instead. This way, even if you forget to choose a category, you don’t have the unsightly “uncategorized” association with your blog posts. Seeing “uncategorized” all over a blog isn’t very assuring.Then, decide on about 8-10 categories for your posts. You might have 25. That’s too many. Categories aren’t for you; they are for the reader. They are to help the reader understand the context of your blog post as well as find specific posts they might be interested in.1. List up to 10 words associated with your blog’s niche.
2. Reduce that list if necessary so it only contains the topics you’ll write equally on.
3. Remove any words that would overlap topically. Leave room in case you need to readjust your categories later, so that you can always keep them around 10 or lower.
4. These are your blog categories.Categories are a work–horse for you, the blogger, only if you reduce them and keep them under control. Well–chosen categories are what keep you in your niche. Writing a post and realize it doesn’t fit well into your categories? The answer is to rewrite the post so that it does. Don’t add another category. Your categories are the guide rails that keep you from going off the road.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?More isn’t better, especially when it comes to the call To action (CTA) that you use to build your email list or sell your product. The more CTAs you have, the more likely you’ll have less success with all of them as a whole.Offer the ebook OR the email course. Offer the free report OR the worksheets. Don’t make everything available all at once. Why?Use the content themes and plans you’ve plugged into your editorial calendar to guide you as you decide which CTA you’ll use.Put the CTA in your post, below your post, or in the sidebar and see which works best. In other words: be purposeful about your CTA. Of course, maybe you’re not using an editorial calendar and so you don’t have that to guide you for your CTA action planning. In that case…This is the big one. This is going to be the year when you actually seriously really do honest–to–goodness blog.No more looking at your blog and seeing you wrote 12 posts over the past year. No more looking at your blog and shuddering about all the random posts you tossed online. Or (even worse) no more looking at your blog a year after you quit writing and wondering what went wrong.A content marketing editorial calendar, like CoSchedule, will help you write and publish regularly.A content marketing editorial calendar is your map. It will keep you from getting lost and from quitting in discouragement.Plan your blog posts, plan your social media, plan your ideas, plan your marketing themes, plan your content marketing research–just plan.When you use a calendar, you can plan ahead before you’re in the thick of things and desperately write and publish anything just to stay afloat. You finally understand how to improve your blog while using it for effective marketing and don’t feel one step behind, always trying to catch up.Whether you’re a solo blogger or part of a team, your content marketing editorial calendar is a taskmaster, but a pleasant one. When you follow these 5 steps you’ll know exactly how to improve your blog and publish the best content using your editorial calendar.A calendar gives you a heads up on how often you’re publishing, if you’ve missed a post, what you have to do for the day, and what you have to do in the coming weeks. It helps you find a workflow that works because a calendar, by nature, is fairly flexible.For example, using CoSchedule, your main calendar screen gives you quick access to these otherwise time-consuming elements of planning your content. You can see how many tasks you have been assigned (or assigned yourself), the content you’ll be writing in the coming weeks, and a place to store the drafts and ideas that you’ll use in the future.With one glance, I can spot holes in my publishing schedule, account for holidays, see how blog team members are doing and working together. It’s easier to make sure that my blog doesn’t fade into 12 posts a year.There is something about a calendar that motivates those of us who are willing to be motivated.Click To Tweet

											The high failure rate of blogs is truly depressing. It’s no wonder that bloggers start the year with big hopes and plans, attempting to offset the inevitable.But, like resolutions or any decision to make a change in life, failure is the dominant feature when considering how many are making the attempt.New Year’s resolutions fail because:So, why are blogs so short-lived?In a survey we conducted, we discovered that 33% of bloggers spend two hours on a post. Another 25% spend 3 hours on a post.That is a significant time commitment for something, particularly if you’re just getting started and aren’t seeing the return on that time investment that more established bloggers experience.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?You have to keep writing without any promise of return and do this for a while.A few weeks or months in is when most bloggers give up. The lack of return in the face of the amount of work it takes to blog makes shutting down the blog easy.In short: Blogs are hard work. Be ready for that, and you’ll succeed.The same techniques that you might use to keep your New Year’s resolutions can help your blog, too. As with those resolutions, it’s simply a matter of committing to something—in this case, your blog—and approaching these changes with an attitude for success.Your blog doesn’t have to fail, but it will if you don’t follow this list.Let’s say you aren’t much of a runner. If you’ve never run before, making a resolution to run 10 miles a day starting tomorrow is setting yourself up for failure.When you over-commit at the start, it’s easy to hurt yourself and too hard to keep with it. The same can be said for starting a blog.Consistency matters more than frequency, so start small with your blog.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Make small goals that you can achieve at the beginning. You need some success under your belt to get the courage and inspiration to up your goals, so succeeding at a few small goals will give you just the right amount of confidence to go forward. Crush your blog writing goals.A better method than starting off with running 10 miles a day?Make that 10 miles a day the big goal, and start by running a mile a day. Then increase it, bit by bit. And have fewer goals to start with.A Stanford University study found that the willpower you have at your disposal is limited. You can only achieve so much before it dwindles and you begin backsliding.So, if you create many blog writing goals to accomplish at the same time, you’ll burn through the willpower.Perhaps you’d ultimately like blogging every day, having a highly active presence on social media, and that you want to create an e-book each week. Three goals sounds easy! But they aren’t really just three goals.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?These are three huge goals made up of many smaller benchmark goals, and you certainly can’t do all of that at once. Choose one big goal, and work toward it. Then move on to the next one.Start small. Have just a few goals. Achieve them. Set some more goals. Follow that pattern.In the American Journal for Health Promotion, researchers found “the more specific you make your goal, the more likely you are to achieve it.”Instead of saying you will “blog more”, your goal should be “blog twice a week”. Instead of saying you will “use social media better”, your goal should be “three Twitter posts a day”.You need something specific as your goal so that you know exactly what it takes to get there.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Vague blog writing goals allow for confusion and leave wiggle room, which allow you to wiggle right out and give up.In the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers discovered that people who were trying to lose weight were more successful if they put money on the line.If those folks failed to lose weight, they would forfeit the money they set aside prior to beginning their diet. The participants that had money riding on their weight loss actually exceeded the goal, so powerful a motivator was the fear of losing their own money.What if you and your blogging team were to use this idea, and set up a “bank” of things that mattered. Perhaps you have the best location in the office. Put that on the line. If you don’t meet your blog writing goals, you forfeit the space.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?This seems to be a harsh motivator, but some personalities respond quite well to the idea of losing something that has meaning. Find out what motivates you.Consider the habits you are trying to overcome—and those you’re trying to establish. These are the two battles that are consuming your energy.What if you were to bundle them together so they played off of each other?In a New York Times article about keeping resolutions, the authors suggested an interesting scenario. Let’s say you were trying to stop reading trashy novels so much, and you also wanted to work out and exercise more. You could bundle these two goals by allowing yourself to read those novels only while working out.For your blog, make a list of what comes easy to you, and what doesn’t.Let’s say you love diving into your feed reader and reading blog posts to get ideas and also love getting involved in the conversations on those posts. Conversely, you hate writing your own posts. You could bundle these by setting up a system where you cannot visit your feeds until you’ve completed the draft of a post.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Again, it’s a harsh motivator, but if you’re really struggling to find a way to meet blog writing goals, you need to find out what motivates you. This technique might (and it might not) motivate you.Find others who have a similar goal, or are at least of the same mindset aiming toward improvement.Having the wrong people around you will only make you fail, or add to the burden that you are trying to overcome. A study in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology discovered that the wrong crowd can increase your stress and other negative health factors.If your goal is to increase traffic and see various kinds of measurable successes on your blog, you shouldn’t surround yourself with bloggers who are after more ephemeral or abstract blog writing goals.  You cannot really support each other with anything other than an attaboy since any serious advice you might suggest would not align with either party’s goals.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Additionally, people who are not on the same path sometimes, even unconsciously, attempt to get you to change course.“Oh, traffic doesn’t matter. It’s more important to have people that are reading instead of lots of hits.”That’s a fine statement if your goal is to write posts that people finish reading, but it isn’t very encouraging if you have a goal that involves a specific number of hits per day.Just as over—committing to blog writing goals that are too big sets you up for failure, so will an eye for expectations that are too large.You will likely not have thousands of readers the first week. You have to write and build up a platform, a reputation, and a following. In other words, you have to keep writing even if it feels like no one is reading.Anyone who has ever set up an exercise goal can appreciate how difficult it is to start and to keep going. It takes awhile to get from there to that magical time when exercise starts becoming fun, and when you finally start seeing results.Most of us are motivated by results, and when it takes a while to see those results, we get discouraged. I call that time. It can be so easy to quit when you aren’t seeing results. And that, unfortunately, is where most new blogs find themselves lodged and are never able to reappear on the other side.Build your own momentum. Find encouragement and reward in the measurable thing that is apparent right now, before those measurable results are seen.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?For example, your dream goal might be 1,000 hits per day. Set up a companion goal that is measurable now, such as posting twice a week. While you may not see those 1000 hits a day immediately, you will be able to measure your success on how often you post. The latter is completely in your control and helps you build your own momentum that propels you forward and ultimately helps you reach that dream goal that is not in your control.Dream goals and companion goals work best if they are related. Posting consistently and frequently is connected to increased traffic. They make a good pair.We love planning here at CoSchedule. We’re all about planning and appreciating the structure it provides.Planning better can be a goal in and of itself (and makes a great companion goal, like we just described above), and it is also a technique that can create a foundation for success for other goals.SMART goals are what we’re talking about here. That’s an acronym that quickly describes what we’ve talked about in this post.Make sure your blog writing goals are SMART goals:January is the time of year when the pressure to change for the better is almost overwhelming. Whether you make the changes in January or July is irrelevant. The success you see on your blog (and in other resolutions) rest on how well you create the goals it takes to get you there.

I wrote my first two blog posts recently, and I just LOVED it. (I’m a J-School grad and have really missed writing stuff!) However, it takes SO MUCH TIME, and I’m now beating myself up for getting off schedule. I realize that with frequency my workflow will improve. I think I need to plan for every other week, rather than weekly for now.Definitely start small. I’ve found it’s important to feel “success” in the small plan so that it helps you get momentum for a bigger plan. If every other week is what you can handle to write great posts, that’s the perfect place to start. Good luck on blogging!Thanks Julie! Good timing- just set up my new blog (www.bigonsocial.co.za) and although I have lots of topics to cover, your post will certainly act as encouragement when things get extremely busy later this yearGlad the post was helpful, Andrew.

I don’t agree with “How to commit to your blog point #4”It says punish yourself if you fall off the horse, beat yourself up. No no no… That’s counter productive.Rather reward yourself when you meet your goals! It’s a 180 from “give something up for not meeting your goals” and has a positive psychological effect on the subconscious.Otherwise a very helpful post as usual. Staying the distance and keeping at it when things seem tough is the key, assuming you love what you’re doing. If you’re not in love with what you’re doing it’s a hard slog.Hi Larry,I see it as one of several methods, where people choose the option that motivates them best. If you read #4, you’ll see it says that you put something that matters on the line beforehand as a motivator. It may sound the same as beating yourself up, but it isn’t really. Instead, you’re attributing additional value and motivation to something that you’re struggling to accomplish. This works best when you perhaps don’t see the value enough on its own without that extra added onto it. Then you finally feel the motivation. So, in the example, perhaps losing weight wasn’t valuable enough for some. Losing money, though, was. And that was tied into the weight loss and worked.It’s all about know what motivates you. Everyone is motivated differently and has to find what works.I really like the six month calendar idea that you post. I’ve seen it several times, and it seriously makes sense. My plan this year is to publish at least one blog post each Sunday for both of my blog sites. This will give me a week to work on the articles, including writing, creating images, editing, and proofreading. Since I use CoSchedule and MeetEdgar, in addition to email newsletters, to promote current and past blog posts, I’m not much worried about the most appropriate time to release a blog post for the first time. I just think if you’re a solo blogger, it’s difficult to write blogs on a daily basis, and to also produce monetary products that are needed to pay afford and develop an income. Plus there’s all the other tasks and responsibilities that we should be carrying out to promote our blogs.Thanks for your useful tips and suggestions.Glad you enjoyed the post! Keep up the good work and happy blog planning this year!!Great article with lots of good tips! Perfect timing too as I have started to write out my schedule and just installed a WordPress plug in (Editorial Calendar) that is going to help me stay on top of it.So weird that my last post I published yesterday was exactly about this topic.  And I love tip #7 especially where you say: you have to keep writing even if it feels like no one is reading!  That’s what I thought, but it’s nice that you confirmed it.  Thanks for the great post.Yep, keep being persistent! Sometimes it can be difficult when you feel like no one is reading, but stay strong and keep writing!Thanks for the encouragement :)Hello Julie!  I just want to let you know that you did a great job writing this article. I’m a big fan! You give such awesome advice!Super happy you enjoyed this post, Aurora! Happy blog planning this year!! :)Great tips you shared for blogging.ThanksGlad you found the tips helpful!

											I’m actually writing this post because this is a huge area we need to improve at CoSchedule. We write great blog posts, but we could do so much more to promote them. But when I started researching the topic of “how to promote your blog”, I just wasn’t finding a whole lot of ideas coupled with the real how-to, actionable advice that would really help us find the best blog promotion tactics for us.So I decided to share this research with you to help you promote your blog better than ever. Consider this post a “choose your own adventure” novel, just like I did when writing it. This is meant to inspire new ideas, try new blog promotion tactics, and grow traffic to your blog. You don’t need to try every one, but here is the world’s most in-depth list of how to promote your blog.Here we go.When Noah Kagan from OkDork wrote a post about getting more traffic for every single post you publish, his very first tip was to start building and prioritizing your email list. It’s the best way to turn organic traffic into engaged readers who constantly see the cool stuff you’re publishing and keep coming back to your blog.As we know at CoSchedule, we focus on converting our traffic into email subscribers because they’re more likely than any other audience type to become regular users of our editorial calendar software.Noah has a couple awesome tools he uses to build his email list, including the SumoMe plugin, List Builder, and Scroll Box. At CoSchedule, we’ve used tools like OptinMonster and LeadPages. Any of these should work well for building your initial email list to give you an audience that will read your posts and share them with their networks. As Noah puts it:Growing your email list is an amazingly vicious cycle. You get subscribers, email them when an article goes live, they go read it and then share it with people. Then those people subscribe and the cycle delightfully continues.Recommended Reading:MailChimp did some awesome research when they included a send time optimization feature into their email marketing software. Essentially, they wanted to know the absolute best days and times to send email when there is heavy receiver inbox activity. They studied billions (yeah, really) of people’s inbox activity to do this, so it’s pretty interesting stuff:John from MailChimp notes that no single day really wins hands down, but there is definitely a trend: Weekdays work best for promoting your blog posts via email. And to me, it looks like there are slight peaks on Tuesdays and Thursdays.The best time to send an email is about 10 a.m. in your own time zone. John notes that the peak here is less than 7% of total inboxes, so there is a lot of variety in the times that people actually check their email. And it gets even more diverse depending on your industry, with some peak times being earlier than 10 a.m., so check out the graph above and send your emails at the absolute best times for your niche.This one’s pretty basic, but it’s also super important—send an email to your list to let your subscribers know you published something new.Email your new posts to your subscribers. We sent this email to promote a new content development process post on the CoSchedule blog.This type of email gives us a nice launching point at CoSchedule to amplify social sharing from our most loyal audience, which helps us increase pageviews from the very beginning.Email your subscribers when you publish new posts to increase your traffic.Some quick tips to maximize your new post email:It looks like there are a lot of people who are trending toward plain text emails recently. HubSpot found that HTML-enhanced emails decreased their open and clickthrough rates, suggesting that some email clients may filter enhanced email from even getting into primary inboxes and that folks tend to see email as a 1-to-1 interaction.DIYthemes also changed their email newsletter to a simple plain text option, and their subscribers seemed to love it.So of course, I had to dig into our own data to understand what you gals and guys like from us here at CoSchedule. It turns out that adding a visual into our new post emails decreases open rates by as much as 3.5% while clickthroughs increase by about 2.12%. Given the massive amount of people who open our emails, I’ll take my 3.5% more opens with slightly fewer clickthroughs.Plain text emails tend to have higher open rates than HTML-enhanced emails.Most bloggers publish 2–3 times a week. Why not compile those posts with a few others from rock stars in your niche to build an email newsletter your subscribers will love?That’s a great way to share your new content again, maybe a few of your older but super awesome posts, and make the time you put into social media content curation totally worth it by sharing those posts again.Share your latest posts—along with your best-ofs and curated content—in an email newsletter to increase your traffic.This is a great way to remind your subscribers to check out your content, while also providing a ton of additional value by sharing other folks’ great stuff.Noah Kagan gets pretty blunt when he talks about email open rates:50%+ of the people ARE NOT OPENING your emails.Ouch.This is what an original email of his looked like…So he went about finding a solution to increase his open rates by 30%. The process is simple:…and after that, this is what happened:As Noah puts it:1 minute of work = 7,028 more people read my emailNot a shabby way to promote your blog while also using your time super efficiently.I had the opportunity to chat with Adam Tuttle at ActiveCampaign during a recent webinar:
One of the things Adam talks about is the idea of understanding what pages and posts your subscribers are reading most so you can automatically send them relevant content suited for their own preferences. That’s brilliant!Basically, look into a marketing automation tool like ActiveCampaign, and start monitoring your most popular pages. When you start to find flows for your content, you can create email campaigns to send your blog posts that complement the information your subscribers are already looking for.Watch that webinar quick for a lot more detail on how to keep your email subscribers. Adam is a fantastic teacher.It’s super easy to create a click to share link to inspire social shares right from your emails. Including click to tweet links in our plain text emails helps us get an average of 12 shares for each blog post within the first couple hours after our emails go out.And it’s super easy to do. Just use Share Link Generator, write your social message, and drop in the link to your blog post. Create the link, and include it in your email like this:Use click to share links right in your emails to inspire social engagement. This is an example from our write better content post.It’s that easy to get a few social shares to establish your post’s credibility right off the bat.The first time I started chatting with Barry Feldman from Feldman Creative, his email signature caught my eye.Barry Feldman uses WiseStamp to include links to blog posts in his email signature.Barry rocks WiseStamp to make this signature, and it seems like a super easy process to get started: Enter in all of your contact information, your picture or a logo, and your blog’s RSS feed. Grab the code from WiseStamp and add it into your email signature right in your email client. Done.If you’ve never heard of aggregate sites before, think of them as a place to go for information from many different sources related to a specific topic. These sites are where you can share your own content and other people’s awesome stuff in your niche to help your community with similar interests.The up-vote aspect of these communities takes on a social role, giving the site’s users the chance to say it’s good or bad. It’s an awesome way to keep the community strong (and keep the junk content out).Here are a few sites you could look into to promote your blog:Marketers talk about solving people’s problems all the time. There are forums out there dedicated purely to helping people ask questions where they can get expert advice as answers. What an awesome way to connect directly with your audience, provide a bit of your expertise, and link back to your blog for further, in-depth answers!A common forum marketers love is Quora, but there are bound to be some even more specific to your industry. For example, I used to work in wholesale electrical distribution, and one of our audiences was electrical contractors—your electrician. There’s a forum for that. Really. And it’s super electric-nerdy—which makes it a perfect place for wholesalers to reach out with product advice for their super niche target audience.You can do it, too, with a little research and your good ol’ buddy, Google. Simply search for the forums in your niche with this algorithm:“intitle:forum” + [your niche keyword]Here’s what it looks like when I try to find forums for bloggers:Use Google to find forums in your niche with this algorithm: “intitle:forum” + niche keyword.No more excuses. I bet there is a forum that already exists for your niche. or else you can do one better and start your niche’s forum yourself. bbPress is a forum software from the makers of WordPress that you can use to get started now.Some folks prefer to find content through popular social bookmarking sites. You can apply to have your blog content present on these sites to help people who are interested in a certain topic discover your posts:I’m in a couple different Slack groups that serve different purposes. But one of them, started by Mention, is meant for blog editors, content marketers, and entrepreneurs to connect, share ideas, and review work.It’s a terrific way for us to publish blog posts and share them with an inside network of people we appreciate and trust. It’s an awesome way to build connections with a you-scratch-my-back-I’ll-scratch-yours culture. It’s a smart idea, and one you can use in your industry for a lot more than just promoting your blog posts.Like Mention, you could rock a long-term group using a tool like Slack, or even smaller, one-at-a-time, face-to-face meetings with a tool like Google Hangouts.Desmond Chua wrote a roundup post on ReferralCandy’s blog, getting the best advice from industry influencers. I loved James Clear’s simple idea:If you go through a lot of effort to create good content, then do yourself a favor and share it, re-publish it, and pitch it to more places. Good content deserves to be shared with more people and the best way to do that is to share it in more places.When you apply that thought to social media, the opportunities are nearly endless, but there are definitely the big ones you don’t want to miss out on:Sharing your content on the networks you know your audience uses is smart. I like James’ approach because everyone is different, and while a majority of your audience may use a certain social network, sharing messages on all of these is really easy and has potential to draw additional interest to your blog.Heck, just schedule your social shares to these networks via CoSchedule to keep it super simple.You can use CoSchedule to easily promote your blog on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, and Tumblr.I just read a post from Olsy Sorokina that mentioned a simple tip that works well for any social network: Look at your social profile and make sure you have a link back to your blog in it.CoSchedule’s user group on Facebook has a link back to the blog in its description.This idea works particularly well if you’re sharing content on Instagram, since you can’t actually include a link back to your blog posts from the messages themselves. So a hack I’ve seen around involves sharing a sweet graphic from your post, then mentioning that the link to the post is in your profile.Include a link to your blog in your Instagram profile.Hey, if it works for Instagram, why not at least include a link to your blog’s homepage in all of your social profiles—including asking your entire team to do it in the personal profiles they use for business?There’s an old rule from sales that is all about forming new relationships. The power of 100 rule is a simple concept: Make 100 new contacts every day.What better place than to try this than your own social networks? It’s as easy as responding to comments or following new folks.If 100 is a scary number for you, consider this social media engagement and make a point to not just blast your content, but share it in context and participate in the ensuing conversation.I haven’t tried this yet, but I would bet that focusing on growing your social networks will help you reach a much larger audience with every social share, making this a super worth while daily habit.Basically, this is all about optimizing your blog posts so when your readers share your content on social networks, they look really good.Optimize your open graph data to help your readers easily share your content. This example is how the CoSchedule Chrome extension uses open graph data to optimize social shares.WordPress plugin Yoast gives you the ability to clean up your excerpt that gets pulled into many social media curation tools, like the Chrome extension built into CoSchedule. But if you’re looking for a way to clean up your Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Twitter, and LinkedIn shares directly from your readers, check out the NextGEN WordPress plugin.This is a no-brainer way to boost your social media schedule. Right when you publish your blog posts, share them to every one of your business’ social accounts, and also the personal ones you use for business.The more immediate retweets, likes, and general shares you get, the more credibility the post receives, so kickstarting your shares right when you publish is a great way to encourage even more shares.Some of your audience may follow you on your various social profiles, so instead of just sending every message with the headline of your post, switch it up to optimize each message for your different social networks. More details on that to come!You could just share your blog post on all of your networks right when you publish it and call it good. But when we researched the idea of sharing your content more than once on social media, we found it can increase your traffic by 3,150%!Here’s how to do it:@njellering For every new piece of content published, we write 12 unique Tweets, schedule for 12 days, then once a month for 12 months.— Amanda MacArthur (@amaaanda) February 2, 2016Neil Patel knows how to generate tons of traffic. I love reading his blog for new techniques and inspiration I wouldn’t have thought of myself.One of Neil’s tips is to repromote your old content, but not just any content. Neil noticed when he shared all of his content again, he actually experienced a traffic drop from his social networks. But when he shared only his best content again, he grew his traffic.So find a tool like CoSchedule where you can see your most popular posts and schedule even more social shares to keep that traffic coming in.The top posts feature in CoSchedule helps you see your most popular content and schedule more social shares to promote those blog posts.After we took Neil’s advice, we noticed traffic continues to grow for our most popular blog posts, even when they’re more than a year old.How To Quadruple Your Traffic With A #SocialMedia Editorial Calendar e https://t.co/qQg6wlgHA7 by @coschedule pic.twitter.com/9xHIJCEjOx— SocialMedia Examiner (@SMExaminer) January 26, 2016There are other pages on your blog that work great for social sharing—your home page, categories pages, and tags.Imagine grouping a list of blog posts together with a tag dedicated to a very specific topic: You could repurpose the posts to help solve a very specific problem, then share that across your social networks.Buffer started trying out this method recently with some success, making it an interesting way to promote your blog with more than just one post at a time.When the New York Times researched why people were sharing content, the results were clear: It’s an emotional task. People share because they feel something for the content they’re sharing, which makes total sense, right?Experiment with these five emotions in your social messages to capture interest and inspire shares.The idea of sharing your content more than once gets super old if you just share the headline of your blog post over and over again.Get inspiration to change up your messages from in the body of your blog post itself:Kimberlee Morrison makes the point super eloquently:Posts with images get more engagement than posts without images. However, don’t just add any old image. Avoid stock images like the plague. Instead, make your images more effective with text overlay, use images to attract traffic from social sites and create more visual posts with graphics as well as captured images.There’s even evidence to suggest that including images in your tweets could boost your clickthrough rate by 150% while using animated GIFs can get you even more clicks.Can you master the #hashtag better than @jimmyfallon? https://t.co/A4SrKpeQPi pic.twitter.com/uJBAhtQFt9— CoSchedule (@CoSchedule) October 27, 2015So make your blog visually appealing, then reuse the images, graphics, animated GIFs, and videos you create in your social messages.If you’re like us here at CoSchedule, you love what you do.So why not turn that love into action to share your content with even more of your team’s networks?We do this at CoSchedule, and it’s so fun to have a more personal conversation with our audience rather than just through our business social profiles.When Is The Best Time To Publish Blog Posts? https://t.co/8gXFGQBQZM pic.twitter.com/U2idWb4WXq— Nathan Ellering (@njellering) January 20, 2016And, it drives clickthroughs back to your content, which is an added bonus.Help your employees promote your blog to reach more people and get more traffic.A trick that I love to do is use social media listening to see who’s sharing our content, and where they’re doing it. It helps us stay in tune with the words our audience is using and where they’re having conversations so I can make it a point to have a presence there.It’s a blast to thank our advocates for sharing our content, then providing a related, totally relevant blog post similar to the one they shared, with a little message like, “Thanks so much for sharing, Nathan! I bet you’ll like this, too! [link]” We personalize that message every time so it doesn’t come across spammy, and it shows.If you take engagement seriously, why not turn that into a blog promotion technique, too, to keep your advocates coming back for more?Sometimes, your audience may just not like the blog posts you’ve published. That’s OK, really, because you can use that as a learning tool to help you write better content.But, when that’s the case, review your social analytics to understand when to stop sharing certain posts. Just like it’s appropriate to keep sharing the best of the best like Neil Patel recommends, it’s just fine to pull the plug when your social engagement for certain posts drops. As Neil puts it:Clearly, when you share too much, you hit a point of diminishing returns.As with most things, you will have to test the frequency of posting to optimize it for your business. Depending on the audience, you might need to share more or less.Look at your social media analytics to understand when it’s time to stop sharing. You could even halt for just a few months, then try again to see if you had maybe promoted your same piece of content too heavily, giving you the chance to improve your social media scheduling in the future.When our very own Julie Neidlinger researched 10 different studies about the best times to post on social media, she found a few ways to make every tweet get a little more engagement:We’ve been researching quite a few different ways to help you maximize your impact on social media. And our CoSchedule users ask us a lot about how often they should post on social media. We analyzed our data and combined it with the top 10 studies we could find on the topic—with the complete findings soon to be released in a brand new blog post (so enjoy the preview!).The consensus for daily posting frequency on Twitter was 15 tweets per day.So share lots of content multiple times a day on your Twitter accounts to promote your blog posts.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Use Twitter to help your followers do something better. You can increase your clickthroughs with visuals, and mix up your messages with the key points from your blog post.Tweets containing 70–100 characters and an image that helps your followers define themselves tend to perform best.You can piggyback off of the trending hashtags you see next to your Twitter feed, or you can easily search for popular ones people are using to share related content in your niche.Trending hashtags simply have lots of tweets using that hashtag, so your tweet lifespan is relatively short and you’ll need to make sure you use only hashtags that make sense in the context of your blog posts. What makes sense more often than not is to find and use a hashtag that complements your content—a hashtag people would use to find your stuff specifically.Trending hashtags are super popular. But finding your hashtags may be a smarter move to make sure they complement your blog posts you’re sharing.There are a few tools you could use to help you find relevant hashtags for the tweets you’ll use to promote your blog posts:Use one or two hashtags per tweet to grow your engagement by 21%.Did you know Upworthy writes 25 headlines for every single blog post they publish? It sounds a bit crazy at first, but when we started doing it ourselves, we noticed a huge improvement in connecting powerfully emotional headlines and our clickthrough rate on Twitter.Upworthy’s process is simple (and a bit funny):And now that you have 25 blog post headlines, you probably ended up with at least a few really good ones.So A/B test them very simply using Twitter:We’re taking this to the next level at CoSchedule and started sharing even more variations to help us really keep our traffic rolling in through irresistible headlines, and it’s all based on Twitter A/B testing.This is really similar to cleaning up your open graph data, but relates specifically to optimizing your audience’s tweets for your blog posts. As Twitter puts it nicely:With Twitter Cards, you can attach rich photos, videos and media experience to Tweets that drive traffic to your website. Simply add a few lines of HTML to your webpage, and users who Tweet links to your content will have a “Card” added to the Tweet that’s visible to all of their followers.Here’s an example of a tweet they sent from a website that’s optimized for Twitter cards:Connect & discover: The Twitter story in 1:40 http://t.co/TRRiDAbkUR— Twitter Advertising (@TwitterAds) November 8, 2013All it takes is implementing some HTML into your blog post meta tags to optimize the tweets your audience sends, which sounds like a perfect fit into your pre-publish blog editing workflow. Get the code to do this right from Twitter right now.After you tweet an awesome blog post, you can pin that tweet to the top of your Twitter profile. Essentially, that makes it the first tweet any followers see when they check out your Twitter account, and it gives your posts a nice amount of visibility longer than the normal lifespan of a tweet.Aaron Lee wrote a blog post for Post Planner that basically says he was able to boost retweets for a single tweet up to 450 times in just a couple weeks. Seems worth it for how easy it is to do.All you have to do is go into Twitter and find the tweet you scheduled through CoSchedule, and simply hit the three dots and choose to pin that tweet. That’s it.This is a hack I just learned from Dan Zarrella. The guy analyzed 200,000 link-containing tweets and found that the ones with the most clickthroughs actually contained links about 25% of the way into the message.When we started hosting #cochat, our Twitter chat, we thought of basing social media conversations around the blog posts we were publishing. The thought was that the reach would increase for our Twitter presence, while also providing a viable, more long-form solution to a challenge when we would provide a link back to the blog post around which the conversation was born.It worked. But it’s a lot of time to dedicate to promotion—coming up with questions, participating in the chat itself, and being “on” for answering every question. It was a bit much, to be honest. But I’d suggest trying it out and seeing if it’s a fit for your audience.And hey, much like guest blogging, you could be a guest on someone else’s Twitter chat to introduce your blog to an entirely new audience. We’ve done that with a few of our friends in the industry, and it’s been a good way to grow your blog audience.As Twitter says:Promoted Tweets are ordinary Tweets purchased by advertisers who want to reach a wider group of users or to spark engagement from their existing followers.Essentially, you tweet your blog posts and then review your Twitter Analytics data to understand which messages are driving the most clickthroughs. From there, you can select the best tweets and pay to have them reach more people.You can pay to promote your tweets to reach a larger audience and drive more traffic to your blog posts.Julie’s research on the best times to post on social media found that you’ll get the best engagement when you post on weekdays.Our soon-to-be released data about how often to post on social media analyzes 10 of the top posts on the topic, and even includes our own custom data.Based on our findings, share two posts to Google+ every weekday to promote your blog.Google+ users tend to be tech-savvy, so think about including in-depth, fact-driven, how-to content that includes videos and GIFs that guide your audience through their challenges.Use rich text like bolding and italics, combined with long-form posts to stand out.At first, I was a bit skeptical about the usefulness of Google+ hashtags. But Ann Smarty lays it out in a way I can definitely understand and want to pursue when I promote my blog posts now:Google+ uses hashtags to explore a topic rather than curate it. When you search for a hashtag within Google+, the network auto-selects related hashtags and trending topics and returns those along with the hashtag you typed in.Google automatically assigns hashtags to your Google+ posts, but you can edit and modify them to suit your content even better. Think of using the keyword from your blog post as a hashtag along with a variant or two. It sounds like using 2–3 hashtags per Google+ post is the best for increasing your reach.Jennifer Beese wrote a fantastic post for Sprout Social covering +Post Ads, which you’d manage through your AdWords account with Google. She mentions there are a few restrictions:It looks like +Post Ads differ from other promoted social content because they can receive engagement from more places on the Web than just Google+. As Jennifer says:People can leave comments, follow your brand, give a +1, or join a Hangout right from the ad.I’d say it’s worth a try to promote your blog posts through +Post Ads and measure your success, especially since there appears to be a few more opportunities for engagement other than on the social network itself.Julie’s analysis of 10 different studies found that posting on Facebook later into the week and on weekends is generally the best way to increase your engagement on Facebook.We’re currently researching how many times to post to Facebook every day to get the most traffic for your hard work. Based on the data available to us right now, I’d suggest sharing one post to Facebook every day, and if you have more than 10,000 friends, share two posts per day.If you’re promoting an entertaining blog post, Facebook is the perfect network to fuel your social referral traffic. Facebook users want to be entertained, so make your messages humorous, inspirational, cause-related, or just super useful.Posts that are less than 100 characters long and include emotional visuals tend to perform well. Include videos to stand out in your fans’ newsfeeds.When it comes to Facebook, hashtags serve to categorize your content for discovery. So it makes sense to understand what’s popular right now to get in on the trend that’s already getting attention.You can find popular hashtags on Facebook by opening up your feed and checking out the right side. There’s a widget there titled “Trending” where you’ll see the three most popular hashtags. If you click, you’ll see a few categories, and more trending hashtags will show up.Data from Digital Information World suggests that 1–2 hashtags per Facebook message tend to get the most interactions.When you promote your blog posts through normal Facebook posts, you can also pin them to the top of your wall. It’s a simple practice that can increase the number of people you reach with a post since it’s the first post new visitors to your Facebook page see.It’s easy to start pinning: Go to your Facebook page’s timeline, click the upside-down carrot icon on a normal post you just published, then select “Pin to Top” and you’re rocking.Don’t have a Facebook Group? It’s a great place to start your community to ask a core audience transparent questions, get feedback on projects you’re planning, and yes, even promote your blog posts from time to time—especially the posts your group inspires.Just go to your Facebook page, and on the left side of your newsfeed find the “Groups” area and select “Create Group”. From there, connect your group into CoSchedule, and you can share messages easily with the folks in your group.Facebook makes it really easy to boost posts after you share them. It’s something we’ve started experimenting with recently ourselves, and a big lesson learned is that targeting the right audience is critical to success—otherwise you’re just paying for eyeballs, but not for clicks.This is especially true with Facebook ads. Something Amy Porterfield, author of Facebook Marketing All-in-One For Dummies suggests looking into is Facebook’s power editor where you can upload your entire list of email addresses to help Facebook find lookalike audiences with similar interests to people on your list.Amy also suggests retargeting your website visitors using Facebook ads to re-engage with those folks. You could use ads to promote your blog posts as a soft sell to get them back to your blog that’s optimized for conversion.Since LinkedIn is generally a professional’s social network, it makes sense that it’s busiest during weekdays at break times and right before and after work.Research tells us that LinkedIn is most active during the work week. So maintaining your presence throughout the typical Monday–Friday just makes sense, and is exactly what we found when we analyzed the perfect number of times to share to LinkedIn every day.Post to LinkedIn four times a week, nearly one every weekday. You can combine this knowledge with what you just learned about the best times to post on LinkedIn and forget about posting on Fridays.LinkedIn is the business professionals’ network, so messages that connect with case studies and success stories, business inspiration, and skill building perform particularly well.Steal the nuggets from your blog posts to share in shorter messages (slightly longer than Twitter) combined with infographics and info-images, memes, and videos.You can create a LinkedIn Group to help you connect with peers, members of your audience, or even your current customers. Just like you’d use a Facebook Group, you can ask them questions and get feedback to turn their input into awesome content. When they inspire awesome blog posts, share them right back with your LinkedIn Group.Create a LinkedIn Group to connect with your audience, ask questions, and promote your blog posts.Creating a group is easy! Just hover over “Interests” on your homepage, click on “Groups”, and click “Create group” in the “My Groups” tab. Now you can start some meaningful conversation first, then provide some valuable insight with the blog posts you’ll share.Paying to play has its advantages for reaching a targeted business-focused audience on LinkedIn. Much like Facebook ads, sponsored content offers a way for you to micro-target your audience and boost the posts you’ve already shared on LinkedIn.Pinners are active outside of normal business hours and on weekends. Makes sense, right? So Pin later on weekdays on specifically on Saturday night.Daily Pinning frequency is one of the most debated topics regarding how often to post on social media. Some suggest Pinning as few as four times a day whereas others recommend 30 times every day.We analyzed the data in a study we’ll release in the very near future, and came to the conclusion that Pinning nine times a day is best. So mix in your old blog posts with new stuff, and curate some of the coolest visuals you can find for your Pinterest fans.Pinterest is a different kind of network—almost like a search engine. Include keywords in your descriptions to help Pinners find your Pins, and make those descriptions robust. Longer descriptions that are slightly more than 300 characters get the most Repins. Buzzfeed found that positive descriptions helped them get more Repins and clickthroughs.Think of your descriptions as actual calls to action to turn Pinners into visitors on your blog.Hashtags on Pinterest work slightly differently than networks like Twitter. Pinterest uses hashtags more for discovery, turning a hashtag you used in your Pin description into a search for that hashtag’s keyword. So using hashtags may help others find your content, but they’re not as important as targeting keywords in your Pin descriptions.That’s why a solid use case for hashtags is to develop your own, and use custom hashtags in your Pins. This way, if someone clicks on your hashtag, they’ll only see your related content and will keep exploring the blog posts you share on Pinterest.However you decide to use hashtags, use them sparingly (keep it to two or three at most), since Pinterest may even demote the value of your Pins in their search results if you use too many of them.Did you know pictures without faces get 23% more Repins than those with faces?To top it off, graphics that are red and orange get 2x more Repins than those that are blue or include multiple dominant colors. You can also embed Pins into your blog posts, which increases the number of Repins.Pinterest’s group boards are kind of like the groups you’d see in LinkedIn and Facebook—they help build a community around a certain topic, often having some ground rules to foster the relationship. These boards are a great way to share your content with active Pinners in a helpful, topic-focused environment.Group boards can help you:Join an existing active board with a little help from PinGroupie. Or start your own by clicking the “+ Create a board” button and inviting Pinners via the “Invite” button and entering in your friends’ names or email addresses, or finding them through Twitter or Google+.Create a shared board with your audience to share ideas, inspiration, and blog posts.While first introduced in 2014, Pinterest has continued to make updates to promoted Pins in order to make them work even better. Promoted Pins for Pinterest are similar to Facebook boosted posts since you can purchase them to reach more people.Promoted Pins are cost-per-click and increase engagement rates up to 2–5%, which exceeds industry benchmarks. Unfortunately, these type of pins are only available in the US today, but it’s only a matter of time before it becomes a global feature, accessible to all types of users and businesses.Your social audience probably follows lots of different folks with their social networks, but some of your more organized audience members may prefer using RSS readers and categorizing the content that they read from their favorite publications.The good news is that if you’re using WordPress, you already have an RSS feed for your blog posts. Hurray for something easy! All you need to do is add /feed to the end of your root domain for your WordPress blog, and you’ll have your RSS feed.This is what the RSS URL looks like for CoSchedule’s WordPress blog: http://coschedule.com/blog/feed. Yours likely looks pretty similar!RSS readers like Feedly are fantastic ways for you to discover content, organize it in ways that makes sense to you, and generally, never miss a new post from any of the blogs you follow while also not having to visit every site just to catch the newest headlines.Even though your goal is to build your email list, there are still some of your audience members who just won’t subscribe. To get your content in front of them, they may prefer a less intrusive route, and that route is Web push.Web push sends a notification through your audience’s Internet browser when you publish new content. A lot of times, it looks just like a system notification.CNN uses Web push to share their content.At CoSchedule, we use Roost Web push as a WordPress plugin to help us reach our email haters.Have you looked at your analytics to find a large majority of your blog post traffic comes from mobile devices? While sending responsive emails is a great way to reach your audience on the go, you can also send mobile push notifications that show up on smartphones just like you’d see a new social message or event.You can enable mobile push notifications for your blog just like this.A tool that works well for this type of setup is Pushbullet.This tip is brought to you by Jason Acidre:Start with the low-hanging fruit—people who have already shared similar content from your competitors. But it’s very important to ensure the quality of your content matches or exceeds the content from your competitors.Makes sense, right? If you absolutely know some people enjoy similar content to what you’ve created, make sure it gets into the right hands.Easier said than done, though, too. Well, there are a couple ways to find the right people who may enjoy your content:Hashtags: If you’re thinking of connecting with folks via social media, you could take a look at the main keywords you used throughout your post as hashtags on the major social networks. You could find the people who shared content with those hashtags before, and reach out to them with your related content.Moz Open Site Explorer: Enter your competitor’s URL to see the content that is linking to their website. Check out the authors who wrote that content and establish relationships with them. Those folks are influencers who are sharing related content in your niche, so it’s a great place to make connections.If people wrote about something similar to your new blog post, chances are, they’d be interested in reading some more content on that topic. It’s especially interesting if there is some contradiction in facts or opinions—controversy gets traffic.Blog post comments: Google the keyword you’re using in your blog post, and look at the top results. Read the related posts and write a comment about what you liked, possibly disagreed with, etc., then give more information with a link back to your content. You’re not a spammer if you’re seriously trying to provide value.When Nikhil used Aman’s advice, he shared it and asked for feedback via a blog comment.Ahrefs Content Explorer: Check out what content is popular in your niche to get in touch with those authors. From there, you’ll have the chance to learn from the pros and possibly even share your own content with those peeps.If you’re anything like me when you write your blog posts, you research the heck out of them and give credit to the folks who came up with the amazing ideas you’re building off of. When that happens, it’s nice to let those people know you liked their work enough to share their thoughts with your audience.You can connect with influencers in tons of different ways—social, email, face-to-face—the point is to use the opportunity to start a relationship as you make the “ask” if they would like to read and possibly even share your content with their audiences.It’s kinda nice to know other people appreciate your work, especially when you’re not super pushy about “share this with your audience” and then email these people a bajillion times asking if they shared it. Don’t do that. It’s not nice.Cold emails specifically have been getting a lot of flack for being terrible lately because so many bloggers are doing a piss poor job of doing it. But when done right, it can be super effective.If you’re ready to try this out, check out tools like ContentMarketer.io, BuzzStream, or Empire Kred to get started.Content curation is a great way to write blog posts when you don’t have a lot of time, and there are tons of great ideas that were recently introduced to your industry. If you know of folks who write roundup posts in your niche, reach out to build the relationship and eventually pitch some of your latest posts to be included in their roundups.You can find those folks to pitch them your content with a little Google magic.Search for this:“intitle:roundup” + your industry/keywordIt might take a bit of digging, but you can often find a bunch of bloggers who have audiences that love roundup posts.Some folks curate awesome content to send to their audiences in roundup emails and e-newsletters, too. Rock the same process you just learned for finding roundup posts to find these peeps:“intitle:roundup email” + your industry/keywordAnd see if there are a couple emails that work well for your industry. You can also change out “roundup” for “newsletter” or another synonym that may apply even better to your industry to find new people to build relationships with.Each result you find is a potential connection to make with people who like to curate and share great content.You work with partners and affiliates because they have the resources and audience to help you grow. So make it part of your relationship to get their advice on content and to help you promote your blog posts. It’s an easy ask to see if they’ll include a link to your content in their future posts, or possibly even share your blog posts in an upcoming newsletter.Something interesting for SaaS companies may include activating your brand advocates with personalized referral links to give them something sweet in return for them sharing your content. That’s an idea a CoSchedule reader gave me when we recently launched our course to Keep Your Editorial Schedule On Track, and would have been a great way to connect with our most loyal fans. Maybe next time!Co-marketing is becoming more of a disciplined practice in the content marketing industry lately. It’s an approach where two marketing teams from different organizations pool their resources to create one piece of content.Now, that might not sound like a blog promotion tactic at first, but hear me out—you can publish content on your blog where people already know who you are and what you offer all day long, but this is an extremely effective way to introduce yourself to a new audience with the validation of awesomeness from that audience’s editors. It’s a win-win for both you and your co-marketers.In the past, we’ve built relationships with other companies through content trades (we’ll write a blog post for you if you write one for us) so we keep up with the consistency on our blog while also getting exposed to new readers. You could also opt in to a more formal agreement by paying to reach an audience (sometimes called native advertising).When CoSchedule launched our Evernote integration, both marketing teams worked together to promote the new feature.Anyway, starting with content trades and working your way up is a great way to get started. Just find a respectable blog in your niche and reach out to their editor with a cool idea to get started.You might be surprised at how much guest posts can help you grow your own blog. When Buffer got started, they built an email list of 100,000 subscribers by publishing 150 guest posts in just nine months. Jon Morrow built a waiting list of more than 12,000 potential customers for Boost Blog Traffic from guest posts before ever publishing a single post on his own blog.Guest posts alone can build your credibility that ties back to your own blog and the valuable content you publish there. Plus, it gets your name out there to help you steal the audience you need to grow.This is an example of a guest post we wrote for the Convince and Convert blog.Let’s say for the sake of this blog promotion tactic, that you just came up with your own custom research because you know that is an awesome way to get traffic.Publish a blog post detailing every actionable takeaway from the content. And now you can turn every one of those takeaways into new content that will help you reach new audiences, position your original research as a credible source, and give your projects the attention they deserve.We rocked this strategy when we launched new research on emotional headlines, and the post on our blog is still one of our most popular pieces of content.Essentially, remarketing or retargeting (whatever you wanna call it) is showing ads to the people who’ve already visited your site.Remarketing can help you reach 84% of the people who’ve already visited your site across 5–10 different sites within 10–18 days. That’s especially useful to keep visitors coming back to your blog to build the trust that will encourage them to go deeper into your marketing funnel.A couple remarketing tools that will get you started and might be worth your while include Adroll and marketing360. I’m sure there are more, so let me know what you’re using and how you like ’em in the comments.Sure, there are probably a few other search engines you could use to target your audience (which may be worth your while in specific niches), but Google takes the cake for the amount of users.If you’d like a solid tutorial on Google AdWords, here’s an oldie but goodie from Phil Frost on the Kissmetrics blog. Get started with Bing Ads with some videos from the platform itself.Top sites in the world are using recommendation engines like Outbrain, Taboola, and Zemanta to sell ad space that suggests related content to their readers.Every engine is a bit different, but the basic idea for blog promotion is simple: Use the traffic that other sites naturally get to grow your own audience.Discovery sites like reddit, the self-proclaimed home page of the Internet, get up to 1 million votes cast every single day. There is some opportunity there to reach that audience with advertising.The way I see it, choosing keywords to target in your blog posts is one of the most effective ways to promote your blog posts. And once you do it right, much of the traffic will take care of itself (at least initially).By concentrating on choosing the right keywords—and focusing on a difficulty score we could successfully compete with—we were able to increase our #1–3 SERP rankings by 248%. More than half of our overall traffic comes from search engines because of this method.The takeaways are:Brian Dean from Backlinko pulled together a complete list of Google’s 200 ranking factors. While there are tons of ways you can optimize your blog in general to help you get more organic search engine traffic, you can also use his advice to build an SEO checklist for yourself to run through before you publish your blog posts:If you do nothing else with keywords or SEO in general, this checklist of 10 things will definitely help you out.In his research on Google’s ranking factors, Brian also mentions that building internal links is something search engines look for when indexing your blog. Brian says:The number of internal links to a page indicates its importance relative to other pages on the site.I had to double check this, and definitely found this seems to be true (and a very good way to direct your traffic from your new posts to your best-converting posts):These are some of the top pages on the CoSchedule website. Lots of them get extra love with links from new posts.The opposite side of this is that Google tends to look at outbound links, too. Too many “dofollow” links can hurt your PageRank, while it’s rumored that linking to credible references and sources can help you show authority. It sounds like if you have lots of outbound links in your content, tagging some of your links to low-authority sites as “nofollow” may actually help you improve your PageRank. It’s easy:<a href=”http://lowauthority.com” rel=”nofollow”>I first read about this idea from Neil Patel since one of the myths of SEO is that Google will find your content and index it. Neil goes on to explain with a metaphor that search engine robots feed on fresh content, and your new blog posts are a tasty treat. You just need to invite them for a meal so they show up. ba-dum-pahA great way to do this is with the Google XML Sitemap plugin available for WordPress. It’ll generate a sitemap to help Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask.com index your new blog posts.Alternatively, check out Ping-O-Matic to enter in your new blog post URL and choose which search engines you’d like to notify. It’s that easy to get the robots over to your site, and Neil mentions he’s seen blog posts indexed within six hours of using this process.Moz has a great metaphor for links: They’re like votes from other websites that tell search engines they favor your content. Another way to think about it is that links are the streets search engines travel from blog to blog, so the more streets to your content, the better.Link building works when you publish really great content that people want to reference as a valid source of information. So when you publish your super awesome blog post, you can promote it to help people find it, and ask for their help through backlinks to give your content the attention it deserves.So Moz lays out four strategies for link building for beginners:Some times are significantly better than others for increasing your initial reach with your blog posts. Monday mornings are typically the best for getting the most traffic, and in second place comes Thursday mornings for inbound links and social reach.From our recent data, we’ve found most marketers publish a couple times throughout the week. Target Monday and Thursday mornings to get the most traction out of your initial publish.When researchers studied the social sharing patterns of New York Times readers, they discovered something quite interesting: They shared practical and useful content more than anything else.And when Tim Soulo covered the topic of growing your blog traffic for the CoSchedule blog, he came up with a simple—yet truly effective—three-step process to help you put that knowledge into action with your blog posts:Neil Patel has the same mindset when he creates actionable content, showing that teaching by example has helped him grow several popular blogs to hundreds of thousands of visitors over the course of his career. Follow his advice, and you’ll be well on your way to naturally generating the traffic you’re hoping for.Something we get asked a lot about at CoSchedule is the best blog post length. We’ve gone on record that it doesn’t matter, and that it kinda does if you want it to rank well in search results.When our team grew recently, the question came up again and again, and it seemed like we’d have to put a word count number on our blog posts to come to an understanding as a team. But then we didn’t, and opted instead to analyze data from our most successful blog posts to find something truly interesting:When it comes to blog post length, it’s comprehensiveness that matters more than anything else.Think about it. This post targets the keyword “how to promote your blog”, which is a topic you should really care about. Would it be as good if I only covered 10 ways to do that or if I gave you everything I could possibly know on the topic?Comprehensive posts focus on what’s right for the reader, not a word count length set by an editor. That usually means they’re long-form.I’ll let you know how this post performs. :)When we analyzed more than 1 million headlines to create the headline analyzer, we found that three types of headlines tended to get the most traffic, shares, and search results:Combine that knowledge with a bit of advice from Upworthy to publish amazing headlines every time: Write 25 headlines for every post. Upworthy suggests that practice makes perfect—that when you write more, the last headlines you write will be significantly better than the first ones.Take that one step further and write 10 headlines for every post using each of the three best types of headlines. That’s 30 to choose from to experiment with in your social shares.You can rock the headline analyzer right in CoSchedule to write more headlines and get a feel for how likely they are to increase your social shares and clickthroughs.In a small case study, Ian Cleary of RazorSocial found that including a number in his headlines could double his number of social shares. Although not completely scientific, we’ve experienced similar results at CoSchedule and have chosen to not only try a few more list posts which tend to perform well, but also include numbers that validate why our audience should click to read the actual posts:All of those posts are among our top performers. Obviously, the content needs to follow through on the promise, but the headlines can really create a big initial draw for readers and shares.When we started analyzing what makes a successful headline—the original research that later fed into building the headline analyzer—a commonality among successful headlines was the emotional words built right into them.That research found that positive or happy emotions do a better job of encouraging social shares. It turns out, humans are naturally drawn to the anticipation of feeling a future positive emotion.You can write emotional headlines by including positive adjectives and verbs in your headlines, and focusing on a promise you’ll resolve for your readers if they simply click through to read your content. You can get started with the headline analyzer that will help you understand areas you can improve with your headline to increase its emotional connection.Slate author Farhad Manjoo researched how people read content on the Internet, finding that a majority of readers don’t make it past the 100-word mark. However, a number of those people will share the content before they leave the site.For your content, that means you have a great opportunity to help your readers promote your blog posts if you write a catchy hook for your introduction.A powerful call to action will help you turn passive readers into active sharers. Tim Soulo has a proven method that works for getting social shares from the 16% of people who read your blog posts from start to finish: Simply ask them to share.At the end of your blog posts, wrap up the conclusion with something similar to this example from Tim:“And please do me a little favor and share this guide with others, for there’s a good chance that it will help them with their blogs.”Tim found research that suggests that explaining why people should share your blog posts could help improve your acceptance rate by 94%!Graphics, images, GIFs, videos—they’re all elements of your blog posts you can optimize to encourage more social shares directly from your content. According to Buffer, visual content like that is more than 40 times more likely to result in social shares.So there are a few things you can do to make sure the time you put into creating that visual content gets you the most shares (and subsequently clickthroughs):When Neil Patel wrote a post for the CoSchedule blog, one simple sentence has stuck with me ever since:Infographics are the most socially shared form of content.Check out the marketing resources library for a few infographic examples.Slideshare found that infographics have more viral potential than other documents the tool hosts. And when Noah Kagan and the team at BuzzSumo researched 1oo million articles, they found that infographics were shared more than any other type of content—as much as 15,000 shares!Recommended Reading:You just put all of the work into creating an infographic among other awesome inline visuals in your blog posts. So optimize the experience to make it easy for your readers to share those images.We’re big fans of our friends at SumoMe who have an easy-to-use and -install plugin to resolve this challenge immediately: Image Sharer. If you’re looking for something a bit different, it looks like Shareaholic has something similar.When we first started building CoSchedule, we wanted to get more traffic from every post we published. At the time, Twitter was one of the best ways to increase our presence in the content marketing industry and promote our blog.So it was a win-win to create the Click To Tweet plugin to help not only our blog grow our following on Twitter, but yours, too.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Get Click To Tweet for absolutely free right now to encourage more social shares right inline within the context of your blog posts.Some people might like to share your blog posts directly with a specific person. A couple simple plugins can help you help them share your blog posts via email:The two plugins essentially serve the same purpose; it’s just up to you to decide which works best for the visual appeal of your blog.First, if you don’t have social sharing buttons on your blog, do it right now. There are bajillions of tools for this purpose like AddThis, SumoMe, ShareThis, and lots more.Second, it turns out that placement of social sharing buttons can also help you increase the number of social shares you receive. Luckily for you, Garrett researched this topic and found five key takeaways to help you choose where to put those buttons:Social sharing buttons are awesome for the same reasons you’d use Click To Tweet—grow your presence on your social networks and drive traffic. Win-win.Yeah, this one is specifically dedicated to the only tool I know that has this super cool functionality. Get the plugin, and when your readers highlight any text in your blog posts, they’ll easily be able to tweet their favorite quotes.Your visitors can highlight text to share it super easily. #awesomeThere’s also the added bonus that future readers will see what’s been shared before to know what parts are most popular. SumoMe says, “This drives traffic,” and since big blogs like Convince and Convert use it, I’m sure it works.When Brian Dean from Backlinko researched all of Google’s 200 ranking factors, #38 mentioned the number of internal links pointing to a page impacts a blog post’s success:The number of internal links to a page indicates its importance relative to other pages on the site.So when I read a simple idea from Aaron Agius on the Kissmetrics blog, the potential of this idea became a dual-edged sword.Aaron says that he looks at some of his most recently successful content—going back either a month to about six months—to find older blog posts to link to that are getting lots of pageviews. You could do that yourself using Google Analytics. He then uses Social Crawlytics to find hist blog posts that are getting the most social shares. From there, he includes links to his newest content from his most popular older stuff to help his audience also find his new blog posts.That’s an easy idea that seems like a win-win for multiple purposes.This idea is similar to including internal links to your new blog posts from your older content, but is much more visual in nature. Related post plugins typically display three related posts at the bottom of every blog post you write. They help keep your audience who was interested enough to read your entire blog post to continue reading other awesome content on your blog.Here are a few WordPress plugins you can use to promote your content with relevance on your existing blog:When Greg Digneo launched a brand new blog, he published a single blog post. For a long time, that post didn’t really get any traffic or turn that traffic into email subscribers.So he decided to republish that post on the SteamFeed blog. After that, his traffic increased and he started getting email subscribers.Syndicating your content really can be that easy, and is a natural way to promote your blog. Get started with these sites that are known for accepting high quality content to republish:YouTube itself has more than a billion users throughout the world—which it boasts as a third of all Internet users. You can easily turn your blog posts into videos which you can use to build a YouTube channel and also embed right into your existing blog posts.As the world’s leading search engine for videos, the work you put into keywords with your blog posts doubles for your videos to help those seeking audio and visual content to find your content.Take the work you put into blog promotion tactic #98 to determine which blog posts to optimize with video first, then simply record yourself talking through the big points of the posts themselves.You can also use Vine to record a video of what your post is about to share it on Twitter. The motion will certainly draw attention in a busy feed.How To Promote Your Blog With Social Media http://t.co/XQoqepx1EH #vine… https://t.co/Kj02DSeddu— ★Kimberly Reynolds (@KimReynolds) May 29, 2013From here, you can also use the audio-only version of your YouTube video to embed a podcast directly into your blog post. WordPress plugin Blubrry PowerPress works really well for this, and is something large blogs like Social Media Examiner have been doing to optimize their most popular posts after they publish.You can also start podcast channels for your audio content with tools like iTunes and Stitcher, which are great for reaching your audience who is on the go.Nearly every CoSchedule blog post has a specific piece of additional, contextually-specific content. These pieces are often checklists, templates, guides, worksheets, or infographics that we give away for free in exchange for email addresses.A significant majority of our more than 70,000 subscribers came from those blog-specific guides.Another advantage of creating so many upgrades, is that it’s allowed us to build a resource library for marketers to get all of the actionable information at once to help them implement new strategies quickly. If you were to do this yourself, upgrades like this work really well for sharing on sites like Slideshare, Scribd, and Pinterest.While it helps to first focus on creating super awesome content that will help you stand out, it’s a fact that publishing more consistent content will help you grow your traffic.Consistently publishing awesome content builds trust with your audience that they’ll continue to get all of your awesome advice if they just continue coming to your blog. Consistency also helps you publish more content to target more keywords your audience is searching for, which will help you grow your traffic from search engines over time.Google’s Matt Cutts reiterates these points, suggesting that quality content is what matters most, and sharing that content frequently will help you build a loyal audience.Ian Cleary sums it up really well:After a couple of weeks, why not do another promotion of your excellent content? If it’s good, it should be promoted again.Monitor your stats to see what’s working, promote your blog posts again, and use your new knowledge to improve the new stuff you’ll create.This post has a ton of information in it. The goal is to help you find any idea you could possibly imagine, and choose a few that will work best for promoting your own blog.Find three content promotion tactics from this list and use them consistently for two weeks.After you master those, keep at ’em and add in a few more. Eventually, you’ll start to see the traffic roll in, and I’d love to hear about your success.If you still aren’t sure how to promote your blog, skim through this post one more time and then follow Shia’s advice:You’ve got this! Good luck with your next blog promotion tactics. If you think of something awesome that I’ve missed, let me know in the comments and I’ll add it into the post!Click To Tweet

Glad you enjoyed the post. :)Nathan, your post just blew me away. Admittedly I already knew 99% of what you went over here (I read a lot of the blogs you linked to), but it’s great to hear it again, summed up so eloquently and in an entertaining manner by you. Sometimes you need to read things a few times in different places for them to sink in, then read them another few times for you to actually get off your ass and do them! I write the occasional longish blog post or ebook for my site http://Shotkit.com, so I know the pain involved, but nothing that comes close to this monster! And I couldn’t even spot one typo!?! Amazing stuff!I’m really impressed that with this post, you’ve taken what all the other big name content marketers have done in the past in one way or another, and added value to it by creating an even bigger, more in depth list. Brian Dean’s skyscraper technique to a T! The quality and quantity of this post actually reminded me of Kevan Lee’s work over at Buffer. Keep it up and well done again. I expect to see the social shares on this one rise up into the thousands in the coming weeks…Mark
@shotkitHi Nathan Fantastic post!! I haven’t read it all now, because I am in the middle of publishing my own blog on exactly the same subject, and promoting it!! (Yes, got distracted by the ping, and you gave this a good title.) LOL. ( Just skimmed and I’m doing it!!) And having just trawled through many on the same subject this morning, it is wonderful to have it all in one place, in such detail. And having just read Neil Patel’s ‘How to write a blog post in two hours” I suspect this took you a little bit longer than that!! So very many thanks for a great resource, and you’re going into my blog as the ultimate guide.Hey @lilymaxwell:disqus, thank you so much! Sorry for distracting you, but I hope you’ve found at least a nugget or two of helpful stuff to try out here. :)This post took a while to write… not gonna lie… but I’ve come to a new understanding with content marketing in regard to length: What matters most is telling the complete story. This one had a lot to share to make it comprehensive and actionable, and I didn’t want to disappoint!Thanks again, Louisa, and good luck with your post.Awesome, thank you for this……Hey @pallavisoft:disqus, thanks for reading!Hey Mark, thanks so much for checking this out and for the validation that we’re moving in the right direction with our content. It definitely makes me happy!Also, I loved this specific comment from ya because it’s the exact reason I chose to tackle this seemingly basic topic:“Sometimes you need to read things a few times in different places for them to sink in, then read them another few times for you to actually get off your ass and do them!”We’re in this together. Cheers, and good luck!Thank you Nathan for this wonderful and long post :)Hey @harsha_srivatsa:disqus, thanks for taking the time to peruse it! I definitely appreciate it. :)Thank you for the kind mention of OptinMonster – really appreciated :)Thanks for such a detailed post!Great post! You mentioned a couple of bookmarking and aggregation sites here that I’m not familiar with and I’ll definitely have to check them out.
And thanks for the WiseStamp mention!Hey @simchalazarus:disqus, I’m super happy you were able to find a couple takeaways you didn’t know about before! And of course, you’re very welcome for the WiseStamp mention. :)Fantastic guide on blog promotion. So many great points.Hey @disqus_cYyNiKQKyA:disqus, I’m really glad you found at least a few points that’ll help you with blog promotion. Good luck as you get started!Hi Nathan,This is amazing work. So very detailed, and so well done. Love the different sections.Even though you didn’t mention me or my site, I feel compelled to share this article with my email subscribers. It’s THAT good.Just tweeted it, and now I’m off to write that email. Great work, Nathan. Hope you are having a great Friday!– @kevinjduncanHey Kevin, thanks for reading and for sharing in multiple ways! I just discovered you, so I’ll definitely check out Be A Better Blogger. :)Thanks again!This is awesome, thanks a lot for this post! You know, I’ve become addicted to headline analyzer, it’s an integral part of my writing management now! Just out of curiousity – has anyone at CoSchedule managed to score 100 in the analyzer? My best result so far – 86! :DHey Inese! Thanks for taking the time to read through the post!Yep, we’ve seen a few scores of 100 come through on the headline analyzer… but… it’s a little tough, we know. :)The headline analyzer works best when you shoot for an “A” grade and any score above a 70.  An 86 is pretty incredible!It may also be good to consider where your competitors do their content marketing and try to find your audience there. It’s easy with tools like megaindex or any other type of backlink checker.Hey @CoSteveNrad:disqus , I’m a bit late here, but you are 100% right. It’s an interesting thought to understand how your competition is promoting their content, then do it better than they do. I know Ahrefs could help track backlinks, and Moz has a tool to help with that, too.I don’t know how you do it, Nathan. But you always write the most awesome posts! Sharing and printing this out!Hey again Aurora, thank you so much for the nice comment! I’m really glad to know you found this post useful. Hopefully, it won’t take up too much ink/paper to print. :)Never.

Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?CoSchedule doesn’t let you miss any small but important detail for making your compelling content, while also winning your readers’ hearts.So, here it goes:This blog writing checklist is great to go through every time you get ready to publish a new piece of content.It’s as clear as day that your blog has many categories, and I know you know how to choose them. Before publishing new content, make sure you choose a relevant category and tags for it. They’ll increase traffic and engagement by improving the user’s experience and helping search engines index it the right way.Things to check for:You know what you’ll be posting on your blog in the future. It’s good to understand how this particular post will relate to your future content. Write every post, keeping in mind its role for your blog, your product, and your business.It’s good to have timeless content on your blog.Things to check for:I’m not going to teach you how to choose keywords for your content or how to build a semantic core for your blog, but it’s important to make sure your keywords are relevant to your content. Try using high volume keywords (for titles, headings, and subheadings) and long-tail (for body content) keywords in your posts.You know the benefits of including long-tail keywords in your content. Don’t ignore them.Things to check for:Two out of 10 people will read your post after reading the headline.A weak headline will ruin your chances of creating content that converts. That’s why there are so many guides, tutorials, and tools to help bloggers make their headlines resplendent. Here at CoSchedule, the free headline analyzer scores quality and rates the SEO value of your headlines, making them clickable and shareable.Before publishing your content, make sure the headline is an appropriate length and that it has emotional words to capture the attention of readers, bringing you traffic and conversion.Examples of emotional words in headlines: how to, fast, easy, best, review, tips.These words will help visitors understand that the content will solve their problem and provide useful information.Things to check for:Introductions help visitors decide whether they’ll continue reading your content or not. Make your content intro attractive by writing a hook and using the APP method.The APP method in introductions:A – Agree: Pitch an idea the reader will agree with.
P – Promise: Promise you’ll show how to solve the problem.
P – Preview: Make clear what you want your readers to learn.Things to check for:Specialists still argue about the best blog length because there is no right answer. Just make sure the length of your post is enough to cover the topic and that it meets your objectives.When you use closely related words (synonyms) of your main keyword, you’ll make it easier for Google to identify and it’ll show as relevant in its search engine results pages. Google your main keyword and check the “related” terms to understand what synonyms to use. They drive a high volume of search traffic; otherwise, your post might not be mentioned in suggestions.Things to check for:“Visitors who don’t click don’t convert.” —Neil PatelLet’s face it: If you create content, your goal is conversion. It’s cool that readers like your content. It’d be cooler if they did something with it, wouldn’t it?Help them!Your content marketing will not survive without a call to action, so make sure it’s present in your post before publishing it on your blog. Plus, your conclusion should synthesize the information you shared in your content.CTA variants:Question: to increase comments.
Invitation to click or check: to increase conversion.
Invitation to read related articles: to increase a crawl rate.Things to check for:No comments needed, I suppose. We write for people, so we should try to engage with them. Then they will know what to do next: comment, share, subscribe, or download. Make sure your blog post engages with your target audience.Things to check for:Edit your content, make it sound natural and readable (1–2-sentence paragraphs work for online), add bucket brigades (aka “words and phrases that keep people on your page”), and speak the same language as your audience.A little practice: Can you find the bucket brigades in this article?While working with guest writers, be sure their stuff is free of plagiarism. A tool like Grammarly’s plagiarism checker can help you out quickly.Things to check for:Okay, one more confession from me: I really like choosing featured images for my blog posts!It’s a ritual.The featured image can both attract and frighten readers, and that’s why many bloggers sometimes get stuck. To ease the task of choosing a brilliant image for your content, keep in mind that it should be part of your design. It should also keep to the tone of your post and show your personality.Creativity is what makes us who we are. And, as Henri Matisse said, it takes courage.With no designer on board, you can try images licensed for commercial use (Creative Commons) or discover resources with free but professional looking pictures.Things to check for:I’ve learned that we should use at least one image for every 350 words of content to make it more readable and attractive for visitors, as they often do not have time or patience to read lo-o-o-ong, though interesting, articles.Images, graphs, videos, photos, quotes, tables, and diagrams—they can all help you increase the text’s value.Things to check for:In the footsteps of the previous step (sorry for tautology), make sure your visual elements meet the above features. It’s unacceptable to ignore quality, relevance, copyright, and optimization if you aim to write high-quality content.Things to check for:When powerful resources link to your content, it’s a sign for Google to rate you higher. And when you link to cool websites, it helps your readers trust you more. Links build your online reputation, so make sure to add them to your blog writing checklist before you click publish.Don’t forget about internal linking, too, since it improves your SEO and guides readers to where they should click next.Things to check for:I bet you’ve noticed that cute block invite in this post or others that invited you to get a free download in exchange for your email.We call that a content upgrade. It’s a consistent way to grow an email list. A tool as easy as LeadPages allows you to do that.Summarize key points from your post into a worksheet, template, infographic, or poster—it’s up to you what type and format you choose for your upgrades.Things to check for:Try as you will, content marketers are not able to ignore SEO factors. This mortal combat leads to nothing, as content marketing + SEO = love forever: They complement each other, helping Internet marketers be friends with Google.So, check all SEO aspects of your content before publishing.Things to check for:It doesn’t matter if you invite guest bloggers to create content for your blog or if you have an in-house team of writers—make sure you always name the author of your content.Are you the author? Perfect! Your name will sound much better than just “admin” or “webmaster”, don’t you think?Things to check for:Check your content in different browsers to see whether it looks good and works well. Big files can be hard to open or download.Things to check for:Thinking in the logical sense, bloggers won’t find it hard to determine the perfect day and time for publishing content. Holidays are a dead duck since user activity is low; so, it would be wise to set a schedule and use a marketing calendar to manage your blog and social media content.Things to check for:You’ll get a clearer picture of changes or improvements your content might need when you test it.Things to check for:Start promoting your content before you publish by sending teasers and previews to chats, forums, and communities where your audience lives. Plus, you can send it to thought leaders, asking them to review and share it with their followers after you publish it.It would be wise to have a promotion plan in advance so you can start it once the content goes live on your blog.Things to check for:Phew! That’s it.It seems your content is ready to see the light and hit the Internet. So, it’s high time to click the “Publish” button to release your post into the world.There you have it.This blog writing checklist seems heavy, but guess what?You know ALL of the steps. But you might just forget to tick them off the blog writing checklist.Let’s try to repeat this checklist in short:Be sure to tick off all the points in the blog writing checklist before publishing your content. You’ll get the results you want to achieve. You’ve got this!Click To Tweet

											There is no shortage of free editorial calendar templates available for creating your editorial calendar. Some are digital, and some are even written out on paper, but none are more prepared for the modern age than the fully digital options.The best part about using a paper editorial calendar is that it can help you start the habit of using one to plan your content marketing. Eventually, you’ll need bigger and better tools, but this is a great way to start out without making a major financial investment.When you’re ready to upgrade, a tool like CoSchedule can provide a fully digital solution, connecting your content calendar directly to your WordPress blog and social media networks. This powerful tool combines social media and content marketing scheduling with a robust productivity tool that will allow you to share tasks with your team and leave comments or critiques on their work. You can also schedule your blog posts with a drag-and-drop ease.No matter which option you consider, the real magic is in how you put it to work.Let’s dive into some of the actual nuts and bolts of using a content marketing editorial calendar.Before we get too much farther into the importance of editorial calendars themselves, it’s essential that both you and your team fully understand what content marketing really is.We often hear buzz words like “content marketing” and “editorial calendar” without fully understanding their implications.According to Wikipedia, content marketing is:“Any marketing format that involves the creation and sharing of media and publishing content in order to acquire customers. This information can be presented in a variety of formats, including news, video, white papers, e-books, infographics, case studies, how-to guides, question and answer articles, photos, etc.”In short, it’s marketing that doesn’t suck. It’s marketing that’s actually helpful to its audience. But, what does strong content marketing actually look like?Let me share a simple example.Popular grill manufacturer Weber knows how to do content marketing.A few years ago they launched a new site called “Weber Nation” that is 100% committed to helping its audience. It provides tips on grilling the best steaks, caring for your grill, and how to use a great grill to entertain your guests. While the advice works great for customers of actual Weber grills, owners of any grill brand can benefit from their information.After a recent relaunch and a new iPad app, Weber is now doubling down on its content marketing efforts.What does that tell you?Content marketing pays off.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Does this mean that everyone who visits their site will purchase a Weber grill? Probably not, but it’s likely that Weber has gained millions of new fans that could all be potential customers.It’s not about a quick sale. It’s about building an audience that trusts you long-term.That is the ultimate goal of content marketing.Most of us are familiar with the idea of a traditional editorial calendar that helps us visualize our content publishing on a calendar-like interface, but how does that differ from a content marketing editorial calendar?Could you benefit from a content marketing editorial calendar?Content marketing is highly strategic.That means you need to understand your audience, what motivates them, and what they need to hear from you in order to make a connection to your brand.A content marketing editorial calendar is essentially a planning document that gives you and your team a plan of attack for doing what Weber grills does so well. Like a traditional editorial calendar, it gives you a bird’s-eye view of what is going on. However, it should also accomplish the following:A content marketing editorial calendar gives you and your team a framework for being deliberate and intentional about how you are reaching and building trust with your audience. In part, it is a strategic marketing tool. In another way, it is a place to keep your team organized and on top of things. Both of these things are going to be very important as you move ahead.In some ways, the content marketing editorial calendar is a simple tool for making our content marketing focus count. It’s what we use to make sure we are making the most of our efforts, and many times it is a game changer for us and our audience.Here’s why:Content marketing itself is a strategic venture. It’s all about understanding what your customers want and giving it to them in a digestible way.This is a strategic goal, and it requires a strategic tool. An editorial calendar is a place where we can see a panoramic view of our content marketing strategy.We usually accomplish what we focus on. If you are focusing on building traffic and/or blog growth, then making a concerted effort to plan your content will only make reaching your goals easier. Website visits will increase when you make consistency and quality your top priority.The content marketing editorial calendar puts these goals front and center.There is something powerful that happens when we write down our plan. It becomes tangible for our team, and everyone will be more likely to stick with it as they go along.The editorial calendar will give our team the accountability it needs for building the discipline of creating content day after day.There is a good chance that our team could all benefit from better communication. Many teams use such a wide variety of tools that they often have a hard time staying on the same page.A good editorial calendar will bring them to a single place to visualize and execute their shared goals.One of the easiest ways to please your audience is to give them something they’ll love.Content that is focused on your audience’s needs are always welcome. They will appreciate your efforts.If you use WordPress as your starting point, it is easy to estimate that there are at least 2.73 million blog posts published each day. How on earth are you suppose to compete with all of that noise? It isn’t enough to simply publish content. You need more than that.Content marketing is the new SEO. Sure, many of the techniques that we used to catch the attention of search engines still work, but those search engines are getting much smarter. Search engines like Google and Bing are heavily favoring unique high quality content over the typical SEO tricks. A focus on content marketing is more important now than ever.Let’s face it: If you’re not using a calendar already, then your efforts probably aren’t working as well as you’d like. Sure, you are getting content out there, but if it’s unplanned, there is likely room for improvement.That could mean increasing efficiency.It could also mean creating content that’s more timely and strategic.Whatever the case may be, by implementing a calendar, you pivot your content into something far more intentional, and prevent your efforts from going to waste. While it certainly isn’t a silver bullet, it is most definitely a way to turn your content into a tool for growth.If you’re going to try and implement an editorial calendar with your team, you will need to be able to make the case as to how it will help you grow your traffic and improve your business.This will take you right back to some of the things we discussed earlier in the guide about the business value of content marketing as a whole. Just remember Weber grills. It may even be useful to have your entire team review what they are doing as a group.It’s cliche to say that you need to understand who your audience is, but it couldn’t be more true. Not only do you need to make sure that you understand your audience, but your entire team will need to know who they are as well. A good place to get started would be with some basic customer profiles.Who’s on your team, and how will each of them be contributing to the end product? This may sound simple, but it is an important question. If there is only one of you on your team, this step may be better spent writing down some of the tasks that will need to be completed and the order in which you will do them.Not all content is equal, so you should decide what yours will look like. The basic starting point is usually a WordPress blog, but it can vary.With a blog, however, you will give yourself the most flexibility to experiment with long-form writing, short-form writing, video, audio, and even images. You may already have a knack for a certain type of content and if that is the case, let it be your guide. You should also identify the overall topics and themes that you want your blog to cover.Think about unique content for social media as well.Determining how often you will post new content to your blog will also determine how far ahead you plan your content. This is a very subjective question. Start with a minimum of two days a week and work your way up from there. Test it and see how many days a week you should post. For some, less is more and for others it is “the more the merrier.”Most teams that use content marketing editorial calendars like to have regularly scheduled meetings to plan out their content. You can use this free guide on running the perfect content planning meeting for a suitable format.So, you’ve decided to take the plunge and start using an editorial calendar for your content marketing.You’ve made the right call.Not only will you find yourself producing better content, but you’ll also become more consistent with your publishing. In turn, it should lead to a steady increase in traffic.As you go, there are seven things that you are going to need to keep an eye on at all times.If you are doing it right, you should have an answer to these questions at all times. How does your calendar make this easier?Tools like CoSchedule allow you to assign tasks to each member on your team, making communication easier than ever. Everyone should know what they are supposed to do, and when they are supposed to do it.Discussion about a new piece of content and how to make it better should be a normal part of the process. You should have something in place that allows you to have discussions, and share thoughts with your team.Images and graphics can be important elements for great content marketing. Who will be responsible for them, and how will they be assigned? Again, CoSchedule makes this pretty easy with simple tasks that can be assigned to each team member.At our office, we use a peer review process to improve the quality of our work. Gathering feedback from our peers is a low-cost way to constantly improve the content that we create. Your calendar and editorial plan should accommodate for a step like this.One tip for users of a paper editorial calendar is to use colored sticky-notes rather that just writing on the paper calendar itself. This gives you the same drag-and-drop flexibility that you will find in a tool like CoSchedule.While it is often missed, promoting your content on social channels is also very important. It is really the best way to spread your content online. CoSchedule makes this easy, allowing you to schedule your blog posts and your social media messages on the same calendar interface.No matter what tool you choose, you need to select something that will set you up for success. I often find that those who take the time to plan, edit, and execute their editorial calendar are far more likely to succeed, and build the traffic that they need for the long run.Content marketing editorial calendars aren’t necessarily new, but you might be surprised at how many people choose to not use them. That’s their loss and your advantage. The content marketers that dedicate themselves to great planning and content creation will always come out ahead.Click To Tweet

Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Bill Bowerman was a track and field coach, as well as one of the co-founders of Nike. In the mid-1970’s, he began experimenting with his wife’s waffle maker to design a better tread for running shoes.As the story goes, he ruined the waffle maker but invented a brand new type of shoe.Work efficiently, stay organized, publish compelling content, and schedule everything for maximum growth. Sign up now for this comprehensive marketing course. At the end of the course, you’ll have a well-thought-out marketing strategy of your own. Time’s limited!Get Started Now For FreeHe later used that design to create the first Nike shoe commonly referred to as the “Nike Moon shoe.” It was the first step of many that put Nike on the map, but there is more to the story than just a great tread—wear design and a waffle maker.There’s also the story of Nike’s incredible, if not accidental and seemingly counterintuitive, approach to promoting their product.Bowerman, you see, is also credited as the man who brought about the jogging craze that swept America in the late 1960’s and 70’s. While you would think that jogging wasn’t something that needed to be invented, it wasn’t all that popular as an exercise or activity at that time. Bill’s work and research truly brought jogging out of obscurity and to the forefront of the minds of the public.After observing a jogging club in New Zealand, Bill began to understand the value of jogging as a traditional fitness routine. Bill immediately began writing articles and books about jogging and how it could be used as part of a fitness program. His first three-page pamphlet was called the Jogger’s Manual and was later expanded into a 90-page book (see below) that he wrote along with an experienced cardiologist.Jogging, the accidental content marketing showpiece by Nike founder Bill Bowerman.Along with Bill’s other involvements with professional athletes, his work helped inspire the 1970’s running boom that Nike clearly benefitted from.Was this the result of a strong marketing strategy?Or was it just a coincidence?The answer is probably a mix of  both.It would be really great to point to Bowerman’s story as a case-in-point example of content marketing at its finest, but it is difficult to do. The book was technically released before the first pair of shoes, and even before he invented the waffle tread. So, if it wasn’t true content marketing, what was it and how did it even work?Customers like great products and they like serious benefits.For them, things that benefit them personally are easy to justify. The Nike Moon shoes did this, but only because the customer was beginning to understand jogging and its benefits for their health. Bill’s secret goal wasn’t to sell shoes, he was simply promoting something that he believed in. This may not sound like marketing strategy, but it certainly should.Initially for Nike’s audience, the felt need wasn’t for better running shoes, but for a better way to get in shape.Certainly, running was already popular among kids and athletes in the 1970’s, but it wasn’t the widespread social activity that we see it as today. The growing white-collar workforce helped pave the way for social activities that included the promotion of cardiovascular health. Once the trend was ingrained, the need shifted and the “jogging shoes” themselves became the felt need.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?It’s unlikely that Bowerman’s original goal was to become a millionaire as he penned the pages of his first jogging pamphlet.That wasn’t why he did what he did. His only goal was to promote a sport and an idea that he believed in. As marketers, shouldn’t we believe in the product and the ideas we are selling? For Bowerman, it sure made marketing a lot easier. He was “marketing” without even realizing what he was up to.While jogging is pretty easy to understand, the waffle tread isn’t (at least not until you understand why Bowerman made it in the first place). His goal was to make the world’s most light–weight running shoe. He believed that this factor alone could dramatically improve the speed of a distance runner. His product worked and quickly gained the industry respect that it deserved.As the marketing landscape has changed since the 70s, so has the Nike marketing strategy.In fact, it’s remarkable how well the brand has adapted its approach to new trends and technologies without losing the core of their identity or brand voice. It’s key to understand that while their general aesthetic and tactics have changed with the times, their customer–centric messaging has remained consistent.While Nike’s early marketing strategy centered on print publications, they later went on to dominate other mediums, like television in the 80s and 90s, through modern social media platforms today.Nike hasn’t historically adopted new communication platforms for their marketing just because they’re chasing new, flashy objects. Far from it. Rather, they’ve been quick to conquer new mediums because they’re where their customers are.For example, take a look at their Instagram profile.They know their core demographic includes heavy Instagram users and so it makes sense for their brand to maintain a presence there. However, they also make sure that everything they post provides value. Rather than interrupting the flow of their follower’s feeds with flagrant sales pitches, they share motivational messaging. 04:40:08. ⠀⠀⠀ ⠀ 280 minutes. That's the amount of time it took @nani183 to not only prove that she was a runner, but to prove that she was a marathon runner. ⠀⠀⠀ ⠀ Hours after the winner had crossed the finish line, the first timer found victory in defeat. It didn't matter how daunting the distance was. She didn't care if she finished 4th or 4,000th forward. She just wanted to finish. ⠀⠀⠀ ⠀ Hanin told us, ""To be successful, you mustn't give up. Only giving up is failure."" #NRCA photo posted by nike (@nike) on Oct 6, 2015 at 11:01am PDTOther posts, like this one, subtly tie into the brand’s history while directing users to interest–specific Nike sub-accounts on Instagram. In this case, they could have simply said something to the effect of, “Check out our women’s footwear and apparel profile, and our general running product profile.”Instead, they went the extra mile and created something memorable and entertaining while staying relevant to what their audience wants to see. How to run your Fastest Mile: Step 1: Wake up hungry. Step 2: @nikewomen Step 3: @nikerunning Stay up to speed at nike.com/findyourfast.A photo posted by nike (@nike) on Aug 30, 2015 at 2:07am PDTThey say the more things change, the more they stay the same.For Nike, that has certainly remained true. Throughout their current content marketing initiatives, Nike makes sure their brand message hasn’t gotten lost over time or across channels. They focus their emphasis on creating content that promotes the benefits of their products, rather than the features. Helping their customers be better at what they love to do is still the focus of their branding and message.By moving their content marketing to the platforms where their customers are it shows that they are keeping their audience’s needs in mind while staying true to themselves. Nike’s marketing strategy has succeeded in sustaining a global brand while many of their competitors have come and gone from the spotlight.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?The history of Nike’s marketing strategy is interesting in itself. What you probably want to know at this point is how to apply these lessons to your own work.Your audience is on the Internet because they’re looking for answers to questions.One way to position your brand or blog as an authority on your topic or market is to create compelling content that addresses those concerns. Doing this well means understanding exactly what your audience’s goals are and what they want to know, and then being there to answer and give solutions when they need them.Do this well enough, and you might even turn readers into passionate brand advocates.In Nike’s case, people were looking for new ways to stay in shape. As jogging became more popular, people needed jogging shoes. Nike then smartly positioned themselves not just as a company that made shoes, but a company that helped their customers achieve their fitness goals (and just happened to make shoes that supported that goal).If you’re unsure what your audience is really looking for, try putting yourself in their shoes for a moment (no pun intended) and think beyond the scope of your product or service. Instead of thinking about your product’s features or competitive advantages, think about what goal your customer is trying to achieve. Then, be there with the information, products, and services they need to make it happen.What goal is your customer trying to achieve? Now make content, gather information, and create products that will help your customers achieve their goals.This means you need to do your research first:In terms of your blog and overall digital marketing efforts, this means that you need to figure out where your audience hangs out on the Web and how you can best reach them there. Which social networks are they most active on? Should you pay to promote your content on those networks? Does an email newsletter make sense for your customers? Could print collateral be something they’re interested in?These are big questions to answer, but the key point to remember is that its important to go where your audience is.Before considering any content distribution tactic, think about your customer’s habits, what types of content they prefer, and where they prefer to find it. Make sure you’re thorough in your approach when it comes to doing everything you can to spread your content.After all, if you’re going to try to market like Nike, then you can’t afford to settle for the status quo.Whether it’s on your blog, social media channels, video platforms, or print collateral, every piece of content you create should address customer needs.Not only that, but you need to be creating the best content on your topic anywhere on the Web.If you’re not answering questions, solving problems, being entertaining, or otherwise helping your audience be better at doing what they love, then it’s time to rethink your approach. If you’re unsure of what your customer’s real needs are, consider everything from simple keyword research to surveys to get a better idea of what kind of content you can create that they’ll find valuable.You’ll also want to consider what content creation budget and resources you have available.If this all seems like a lot of information to take in, that’s because it is. If there’s just one thing you remember from this post, however, it’s the idea of creating content that spreads, instead of content that just sells.Here’s the cool thing: Bill didn’t sell shoes; he didn’t need to.Instead, he sold jogging and all of the benefits that came with it. This should make us pause as marketers. Instead of selling our products we should be selling the benefits that products like ours promote. Running shoes matter to people who jog, so selling them on jogging is always a good first step.The same goes for us here at CoSchedule. We are a content marketing and planning tool. The more people that use content to market their business, the more copies of our software we sell. We also gain the added benefit of understanding why our customers buy what we are selling in the first place.Even in the world of content marketing, there is a lot of selling. This is fine, but it misses the real point that Bowerman so aptly understood–spread ideas, not products.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Content marketing is growing, and that usually brings fuzzy definitions that blur the lines between what something actually is and what it is becoming. It’s often pegged as a process rather than a technique, but content marketing doesn’t depend on a specific set of tools or a common workflow.It is about providing value and building trust with customers.Bowerman’s book built trust and provided immense value–a trait that naturally carried over to his products. He didn’t intend for the book to be used as content marketing, but because, with content, the lines between value and marketing are so blurry, marketing is exactly what he did.Strategy is great. Using keywords is smart. Blogging is the future. But providing customers value, no matter the medium, will never go out of style.Click To Tweet

Our need to experience shared beliefs trumps product everytime!Great Insight, Problem is most companies don’t understand the difference between sharing a kitty video on facebook to creating content that educates clients. Content strategy 101 is basically deciding do you want it to be shareable or are you adding value through an insight.Fair point! We need to keep educating others on what content marketing really is :) Thanks for the comment.Hey Garrett,Another beautifully written blog post!You guys consistently put out amazing high quality content, this article is no exception.I also love your CoSchedule plugin the interface is beautiful, extremely functional and easy to use.I noticed in several of your blog posts you utilize highlighted content to create an emphasis on specific content.Would you mind sharing with us how you create the highlighted content? Is this HTML, CSS or a plugin that you can recommend?Thanks,
MikeSo glad you enjoyed the post, Mike! Happy blogging!Received this in my email this morning. Nice take, Garrett. :)
But this would work better if marketers like us viewed it as a continuous process other than as a one-time hit. For instance: once people have bought our products through content, we should followup and showcase them as they interact with the merchandise. How happy are they? What do they want us to improve on? What things to they look forward to? Then we go back to square one and craft more content based on those answers. It’s a wonderful cycle that we should never tire of.Great work, Garrett. This is very similar to our content marketing strategy at Harvard Medical School!Happy to hear you enjoyed this post!HEY  GARRETT,

											The very first thing I do when I feel uninspired is to change my physical environment. While routine can be a great thing for personal productivity, sometimes it can kill your creative spirit. You get too used to the way things are and need a change to spark new thoughts and ideas.If that doesn’t work, maybe it’s your office space itself. Even the noise levels can influence your creativity. A study from Juliet Zhu found that a moderate noise level provides just enough distraction to encourage creative thought. Find a few different spaces that work for you, and change your environment when needed.Stanford researchers have found that walking improves creativity. On average, creative thinking increases by 60% when there is walking involved. Not only does inspiration form while walking, but then it continues to come even after you return to your desk.Think back to some of your most creative years in life. Most of us think back to our early elementary years. At the age of five, you’re at 80% of our creative potential as you’re inventing all the time.Remember the finger painting, drawing, snowmen building, tree forts, and everything else? The only difference between then and now is that back then you allowed yourself to just play. There was no plan, no set goals, just an idea and the freedom to make whatever you wanted.Give yourself room to play. Just do it. I promise you won’t regret it.Lately when I hit a creative road block, I find a new hobby to pursue in order to give my creative thinking a new perspective. For me as a graphic designer, that means playing with watercolors, hand lettering, woodworking, video, and other forms of creative mediums that I wouldn’t consider myself to be a pro at.For you, it might mean writing a short story, cooking a new recipe, or going to a new class on the weekends. Do something new to not only grow your creative background but to give a refreshing break to your usual practice.Maybe it’s not enough to change rooms or even change buildings for that matter. Maybe you just need a trip out of town to be around a new culture. Take a trip with some friends and enjoy your time together.“New sounds, smells, language, tastes, sensations, and sights spark different synapses in the brain,” according to a study done by Adam Galinsky. Even new experiences that are totally unrelated to creativity can bring new ideas and perspectives when you return to the office. Designer Stefan Sagmeister closes his studio once every seven years to do just that.Creative mentors are some of the best mentors. Mentors can range from a friend, a hero in the industry, or to someone else at your workplace. Mentors are there to listen to the problem at hand and lend their expertise to help you move forward.They can also introduce you to others that might be able to help you, making for awesome new connections and further expert advice. After all, networking is critical to finding a job you love—and one you could possibly be even more creative in.At CoSchedule, we have several team building activities, but one of my favorites is our book club. Once a week, we get together and go over a chapter in the book that we’re reading through as a team. We discuss anything and everything that we’ve found interesting. That leads to a great conversation with a variety of topics that often influences our work through actionable steps.Start with this awesome list of creative books. Find a book that’s interesting to you and learn through another’s story. You may even find blog ideas from reading.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?There’s a podcast for almost anything. Podcasts are great for car rides, but also for a music replacement while you work. Instead of listening to your favorite music stream, check out a podcast that will bring new insight as you work.My current favorite podcast is Design Observer as Debbie Millman interviews a variety of creatives from all different industries. Look to your professional heroes, and find a podcast or TedTalk that they’ve spoken for.While Pinterest is arguably the world’s largest inspiration site, there are several other places that may suite your industry best. For designers like me, that’s Dribble or Behance. For you, that might mean TechCrunch, Mashable, or Convince and Convert.Whatever you enjoy, find those key sites that you can bookmark and refer to for creative reminders when you hit your creative road block.When we hit a problem, most of us try to solve it ourselves. But sometimes the solution will only be found when you talk it out with someone else.The answer might be at the tip of your tongue or in the back of your mind, but without speaking through the problem, the solution will be left buried in our internal thoughts. 99u found some awesome facts about collaborating together that can seriously boost your creativity. Find someone nearby, talk it out, and collaborate on finding a solution.There’s a reason that history is remembered. What once was important or imaginative, might very well be the key to what you need to move forward.Ask yourself:Look back at what those before us have accomplished to see if their process can help you with yours. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel, you just need to make it better.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Let me repeat, borrow ideas, not copy. As French author François-René de Chateaubriand wrote, “The original writer is not he who refrains from imitating others, but he who can be imitated by none.”Sometimes you just need to start somewhere, look to what you know, and then see how you can make it better. Even Steve Jobs started with the idea of the personal computer from a Xerox prototype and then ran with it.“Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.” That’s what Austin Kleon said in his awesome book, Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative.And it’s true!Collect as many ideas as you possibly can so that you can use them as a reference later on. This might take shape in a Pinterest Board, Evernote folder, or physical collection of clips and snippets. But any way you do this, it’s incredibly important to start collecting now. Start now, and watch it grow.Salvador Dalí once said, “All of my best ideas come through my dreams.”Whether to get inspiration from your dreams or to simply take a break and clear you mind, having a good night’s rest can be key to creativity. Believe it or not, we need to have a balanced life outside of work so that when it comes time to think, we’re fully prepared both mentally and physically.Eat well, exercise, and get some sleep.Theodor Seuss Geisel, a.k.a. Dr. Seuss, was challenged by his publisher to write a book using only 50 words. Green Eggs and Ham was the result.Today, we can fall into creative fatigue not because there’s not enough choices out there, but because there’s just too many! Try to limit yourself in some shape, way, or form to challenge the way in which you’re thinking.50 words was quite a limitation for Dr. Seuss, but that very limitation made a masterpiece! New connections will be formed when the clutter of choices is eliminated.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Not only can you make mistakes, but I’m giving you permission! Please, by all means, make mistakes. If you aren’t taking risks, then you aren’t making mistakes, which means you’ll never reach that new awesome idea that you’ve been waiting for.Do I need to remind you of all our heroes who failed before they found their success? Make mistakes, fail, fail fast, and then keep going.“Creativity is just connecting things,” Steve Jobs said. If connecting familiar ideas isn’t working, try connecting opposite or unrelated ones.This is often the equation comedians use for humor, and if it works for them, why not you? Some of the most successful ad campaigns I’ve ever seen have been made possible by connecting an unrelated emotion or story to the one they’re trying to convey. Opposites can be very powerful, so try them out.Take a notebook with you on your morning commute and start sketching. Fill it with quotes, doodles, a record of what you did that day. Write a story!Let this notebook be your place to play and relax while on your trip to and from work. Athletes use this similar ‘warm up and cool down’ approach in their daily workouts. To heighten your creativity, treat this notebook like your personal workout. Warm up with sketches on your way to work, and cool down with doodles on your way home.And remember, don’t overthink it. Just let your mind wander and play. An idea notebook will really show you how to be creative throughout daily life.Sometimes, we can hit a creative road block simply because we’re asking the wrong question or not asking any questions at all.When we assume we know how to solve the problem, we ignore the several other possibilities that could be the idea we’re looking for. Instead of taking the assumed, common approach, start by asking questions and let that direct you to your creative inspiration.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Austin Kleon believes, “Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing.”Yep, that’s right. Take some time to do nothing, nothing at all. Every task at hand needs a break, no matter how great it might be. Relax, enjoy yourself, and come back to it later. Time away might be exactly what you need in order to come back completely restored and inspired.There you have it! 20 different ways on how to be creative when you feel absolutely stuck.As Austin Kleon says, “It takes a lot of energy to be creative.” We need to not only protect our energy, but use it well.Whether it’s sketching on your commute, taking a trip with friends, giving yourself permission to play, or doing absolutely nothing—try out different ways to find inspiration and see what works best for you. What works today might not work tomorrow, so keep your creative mind alive and open to new possibilities.Click To Tweet

							Ashton is CoSchedule's graphic designer who takes written content, throws it through an unbelievable design brain, and makes everything we do even better. Photographer, designer, artist.If you want to build and execute a data-driven, agile content strategy to get massive results from your content marketing, this post is for you.Need help creating more effective content, more easily? Download these 21+ marketing templates, each designed to help you do your best work now.Great list! I think I rely on #20 a little too much ;)Haha, thanks David! As with everything, balance is key :)Great post, Ashton—Thanks for sharing these tips!I’m particularly fond of number 15, “Embrace Constraints.” I’ve found that too many options can be paralyzing, whereas few options provides me with a structure and framework to build from.Number 17 is a great idea, too. Reminds me of Einstein’s concept of Combinatory Play, which is basically where you combine two seemingly unrelated things to create something original.No problem, Logan! Thanks for reading. I think #15 is often forgotten, too, while it can be extremely helpful to simply limit ourselves. #17 is another rare one. I’ll have to read more about Combinatory Play. Thanks for sharing your knowledge!Great ideas. And I can really use them TODAY because I need a topic for a blog post!  Thanks for collecting and sharing these good ideas.What great timing! Glad I can help :)With #20, I wasn’t really thinking that by doing nothing is one way to boost creativity. At times, I think doing nothing is being lazy, which is a mistake. Thanks, Ashton for your wonderful article, worth-sharing to creatives. From the Philippines xoxoYes, you’re exactly right! With everything, balance is key. For those creatives like myself, it can be really challenging to simply sit back and relax as I’m always working on something (because I love what I do!). Doing nothing, can be a great reminder…. just not if it becomes laziness ;) Glad you enjoyed the post!Hi, Ashton! At least you love what you’re doing. Ugh, my life sucked up. Doing online work what I really don’t like and well, underpaid — no options of earning income. I do blogging but with lesser traffic. That makes me much more stressed this time. Sad face.I agree with this. Although at no point ever does someone do nothing, we’re always doing something just because it’s not work related. I think family time and time spent away from the computer helps you be more proactive during working hours.But sometimes people will think that we’re lazy just because they see us just sleeping or resting most of the time. They will never understand that we’re not really just resting but thinking like how could we possibly earn more income than we earn today like my situation right now. Sucks.If that’s the case then you should try to care less about what others think. If you know you’re not a lazy person, then that’s all that matters. If you have a passion for something then you stick to it and keep that endeavour attitude, the results will come one day. Remember, when life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade.Yeah! You’re right, Joshua! It’s time for me to care on what I really want to do with my life without really caring about what others think about me. Though this is hard to do. Sad face.Hi Ashton, great post. I particularly like point #4. Have you come across Matt Cutts try something new for 30 days? That helped me a lot, I started going for a jog every morning for 30 days, this motivated me to complete the challenge and since then it’s stuck. This has a wholly positive effect on my working life as I’m more creative and proactive.Hey Joshua, thanks for reading! I haven’t read Matt’s stuff yet, so I’ll have to do that! I suppose 30 days is what’s needed for a habit right?! Love that concept.This is a great article Ashton! It is really hard to think of doing something about your work when you’re not inspired. Especially if you are a marketer or a businessman that has a blog to update. With the tight schedule and tiring job, your mind is boggled and can’t concentrate on what to post on your blog ─ not inspired at all. Taking a walk will surely help us think of something to put on our blogs. Just relaxing our mind and our whole being. Thank you for sharing!Thanks for reading, Barbara! I completely agree! The daily tasks can become routine, and that’s exactly why we need some play in our lives to keep us creative. Cheers!Such a great list here Ashton. Definitely feeling uninspired today and this got me back on the right track! Thank you.Thanks Jordan! We all reach that point, so I’m glad these ideas we’re able to help! Make time for what inspires your creativity and keep up the good work!© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,8
2015-11-23,http://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-run-a-successful-blog/,How To Run A Successful Blog That Will Boost Your Following,"The free blog post headline analyzer will score your overall headline quality and rate its ability to result in social shares, increased traffic, and SEO value.There are a few blogs on the Internet. A few of them have instructions on how to do content marketing and blogging the right way.And by a few, I mean millions.As a content marketer, you’re overloaded with information. Even if it’s helpful information, you can’t process all of it. Research has shown that when you’re faced with an information overload, the viewer tends to glaze over and not see the actual information. You instead look for patterns. This is why zebras value their stripes and paint horses value their splotches—it’s hard for the predator to discern the individual animal behind the pattern of the vast herd.That’s fine for herbivores who want to live to see another day, but what about for us bloggers? What if you picked out the pattern that all “blog headers should be blue” because you noticed a plethora of blue header graphics and can’t really remember anything else?Sometimes you need a distillery. (No, I do not mean you need to go get a drink).In this post, we will boil down to the very basics of blogging. We’ll enforce three core blogging concepts and will show you how to run a successful blog. Let’s forget hedging our bets so you can get a clear picture instead of a blurry pattern.Click To Tweet

											Fact: You have to write blog posts if you’re going to blog.Real-world Realization: Writing is hard work. It’s not shovel-ready work, it’s not elbow grease, but it’s work that strains your brain.Writing successful blog posts means you’re facing several decisions about what and how you will create the copy. While there’s truly no wrong approach to how you’ll resolve these decisions when you are sincerely trying to do your best, this post is all about distillation. Let’s reduce all of those legitimate options and cut down to the bare bones of blogging.Your post should be about one specific thing, and then three things related to that one thing.In other words, it’s about the idea of core content and peripheral content. If you blog about baking, that is your core. You’ll spend most of the time writing about the recipes and things you bake. Three related topics to that core content might be talking about handy kitchen tools, ingredient reviews, and new cookbooks.Your post should be about something you love and believe in. If either of those are lacking, writing will not be enjoyable work; it will be dreaded drudgery.Your blog post should be specifically focused, not generally. You are not writing about every kitchen mixer, but a specific kitchen mixer. You are not writing about everything you can do with email marketing, but about a specific email marketing technique.You might have lost specific focus if:Everyone has their own opinion, and there are many different right answers to the question of blog post length. But let me give you one to start from: 1,000 words (give or take a hundred).In those 1,000 words, your blog post should contain:Your blog post should have:Here is an example:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Give your reader lots of white space by keeping your paragraphs to no more than three sentences each.Having headings, lists, and white space is all about people being able to scan your blog.You must have at least one image.That image should:Dig Deeper: If you want to set yourself up with a mini course in foundational blog writing techniques, here are my favorite posts on the matter and methods I use myself:Stupid question: If a tree falls in a forest, and no one is around to hear, does it make a noise?More useful question: If a tree falls in a forest, and no one is around to hear, does anyone care?Coming up with a content marketing promotion strategy is easily forgotten about for anyone who is more focused on creating blog content, abhorrent of self-promotion, or simply too distracted with the joys of writing to bother letting anyone know that there’s also publishing going on.You tell people you know are interested and any you think might be interested.The people you know are interested are those who:The people who might be interested are those who:You already know this.It’s easy to forget there are five obvious audiences (and one possible audience) who want to hear from you. Sometimes it’s easy to spend too much time building a promotion plan that is email or social media heavy.For every blog post you publish, alert each of these known/potential audiences.Telling people you created new blog content is a lot less awful if you’re not a jerk about it.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?When you consider people to be part of a relationship between you/your content instead of merely receiving a subscription or notice of publication, you won’t slip into bad and spammy behavior.To honor the relationship nature of people instead of the recipient nature:I bet you thought the third step was going to be something like “engage.”Well. Surprise.Engagement is sort of in promotion, anyway, in that relationship part.The focus here is on blogging. Not social media. Not marketing. And beyond talking to people who comment on your blog post, I’m not going to pursue engagement of your audience in this post.When it comes to blogging, the two most basic things you can do are create the content, and then let people know you did. And then, by making those two things a habit, you up your chances of having a successful blog.In the great tradition of sharing thought-provoking quotes from successful people, quotes which necessarily contradict each other because no one works in the same way, I wrote a post about some of the habits of successful writers.The best habit isn’t what Ernest Hemingway did. It’s what you do to get things done.How do you get things done? To help understand yourself a bit better, ask:I can tell you how I do things and how people say things ought to be done, but what really matters is how you get things done. The best habits are the ones that produce results for you. Figure out how you get results. Build those habits, even if the productivity world is telling you that you’re wrong.Behance has some good ideas on how to make a habit out of the behavior you want to solidify.It takes at least 21 days to form a habit, or so the habit mythology goes. Let’s raise the bar and say that you need to do something for a month before moving onto acquiring a new habit.So let’s review it all, and tell you what you already knew (a hundred times over) but felt overwhelmed by:

							Julie R. Neidlinger is a writer, artist, and pilot from North Dakota.

Download these 21+ marketing templates, each designed to help you do your best work now.I don’t know if I can call my blog successful, but the soul searching paid off. I finally found the direction I want to give to it and how I can make it useful to my readers. Since then everything is falling into place and writing has been much less of a burden.
I cannot wait to have more time to catch up with all the blogs I missed here.That’s fantastic, Debbie! It’s wonderful when you find your pace and the struggle is gone; blogging is fun again!Hi Julie, and thank you for a terrific post, crammed with encouragement, wisdom, and practical application. Could you explain how to add my URL to my photos on my blog? Do I make that part of a caption? Or type it into the title when I upload it in my media library?Hi Laurie, it would depend on the blogging platform you are using. If you are using WordPress, you will see the option to include it with the picture when you upload (or when you click on the inserted image to edit it). But, if you are using a blog platform without that, my own practice is to put the caption beneath the image, in italics and a lightly smaller font to set it apart from body copy. Hope that helps!Hi Julie, thanks to your post I finally know what to do with my blogging issue.Well, you just made my day. I’m glad something I wrote helped you out!Wise words.  You definitely presented “a distillery” (not sure that’s grammatically right but I get the point – you distilled the essence of a good blog and presented that essence).  I will keep this post for reference when I get confused about what I’m trying to do.  Thanks!Glad this “blog cheat sheet”  was helpful. And I’m all for inventing words; distillery it is.Great post! I’ve re-blogged it. I learn something new from every post I read at CoBlogger.Great summary, Julie. The habit part is key. I write up a storm for my clients, but fall down on my own posts. It’s terrible!A very insightful post Julie! I enjoyed reading your work. On the business side, these tips will help a lot of marketers who have blogs with a small amount of audiences. The content of your blog is always important. Make a content that is exciting and will catch the audience’s interest to read your blog. Having more audiences will help your blog and your business to be promoted. Thank you for this great post Julie.

											First off, this post is geared toward beginners or those trying to build better social media habits. Some of you might not have even signed up for an account on a social network yet. If that’s the case, I’d recommend starting with just a few high performers. You can always branch out later.If your niche is crafts, foods, lifestyle, or visual arts, get accounts on Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram.If your niche is marketing, business, or a professional presence, get accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.This isn’t written in stone; you’ll probably find as you get going that other networks will be valuable, too. These are just basic guidelines to get started.Remember how we suggested that multitasking didn’t really work? You can’t do everything at once. In the same sense, doing all of your social media activities every day isn’t going to work so well, particularly if you’re just getting started or trying to establish good habits.Breaking your social media management into daily, weekly, and monthly segments will help you manage your time better.There are some things you should do every day if you want your social media efforts to be successful:Rather than being constantly distracted throughout the day, set aside three or four specific times that you’ll hop in and do these things. Otherwise you’ll find yourself never leaving your social media accounts, and you won’t get your other content marketing done.Do these three activities at 8 a.m., 11 a.m., 3 p.m., and 5:30 p.m.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Many content marketers will give you a long list of things to do every day when it comes to social media management. You may be able to pull it off down the road when you’ve established your own habits and rhythm. I’m going to suggest that, when starting out, you set some of those activities as weekly activities so you don’t feel overwhelmed and give up. So, choose a different day of the week for each of the following:Here’s an example schedule:Pick a schedule that works for you. The key is to take some of the load off the daily obligations and break it up over a week. Instead of having 15 things to do for social media every day, you have the quick daily schedule of three tasks at four points during the day, and a block of time for a weekly duty.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Every month, you should be:Do this at the start of the month. Check your stats and analytics to see how well your social content is performing. Look for trends in traffic, topics, networks, time and date shared, and type of content shared. Discover what’s working and what isn’t. For a beginner, I’m going to put this on a monthly basis. As you get better at social media management and find you can handle the extra load, I’d recommend moving it to a weekly basis.Actionable Takeaways:If you’re running ads on social media networks, you’ll want to review their performance each month. Paid advertisement is definitely not “set it and forget it”.Actionable Takeaways:Recommended Reading:Set (and change) your social media goals according to what your monthly analytics review is telling you. Maybe you need to be sharing more (or less), or at a different time. Create A/B tests to run the next month that you can use for better decision making the next round.Actionable Takeaways:Recommended Reading:Plan your upcoming monthly content marketing in regards to social media. Think of the blog content you’ll be creating, any campaigns or themes, and plan and create that content that you’ll be publishing. Get it on the calendar.Actionable Takeaways:Recommended Reading:Click To Tweet

											First, a tangent: There are many factors at play here that made these 1,000 blog posts successful.I could name off a bajillion questions about the quality of the content. So this data analysis focuses purely on the headlines themselves and not the context of the content behind them. That’s why there are a few things to keep in mind:But, it’s worth mentioning that from this data sample, an average blog post received:So there are definitely lessons to learn since only two of 10 people who see your headlines actually click through to read your blog posts.An overwhelming amount of headlines in this study were generic—meaning they didn’t contain any value proposition or helpful information to connect with the readers’ emotions. I’ve heard headlines like this called label headlines before, and they look something like this:Wedding BudgetsWhile generic headlines work, you could improve this headline even more to connect with an emotion that could generate even more social shares:How To Stretch Your Wedding Budget To Make It The Perfect DayIt’s not an exact science, but your audience gets a better feel for what they’ll discover after clicking through to read your content while connecting to an emotional need to stretch a smaller budget. The data we used to build the headline analyzer suggests the latter example here should perform better than the original for increasing social shares and clickthroughs.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?About 11% of the blog posts in this study began with numbers in the headlines. Some of these were list posts, some mentioned completing tasks in a specific amount of time, and some included steps.There is something about data that draws people into these headlines—setting an expectation and promising a quick solution to a problem.Data from Conductor and cited through Backlinko suggests that headlines with numbers get 36% more clickthroughs than those without, and this new data seems to complement what Conductor found, suggesting that headlines with numbers get more shares than those without.But Conductor data suggests that odd numbers tend to perform better. Data from this study suggests the opposite.Of these popular headlines that contained numbers, 49 contained odd numbers while 58 of them contained even numbers. The most popular numbers used in headlines were:Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Those numbers you just read about? Most of them were part of list posts. Yep, they still work.It was surprising to find only 4% of the headlines in this sample contained how to in them. But even with just a small amount, these still performed super well among the larger group.While you might have the greatest headline and content in the world, it won’t drive shares on Pinterest unless you complement your blog post with awesome visuals.The average blog post from this study received more than 300,000 Pins on Pinterest because they included visual content. Even if they contained a generic headline, these blog posts had to have awesome visuals to drive those shares.DIY appeared in 5% of the headlines. That’s even more than how to! A similar percent contained the word minute, taking an idea and letting the reader know how easy using the information from the blog post would be:$5 + 30 Minute Wooden Growth ChartSome of the blog headlines also focused on helping readers do something with the tools they already had, without the need to buy anything new. Overall, it seems that in no matter what industry—or even business-to-business or business-to-consumer—there is a common need to save time and money.Only two headlines in this study used questions to inspire curiosity. That runs contrary to other data we’ve analyzed that shows that question headlines are one of the top-performing types of headlines.Essentially, this means there is some opportunity for you to use question headlines to stand out from your competition.When we started analyzing our Twitter data to help us improve every tweet we send, we found that open-ended questions tend to get more clickthroughs than other headline ideas. Sometimes, that disparity hit as much as 32%!So appeal to the fear of missing out in your social messages by sharing headlines like…Does Your SEO Content Strategy Focus On Buying Intent? Get Customers, Not Just Traffic.…to encourage more clickthroughs to your content.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?A few of the blog posts had unusual headlines that nearly focus on the absurd to inspire clickthroughs and social shares:135 Easy Elf on the Shelf IdeasThat is a ridiculously high number, meaning folks looking for that information probably only need a single source to answer all of their questions on the topic.Those examples made me think of the best types of blog posts that help you grow traffic. When Aman Thakur explored the topic, he found:Nearly 5% of all the headlines in this sample contained the word easy, another 4% used you, and 2% contained best. It looks like it works to focus on providing the best possible information to use as easily as possible all while targeting your audience directly in second-person narrative.Don’t be afraid to test lesser-used adjectives to inspire some interest in your blog posts:Stop Searching For A Magical Exercise RoutinePulling information from previous research, check out this huge list of 500+ emotional words that will help you write better headlines with some uniquely powerful words.The average score of these posts is a 32 with the headline analyzer, getting a C- grade. Woops.That’s why even when you’re publishing really great content, we decided to help you write better headlines by integrating that headline analyzer directly into CoSchedule so you can see your score, write a few more headlines to publish every blog post with a more emotional headline, and even get inspiration for sharing alternative headlines on your social networks.You can get started with the free headline analyzer now, and when you want to plan awesome content, just know it’s waiting for you in your marketing calendar right in CoSchedule. ;)One of the things that’s most useful with this data is checking out the structure of successful blog headlines to give you new headline ideas. Consider this a way to find new angles for your blog posts and get a bit of inspiration from headlines that have already performed extremely well.This is going to feel like a lesson of filling in the blanks. Here’s what you need to know as you get started with your headline ideas:Alright, some of that might sound scary to those of you who didn’t pay attention in grammar class (you know who you are).

Here’s a glimpse of the most-shared headlines on the CoSchedule blog:I recommend taking some advice from Upworthy as you get started with these headline ideas: Write 25 headlines for every blog post. Not only can you use all of the data and examples from this post for inspiration, that practice will help you write better headlines every time—and consistently.When I started writing at least 25 headlines for every post, our traffic started taking off slowly but surely. We were able to reuse some of the best headlines in our social messages and email A/B tests. I’m telling you that this works—and that’s one of the reasons we built the headline analyzer right into CoSchedule to help you get the most out of every blog post you publish.Good luck, and tell me all about your headline journey!

I’m excited to see it integrated right into CoSchedule!Hey Karen, thanks for reading! I hope you enjoy the headline analyzer. Would love to hear back from you in a couple of months on your progress. :)I use the CoSchedule headline tool but I seem to get conflicting information. Most of the headlines above are 5-12 words long which makes sense to me, although I often read suggestions about creating headlines that read How to X Like Y without Z or somesuch descriptive thing that ends up having 15 or 16 words in it. An example: 10 Funny Things Research Revealed in 2014 About Pregnancy That You Need to Know Today. The headline sounds compelling, but anything over about 10 words and the headline tool, says, “whoa, girlie, you’re writing a book there, back off, eh!” Are those headlines just exceptions to the rule? Is shorter better or are the formula headlines worth following? Thanks.Hey @suzatonic:disqus, that is a really great question—thanks for reading and taking the time to ask.If you’ve read CoSchedule posts recently, you’ll notice our headlines are long. Yep, way longer than what the headline analyzer suggests as the best length (six words, by the way). We focus on the same things you’re talking about—emotion, connecting your thought to perceived value gained from reading the post.I really like to look at the score more than anything else, personally. While going over six words has a negative effect on your score, more powerful words will improve it.Does that make sense? You’re doing this right! :)Great post, Nathan. Kudos for disclosing that these top posts scored an average of just 35 with the headline analyzer. I use it pretty religiously and will continue to, but this affirms that I should take it with a grain of salt. One of the reasons I enjoy using it is it does force me to brainstorm through potential titles and try to best my score, sort of like a game, which as you mentioned is quite valuable. I didn’t love that when discussing a group of top-performing blogs, their social share metrics were presented as for “the average blog post,” when really that group was anything but average. A bit misleading. But loved the post, read it all, it made me think and gave me some new good ideas! Thanks for sharing it.Hey Kirsten! Thanks for reading and for the insightful comment.I hear you on the average score of 35—was a bit shocked to discover that stat. And on the idea of averages, too, you have a good point. I did sift out the top 1,000 posts first, then averaged them just to give you a bit of clarity that these posts were waaaay beyond average (even when they, themselves, were averaged)!I’d say you’re on the right track with your headlines. :)Love it, too cool, and that is super handy to have ready to rock and roll for your content. Even if it’s just a quick visual score.Glad you enjoyed the post and thanks for commenting! :) Have a good day!“The #1 Question That a Reader Had from Reading Nathan’s Post.” Great piece. Following up from Kirsten’s point: I use the headline analyzer all the time and strive to score 70 or more. But in this article (point #10), you indicated that the top headlines scored 32, a C-. Perhaps I misunderstood. Do all the great headlines you write about here score high? Can we keep using the headline analyzer exclusively, or do we also need to follow the samples you give if we want to improve our hit rate and share rate? I am looking for a take-away for both myself and for giving to my editorial/writing team. Thanks!Hey @douglas_goldstein:disqus, this is a really good question, thanks for reading and for the critical thought here.The headline analyzer is a tool, so there is always room for human eye to improve what a tool sets out to accomplish. That said, the words we chose to include in the headline analyzer were chosen because of data that says those words are likely to increase your success.Take your score with a grain of salt. Some of the headlines in this example may not immediately score well when you enter your keyword and value proposition into them. But adding emotional adjectives and verbs where possible will definitely improve your score, which should help you capture more audience interest.Does that help? I appreciate you reaching out!I don’t know what it is about list posts that I enjoy reading so much, maybe its because the information feels more palatable due to the bulleted nature of lists. I find that when I post blogs for clients lists are almost always their #1’s.Thanks for reading and commenting, Sheena! Yup, in a lot of the data it shows that lists posts are some of the most successful posts. Keep up the great work and have a good day!This was an interesting read. I will have to test what works for me. I see that Douglas Goldstein has already written about something I that struck me. I am quite confused by the conflicts with recommendations here and the results in your headline analyzer. Given below are the first 11 headlines in this write up followed by the score – in square brackets like this [xx] – by the headline analyzer. The range is 39 to 72, with 58 being the median score. That is why I feel that the recommendations in this write-up is not consistent with your headline analyzer. I am very interested in your thoughts on my observation.I would like to acknowledge that one of my LinkedIn blog posts has a #1 Google ranking for the search term “ERP Scope Management.”  I believe the headline has a impact on the traffic and the Co-Schedule headline analyzer helped me write it.Easy Pull Apart Pizza Bread (Our Favorite Recipe) [51]

											Using images in your blog posts will drive traffic to your content. That’s no secret.It’s important to understand how many images you need to use. Slapping on a featured image and the occasional screenshot isn’t the best strategy.Luckily, Canva and BuzzSumo came together to do some deep research into how many images you really need. And, they found some interesting data:From looking at more than 1,000,000 articles, they found that using an image every 75–100 words increased the social shares of an article by at least 30%.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?So, simply put, for every 1,000 words you write, you should aim for 10 images.But there is one caveat here you need to be aware of:These images need to be relevant.You can’t just stuff your post with images to fill the quota. Instead, these images need to be relevant to what you’re writing about.If you’re unsure, stick to:And, for bonus points, add captions to your images. They’re read 300% more than your body copy, which makes them an excellent way to boost your on-page time.As you know, more social shares = more traffic.Recommended Reading:Okay, I’m not going to send you on a whole SEO link building campaign. Because that’s another topic for another day. So don’t worry about getting people to link back to your site right now.But right now, you can link to other reputable sites to drive traffic to your blog. It’s as easy as backing up your points with data or referencing scientific studies, including articles at the end of your article, or even simply linking back to an authority site when you quote them.This has two brilliant traffic-driving implications:Let’s look at each of them in a little more detail…Google wants to rank sites based on facts. And, with good reason. Nobody likes searching and finding themselves on a spammy site that provides zero value to them.In order to do this, Google uses a metric called trust flow. Without getting into too much detail, trust flow measures how accurate your facts are and where you get your data from.If you’re linking to sites that are already authorities and are on Google’s good side like news sites, they’re more likely to trust the content you produce.While this isn’t a direct way to drive more instant traffic, it could improve your search rankings in the long term. That makes it invaluable.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?In the words of Jeff Goins, “It’s not who you know, it’s who you’ve helped.”And by linking out to these authority sites, you’re helping them. You’ve given them something valuable that plays a big role in their success.If you reach out to them and let them know that you’ve linked to them, there’s a really good chance they’ll share your content with their audience. And that means you get more exposure and traffic.But, that’s not the only benefits for you. Consumers see bloggers as one of the biggest influencers in how they choose a product. In fact, according to Technorati research, 31% of people say they’ll use a blog to choose a product.If you can get these bloggers to tweet, share, and interact with you (or feature them on your site) they’re more likely to buy into your brand, which will drive traffic back to your content.Interviews seem to have become the realm of Podcasters and YouTube stars.But, why?Getting influencers (people who have made a name for themselves in your niche) to appear on your blog is a direct brand endorsement. That’s powerful because 92% of people say they trust this earned media more than any other form of advertising.So when they see a person they know sharing or tweeting about your blog, they take notice. Even if it’s just to promote their own interview.Take a look at this interview with Seth Godin from Contently. It’s been shared by over 11,000 people:That’s between 5,000–9,000 more shares than their other top shared articles for the year:Now, your interview may not blow up this much. But if you choose the right influencer and create a good interview, the exposure you get can be incredible.Boost Blog Traffic wrote an excellent article on how to get influencers to interview with you right here.You’re probably using a tool like Yoast SEO, right? So you can put keywords into your posts and get to a good level of SEO for the piece of content.Now, there is nothing wrong with optimizing it this way. After all, keywords are what people search for.But, you probably do a little Keyword Planner research and come up with a two- or three-letter keyword like:Because they get a good amount of searches and they seem to fit the bill. But, if you’re not an SEO wizard by trade, you’re going to struggle to rank anywhere near the top results for keywords like this. Unless you’re already an established authority.That’s where long tail keywords come in.By switching to long tail keywords, Neil Patel managed to go from 89,000 visitors per month to 174,000 people per month in a 14-month period. That’s a 91% increase in traffic from search engines.If you’re not sure what a long-tail keyword is, here’s a quick definition:Now, you can swap out the word ‘buy’ there for ‘learn’ and it’s exactly the same for your content.The longer it gets, the more specific it is. The more specific it is, the better you can optimize your blog for it because there will naturally be less competition.This is really specific to your niche and your site, so there’s no one-size-fits-all way to find these keywords. However, you can use tools like SERPed or AdWords to analyze your short keywords and build them into long-tail keywords.The reason your content (or blog or platform) exists is for one reason:To help people answer their questions.Each piece of content you create answers a question in your niche. No matter how big or small, that’s the purpose behind it. And you’ve probably got a lot of answers to a lot of questions by now, haven’t you?Instead of hoping people stumble across your answers, it’s time to go straight to the source and put your well-researched and expertly written content in front of the people who are asking all the questions.Enter Quora.If you don’t know what Quora is, it’s a question and answer site. And, to you, it’s now a powerful traffic-driving tool.The smart marketers over at WishPond have used it to build up to 27,000 views a month from their Quora answers.And it’s pretty simple to do.Let’s say you run a copywriting or content marketing blog. You’d search the broad topic that you blog about, and ‘follow’ it:Then read through a few pages of questions to find ones that:Like this one right here (the comment from Sarah is the top answer right now)…Click on it, and take a look at what they’ve actually asked:Then answer the question in your way, giving plenty of value throughout. Think of it like a mini blog post where you can link back to yourself throughout, without them needing to click the link to get the value.Like this one that starts with a link:Has a meaty, value-filled middle. And then finishes with a link back to their site:This particular answer has 26,000 views. That means even if only 1% of people click that link, there’s still 2,600 people who have clicked through to their site!If you answer questions regularly and with enough detail, the traffic you can drive really has no limits.There you have it.Five easy-to-remember and implement traffic-driving strategies that you can use right now. Here they are again, in short:Now, I have a challenge for you.Pick one of these strategies and commit to doing it every month. Comment on this post with your choice. Then track the results. It could be the influx of traffic you’ve been waiting for.Click To Tweet

For the uninitiated, these are the words Link (the main protagonist) hears from a shopkeeper who grants him his first sword before embarking on a treacherous quest to rescue Princess Zelda. Shortly after, the player is faced with overwhelming challenges, scarce resources, and no single path to victory.Sounds like many of our first journeys into content marketing.In fact, if you’re just getting into the content marketing game as a solo blogger or lone in-house practitioner, you can probably relate to Link more than you might realize. That’s because squaring off against better-financed competitors across a complex content marketing landscape can often feel like warding off monsters while wandering the desert with little more than your wits. Executing a comprehensive content strategy while under pressure to deliver results without an ideal toolset or a roadmap to victory can be stressful (and less fun than any video game).Fortunately, it ‘s possible to succeed at content marketing on a limited budget. The key is to think like Link by making the most creative and efficient use of what you do have until you’ve got the strength to go toe-to-toe with bigger adversaries. To get there, you’ll need to generate maximum mileage with minimal effort while working smarter instead of harder. The only difference is you’ll be solving business problems instead of puzzles and slaying your competition instead of vicious monsters along the way.Take this guide and let’s begin.Click To Tweet

											If you’re working with an existing website or blog, especially one that has been around for awhile, then your first step is to figure out exactly what content you already have (and how much of it is still useful). Think of it like giving your wardrobe a solid spring cleaning, with boxes for things you’d like to keep, patch up or update, and things to get rid of.An easy way to keep track of your progress is to create a simple spreadsheet. There are a number of ways it can be laid out, but at a basic level, it should list all your URLs, page titles, and the following columns:If you’re working with a large website that has a lot of URLs, a free downloadable tool called Screaming Frog may help speed up this process. This desktop website crawler can be used to quickly generate a list of all the URLs that exist on your domain, which can be helpful for discovering broken links or old pages you might have forgotten about.If you’re short on time, keep in mind that your emphasis here should be on balancing speed with relevancy. Focus on posts or URLs that have the highest relevance to your readers to keep, and those that are objectively outdated or no longer relevant to get rid of. It’s also important not to burn yourself out while sorting through the URLs on your domain. This is especially true if your site features tens of thousands of pages (which is common with e-commerce websites, in particular).If you’re ready for a more in-depth guide on how to perform a content audit, take a look at this thorough guide from Moz.Once you’ve got a clear idea of what (if anything) is already on your blog or website, your next step is to determine which channels you’re going to create fresh content for. Beyond your site and your blog, you’ll also want to consider which social media are best for your needs. You may also want to consider whether other content channels make sense within your overall strategy.With so many different platforms available, it’s easy to start feeling some option paralysis. If time is at a premium, try to focus only on the channels that will both deliver the most impact for your business and that you have time to comfortably invest in. Concentrated efforts in a few areas may yield stronger returns than splitting your attention between more platforms than you can manage.Choose the right platforms: In most cases, a Facebook page will be essential. Twitter is also a must-have for most bloggers. From there, think carefully about Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, and Google+ (yes, it seems to be fading, but may have utility for some applications). If you’re unsure whether you might have a potential audience on a particular platform, see what your competitors or other blogs in your niche are doing.Stay within what you can manage: Overextending yourself by committing to every new social media platform that becomes available can be exhausting. Worse than that, letting any of your channels stagnate can hurt your brand. Don’t give into pressure to chase every new flashy object if you don’t have time to spare.Don’t be boring: How many times have you signed up for a blogger or company’s email newsletter, only to be let down with horrendous formatting or a lack of any visual styling?This bland approach is boring and provides a poor user experience at worst.Low-cost email marketing doesn’t have to mean low quality. Services like MailChimp offer free entry-level accounts and easy-to-use templates that can make putting together professional-looking e-newsletters simple (and if you’re curious how hard hand-coding emails can be, ask any developer).Reuse blog and social content: Cut time off your email content creation process by linking to your social campaigns and teasing your blog posts.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?While there aren’t many hard and fast rules for how often you should post on any particular channel, it’s important that you keep them all updated on a regular, predictable basis.If your audience knows when to visit your blog for updates, or knows that you post on a particular social media regularly, they’re going to be more likely to keep coming back for more of your content. Knowing when you’ll post in advance also helps get more done in less time.Best practices for post frequency vary by market and niche. But here are a few general guidelines to follow:Investing in a tool to manage your post schedule can help you get organized and save a ton of time. That’s exactly what CoSchedule was built for. However, a simple spreadsheet or Google calendar can get you started with scheduling posts if spending money is out of the question.Generating ideas for unique and interesting things to write about isn’t easy. However, there are ways to speed up the process while avoiding the time and soul-sucking dread of writer’s block.What topics are buzzing on Twitter within your industry or niche? What are Facebook fans discussing on your page? Listening in to social media chatter can give you a good idea of what your audience might be interested in reading about, as well as what questions or concerns they may have that you can create content to address.You know your website and blog content needs to rank in search engines to bring in traffic. Use the Google Adwords Keyword Planner to get an idea of which keywords for your chosen blog or web page topic are generating the most attention.It’s worth keeping in mind that this tool reports how many times a keyword has triggered a pay-per-click ad on Google, rather than the total number of searches it has received in general. Even still, it’s useful for getting a ballpark idea for which keywords you should target for organic traffic as well.Creating content that your audience loves while providing an original take on a trending topic is an excellent way to drive traffic to your blog.If you think you’ve got a good idea for a post, or need some assistance coming up with timely posts, try Google Trends. It’s a useful tool for monitoring how many news headlines have appeared around your chosen keyword, as well as seeing which searches are most popular on Google at the moment.Before you can deliver content people want to read, it helps to know what they’re looking for. Ubersuggest is a free tool that generates lists of actual search terms users have typed into Google’s search bar based on a selected keyword.If you notice a high number of blogs or websites writing about a particular topic, it’s probably because there’s a lot of reader interest around that subject. Check out what other sources are writing about, identify what’s popular, and see how you can make your own post unique or more useful.You can do this by digging deeper into the research, including something that’s missing from other posts, or simply adding your own voice to the conversation. This can help you tap into what your audience wants to read, and drive more traffic by providing a more authoritative resource than your competition.At this point, you know what kinds of content you’re going to create, when it’s going to be created, and where it’s going to be posted.However, without much (if any) assistance, you might quickly find that keeping up with content creation over the long-term can be difficult. But, it doesn’t have to be. By establishing efficient processes, finding ways to reuse content across channels, and maybe enlisting some outside assistance, you can generate more content than you might think.If you don’t have much time to create content of your own (and even if you do), then leverage someone else’s. Now, this doesn’t mean you should go out and steal other people’s work. Rather, content curation simply describes the process of gathering and sharing content around a topic from other sources, and adding your own commentary or insight.Here are a few content curation tips:On a weekly or monthly basis, round up the most interesting posts on your subject or industry and put them into a blog post or email newsletter. You can also reshare content on social media. Make sure you always give credit to the original source. Over time, this approach can position you as a valuable resource to your readers by helping them find the best content on your subject.You might not always have time to write on your own blog as often as you’d like. Fortunately, someone out there probably does, and there’s a chance they might even want to work with you.By cultivating relationships with industry influencers and soliciting guest writers, you can leverage other’s expertise, build connections in your industry, and generate authoritative content while easing your own workload.Here are some ways to find guest bloggers:You’ll want to be mindful and not overstep your bounds here, though. For example, if your site doesn’t generate much traffic yet, then it’s unlikely that a high-powered influencer will want to work with you (or at least not yet).Have a great idea for a Facebook post? Try adapting it for Twitter (and maybe Google+). Just posted something awesome on your blog? Put that in your email newsletter. By finding opportunities to stretch your content across platforms, you can keep your various channels updated efficiently while giving your content maximum exposure.Creating strong graphics for blog and social media posts can be tough if design isn’t your forte. If that sounds like you (and you don’t have access to a skilled designer), consider these options:Canva is a free web-based service, which allows you to create images using a wide variety of fonts, backgrounds, and templates. It has its limitations, but its capable of producing some surprisingly strong results in relatively little time.People love data. Info.gram is great for data pertaining to Instagram. People loves pictures. Bring the two together with Info.gram. This free infographic tool makes it easy to plug in stats and numbers to create quick infographics and data visualizations easily.Video content dominates the Web. In fact, recent Facebook algorithm updates have started to give more weight to video on that platform. However, pro video equipment is expensive, and not much use without the expertise of a skilled shooter and videographer. There is a solution to this problem, however, and it’s probably in your pocket right now.Your phone.While shooting video on your smartphone won’t match the quality of what’s possible with a real camera, it is possible to shoot compelling footage with one in a pinch. Depending on your business, the more raw, unpolished look might even be perceived as more authentic too.If you don’t consider yourself much of a camera person, try following these tips:Once you’ve got your content machine rolling, you’ll want to measure your results and use that data to help drive better decisions moving forward. If you’re getting a ton of traffic from search engines, then continuing to work on content strategy and search engine optimization is probably smart.Or, if you notice that certain social media channels are driving tons of traffic while others are stagnating, that might be a sign that you should focus on the ones that are succeeding, or alter your strategy on the ones that aren’t.The best content marketing plan in the world doesn’t mean much if you can’t measure the results. Fortunately, one of the best digital marketing analytics platforms happens to be free and fairly easy to set up (at least at a very basic level).While Google Analytics is both free and relatively easy to get started with, it’s also a powerful tool with a lot of advanced functionality. Avoid wasting time drowning in data and analytics by focusing on the following three top KPIs (key performance indicators):When time is of the essence, these are the most essential metrics to monitor.In short, SumAll offers free tools (with a paid premium version available as well) to track your social media stats.Between these two tools, you should be more than capable of getting a clear view of how your efforts are performing.Let’s get one thing out of the way here: SEO (Search Engine Optimization) isn’t dead. You will, however, ignore SEO for your blog at your own risk.If you’re looking to save time:There’s a lot of competition out there for premium SEO software platforms (such as Moz, Raven Tools, and more). If you have enough budget, plans generally start around $99 a month and go up from there for more keywords. These options provide powerful capabilities and will make it easier to get more done faster.If you’re looking to save money:However, we’re talking about doing content marketing on a budget here, you’re not totally out of luck if that cost is too high. Premium SEO toolset provider SERPS.com has put together a handy resource of free SEO tools, including a handy rank checking tool and more. Consider this option if budget simply isn’t available.This might seem like a lot of work. Frankly, that’s because it is a lot of work (at least until you get your plans and processes in place). Once you get your content marketing flywheel moving, however, you should find you’re able to get more done in less time on a limited budget with some simple planning, prioritizing, and persistence.Best of all, it won’t cost you much (or possibly anything at all), and you won’t have to cut (too many) corners to get it all done.Click To Tweet

											One of the things that we have been talking about quite a bit on this blog is a concept that we’ve come up with called content hacking. It’s about learning to get more from your content than just another blog post with the occasional tweet. It’s about using your content to drive maximum traffic and lots of attention.It’s about getting results, in other words. After all, why else would you be creating content?With that in mind, here are 25 killer ways that you can hack your content marketing, in no particular order.Headlines matter. A lot.You already know this, yet you still write mushy headlines that don’t always drive results. Why do you do this?If you needed further proof at just how important a headline is, consider Inbound.org, a site that is about “voting” up content based on the headline. Maybe that isn’t how it is supposed to work ideally, but a simple scroll through the homepage and it’s easy to see that headlines are a factor. Recently, I took some advice from Upworthy.com and started writing a minimum of 25 headlines for every blog post (we’ll talk more about this in a bit) that I write. It hasn’t always been easy, but it has paid off well. My headlines are better than before, though I am sure that I still have a long way to go.Write headlines that get people to want your full content even if all they have to go on is that headline.Write Better Headlines With A Free Headline AnalyzerThe headline analyzer will help you:Try The Free Headline Analyzer NowHow easy is it for your readers to share your content? It’s not that readers are lazy, but they aren’t going to work too hard to share a post; you need to make it easy for them.I’m sure you have a few share buttons, but are you placing sharing options within your post itself? Simple WordPress plugins like Click To Tweet and Markerly allow you to make the content in your post shareable with a simple click. These are important triggers that you can use to get your readers sharing content for you.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Where are the share buttons on your page? Are they above or below the fold? Believe it or not, but it can make a difference. AddThis (one of the leading social sharing tools) suggests that social share buttons placed “above the fold” performed the best for most sites.Keep your button near the top of the page: Avoid making your readers scroll to find your sharing button. It is okay to have the button at the top and bottom of the page, but users will find it easier at the top.Of course, this may not be the case for each site, so it is important to try out a few different arrangements. In some situations, you can even keep them fixed to the side of your blog post.It feels like SEO is becoming a bit less important in the new order of content marketing, but I am not convinced that it shouldn’t matter at all. One of the big benefits of choosing keywords is that it keeps you in touch with your audience. You will know what they are searching for, and what is on their mind.I recommend learning how to use Google Adwords to find keywords that work for your audience. Generate a list, and write a post to go with each group of keywords. There are several plugins out there that will keep you honest.Every time someone reads your content, you should be leading them to an inevitable call to action.On the CoSchedule blog, we provide a sticky header that offers our readers all of the helpful guides we’ve ever written in exchange for a simple email address. This simple header leads to hundreds of new “leads” each month. It’s simple, helpful, and worth including on every post.Neil Patel does a great job of asking for action from his readers at the bottom of every post. There is nothing wrong with asking as long as you are providing value to your readers.Ok, now let’s take it one step further. Maybe you need to make your call to action a little more actionable like this pop-up ad from GrooveHQ.Groove’s super-compelling pop-up. Who wouldn’t want to grow their business?I know that pop-ups aren’t always well-loved, but they do work. It’s hard to argue with results.Give the OptinMonster plugin a try, and grab the ‘exit intent’ add-on while you do. This plugin will only “pop-up” on readers that are already leaving your site. What do you have to lose?You also need to pay close attention to the text on your pop-up. For example, take a look at Groove’s language above. Who doesn’t want to grow their business? This is a compelling call to action. Make your call to action something that no one can refuse.Gamification is subject unto itself, but it takes advantage of a key component of growth hacking–the desire to make what we do and what we think, as readers, public. There is a unique human desire for connectivity and personal sharing that makes sites like Facebook and Twitter work. Why not use this for your own site?Poststat.us, a site that uses Love It Pro to gamify its reading process.One of the ways that we can do this is with a WordPress plugin call Love It Pro. This simple plugin allows visitors to ‘vote’ on your posts with a simple button. You can track your most loved posts in a sidebar widget, or use them as a way to prioritize them on your homepage. This simple gamification will make your content all the more sticky.So often, we think about our blog and social networks as outbound channels–channels for sharing our content with others, but not necessarily connecting with them. Chris Lema is a blogger who knows better.Lema blogs regularly about the products he loves and people that he respects. He is a well-know force in the WordPress community simply because of his willingness to reach out and give generously. Jump on Chris’s email list, and you will know what I mean.It may not sound like a content marketing growth hack at first, but using your blog to make friends with key players in your industry is a great idea, a great way to make friends, and a method of building referrals and shares.Yeah yeah yeah, Matt Cutts said that guest blogging is dead. He didn’t mean it. At least not really.Guest blogging as a link-building tool is dead, but as a way to build trust and awareness for your personal brand, it is very much alive. Guest blogging is still a powerful method for promotion and professional networking if you’re doing it right.Referral links from guest posts provide consistent traffic and recognition.At CoSchedule, we’ve had an aggressive guest blogging campaign since launch, and there isn’t a day that it doesn’t pay off. As you can see, many of our top referrals come from guests posts day in and day out. This doesn’t even take into account the ‘street credit’ that we build by writing on these blogs.Guest blogging is still a classic way to hack your content marketing.As a blogger, it can be pretty easy to think only in terms of our own blog, but if we were honest with ourselves, we’d see that there is a whole big world out there. Modern content marketers need to think beyond the borders of their blog and take their content elsewhere.Here are a few ideas:The thing that we have to keep in mind is that our content is still connected to us and to our own authority, no matter where it’s hosted. Building traffic isn’t always about the traffic. Sometimes it’s about the authority and relationships that we build. That’s what makes it a perfect growth hack.Blogger Neil Patel recently published a great post regarding search rankings and post length on his blog. In his research, he discovered an “average content length for a web page that ranks in the top 10 results for any keyword on Google has at least 2,000 words.” I did my own research and found very similar results. So, what does that mean for you?Well, clearly you need to write more!Source Quick SproutNo matter how we spin the results, longer copy is rewarded by Google. As pointed out in my own research, content length isn’t the only key to success–quality still matters–but you have to know that the length of your post matters a lot.It may sounds like old news, but your headline is one of the most important aspects of your post. If you mess it up, you lose your chance at ever achieving a real content hack.Upworthy.com knows a thing or two about headlines. In their slide deck The Sweet Science Of Virality, they emphasize the importance of the headline again and again. More importantly, they emphasize the value in writing a minimum of 25 headlines for each post.The full Upworthy presentation is excellent, and definitely worth a look, a bookmark, and possibly even a print out. It’s that good. We also break down the results a bit further here, and provide some details on WHY writing more headlines works so well.Speaking of Upworthy.com, there is a lot more that we can learn from them.Their entire model is built on the simple idea that they can manufacture virality with the right formula. You may think that it can’t be done, but they’ve come as close to it as anyone, and they’ve even given us a few of their keys for success. It seems that the key is to be a true connoisseur of human nature. You need to understand how people think.As a blogger, trying to understand what motivates people to share content is an important step in the process. Upworthy has invested the time in understanding this, and it has allowed them to virtually manufacture viral growth. As content hackers, we should certainly try to do the same.We all know that links are a good thing when it comes to the search rankings and the web, and we all want others to link to our content. But what about linking to our own content for a change? Google rewards this behavior as well, and it is an important step in the blogging process.The trick is to choose key phrases in your new blog post that can be cross-linked to other posts on your blog. For example, if you have written a blog post for the keyword ‘write better headlines,’ it would make sense to link to that post using a variety of phrases such as ‘here’s how we write great headlines,’ or ‘writing better headlines is easy.’As Google indexes your page, it will take into account both the link, and the text that you are using to connect the two posts. The result is better ranking for you.One of the lessons that many content marketers have been learning lately is that the more time you spend on your content, the more likely you will have a pay-off.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?Hard work and effort matter, and this applies to your content. This is something that Moz engineer  Dr. Peter J. Meyers calls big content.Infographics, particularly well-researched ones, can certainly fall into this category.Our recent infographic on content hacking resulted in 10x more shares than our more conventional posts, and it is still bringing in new traffic each day. If the key is better content, infographics are a fun way to go about it and a relatively easy way to growth hack your content marketing.Creating content that you can reuse in multiple different ways is a huge content hack. A great example of this is a blog series that you turn into an ebook or an email autoresponder course. Serious content hackers learn to stretch their content as far as it will go.Udemy.com is a great place to offer your free or paid online course.Online learning is a currently undergoing huge growth, and it’s a great place to showcase your reusable content. Sites like Udemy, Google Helpouts, or Skillshare allow you to create step-by-step courses for your audience. You can choose to give them away for free, or to sell them for a profit. Either way, it’s a great way to get more life out of the content that you created, and find new fans who discover you through your course.In 2013, Groove did a really brave thing. They shut down their content marketing blog, a blog that was already bringing them 10,000 unique visitors each month. It was both a bold move and, as it turns out, a great idea.Groove decided to shift their story from “generic evergreen content” to the story of their own success. Now Groove is sharing intimate details about their journey to making 500k in revenue each month. It’s a bold move, and requires an unprecedented level of transparency. Fortunately though, it has paid off in spades. In the first 5 weeks of the new blog, Groove gained 5,000 new email subscribers! It’s hard to argue with results like that.This comes back to some of the things I mentioned about virality: We love connecting to others on an emotional/personal level. Stories and transparency help bridge that gap. A great way to hack your content marketing is to use this natural instinct of people wanting to know and connect in this way to your advantage.Your ‘About Us’ page is one of the most visited areas of your website. Unfortunately, it’s often one of the most ignored, especially when it comes to a good call to action.Use some of the advice from this article to create a second version of your About Page and test out your changes with Optimizely, a service that helps you with A/B testing.For some inspiration, take a look at how Copyblogger places an effective call to action right in the middle of their About Us page. You’re telling people who you are. Why wouldn’t you give them the opportunity to connect now that they’ve gotten to know you?It’s 2015, but email is not extinct.Freelance writer Barry Feldman wrote an email marketing mega-post on the entire subject that covers it from top to bottom, but the easy summation of it is this: Email marketing is a tactic that you must get right. Over and over again, it’s been proven that email marketing will consistently result in more conversions and more paying customers than social media. It is just that good.At CoSchedule, email marketing is a major part of what we do. We offer several opportunities for readers to join our Content Marketing Update each week. It’s an email newsletter that is filled with the most recent content marketing articles from around the web. It is a simple product, but it still brings in hundreds of new signups each week.The bottom line is that email works, and if you aren’t using it to the fullest potential, you need to be. It’s the classic way to growth hack your content marketing.Buffer looked into their tweets a while back and found they got 150% more clickthroughs when they shared images with their tweets instead of just text alone.But what if you could get even more engagement with your social messages than Buffer?Can you master the #hashtag better than @jimmyfallon? https://t.co/A4SrKpeQPi pic.twitter.com/uJBAhtQFt9— CoSchedule (@CoSchedule) October 27, 2015When we started researching the best ways to get the most clickthroughs from social media, we started sharing a few GIFs in our tweets. Those tweets got 22.3% more engagement than our tweets with graphics alone—and 166.6% more clickthroughs.Motion in social media feeds can stop scrollers dead in their tracks. If you’re using plain text social messages, think of hacking your networks with images, GIFs, and videos.Search is now social, and one of the best ways to get noticed on search is to get noticed on Google+, Google’s own social network. Many brands have a presence on Google+, but place little priority on the network because they’ve focused on Facebook or Twitter. Now is the time to change that.The more people that have you in your Google+ circles, the more likely you are to show up in social search, the default setting for Google searches. Weight is put on those in your circles when it comes to the search results on this setting. You want to show up in other’s searches? Get in their circles.These days, SEO is all about social connections and great content, so getting as embedded as you can in the Google+ network only makes sense.This is a simple content marketing hack–get more followers on Google+. Get found in Google search.In case you haven’t heard, it’s ok to promote your content on social media more than once. Networks like Twitter actually require it for true success. One of the easiest ways to grow the number of readers for each post you write is to simply share it more often. If each share results in a few new clicks, the math should take care of itself pretty quickly.At CoSchedule, we not only make this process easy by connecting social media scheduling right to your blogging workflow, we also provide a detailed guide on how to promote your content on social media (more than once).Email-based autoresponder courses are an epic content marketing growth hack that you should be using to grow your blog.They’re not the same as your regular email newsletter. Instead, they are simple courses that drip content to your readers as soon as they sign up for your email marketing mailing list. They are a great way to drive deeper engagement with your readers, and keep them connected to your brand.Our “6 Free Marketing Tips” autoresponder course is consistently one of our best methods for driving new email addresses to our list. It is a major source of new leads for our product, and (shhh…don’t tell) was put together using content that we originally created ages ago. That’s right, autoresponder courses are a great way to recycle older content for a new audience.Faster? Yes, faster. Back in 2010, Google engineer Matt Cutts announced that Google is now factoring site speed into search rankings. So, it only makes sense that you would make your blog as fast as possible.Credit: Search Engine JournalOne of the things that happens with blogs, especially WordPress-driven ones, is that we fill it up with a bunch of crummy plugins and themes that degrade our site’s performance slowly over time. It’s important that you spend some time reclaiming that speed and improving how you rate on Google.While it can be a bit technical, WPMU DEV has a great guide for speeding up your WordPress blog. Follow it, speed things up, live long and prosper.One of the biggest mistakes that content marketers make is that they focus more on the content than its promotion. While it is true that great content can “rise to the top,” the biggest winners are still the ones that promote themselves the best.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?There are a ton of ways to growth hack your content marketing, but none of them compare to promoting your content mercilessly, and fighting for each new visit. Don’t make the big mistake of assuming that if you write it, they will come. You have to go out and tell people about what you’ve written.Content hacking is, at its core, all about making your content easy to find, consume, and share. Anything that helps break down barriers to these three foundational concepts is a content hack worth trying.Click To Tweet

							CoSchedule Co-Founder, blogger, designer, content hacker and serial starter. Also, a firm believer in the do what you love, love what you do philosophy.If you want to build and execute a data-driven, agile content strategy to get massive results from your content marketing, this post is for you.Need help creating more effective content, more easily? Download these 21+ marketing templates, each designed to help you do your best work now.I wrestle over headlines.  Maybe it’s because I’m a black-and-white, just-the-facts-ma’am kind of thinker, and maybe hardly anyone else looks at post titles this way, but I have a hard time with writing post titles that don’t DESCRIBE THE POST.  I know that a good leading headline is more likely to get views.  But for the sake of evergreen content – and being able to FIND what you’re looking for later – they are typically very unhelpful.“Try This Weird New Trick to Get Your Kids to Talk” might be a compelling headline that gets moms to read an article.  But they’ll never be able to find that article later because no one is going to think to search for “weird new trick.”  It would be kind of like filing my papers under “cool stuff.”How do you balance this need for grabbing attention with the need for longevity and searchability?Well, I think that comes down to keyword selection. We make a point to keep our SEO keywords in the headline. This is good for SEO, and for the reasons that you describe here. For example, the keyword for this post was “content marketing growth hacks” which means that both “content marketing” and “growth hacks” are included in the headline. We like to keep the phrase together, but it does get broken up if there is a better headline option. Good comment – thanks!I feel your pain. But I think there’s a difference between two types of content, the first being “Discovery” content, and the other “Relationship content”.For Discovery content, you create a resource page linking to various articles you wrote optimized for what you optimized for what want to rank for. You still have to make the headlines attractive, because showing on ye Google is half the battle, getting someone to click is another. That in my opinion where the traffic comes from, that 20% of the posts targeted for a keyword. The rest of the posts in my opinion can be relationship building and not really focus on keywords but focus on keeping the readers entertained. You get the readers from Google to your list from the first type of content, you keep them with the second.My 2 cents :)Hey Oliver, I like your definitions of Discovery content and Relationship content. I’ve been doing this without being able to describe it.I don’t know if it’s the “smart” thing to do, but I use a searchable title on my blog post, and then use more compelling headlines for social media. So on my blog, the post is titled “How to Grow Hydroponic Turnips” but on SM i share “3 Weird Tricks I Used To Make My Kids Eat Veggies” or  “You Won’t Believe What I Did To Save Money On Groceries!” (note: I do not blog about turnips) :DThat makes a lot of sense.I’m getting better just with practice, too.  By the way, the CoSchedule blog does a FANTASTIC job of headlines.  (I like watching these guys, to model after.)  I probably click through their emails because of compelling titles more often than anyone else whose emails I get – and I *always* get what I expected and then some.  I’ve never been disappointed because CoSchedule “hyped” their headlines too much.This is a great list, and a must read for anyone into blogging. It really hits the nail on the head!Thanks Olivier!Great job Garrett, this is a great comprehensive checklist. I will definitely try the multiple headlines for each post. Personally this is when I often stare at a blank page!Well with 25 to go, the pressure should be off. Hopefully that will help you get them on paper quickly.Fingers crossed :)Thanks for a great post.  Now I need to spend the next 4-6 hours pouring over every inch of this article. :)Ha ha. Thanks John – good luck with that :)Actually motivating and very much convincing post! Thanks for sharing this commendable content.
Internet Marketing GURUHello Garrry, thanks for the tips. Shall take some time to review which ones work very well for my very own work. It is getting time that I have to write down my very own tips and share them as well. But if I can give one. Share your Facebookpage posts with the Facebook groups you are member of. Unfortunately you can not do that using the name of your page, but as your profile. So you should do this only when you want to link to your website not to your Facebookpage.Thanks Geert!Hey Garret,This is great stuff! I especially like the pop up and site speed tips Funny enough, I’ve covered a similar post on the same topic “Social Media Hacks for Content Marketing”.http://tribes.no/2014/09/30/social-media-hacks-to-boost-content-marketing/Best,StevenI just found this post, thank goodness great content lives on! This information is relevant and totally awesome. Some of the things you suggest, like the ecourse, I started long ago and still do it. Others are new to me but totally worth the time to do.Awesome Garrett, just a chock-filled checklist of things to do to improve your site.Thanks for the great post! Some of these are sometimes a challenge, especially writing headlines. I was earlier looking for a email marketing tool that had landing pages, autoresponder and was easy to use. In the end I chose GetResponse. Even though social media can be powerful I find email marketing essential. Pop ups seem also like an interesting option to try.Thanks to Jonah Asher at thewhitehathacker09@gmail.com,i was able to get into my fiancee’s facebook as well as her gmail acct,also got hold of all of her phone logs,text messages to discover she was a cheating liar,Dude’s work is top class.hit him up for any hack related issues as well as bank tf’s.blank atm’s,high school/college score upgrade.THEWHITEHATHACKER09@GMAIL.COM…robert referred you cuz he’s real private.© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,1

There would be a prolonged moment of silence and then that question.I don’t know if that prolonged moment of silence was in honor of the memory of what they thought was now-gone employability. I can promise you that as I got older and there was more distance from my college graduation, I fretted less.Because in the ensuing years, I learned that the answer to that question was: quite a lot.Sometimes a skill is not just a skill.

											Getting your art degree, it turns out, doesn’t only make you a prime candidate for being a professional artist, but it also spawns the ability to defend your work in front of a room of critics. You know the skill of B.S. (yes, it’s a real skill) and can create something out of nothing.As a content marketer, you’re holding onto skill sets that go beyond “simply” being a content marketer.So, the next time someone asks you what you do as a content marketer, rest assured you have some solid answers.This skill is huge. Don’t ever undersell yourself as a content marketer, because your ability to write is paramount.Oddly, writing every day makes me forget that not everyone is a writer. I assume everyone is writing constantly and am shocked when I come across someone struggling with their writing. Reading long posts and comments on Facebook, for example, is stunning at times. I’m not interested in correcting grammar or making people feel embarrassed (many bizarre words and typo errors can be blamed on type assist on mobile devices), but I am genuinely surprised.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?In the past five years, the ability to write—which also includes vocabulary, grammar, and analysis—has noticeably declined among college students. 26% of college graduates have deficient writing skills.That’s college graduates, we’re talking about.It’s easy to think writing great copy is just about stringing together the right words, but there is a huge analysis factor.Good writers have to be able to analyze their own ideas and the ideas of others. Writing also involves communicating persuasively as well as clearly. Too often, good writing is seen as something that is clever rather than clear. Snappy and clever is fine, but not at the sake of clarity.And, of course, good writing is done in a way where you inform people while making every reader, no matter their skill and knowledge level, feel welcome.The fact that content marketers, out of necessity, are constantly writing means they are always in a state of practice. The sheer amount of times you put pen to paper (or word to screen) means that you are exercising your writing muscles and brain cells. Perhaps this is why I am surprised by the lack of writing skills I come across in others: They simply do not write every day.Your ability to write puts you at an extreme advantage in this world.Improve Your Skill:In a content marketing career, you’re frequently at the mercy of the winds of trends, breaking news, and ever-changing technology. That means you get used to creating under some level of pressure. There’s no letting up, no break—because your audience is just one yawn away from leaving you (or so you think). You never know who will say what to you on social media, and you have to figure out a response in the moment that is both appropriate and genuine.Unless you’re a solo content marketer, you’re also pretty good at working with others. You delegate duties, plan timelines, and brainstorm.You have the ability to hit the ground running and think on your feet—with or without a team at any given moment.Criticism and critique are not the same thing. Both can be valuable.As a content marketer, you know how to handle both criticism or critique, whether that means knowing how or when to respond, or if you should respond at all. You can identify what you should take seriously and which battles to fight. You know how to participate in amicable disagreement, or you knowing when to avoid it entirely.Click To Tweet
Want to use Click to Tweet on your blog?And all of this often happens in full public view… of your customers and competitors.You have the ability to be graceful, honest, and real under pressure in full view of everyone.Convincing someone that they ought to consider the idea you’re presenting, much less getting them to act on the idea, is tough.This goes beyond how great your writing is, and how well you can turn a word. Instead, it is about you understanding how people function.As a content marketer, you read and research what motivates people emotionally and psychologically. You are constantly reading the research from other marketers and are always developing a strong understanding of how people react in specific situations.You learn about the sales process, the sales funnel, and how to identify (and respond to) someone in different stages of the sales process.You have the ability to understand when someone is ready to buy, and what to do if they aren’t.This post is on the CoSchedule blog. Of course we’re going to point out your amazing planning skills! Planning is what we’re all about, and as a successful content marketer…so are you.The year I was a school teacher, I was repeatedly told by other teachers that the education sector built incredible organizational skills and I was lucky to be picking them up (though I saw a few teachers desks that suggested otherwise).If ever there were organized people (or people who at least were actively focused on getting organized), it’s you as a content marketer. With so many things to keep tabs on like engagement, social media, blogging, email, and ebooks, it seems to be, either you organize or die.If you’ve been a content marketer for over a year, you:You have the ability to see what needs to be done, and you know how to plan and do it.Content marketing is about marketing awareness.You have to know what is happening in your niche, and which trends are increasing or fading. Content marketers are definitely not “set it and forget it” people, known for constantly testing everything from button placement on a page to the headline of a blog post in order to find the better performer.Content marketers are also known for using technology to gather data and for being creative in how they use that data to impact their next decisions. You do this. You’re not just using a traffic counter and watching the numbers click up. You’re deciphering bounces, page habits, landing page performance, and demographics. Data is so much more than numbers in a spreadsheet for you. It tells you what happened, what’s happening, and what you’ll do next.You have the ability to interpret data and trends in a way that gets put into action.Content marketing doesn’t work if you’re blowing smoke at people, and you know it.It’s all about connecting with people. Content marketers have to create content, but it’s not enough to just create content. It has to be helpful content that your audience actually wants.This means you’ve learned to listen to your audience (heck, you’ve actually found the audience that works best for you). You can interpret and read them, finding out what makes them tick. You take the time to understand their user experience. You put aside what you want and turn marketing into something they want. And in the end, you really connect with people and forge loyalty.You have the ability to inspire customer loyalty because you understand the importance of caring about real people.Those who are in a content marketing career live in a visual realm.Social networks and websites are all about visuals. As a content marketer, you’ve learned to write well, interpret data, and use psychology. Content marketers are the ultimate repackagers, digging up complicated studies and turning them into palatable infographics.This isn’t just about making pretty pictures. You are actually creating a new content type from another.You have the ability to take complicated information and make it simple to understand, especially visually.Content marketers are always in need of new ideas for blog posts and social campaigns. This means they are always in a state of asking questions.You do it all the time. “What does my reader want? Is that trend a sign of something bigger? How can I make this simpler? What are my customers telling me isn’t working? Why am I seeing blog posts on this topic all of a sudden?”You ask questions of beta test groups, data, customers, social followers, and of your team members. You know that the right solution is only found when you ask the right question. Otherwise, you’re wandering around blindly.Content marketers struggle with the idea of showing a return on investment (ROI) because they sometimes seem to think their work doesn’t have one.As we’ve already covered on this blog, that simply isn’t true.The work you do has real ROI, and you know both the need to prove it and the method for doing so.After all, great content marketers aren’t going to keep doing what isn’t working, so they are always looking for the return. This is why you A/B test, this is why you measure, this is why you collect all of that data, and this is why you periodically make changes in your plan: You have an eye on getting the maximum return.You have the ability to identify what provides a ROI and what needs to be scrapped.In your content marketing career, you aim to get the most bang for your buck.With an eye on saving time and money (your two most limited resources) great content marketers know how to reuse content in a way that makes it fresh again. This kind of approach is valuable; you’re not always reinventing the wheel and throwing more (new) money at a problem. You know how to take something old and make it new. Repurpose your content by making it new.You have the ability to use what is available and make it work.So if anyone ever says to you, after you’ve told them that you’re a content marketer, “what in the world will you ever do with that?”…now you know.By the time it’s all said and done, content marketing has helped you acquire a great skill set worthy of its own content marketing degree (sorta). The next time you see a list of skill sets in a job ad, stop scanning to see if “content marketer” is listed, and instead see if any of the above skills are listed.You’d be surprised at how valuable your content marketing skills are.

Keep writing & thanks for reading!!Glad you liked the post, particularly something specific. Clarity is sort of a forgotten element, replaced with clever or flashy (both visual and verbal).

											Infographics are the most socially shared form of content.In 2013, Slideshare reported: “The data’s in: Infographics have more virality than presentations and documents!”It’s still true.Noah Kagan of SumoMe recently conducted one of the most massive social sharing studies in the history of the planet. He and his team crunched data from over 100 million articles.Here’s what they discovered.What type of posts typically receive a lot of shares?…Infographics.The data indicates that infographics claim the top spot.I’ve produced a bunch of infographics over the years, so I totally understand the data.Infographics are incredibly engaging. Since humans process visual information faster than words, it only makes sense.The human brain tells us “reading is hard” and “looking is easy.”An infographic uses the power of visually appealing content to trick the brain into reading. Besides, we understand the content better when it’s paired with pictures.NeomamIt’s no surprise that kids like picture books. But it’s not just kids; adults are the same way! The brain itself likes pictures.The takeaway is simple: Share infographics socially, and the social world will share it right back.Interactive content is all the rage.Wikipedia defines interactive media in this way:Interactive media normally refers to products and services on digital computer-based systems which respond to the user’s actions by presenting content such as text, moving image, animation, video, audio, games, etc.The content marketing industry has moved past the static read-it-and-process-it form of social media content.Instead, savvy content professionals are producing content that users can better engage with.At the beginning of 2015, Ion Interactive published a survey of content marketing trends. Their thesis was, “Clearly, content is going interactive.”SlideshareThey quoted William Comcowich, the CEO of Cyber Alert, who said this:“Content marketing is becoming less about the words you put on a page, and more about the experiences you create for the consumer.”One of the most viral forms of interactive content is the quiz.You’ve probably taken one of these quizzes.Quizzes are a two-way form of content. Users do something with it rather than just consume it. Besides, people love to share their quiz results.The Atlantic famously reported that The New York Times’ most-shared content of 2013 wasn’t an article at all. It was a quiz.If that’s true of a news company that produces thousands of articles a year, then how much more valuable would it be for your brand?Interactive content is valuable for so many reasons. Once you start posting interactive material, you’ll never again revert to the old ways.If your social media content doesn’t spark people’s emotions, then it probably won’t get shared very much.CoSchedule’s research discovered that “posts with a higher emotional value get more shares.”There are all kinds of emotions, though. What kind of emotional response gets the most shares?Not surprisingly, it’s the happy emotions that inspire people to share.CoScheduleBuffer’s analysis of emotional content found the same trends to hold true. “Positive feelings” and “positive ratings” were correlated with positive emotion in the shared social media content.Bufferapp Blog If you want truly valuable social media activity, focus on emotion. It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in.Emotion is a universal language that evokes similar responses everywhere.Obviously, your emotional language will vary according to your audience and their particular demographic makeup. Broadly speaking, however, emotional language in social media will produce valuable results.It shouldn’t be a surprise that image-rich content is incredibly shareable.Data for this comes from all kinds of sources, but some of the most compelling statistics are from Buffer’s research.Take a look:Of course, that’s just Twitter. What about Facebook?The same holds true:WishpondYou can’t argue with the facts: Images are shareable.Go-Gulf conducted a study on “what people like to share on social networks.” It’s no shock that pictures came out on top.Go-GulfIf you keep up a steady output of image-rich content on social media platforms, you’ll be sure to increase your value.One of the most obvious results of OKDork’s study (Buzzsumo) was this:“People love to share lists and infographics.”Here’s that chart again:Content marketers classify content according to several types of blog posts. Here is a common classification:According to Kagan’s data, list posts came out on top. Since he analyzed over 100 million articles, I’d say that data is reliable.Hubspot did a similar study. Their findings? List posts came out ahead, too.Lists and “why” posts proved to have the most reliable social traction, averaging around 21,000 shares per month with a variance of less than 2.5%.Between list posts and why posts, list posts won out.Lists narrowly claimed the most social traction at 22.45%.Content marketing pioneers like Brian Clark have long known the power of list posts. Clark’s article “7 Reasons Why List Posts Will Always Work” provides one of the primary reasons why the list is an irresistible form of content—the headlines are magnetic!Some writers explain that the brain is hardwired to tune into lists. Since this is true, we are more likely to share, engage with, and benefit from list posts shared on social media.In raw numbers, news articles get more social shares than any other type of article.The data above shows the number of shares for a six-month period according to industry. It’s clear that the news industry has an advantage.Here’s the challenge. It’s hard to be a source that breaks news as it happens. There are two types of businesses that are able to do this:Most businesses that produce content are focusing on deep long form content rather than as-it-happens breaking news.If you’re not in the news industry, you probably don’t want to be producing news articles. Why not?Because, when analyzed according to industry, news articles—called “what-posts”—were the worst performers. Only in the news, technology, and entertainment verticals are news articles shareable.According to Hubspot, what-posts are risky, and they are social low-performers:If your niche is news, entertainment, or tech, what-posts may be valuable on social media. Otherwise, you’re better off sticking with some of the other methods in this article.Now that you know the most shareable types of social media content, what should you do?You may choose to produce this kind of content and share it on your social channels.That would be fine. But first, let me suggest something else.Before you share anything, learn what your audience wants. Remember, just because something has data-backed share value does not mean that it’s going to give you the same results.Your audience might want something different entirely. They may react favorably to a list post but completely ignore a newsworthy post.The best method is to make sure you know your audience, analyze your data, test different types of social media content, and develop a powerful strategy.

This post will show you how.Mind blowing as all your articles, Neil. I’m a major fan.
It’s incredible how images too over the past years. While Pinterest has surely played a major role in it, the simple fact that there’s too much content out there and little time, also force people to filter by the “looks” of an article as well.
Thanks for sharing your knowledge!Hey Debbie, as always, thanks for reading. Insightful comment here. I just read, too, that people who use visuals about every 100 words tend to experience more success, which seems to back up what Neil is saying. http://coschedule.com/blog/types-of-blog-posts/Hmmm. I didn’t know about it. Thanks a lot for the info, Nathan!
I need catch you with the posts from CoSchedule. :)Fantastic! It’s not easy to break down the complexity of social into digestible segments. I would love to see this article updated for the 2015 digital landscape. I’m not sure infographics are still the rage…I agree – I think they’ve been tainted by a glut of low quality marketing-based infographics. At least on my end.I wonder where video stacks in all of this. I’ve noticed when I post my paintings/cartoons I get more engagement than text. But videos take time to watch, unless very short. Still, I think videos are of value.Video is ranked last at 17% (the final infographic in that section, Section 4).Thanks, I missed that! Great info!Awesome post Neil. I’m currently finishing my postgrad in Digital Marketing and starting my own blog- this post was extremely relevant and informative; it was a great breakdown of a topic I find really interesting. I wonder what this list will be in the next couple years or even five years from now. What do you think?Hey Jordan, I’ll chime in here with a couple thoughts from our perspective here at CoSchedule.1. Interactive content will get even bigger. A lot of companies have blogs, but millennials will want even more interactive content, and if I had to guess, it’s going to be more than surveys but more very easy-to-use tools that help them solve a specific problem quickly. That guess comes from the success of our headline analyzer.2. Successful content will get even longer. Neil mentions list posts perform well, but there’s already evidence to suggest that large list posts perform well. People don’t have time to hop from one source to another to find an answer, so if a headline can suggest one place to get everything while saving time, that source will get clicked and shared. Instead of ’10 Ways To…’ think ‘100 Ways To…’ and 5,000+ words to back it up. http://coschedule.com/blog/types-of-blog-posts/3. Visual content will continue to grow. I read recently that some posts perform well when they have visual content appearing every 100 words throughout the body. I say visual content because the advent of motion in social media feeds draws attention. Think of scrolling through Facebook and seeing videos and coming to a halt. Twitter now supports GIFs and video (and we’ve seen our own tweets with GIFs get 167% more clickthroughs). So, visuals will also continue to expand successfully on social. http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/social-media-growth-hacks/I hope that helps. :)Neil, outstanding post and it wasn’t so much the tips and advice you gave as it was the point you made in the closing paragraph – get to know your audience first. I was reading this post thinking that what content you produce is solely contingent on your audience profile, not what necessarily works because of a broad analysis.Thank you for making that point at the end!Hey John, awesome point here. It does always go back to that—know your audience, make logical connections between data and your understanding what they need, then execute. Love it.Hey Neil, thanks for this fantastic article. I can always count on CoSchedule to deliver what I need to know to stay at the front of the pack. It sounds like interactive content is the way of the future, but I’m not sure how to create that (I’m a writer, not a designer or web programmer). Are there any plugins that you would recommend?Hello Asheritah,
Thanks for reading! Glad you found the post helpful! We actually have a post coming up on the blog in January that will be talking about how to design infographics. Keep an eye out for it. :)I’d add skip Positive in “Post Content that Evokes Strong Positive Emotions”. Just emotions. We must tell stories and post content which evokes emotions in people, all kind of emotions. On Facebook, people are somehow trying to post only positive news or stories, trying to keep other ones for themselves. With posting real content, real stories, content that can be attached to people’s everyday life, you get to stand out for the crowd.© 2016, Coschedule - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy",CoSchedule,6
