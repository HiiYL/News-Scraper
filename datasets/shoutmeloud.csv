2016-05-13,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/secrets-of-popular-bloggers.html,Top 6 Secrets of People Behind Popular Blogs #2 is Dope,"So you’re wondering why your blog refuses to grow after putting so much time and effort into it. You’ve implemented all the things you learnt from other blogs in order to build a very successful blog yet there’s no sign of growth while other blogs that were built after yours are speedily picking up and getting lots of exposure and mentions. Does it mean that those other bloggers that are becoming famous are smarter, luckier or more intelligent than you are? Or maybe you’ve concluded that blogging is not meant for you after all? Well, that is not the problem. The problem is that there are few things they’re doing which you are not. In this case, giving up usually looks like the best option but I urge you not to even think of that at all instead, give me some minutes and I will show you exactly why you’re not moving forward with your blogs. After reading this post, you’ll see the exact things that separate the pro/successful bloggers from   all to no avail ,so… let’s do this. After carrying out my research, below are the things that I found out that are synonymous to every successful blogger out there. Successful bloggers understand that no good business survives without adequate and workable plans and strategies. They don’t just blog for the sake of blogging or because every other person is doing it. Before they even launch their blog, they already know the necessary things they need to be doing in other to ensure the success of the blog and once they’ve mapped out their plans, they follow it diligently not allowing anything else to deviate them from that plan. As a blogger, you don’t just   because you feel like or because you know that you should publish, NO! backlinks plan If you truly desire to imitate these pro bloggers in order to also take your blog to the next height, then, you must also be willing and able to learn and practice what they’re doing. One of the things I’ve learnt about them over the years is that they all have an   and have publishing schedule that guides them on what and when to publish on their blogs. But a majority of bloggers out there don’t even know what an editorial calendar is and what it is used for, let alone, actually knowing how to use one. Do not be one of these bloggers. There are so many benefits that come to having a good editorial calendar and   including but not limited to: It helps in your blogs SEO, builds anticipation in the minds of your audience and totally gets rid of   that we often encounter at one point in time. Not having a schedule is dangerous and can ruin your blog if not corrected immediately. Brian Harris of video fruits stated in his   that not having a content planning and continuity for his blog last year was one of the things that didn’t go well in his business. Hence, he went ahead and created his own content marketing editorial calendar as you can see below. So, I really urge you to go   now if you haven’t done so because you can’t possibly succeed without it. A lot has already been said about the benefits of  for your readers and I had to also include it here because of its importance. You see,   hoping that magic will happen and it end up creating a buzz! They always take their time to research and make sure that what they’re creating is needed and will be well received. Every content they publish have a goal behind it, they have an idea of what they want that content to achieve for them, and finally, they will make every effort to make sure that aim is met. If you really want to speedup the growth of your blog like the pros do every time then, you should start by learning how to publish the right contents. You might be confused on what exactly is the right content here, let’s look at  … As you can see from Brian’s definition of Right Content, any piece of content you publish on your blog must be able to achieve any of (if not all) the qualities above, that will make your contents very successful and rewarding. When writing your posts, it needs to be very actionable and backed up with good data where necessary, this will not only make it more authoritative but, it will also enable you to be creating long form contents that your audience will find very valuable and educating. According to a report by  ,  . It’s true that everyone has his own opinion on how long an article should be but at the end, longer is much better.  This is true because statistics has shown that “ ”. By writing long form contents, it will also benefit you more due to the fact that, on average,  , this will put you ahead of others because your own blog posts will also have more value. People will be happy to read, link to and also share it with their fans because they like it. You also need to know that 94% of people who share contents on the internet do so because they think it will be helpful to others according to a research by  . Furthermore, successful bloggers know exactly the things that make articles go viral. Are you a successful blogger? You should understand this.  , this will make your audience see it as if you’re speaking to them directly, it will also make them to understand that you’ve also gone through what they’re currently experiencing and this is a no brainer. Understanding what makes up a   is very crucial to your blogs growth and this should not be neglected. Two Upenn professors recently carried out a research named “ ”. They analysed contents that were published over a three-month period to find out the factors that contributed to their higher sharing and  Remember; don’t fill your blog post with irrelevant words if they don’t fit into the article. If what you’re writing cannot fit into 1500+ words then, cut it down. It will be very time wasting to write a 2000 words article on a topic that’s supposed to be 500 words just because you’re aiming for a long form article.  , therefore, don’t aim for quantity alone; consider relevancy and quality. Also, while writing your contents, don’t try to use fancy words or slangs if they are not necessary, instead, write in simple and  . Write as if you’re discussing or writing to your friend, better still, write like you talk  . It’s also important that you learn how to incorporate storytelling to your posts; this will make it more engaging and fun to read especially on your post opening.

This is why your headline needs to be as   as possible because it will eventually determine if the post will be read or not. You can actually create a great post that will provide a lot of values and benefits to your readers but if your headline is not enticing enough, the post will not be able to get the attention it deserves. However, writing a great headline does not guarantee the success of your blog post, the benefits covered on the headline also has to be properly satisfied at all means, else, your article is doomed to fail. There are no two ways about it. According to the copywriting trainers at the  , there are four ‘U’ approaches to writing good headlines and they include… Headlines, Subheads and Bullet points should: If your headline includes all of the above FOUR U’s then, there is every opportunity of it performing very well. In the same manner, Clayton Makepeace  suggested that you ask yourself the following six questions before you start to write your headline: With Clayton’s six questions combined with the 4 U’s that a headline should have, you already have the right template to always craft irresistible and outstanding headlines. You should consider keeping a swipe file of some of the best headlines you see. Then see how you can emulate the strategies used by your favorite headlines into your own blog posts. You might also do what   for each of your post, this will enable you to have so many variations of headlines for that post which will help you to choose the right one. You should also use the  r to check and see how good a headline is each time. The guys at Coschedule and Okdork wanted to see if there is an easy way to rate a headline and predict if it will be a well shared post or not and in order to achieve this, they started testing some of the most well shared headlines on the internet using an awesome tool by the   called  . This handy tool promises to let you know how emotional your headline is by counting the number of emotional words that are used in the phrase. The tool is very easy to use. Just copy and paste your headline in the space provided and click on  and it will calculate and give you the EMV score of your headline. Here’s the result of the headline of a post I got from   by Henneke titled:  And below is the headline score for this post: So the question that the guys at Coschedule and Okdork are asking is; does this really work as a way to predict popularity? To find out, they took an average sampling of headlines from three sharing groups. And below is the result: Now as you can see from the image above, posts with a high number of shares constantly reached an EMV score of 30 or 40, several points higher than posts with fewer shares. And the conclusion is that  . So, this is why you really have to work on using emotional words on your headline. You can check out  .

A recent research by   showed that 70% of marketers lack a consistent or integrated content strategy. If you really want to become a very successful blogger then you have to do what you need to do and one of such things is to get really serious with content marketing because you cannot possibly survive without it as a blogger. I understand that writing can be very tedious sometimes especially as a starter but with constant practice, you will certainly get used to it. Ana Hoffman of Traffic Generation Case stated that “  so, why not try this and see the impact it will create on your blog? To drive more of my point home, check out this stats by   …… Be mindful, I’m not just talking of any type of content here, if you must succeed with content marketing then your contents need to be of higher quality, you need to be constantly churning out epic contents that will be even better than others of its kind, if not, your content marketing efforts will only be a total waste of time. It might interest you to know that   so, if you’re anything like me, you will want to be among the remaining 31% that writes quality contents. According to Neil Patel, More and more companies are taking the content marketing plunge. It’s growing so fast that 77% of companies increased their   in 2015. Be cautious, content marketing here does not only mean text-based contents, you also need to be using other forms of content marketing like videos, webinars, podcasting and info-graphics depending on your budget. Remember that YouTube has become the second largest search engine on the internet, much bigger than the likes of AOL, Bing, Yahoo, etc… so, if you’re not yet part of the network then you’re actually giving up on your chance of being discovered by the new audience as well as potential clients. A lot of people have already made millions of dollars from YouTube and there are so many ways through which you can also tap on this goldmine as a blogger depending on your niche. For example, how to video has proven to be always well received on YouTube and if you can make good videos on how to solve some of the most difficult tasks on your niche, it will eventually give you more audience and traffic. [Tweet “Video is becoming the bell of the content marketing ball. “] Two-thirds of marketers and agency executives believe that original digital video will become as important as original TV programming within the next three years. If you’re wondering how to get around YouTube marketing, there are already lots of good guides on the internet that can teach you this. Check out the ones below. It’s also advisable that you understand who your target audience is while carrying out your content marketing campaign. You need to know the people you’re writing for: Knowing all these will enable you to ensure that you’re really meeting them at the point of their needs and they will end up liking and trusting you for that. Take a look at the graphic below from the Neil Patel blog: If you want to achieve your business goals then, you need to constantly write contents that resonate with your target audience. You need to talk to them using the language they understand the most. Content marketing is a very integral part of blogging, they work hand in hand and one cannot function well without the other, therefore, you need to get used to it. You need to determine your own content publishing frequency. A recent statistic by   found out that 91% of the best business bloggers publish weekly or more often while only 70% of all other bloggers post at this frequency. I’ve seen lots of bloggers whose blogs were liquidated by their web hosts. I’m sure you understand the feeling when you put in so much time and efforts into building out your site only for it to get hacked after some time  . If you’re really serious about   then, the first step is to ensure that you make use of a  .  , by official WordPress.org for hosting WordPress blogs. While it’s good to start with a , if you have the budget and plan to build your blog into an authority in your chosen niche, I will recommend you go with your own server. It will be well worth the investment at the end. One thing you must always bear in mind is that none of the successful bloggers out there became successful by chance, it took a   and making use of the best tools before they arrived at where they are today. If at any point in time, you ever felt that you can’t possibly attend to every task on your list as a blogger because of lack of time then, maybe you just need the right tools. These tools can be a time saver for you, also, it can ultimately cut down the time required to research your market and competitors.  are very necessary these days in order to work faster and possibly land more clients and readers without compromising content quality. Setting some of these tools up can sometimes be very confusing but the best part is that once you’ve successfully incorporated the right tools to your blogging business, you will have less to worry about and you can even travel to any part of the world while your business will still be in a good shape. However, without using  , you will be wasting a lot of time in every task ranging from creating contents and even promoting it. Talk of any blogging task out there and you will definitely see a good tool that can make it easier for you. For instance, Email marketing, social media marketing, content writing and promotion, analytics and split testing, shopping carts, etc… And the best part is that most of these tools are free to use. You just need to figure out exactly what you want then, carry out a little research on the best tools for it and boom!…you will be amazed at what you will see. Any  needs the ability to save time and get more jobs done in order to become successful. You can only do it on your own manually for a short period of time but the truth is that you cannot achieve any significant result without the help of these tools. So you need to decide what you really want. You need to have the desire to succeed and once you’ve achieved this, the next step will now be to figure out the various disciplines which will best help you to make progress and achieve your end goal and then   to ensure that nothing stops you from getting exactly what you want. Check out what my friend Glen from Viper Chill has to say about this in his recent post titled:   (I’ll suggest you go read this post later). I’ve seen lots of bloggers that gave up after a few months of starting their blogs simply because they had nothing to show for it, they’ve spent lots of time, their money and efforts to see if they can make it via blogging but at the end, it didn’t work and so…..they quit. The truth is that quitting always seems to be the best way out but it’s not. You will only quit if you’re not very committed to your goal and do not even know your ‘why’ in the first place. You need to, first and foremost, determine   and if you get it right, that feeling alone will always carry you through whenever you feel that things are not moving well. Yes, no one told you that the road will be rosy and if anyone ever told you that, then he lied, yet it’s not a rocket science either. Many people have passed through that same road and if you’re motivated enough, you will also pass through it someday, it might only take some time but at the end, it will certainly come to pass. All is required of you is to always find ways to motivate yourself just as   did with the picture below which he hung on his wall. As you can see, Glen uses these pictures to always keep himself motivated and each time he starts feeling down and out, he simply takes a quick glance at them and he will get back on track. Now, I know that this approach might not really work for everyone but why don’t you just give it a try and see if it will work out for you or not? He also uses another great method which I haven’t heard of. Glen wrote a book specifically for himself where he wrote his entire ‘why’. According to him, the book practically contains all the most important advice and tips he believes in and can follow in order to reach his own personal definition of being successful. Check it out in his own words. I’ve said it all. You need to decide if you really want to succeed with blogging and enjoy life like pro bloggers or not, it’s your calling and you’re the one that will choose whether to answer or not. At the end, those that succeed are those who think they can. So take up the challenge and do what pro bloggers are doing in order to become a pro too. It’s not all about reading, if you spent your time reading this 4,000 words article and still do nothing with it, then I’m sorry for you. You need to examine yourself properly. Remember, successful bloggers are also action takers. Go take action now and become successful too. A quite detailed post too.

If you’re getting traffic but they’re not converting then I’m suspecting two things at play. It’s either you’re targeting the wrong people or, you need to work on your copy and also add more CTA (Call to action). Hope this helps. Let me know of any other way i can help Quality content always attract readers. We all know that, content is king. Focusing only on quality content doesn’t matter, we also have to concentrate on other things like SEO, SMO, Backlinks, Guest Post etc to become a good blogger. I agree with you Kumar, 
But you’ll have to understand that quality content comes first before all those things. If your articles are crappy, you’ll be wasting your time doing SEO and the rest of them.  Also, before you can succeed with Guest Posting, your contents must be of higher quality too. Who will accept to publish poor written content on his blog?

2016-05-14,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/become-good-manager.html,How To Be An Excellent Manager Without Being Bossy,"Earlier post in this series: Part 1:  Part 2:  Part 3:  Good tips on how to manage yourself first. Not an easy thing to do but has to be done if you are a business person or a blogger. Time management is perhaps the most hardest part if you are trying to juggle many things around. I have already been doing this at the IT company that I’m the team lead for. (I run day to day operations on the floor among behind the scene stuff with client emails) I always have a schedule created for the following day so I have a general outline of what I want to accomplish but everyday things come up so I get off my schedule for awhile but eventually get back to it. My employee’s are my number 1 priority because without them doing work on the bench, we not making money. Any holds ups is my problem to resolve quickly.  I  live in Excel because I’m running reports, creating reports doing billing projections plus a lot more. Yes it’s stressful being the boss but I love what I do and always try to improve my management skills while on the job. In my line of work Technology changes fast so I keep up with it as I make suggestions to our clients and my higher up management people about possible changes to there contract but I do the dirty work and come up with figures….etc Since I am the last teamlead to leave for the day, I set up all techs with work for first thing in the morning. They come in and can start working right away and if need more work during the day we leads will bring more. Certain items at work can be escalated as the client wants it back A.S.A.P. so I make sure I mark these for certain techs to start first thing in the morning.   I am in charge of special projects at work for our clients… short team or long term ones that takes me about 3 weeks to get everything all set up before we launch it. You know predict any issues that might happen and have fixes already for these issues. Make sure we have all supplies that we need or order them ahead of time. Time is money and at my job, i’m always planning ahead besides working on the present stuff. Couldn’t agree more on first point.Most managers are hypocrites and that’s why they stale at managing.",nayneesh
2016-05-15,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/highlight-share-text-wordpress-twitter-plugin.html,How to Add Select Text & Share Feature in #WordPress For More Traffic,"As a blogger, your social media presence is essential to your success. Twitter is usually a primary choice for most of the bloggers and writers to share their work simply because it’s easy to use and is designed for speedy sharing and consumption. Everyone who is seeking exposure is on Twitter, and that includes bloggers like you and I. The most common way to   is to post a link to your latest content and hope that you get more visits and retweets from your followers. This strategy is great for attracting new readers to your blog, but sometimes it’s not enough. On average, there are 500 million tweets in a day, so your tweet has to grab a person’s attention just enough so he clicks on the link to your blog post. That’s not an easy feat. To make your tweets stand out, you have to put more effort into what you’re actually tweeting. Luckily for WordPress sites, there is a plugin that allow highlighted text to be shared on Twitter. The plugin is called  . Highlight and Share does exactly as it says — anyone viewing your website can highlight any text within your blog posts and share it on Twitter and Facebook. ? You might be wondering why there is a need to share a quote from a blog post rather than just sharing a link. While regular Twitter updates for new blog posts is a solid way to get more readers, sharing a quote instead of a simple link makes the approach more personal, and gives readers an idea as to what your content is all about. When audiences read a quote instead of a blog title, there is better chance that they will retweet it to their followers, hence more chances for increased blog traffic. After installing the plugin, all you have to do is go to Settings>Highlight and Share and pick from a list of features. This is where you enable or disable some aspects of sharing. I Here is an example from my test site: . You hit two birds with one stone by getting someone to read your article and share it at the same time. Plugins like Highlight and Share make the job so much easier — and it’s straightforward and easy to learn. It’s a good idea to try this plugin on your blog & see how your users are using it. For certain blogs like yours, it could do wonders. Before you add your comment, here are few more social media plugins for WordPress: great post, a very good plugin for marketing guys. Nice highlight technique. Thanks for sharing Kim!",Kim Barloso
2016-05-15,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/ecommerce-link-building-case-study.html,"From £0 To £11,000+ Per Month E-Commerce SEO","This case study outlines the exact link building steps we took in order to increase traffic and subsequently take our clients e-commerce site from £0 to over £11,000+ per month in revenue. The site is in the food niche and the profit margins are high. You’ve probably read a lot about SEO and link building. Whitehat,  , Greyhat, anchor text distribution yada yada. Much of what you have read has most likely been conflicting, which may have left you a little confused as to the best way to get backlinks to your website. The truth is there is no one size fits all strategy. Every industry and campaign is different and the way you go about obtaining backlinks should reflect this. The simple answer is to find out what your top ranked competitors are doing. If you aren’t sure who your main competitors are, it’s probably a good time to find out. A simple search for your main keywords in Google will provide you with the answer and from there you can start analysing the sites and find out exactly what they are up to. Let’s take two examples in two very different niches, to confirm the point there really is no one size fits all link building strategy. The games niche is huge, tens of thousands of terms, many  huge search figures. If we take the game Happy Wheels and do a quick search for some keywords we can see some decent search figures: If we search “happy wheels unblocked” in Google we can see the search results dominated by Google, Weebly and Wix sub domain sites, which is interesting if you were looking for good niches to do some parasite SEO. If we take the first standalone domain we can see US organic search figures at 11.8k (mobile) and 6.7k (desktop) – which is only a conservative monthly estimation of the traffic. Although not that relevant to this case study,   also provides data on the top organic keywords bringing in the traffic to the site, which is useful information for the keyword research phase: Either way the data reflects there is money to be made here. The next step is to put the domain through   or  . I use Majestic, it’s just a matter of choice. The overview reflects happy wheels related keywords would not be easy to rank for with a brand new domain: The anchor text distribution is interesting: 31% for “happy wheels”, which probably contradicts a lot of what you have read and reiterates the point that every industry is different, including the amount of times you should use your main keyword as your anchor text in order to rank highly without getting penalised. The backlinks to the site also contradict what could be described as “quality” “relevant” and within “Google’s guidelines”. Spam blog comments from a muslim related domain?!: Sitewide links from several cloned websites, most likely some kind of PBN: Analysis tells us blackhat techniques are most definitely working in this niche. Let’s take our second example a food sub-niche and similar to our clients. “organic food delivery” receives over 6,000 searches per month and will be highly lucrative: If we run the site ranking number 1 in the UK for that term through Majestic the overview indicates a very strong domain: The anchor text distribution looks a lot different from the happy wheels URL, indicating a far cleaner, more natural link building campaign: Analysis of the links indicate relationship building, free give-aways and high end directory submission. As you can see two very different methods to reaching the top in two very different niches. If you are going to use any blackhat techniques on a client site, the only rule is they know exactly what you are doing, agree to it, are fully aware of the risks and you have a strategy in place in case things go wrong (which thankfully doesn’t happen often). Offering discounts to organisations is a great way to build links and also to generate some direct sales. In terms of our clients site we were able to obtain several links from highly authoritative sites, including some .edu domains using this method: It’s a pretty simple tactic in which you approach organisations which offer their members discounts and pitch your own discount on the products or services you sell. It’s always best to target organisations whose members will likely be interested in your products. To find opportunities you could enter the following search strings in Google: 
 
 
 Further opportunities can be found by analysing the backlink profiles of the organisations already listed on the members page. For example Warner Leisure Hotels are listed on Sagas membership discount page: Analysing the backlink profile of their website, provides us with  : If we start working our way down the backlinks it doesn’t take long to find the first organisational discount link: It’s from the English Indoor Bowling Association, an organisation which could be pitched to but also providing another list of companies we can analyse for further opportunities: I’ve read recently that Google are clamping down on this technique and that all backlinks provided should be no followed. The truth is if every single link you work hard to obtain is no followed, you are going to rank for nothing. Much like many things in life it’s about common sense and doing things in moderation. Offering something free to influential bloggers in your niche, is a great way to get some promotion and build links. While many companies have money to burn and can afford to send out free stuff worth hundreds of dollars to bloggers I would call anything but influential, I prefer to pick and choose. Before making a commitment, you should check: The strength of the domain – using Majestic or ahrefs 
Organic search traffic estimation – using SEMRUSH 
Social account follower numbers and engagement levels To find opportunities you could use the following search strings in Google: 
 
 
 
 Once you have found some good sites that have provided reviews, reverse engineer those websites to uncover further opportunities. Sponsored posts are much like guest posts, except you pay for the privilege of posting your content on someone elses site. While in an ideal world we would have titled this section “Guest Post” and published our content for free, you will often find this isn’t a viable option for commercial businesses. While many bloggers in the food niche, were more than happy to accept guest posts from their fellow bloggers, they were a bit more reluctant to allow us to publish our content without receiving some cash first! Much like the free giveaway tactic, be prepared to do some analysis on the site you are thinking of publishing on. To find opportunities you could enter the following search strings in Google using either “guest” or “sponsored”: You can also find a  . We also found good opportunities on Twitter by searching for “keyword + sponsored post” While many low quality, spammed directories got targeted by Google a few years ago and were de-indexed, directory link building is an easy and solid way to obtain quality links. We prefer to submit to industry specific directories and also pay for the privilege, which normally costs between $20 – $100. While a paid directory normally indicates it is going to be of a higher quality, we still check the metrics and also look for opportunities that represent a little more than a directory. By that I mean you will see industry specific articles, information, images and videos on the site. Here are list of  . In order to find directories to submit your site to, you could enter the following search strings in Google: Turning non-linked mentions of your business is an easy and effective way to obtain some links. This   worked for us because our client was reasonably well known for the bricks and mortar side of the business. It’s important to note that if you are a brand new e-commerce company it’s highly unlikely you will be able to find any mentions of your business. In order to find mentions you could use   or  , both tools will provide you with notifications of when your brand is mentioned. After you receive notification head over to the page, if you have already been provided with a link, your work is done, if there is no link visible then reach out with an email similar to this: Hopefully, you found this guide useful and can use some of the techniques mentioned to build links to your own website. The full case study, which includes sections on keyword research, email marketing, on page SEO and various other things we implemented  . Hi James,    Fantastic post. I am also considering this post is very helpful for micro niche blogs also. Thanks for sharing. Regards 
shajeer Hi Shajeer. Thanks, much appreciated. A lot of what I spoke about and did could be used to build and optimise micro niche sites yes. James. What an in-depth case study!! I am very much impressed with the result. Thanks for sharing up such a nice thought. Thanks Tanmoy, the client is also impressed with the result, which is the most important thing.

2016-05-13,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/best-iphone-camera-accessories.html,10 Kickass Smartphone Camera Accessories for Youtube bloggers (Velfies),"This is the 3rd post in our Video marketing series. With this series, my goal is to help you make better videos with your smartphone or camera. Here are two earlier posts in this series: In the recent past, nothing has come closer to disruption of an Industry like the smartphone has done with the camera and video recorder industry. The camera that started out as an added mechanism in the smartphone has become a full-fledged device used by professionals all over the world to capture photos and to shoot videos. [Tweet “This Smartphone disruption has brought about a new change & a change for good!”] Everybody knows building mobile applications  is a  lucrative opportunity and hardware creators have realized the same. They can build products that compliment the features of the smartphone and add immense value to the user at 1/3rd the cost. Let’s take a look at an   that will help people take video selfies. Even though many of these gadgets work perfectly fine with some of the popular Smartphone companies like Samsung, Lenovo, Gionee to name a few. But, I’m keeping this post more targeted towards iPhone users as I was making & researching about cool video accessories for my personal use. Also, if you are a GoPro users, you won’t be disappointed as many of the listed Camera accessories is compatible with GoPro too. Today we look at cross-functional gadgets that help you take better videos in different scenarios. We cover a wide range of requirements and the gadget that can help you in that situation. The makes of the Ollo Clip are one of the leading lens manufacturers for the iPhone camera that gives you a DSLResque experience to your iPhone. The Ollo Clip is an attachable device which you can fix on top of your iPhone camera lens with the help of a special phone case. The Ollo Clip has multiple variants that help you with different options for videography. There are lenses which support wide angle shots, some which support macro zoom which goes all the way up to 21x. Depending on the nature of your videos you could choose the right kind of Ollo Clip. There is even a version for taking selfies or velfies which is pretty neat. To Summarize the Ollo Clip is one of the best smartphone gadgets out there for taking brilliant photos and videos which give a much better experience than the iPhone camera. This kind of a device is also great for portability because of it’s relatively small size and removable lens cap ||  Special Mention :  is another company which makes similar lenses for the iPhone. We move on to a professional equipment company called the iographer. The iographer is an iPhone and iPad filmmaking case. This is not a case for your phone for protecting it, but a case for filmmaking that you take out to shoots. The iOgrapher is a multi-compatible device with provisions for fixing a   and other equipment like lighting and sound. You can carry this one single case in and have all the options of filmmaking like light, sound, and stability in one place. It’s portable enough that you can carry it in your bag. There are iographer cases even for the iPad as well. This kind of a device is a great investment for a filmmaking student or a video blogger who needs a  . If you Consider the provisions for other devices that can be attached to the iographer, then it makes this a thorough and professional video creating device for the iPhone.  ||  If you are a new to taking videos on your smartphone and want to start somewhere, the first thing that you will probably purchase is a . What if you could get something with a similar functionality, that had other uses as well? Meet Mega Tiny’s anti-gravity case. This case is fit with nano-suction technology that you could stick it up against any surface and shoot your videos. If you don’t have a tripod and you want to place a video of you walking and talking in front of the camera at a particular height, all you have to do is, stick it against the wall and you have your wall mounted camera ready.  ||  The tripod is a great device for filming steady shots and has been the corner stone of every videographer’s great camera skills. The tripod though has evolved and the tripods these days have to be cross-functional. A tripod just doing a tripod’s job is too conventional and can be bulky. The Joby Tripod stand is a perfect example of a multi-functional tripod stand that can be adjusted to suit multiple situations. The Griptight Gorillapod hybrid is one of the finest tripods we’ve seen. We’ll show you the power of this tripod through pictures. In the first image, you can see a simple tripod stand And in the second image, you can see the tripod stand in a different shape to suit the environment!  ||  Everybody has seen the Go pro camera and it is a great device for outdoorsy folk who like some action. The problem with devices in this world are, there are too many devices. The use case for a Go pro is also limited. What would you do if you want to take videos in rugged environments that mimic a Go pro’s experience without having to buy one? The answer is the Optrix sports case. It’s a case created for the iPhone with an extra layer of protection for your phone and can be mounted on your helmet, exactly like a Go pro. This way your iPhone can become a video recorder in a rugged environment as well. Body Glove, the company behind Optrix have also created a water proof case for underwater shots. There is truly no limit to what you can shoot with your iPhone with gadgets like this. Here is a hands-on video of Optrix sports case:  ||  This is a nifty device that automates the process of taking a video shooting a picture. The Shuttr from Muku Labs is a blue tooth controlled device with which you can take a picture or shoot a video on your iPhone from 30 feet away. Think of it as a remote control for activating your phone’s camera or video. This is really good for movie videos or a documentary you want to shoot while you are moving and while you are shooting alone.  ||  This is another case of a multi-functional tripod stand.   when it comes to tripods. The Pixi works as a   for taking moving shots without a lot of shakiness. So the tip here is to get functional tripod stands based on your requirement because a lot of them are multi-functional. The Pixi also has a   to tilt the head of the tripod in any angle, this helps to camera shots in a particular angle without having to position yourself differently. Here is a pretty cool review by Paul that might make you grab this little beast right away: A collection of iPhone video gadgets is not complete without the selfie stick. The Selfie stick that we cover today is the Xshot Sport Pole selfie stick. The Xshot sport is water proof and an extremely sturdy selfie stick. If you are getting a selfie stick, it might as well be on that can last you for long and in different conditions. It’s very long compared to many of it’s competitors and does its job well. For the GoPro users, it alo supports GoPro.  || The MCAM is another case with an attached lens that helps in zooming in and for shooting in wide angles. The speciality the MCAM has it’s the function based features. They have a filmmakers pack, then a journalists pack which gets you the perfect equipment for your situation.  ||  As promised, we finish with Manfrotto’s Klyp+. The Klyp is another case based iPhone video and photo gadget. This gadget is so small and has provisions for all kinds of features that requires a special mention. The Klyp is not as big as the iOgrapher and is easily portable and it works with the Pixi tripod seamlessly because they are made from the same company. The Klyp also has a provision for a light to throw on objects which create an ultimate shooting scenario for the videographer. It also has a lens that can be attached to the iPhone’s default lens.  ||  This post has been an eye-opener for me in the terms of products and the way technology is shaping. With devices such as the iPhone which have strong fundamentals mean one thing, they are good enough to replace independent devices such as cameras albeit in the start of a videographer’s career. Instead of having multiple devices like a Go Pro and a video camera, all a person needs is multiple cases that they can get at 1/3rd the cost. This way they do not have electronic items lying around in the house that are not being used. I hope this post has given you the idea of the gadgets that can be used for making videos with the iPhone! Now got shoot!  ? Here are few hand-picked posts for video bloggers: nice cool gadgets,

2016-05-08,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/happy-team-means-better-business.html,Here is the Most Critical Factor For Success Of Your Startup,"[Tweet ““If you are an “A”, player then you must hire an “A+” player in your team”.”] For further reading: Hi Nayneesh, 
Thanks for sharing this helpful article, The things you shared are very useful to make any start-up success. Keep it up. I always prefer Analyse and Skills. I believe that if you have not enough skill to do something, you will not success later. So before going to do something, everyone should gather minimum knowledge(Skill). 
Thanks for sharing this information… I don’t use this methods for my online blogging stuff but for my career job yes and I do a lot more then what you mentioned. I have worked for a huge IT company for the past 16 years (work anniversary is actually today). I just turned 36 and you do the math. I started there at a young age and have moved up the scale throughout the years to become the Team Lead for my department running day to day operations on the tech floor with a ton of authority to do things.  I made lots of changes since I became the boss because the idea’s I had in my head for so many years I know had the chance to make it happen and if it worked it would make our employee’s happy about the place they work at and eager to come back the next day besides still satisify our clients.   I am the one boss who at least once a day goes up to one of my techs or a few and look them in the eyes and thank them for the hard work they put in that day and it means a lot to the company.  Just by doing this, the employee is happy that his boss takes notice of his work he does and is happy with what he is doing. I can be mean if I have to but I don’t.  We getting ready to role out a bonus program meaning 1 tech on each shift will get a small bonus check at every quarter. Now the same tech can not win multiple ones in the same year so it makes it fair. But we won’t tell the tech’s how we come up with the winner. They have to figure out how they can become the top guy to get it. One thing I look for is teamwork and someone who would drop what they are working on to help another tech who might be struggling 1 day with a certain problem. That’s 2 things I will take note of.  I was a bench tech for over 10 years so I know the stressful job the techs have and also having to do whatever there boss tells them to do.. So I figure out ways to not get the tech unhappy with me but still do what I ask of him. Sometimes I stop my daily activites and will do 1 or 2 orders myself on the bench while people look at me saying to each other… Why is the boss doing our work?  Yes, I like to still show off that I still have the skills they do even though I am a boss.  My department is the repair department. We  repair all kids of stuff. Servers, printers, cash register setup (whole thing you see), desktops, laptops and this year getting into repair mobile devices. I have 2 techs going away next week for a whole week getting trained by certified Apple employee’s and Android employee;s. Then these 2 techs need to study and get there IOS certs to be able to fully repair any mobile device.   We pay for techs to get trained and for any IT certification they want to get.. Hey Derek, It was a small but a nice read. You could too inspire the generation. The first 5 paras were really good, but not sure about the last one. Anyway, it was a god read and hope to read more from you anytime soon, if you write. Cheers! Wow , Its totally true. Working without a functional team can be boring , And without a team one can end up not completing his or her mission ..  Thanks for the info. I envy Shoutmeloud team Informative Post. 
I totally agree on making work fun. 
It’s critical factor. Thanks Nayneesh for your post here on Shoutmeloud. Cheers Mate. Everything that you have said here is very true. Currently I work in an environment that is trying to implement many of the ideas you have given here. This is in an effort to keep employees fully engaged and happy at work. This will translate to better customer service and higher profits while lowering costs. All entrepreneurs should follow this and when hiring should really consider the soft-skills and the certification of others before hiring someone to join their team. You have hit the nail on the head. Great work and keep posting more content like this. ~ Shane Hay Shane, Thanks a ton for appreciating. I am happy to know that the organization you work for is willing to implement the elements mentioned in the blog. And I surely will post more and more blogs. Cheers! Hi Avtar, Thanks a ton for appreciating. Hope you get the right team and achieve what you mean to. Cheers! Very well explained NAYNEESH, 
I got an idea to work with a team after reading your article.I want to make my office and also want to hire a team.But I got a way from you to work with a team as fun really Awesome. 
Thanks for sharing such great articles with us. Really a mind blowing article which really gave me knowledge ! Shout out to shout me loud ! That’s the high quality content that’s why I read posts on shout me loud",nayneesh
2016-05-09,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/freelancers-say-no-clients.html,Freelancers: How to Say No To Your Clients Without Feeling Guilty,"Becoming a “yes” man or woman is typical when you’re in the freelance business, especially when you’re starting out. You try so hard to win clients, please them at every turn, and ensure that the likelihood of receiving projects in future sky-high. However, what about when you face a situation where saying “no” is clearly better than signing up for something you know you can’t manage due to time constraints or some other reason? How do you decline without hurting their feelings, appearing incompetent, or risk losing any chance of receiving projects from them in the future? This is a sticky situation for many, particularly those of us who find saying “no” difficult. This is why we’ve gathered a few tips that will teach you the trick to saying “no” without doing too much damage. Often we try to exchange what should be our top priority with work we shouldn’t have signed up for in the first place. For example, if you always have a specific number of hours set out for quality time with your family, don’t make it a habit to exchange this with work that randomly pops up. This could be true for other priorities as well, such as time for yourself, time for another high-paying project, or time for another high-value client. Be it a weekend or after-work hours, tell your client upfront that it can’t be done during those hours, and you’d be willing to do them at another time. Prone to being a “yes” man? Don’t worry that can change. How? The same way you try to learn anything—with plenty of practice! You probably face situations where people try to push you to your limits. Even though you feel like you should be saying “no,” you reluctantly choose to say yes. It is during these situations you should learn to say “no.” Understand the fact that saying “no” is not bad at all, especially when you know that saying “yes” would lead to even more unpleasant consequences. In some cases, an outright “no” as a response is not necessary. For example, if the client isn’t in a hurry for when the project is handed in, tell him that you’ll start on it as soon as you are done with what you are currently working on. Of course, you need to convince them by providing more information about other due dates and where on your calendar their project will “fit in”. If they’re in a hurry, though, postponing may not be an option, and you might have to reject the offer. If you’re reluctant to sign up for an assignment because you feel you’re not being paid enough, can’t offer the required services, or feel that the contract would violate “ethics” in some way, talk it out. Again, you don’t have to give an outright “no” in these situations. Perhaps, you feel you can negotiate the terms. For example, you can tell your client that with time and experience, you have realized that the market value of your work is higher. Give objective facts and figures and point out why they could be higher in your region. Or perhaps, you could request your client to drop a few tasks and reduce the volume of work. That way, you’re not exactly saying “no”. You’re simply giving them a counter offer and the whether to accept or reject the project is totally up to them. This one always works when you’re trying your best to be polite! If you’re worried about offending your potential client’s feelings, you don’t always have to use this seemingly rude two-letter word. Learn the art of saying no without actually saying no! For example, you can say, “I appreciate that you offered me this job, but unfortunately, I’m swamped with [X project].” Or, “That would be great, but it’s too bad I have to [commitment]. This time, you might have to look for someone else”. Perhaps, you can simply state your busy schedule until a certain date and offer work after that date. There are plenty of ways you can “no” without actually saying it! In the end, the best way to say “no” without doing much damage is to say it as politely as possible. Also, try, to be honest about your schedule, commitments, or other preferences it could come in conflict with. First, always try to listen to the request and avoid interrupting until they are finished. Then, tell them you’re tied up and that you simply can’t do it at this time. Always remember that a   Not only would that waste time and money (client’s), but also result in even more “sticky” situations and a much less likelihood of the client hiring you again. Hi Eddwarn, I’m in total agreement with the post. I have been getting a lot of offers lately to do some private work and the truth is I’m not sure I can handle all of it. Some are more lucrative than others therefore it makes it very difficult to decide which offer to turn down. I think one of the main problems freelancers have is that you never really know where your next project is coming from or if it will all ‘dry up’ at some point, so you begin to think it may be better to do as much as you can now to rally you through when times get slow. I believe that freelancers need to think more like businessmen and try to expand their reach by doing less and outsourcing more. Since all of these offers are coming in that’s the way I’m heading now. It allows me to take on more jobs while not doing all the work myself. It also allows me to have some free time. Saying no is great advice but freelancers should also look long and hard at their business model and tweak it. They may begin to realise they don’t have to work as hard after all. This is what I really wanted to do. Thanks for a meaningful post. Often we come across situations like this , which needs  a “no” Amazing topic to write a blog. One of the best quote from Steve Jobs saying : 
“And it comes from saying no to 1000 things to make sure we don’t get on the wrong track or try to do too much.” I am totally agree with this line.  Let me share my experience. There is a situation in which client give us two phase keywords and its search volume is very high and competition is very tough. So, practically it is not possible to bring those keywords on top 10 position within just one month of time. Here is my reply to that client :  Hello sir, we respect your given keywords list but as per my SEO experience I would like to suggest you other suggested keywords which are quite beneficial for you to get sales as well as leads. The reason behind is that your given keywords are very broad keywords & not beneficial to get quality CTR, sales & inquiries though they have maximum amount of search volumes. So, it is advisable to change your given keywords & try to target some other keywords which are beneficial to get the sales & leads. This is a perfect reply given by me to the client and with no surprise client is very happy & give us project. What do you think of this answer folks? We are registering a company and this tip is saying NO and don’t try to hard to win client is very good. Most of time saying yes may backfire back to us when we can’t deliver or promise the task allocated. Thanks 
Rahul First is to thank you for all this informative posts you give us for free; i bet all of us are happy. 
Such a great idea of yours! You have been a big help for me. Thanks a lot. more post for interesting topic. Great! Hello Eddwarn, 
Saying no to your clients itself is an art which every freelancer should know because sometimes situations arise when you need to say NO to your clients for various reasons. Nice tips shared by you. Thank you so much. Hello EDDWARN Buddy, 
Yeah Seriously, Sometimes we feel guilt in saying no to customers but your handy tips can be life savior for all of us! 
Thanks for sharing seriously! I really loved the phrases to say no to people. I deal with a lot of customers and this will be very helpful for me. Sometimes the situations happen that you want to do something for someone but your are unable to do it because of some limitations. Hello Eddwarn. 
Sometimes situations arise when you are unable to do the work or the work is not profitable, at that time your above-mentioned tips come handy because this is a serious business and a negative word of mouth can harm the entire business,. Sowe should learn how to say no in such a way that no one feel angry. Hi Eddwarn, Saying No to clients and known people is very difficult, sometimes I do say yes to so many people who will ask me some favors which I don’t like to do. Alternative phrases which you mentioned in this article are really very good to say NO, I will start implementing these methods in my lifestyle, thanks for sharing such an informative and worthful article. Hi Eddwarn, This is a great piece of advice for freelancers of all stripes.. web services, coaching, campaign management… anything that requires your personal time rather than digital trainings. I do a lot of coaching with bloggers and online entrepreneurs, but every month I limit the number of people I will work with one-on-one.   If I don’t, then I’ll spend all my time helping my clients grow their business while mine withers on the vine. There’s another reason to reject clients, though. You know when a mentor says they want to know what you want to accomplish in order to see if you meet threshold for their coaching program?  Well, you should do this AND you should mean it.  You decide who you can best work with and politely refuse those who don’t match up. A funny thing happens when you do this. Quick story… I’ve been an offline consultant for years.  The more I decline to work with a prospective client (for a wide variety or reasons), the more they want me to.  They offer to pay more, use less of my time or whatever it takes to get me on board.   For me, though, it’s not about money, although sometimes my time is at issue.  Usually it’s about attitude and coach-ability.  If I don’t  think I can help someone, or if I don’t really want to try because their attitude would be a drain on my energy… I simply decline. I’ve never lost business with this attitude, and like I say, when the word gets out that I really am discriminating in this way, people want my service all the more. Imagine…  So, yea, this is great advice.  Thanks for offering it here.",eddwarn
2016-05-12,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/indirect-serach-engine-ranking-factors.html,4 Indirect Search Engine Ranking Factors You Should Never Ignore,"It’s time to change the way we do SEO because those days were gone when   was the only factor to rank well. Everyone wants to improve their search results, want to earn more organic traffic. There is no one who doesn’t want free, high-quality organic traffic. Every marketer is giving some amount focus towards SEO and yes there are many things that have a direct approach towards SEO. There are many marketing activities that we probably don’t know, but indirectly they affect the search traffic. Today, here I’m e going to talk about few ways that will indirectly be going to help you to increase your search ranking. Many people think that there is no connection between user feedback and SEO. But I assure all of them that there is an indirect connection. Having feedback from your customers is going to help in many ways. Of course, it’s a time taking process. However, if businesses are going to get user feedback and using it in a correct way, then it can help them out in different ways. Only they have to follow two things: Every business focuses on customer satisfaction but how one can be assured about this. For this, you have to communicate with the customers without making them annoyed. You have to find out the chances to interact with them likewise communication just after the sale. It’s obvious that when someone is going to use your products/services, they want some reassurance regarding quality service. For this purpose, you can directly call or email them confirming about their products/services and make them free to contact for any future help. The best thing about getting feedback from the customer after they used your product is to know about real user experience. Once they use your services, they will share their working experience with you. This will help you to make your services much better so that it can help you to retain happy customers. If your customer says that they are feeling great with your services, then you should ask them to share their experience with the world. Since they are happy with your support, then they will help you out in many ways. You can also choose few things that can help your SEO like ask them to put a review of yours on a quality Review site, for example, Yelp, Yahoo local, Yellow Pages, etc. The better customer experience you have, the higher your profile will appear on high-quality sites. Here are  Sites having high authority will pass some of the authority to those websites that are top listed there in the niche category. Having good amount of profile over many authority review site will improve your search authority at some level. These reviews can provide direct business customer and search authority in not a big way but in a good amount that will be noticeable. In every business area, there are many events happening throughout the year. Anyone can easily find out local events related to the same niche. Many believe that joining conferences can be a waste of time, but I think it can help in many ways, just like building relationships and learning from experts. Events can create a road for you to get many opportunities. In conferences, you will meet many people of your industry and there you had a chance to discuss your product/services. You can also email them your latest post and ask them to give feedback. What else can help you is that if they like your post then most probably they will link to it. This link back will have a huge impact on your search ranking. Else you can also offer to create a guest post for them, and this will help you to create more links. You can easily find out any conference by searching over Google. Only you have to put Query as: Go to many lists as you can to find out the best one. One thing I want to clear that it may be a worthless or valuable event, it’s on you how you are going to spend your time for the specific event. If you are a sole owner then you have a lot of workloads then it’s quite obvious you can’t do everything alone. Mostly, busy people hires experienced   to have quality content. Good Freelancers do their job very carefully, and their content became easiest to rank over SE. If you are going to hire a freelance writer, then offer them some good opportunities to talk about. When you build a great relation with them, they will take more interest to write a valuable content and then, of course, they will share their piece of writing all over the net. You will found that your writer is going to help you in an indirect way. Having a website is not good enough you also have to focus on some factor by keeping in mind UX. It is found that usually users leave the pages because of the low-quality website, and this will lead to increase in  . How Google finds you best for user experience? When a searcher clicks on your page from SERP then if he will stay on your page then you did a good job, but if searcher came back to Google, then it will show that your website doesn’t satisfied user choice. So, if you are going to improve your user experience, then it will increase your visitor’s number and indirectly the search engine ranking. Three basic factors of User Experience: In this process, internal linking also plays a great role, but  . This will also help users as they find the relevancy between your sites pages, the bounce rate will decrease and leads to the improvement in better ranking. By doing all research and spending my time with SEO, I found that if you have the assumption that I have done everything which was necessary then this is the right time to wake up. There could be lots of other ways which may be treated as indirect SEO factors but they producing good values for your web pages like few which I shared above. Indirect factors are largely being missed by business owners. Therefore, it’s better to focus our SEO strategy in these factors on bringing more sparks in our results. Do let me know what other indirect factors affect search engine ranking? I would love to hear your opinion in the comment section below. And, do share this article on your favourite social networking sites. its really helpful . could you please elaborate how so can be improved for shorter posts . like if i need to write product description and it can not exceed more than 300 words . what could be optimisation factors for that . Great, I think feedback page is now a important page for every blog. It can help to get adsense. In this article tell about Customer Feedback that play very important role in the site ranking and site traffic. If we don’t replay our customer then they not visit our site again in future Hey Shalu Thanks for sharing this kind of good info. But main thing is content quality, that should be awesome. If your content has useful tips then it will really attractive.

Sorry for that,I mean how to increase loading speed and is there any tool which measures website loading speed Yes True but main thing is Content Quality. User will attract if they found something useful Hi Shalu,

Thank you for sharing this note. Thanks Shalu for this awesome post! I love the way you explain about attending the niche events. These events boost up your confidence and help you to seek new ideas from like minded people. Thanks 
~Abhishek There are 200+ ranking factors that effect search engine ranking. But Google do not say clearly what are they. it is still good that we analyze and find out what are they, and work on them to rank higher in search engine. your tips are helpful to rank higher in search engine. When a blog is new and there are lesser number of articles in it, in that case bounce rates will be higher. In that case does google take that as a negative feedback??? 
In that case launching a website with 30-40 articles is that advisable??? As far as I think, no it doesn’t hurt to launch a website without article. 
Google can determine website age obviously and considers too. 
If you have 30-40 articles ready, it is actually great. I think you can setup your blog and schedule one article a day for next 30-40 days, (and make sure you ping Google and other search engine bots after the article is published). It will create an impression that the new site is updating regularly and hence given more weightage by Search Engine and visitors. 
It also gives you some time to prepare other such articles (say 20) which are not time constraint dependent. You can schedule them each for one alternate day (after your 30-40 articles are published). 
This way when you get something fresh to talk about (or something which is related to time constraint) you can go ahead and published during the days when any article is not scheduled (or reschedule the article if your new post is more important). It is up to you how to balance.But content for almost next 3 months is ready with you. 
And to me A blog which is updated regularly since last 3 months is more reliable which is launched today with 30-40 articles. 
Another good point is, while all these of your articles are being published you are receiving readear’s feedback and also able to analyze the behavior of the visitor (say using Google Analytics). It will help you plan better. And, ultimately the blog is made to be read right?, so getting input from someone else than the creator, is one of the most important aspect. 
On my blog, I often does it for the reviews for anything which is classic, publishing about it anytime won’t hurt, and it give me something to publish even if I am busy with something else. 
Please do share your thoughts and strategy here, and we can all learn from each -other’s experiences. This article is not right . 70% of this is wrong you are misleading the people by saying that backlinks are not the best way to rank a website . i will rank a website with backlinks can you do that without backlinks ?",Shalu
2016-05-11,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-make-url-shortener-under-your-domain-wordpress.html,The Easiest Way To Create Branded URL Shortener with your Domain,"Being online is all about branding, and it doesn’t matter how you do it, but more people see your brand name, more they are likely to remember it.Using a good URL shortening script you can also configure it to see stats and other details. Moreover, with growing need of short URL’s (As short URL’s are easy to share on sites like Twitter), it’s a good idea to use your brand name. There are many   and much shorter in letters, which are quite easier to share on social services. Today, I will be sharing an easy to follow tutorial for those, who would like to self-host a URL shortener under their domain name. If you own a website and want to create such your URL shortening service then here is a very easy way to do with very little technical skills required. This service is free to use & all you need is a domain name in your Godaddy account. You can use below link & coupon to get the domain name for only $1 (Valid for new account only) & follow the steps outlined below. Sign up:   (Use Coupon:  ) Godaddy offers a URL shortener for their customer & anyone who have a Godaddy account can use it. What interesting about this service here is; you can also use your domain to create a URL shortener. You can keep the URL shortener Public or private; that’s your choice. Some of the features of this tool are: To get started with this, head over to  & login with your Godaddy account. If you don’t have an account,   & buy a domain name. It’s recommended to buy a 3 or 4 letter domain name to keep your URL short. You can also transfer your existing domain name from other registrars to Godaddy & then use it for URL shortener. If you are planning to do that & need a guide for the same, let us know & one of ShoutMeLoud member will write a guide on the same. On the shortener.godaddy.com, click on the settings at the top to start configuring On the settings page, click on help first to get your A & TXT record that we need to update. This will point our domain to Godaddy URL Shortener & then we will be able to further configure everything. Note: I haven’t tested this method with the domain registered from another registrar. If you anyone of you try it, let us know it works or not. Click on Finish & on the next page click on save changes. Similarly, add TXT value & click on save changes. Usually, the changes take effect within 5 minutes. Go back to GoDaddy URL Shortener & click on settings. Let me quickly explain few settings here: Here is what my settings look like: In case if you get an error “Your domain hasn’t been verified. This can take a few minutes.”, That means the changes have not been replicated & you need to wait some time. Also, Ensure that you don’t have duplicate A record. You can   to check the updated record. Once everything is configured, you can quickly start shortening your URL’s under your branded domain name :) Test link: http://gdaddyusers.com/4ABM One popular method is using YOURLS script which is . What I like about YOURLS are the  . You can add tons of feature to your branded URL shortener with plugins. Though it requires more technical skill than above to run YOURLS. If you are accustomed to using FTP, database, and making changes in your core file, you should be able to configure YOURLS. I recommend you first to try it on your local installation of  PHP and MYSQL server. You can refer to below guides for configuring local PHP & mySQL server. Another method that I have used is using Bit.ly to create URL shortener. I have been using it for a while but after news about Bit.ly adding affiliate token to many shortened URL’s under the free account, I wouldn’t recommend the same for you or anyone. Overall, the Godaddy method is pretty easy to use & one can get started with his/her branded URL shortener in no time. If you know of any other useful method to create custom URL shortener, let us know in the comment section below. If you have found this guide useful, do share it with others on Facebook & Twitter. 
 
 Godaddy is best for this feature! Most of popular tech blogs and one of them Lifehacker recommend   instead of  . 
 I have registered my domain name on Namecheap, So is there any other method? I have one doubt what if we are using CloudFlare for DNS hosting ? Also CJC99COM is no more available in India @Chris 
In that case you will be adding A record & TXT record on Cloudflare. As per other users, CJC99COM coupon is for new users only. I’m also using godaddy but i didn’t know this feature. Thanks for sharing useful information. Never Heard of the GoDaddy URL Shortening. Thanks for sharing the useful information with us. Now, These links will make sense. Unlike other shortening services, we can use our own brand name on the shortened link. This type of URL Shortening can be very effective when we share those links on social media profiles. Hello 
         Harsh thanks again introduce to new tips for blogging nice . Nice information, thanks for sharing. Bro Did you mean URL like mysite.com/xyz    ?????? 
Then This Cool! It means a owned alternative of URL shortener like goo.gl & bit.ly etc.",Harsh Agrawal
2016-05-10,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/facebook-instant-articles-setup-wordpress.html,The Mega Guide To Configure Facebook Instant Articles for WordPress,"Want to drive more traffic from Facebook & earn more money? If your answer is yes, today seems to be your lucky day.. Read on… The Facebook instant articles are not new to the users like you who is so net savvy. As a blogger & webmasters, Fb instant article is a boon & a curse. Boon because it will give us more traffic from Facebook & at the same time it’s bad; as you won’t be able to show your widgets or email box like you do right now. Needless to say, the Facebook instant article is here to stay &  sooner you would integrate it, better it would be for you. I have waited for quite long to share this article with you; as I wanted to give you all necessary details & guide to configure FB instant articles with your website. Today, I will be sharing the complete tutorial + a video guide to help you setup Facebook instant articles for your blog. If you are not aware of Instant articles by Fb, let me quickly give you an overview of what it is & why it matters. The instant article is a feature by Facebook that solves the problem of slow loading of articles. An Instant Article is a HTML5 document optimized for fast mobile performance, rich storytelling capabilities, branded design and customized the visual display. Once you have enabled Instant articles on your website/blog, after that whenever your articles are shared on Facebook, users surfing on the mobile app should be able to see instant article icon. The icon represents that the article is an instant article & it would open within seconds.  In the below image you can see how instant articles icon look like: I’m sure many of you already have experienced Instant articles when using the Facebook mobile app on your smartphone. If not, from now on pay attention or check few posts on   using your Facebook mobile app. There are many pros & cons of using Facebook Instant articles, but pros outweigh cons in the majority of cases. Since Instant articles are not too old and there is a great room for improvement & innovation in the coming days. Instant articles are very crucial for countries like Brazil, India, Philippines & many other countries where low connectivity is an issue.  Check out this video to understand how Instant articles look on a smartphone: I will cover the pros & cons of Facebook instant articles in coming days & for now let’s setup Instant articles for our WordPress blog. I would suggest you to go through the steps mentioned below & then watch the video guide.  , start configuring Instant articles for your WordPress site. It should take about 15 minutes to configure everything & within one day, Instant articles should be live for your website. So, let’s get started: This will lead you to next page where you need to select the Facebook page where you would like to enable Instant articles tool. Here we need to do following things: We will also be configuring official Instant articles WordPress plugin that I have covered in-depth below. If you feel you will be stuck in between, don’t worry as the video guide will make it easier for you to follow everything. A user with basic computer skills should be able to follow this guide. So let’s get started: Click on Claim your URL & that would give you a Meta tag which you need to add to your Website <head> tag. You can do the same by editing your header.php file or if you are using   like me, watch the video below. Once you have added the Meta tag, do clear your WordPress cache. Now, click on Claim URL & you would see a success message as shown below. The next step is to setup the RSS feed for Instant articles which would be done with the help of official WordPress plugin for Facebook Instant articles. RSS Feed & Official Facebook Instant articles plugin: Facebook has partnered with   to make it convenient for bloggers to create and post Instant Articles. Install  . This plugin is developed by Facebook, Automattic & few more developers. Upon activation of plugin, a new feed has been generated & you can check it by adding  to your domain name. So, in my case it was: Go back to your Facebook page instant Articles setting & add this RSS feed into the ‘  area (Refer to below screenshot) Click on Save & now let’s get the last few things done. Click on Create App ID & on the next page, enter your website URL without HTTP:// Click on Next & then click on Skip quick start guide. On the next page, you would see your App ID & App secret. ( I suggest you to ). Click on next & that’s it. The plugin is configured & now you need to submit articles for review Now, before we complete the final submit for review step, click on Style & click on default style: Here you need to add your website logo (Mandatory) that should be in the size of  . Tip: If you don’t have the logo, simply create a blank canvas of the size 690*132 in   or any other image editor tool you have & use your blog name as logo. Once you have uploaded the logo, click on save & done. Now, this is where it gets tricky, as you need to submit 10 posts for review. Here is what you can do: Once that is done, you will be able to submit your articles for review. It usually takes about 3-4 days for your submission to get approval. For one of my blog I got following error: Fatals For that blog, I deleted all posts from Instant article production which were giving errors & resubmitted for review. For ShoutMeLoud, I got approved & after approval, the screens look like below. One important thing, you should enable the auto publishing from RSS feed. Update:  Here is the video guide that I have mentioned above. This would clear any doubt that you might have for configuring Instant articles for your WordPress blog: One of the thing that most of the publishers are worried about is monetizing articles served via Facebook instant articles. Well, Facebook has open   which let you earn 100% of revenue generated via it.

I am waiting for your reply. Thanks!! Wow! Thanks for the guide. I did not know about Facebook Instant Article at first, and now i know how to implement it. This information is very helpful. Great work. @Diverse

While Configuring i got the below Error 
When i Claim the URL The fb:pages tag on the url doesn’t contain this page’s id. The url has fb:pages tag but they don’t have this page’s id. Please work with your developers / webmaster to add this tag to your website. Can you Help me in this ?? @Sudheer 
How are you adding the meta tag? Open your site homepage, check source code & see if meta tag is there or  not. If it’s there, most probably  it’s cache issue. You need to flush all the cache & also from Cloudflare (if you are using it). 
Try & let me know Hi Harsh,

It is something am having issues with at the moment. Thanks Harsh for being a good online friend. You rock! Hi Harsh, I am getting the below error message while trying to log in from my Facebook for “Instant Articles” plugin from WordPress.  “Given URL is not allowed by the Application configuration: One or more of the given URLs is not allowed by the App’s settings. It must match the Website URL or Canvas URL, or the domain must be a subdomain of one of the App’s domains.” Please suggest. I have already got the solution. I think in article you have missed one step. After Creating your Facebook app and making it live, you will have to go to the Settings tab and then click on Advanced settings. In advanced settings, you will have to define “OAuth redirect URIs for Facebook App” otherwise the WordPress plugin will not allow you to connect to the app. In the redirect url I have used the name of my domain and I was able to successfully connect the WordPress plugin to the Facebook.  Also after installing the WordPress plugin, please check in the instruction whether you will have to use   or   . I had used only http:// which was causing problem but my WP plugin recommended me to use   Then my problem got solved. Thank You,

I have always been fond of facebook. Lately increasing my engagement rate was big challenge.

Hey Harsh this is what we all are looking for, thanks for sharing :) Hey I want to know does AdSense adds works in instant article @Shashank 
I’m yet to explore that part. Will share about the same in coming days. Hi Harsh, I am getting this error when I am trying to sign in “Given URL is not permitted by the Application configuration: One or more of the given URLs is not permitted by the App’s settings. It must match the Website URL or Canvas URL, or the domain must be a subdomain of one of the App’s domains.” @Shoeb 
Seems like you making mistake in the configuration of facebook app. Can you watch the video & follow the exact steps mentioned. Let me know if that works for you or not. I have solved the problem. Thanks Harsh for your post. Very Informative article and clear instructions, was just wondering if facebook is being fed our article via our rss that means they will get published instantly, does that mean our original articles on our website will loose link juice and get pushed down the list on search engines since fb has higher authoritative page and domain rank ? @Alex 
It won’t hurt your link juice or create   as Instant article uses the  .  “The URL specified in your Instant Article markup is used to associate the Instant Article version of your article to the web version. This association is important as it helps determine which version of the article to present to a reader based on their platform.” That’s great then if its going to assist in driving more traffic without affecting link juice, thanks for the info, appreciate it. Hi Harsh Great Information, I just follow these steps and try implementing this instant article option. It’s really sound great. Thanks for sharing. Arpit Wow so intersting , such a simplest way to explain the steps. I heard before about facebook instant article but don’t konw completly about how to confiqure it? But that’s the time to impliment it on my webstie which is realted to astrology news. I hope will get good enegagement with the feature facebook launched.  Thanks",Harsh Agrawal
2016-05-07,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/inspectlet-record-users-screen.html,Want To Record How Visitors Are Using Your WebSite? Try Inspectlet,"Have you ever wanted to see how random visitors are using your site? Well, I always wanted to & this post is all about that. But before I tell you about this amazing tool, let me quickly tell you about one important term that anyone who works online should know. i.e.  From past few months, I have been focusing on tracking users behavior on my site & making changes accordingly. I have been using  . I always wanted to see how users are interacting with my content. Recently, I came across a great tool called  , which let any website owner see how visitors are using their site. It’s not like this tool is the first of it’s kind as I have used such tools in the past but this one is pretty easy to use & anyone can start using it in literally 5 minutes. This post is not a review rather a hands-on experience with Inspectlet. So, let’s get on with learning about another must have conversion optimization tool for every website owner. With this tool, you can record users session, track heat map that includes (Scroll, Click & Eye-tracking heatmaps). It’s like watching individual visitor use your site as if you’re looking over their shoulders. I got to know about Inspectlet from Producthunt & for the moment, I thought this tool is going to cost a bomb. But I was surprised when I checked their pricing page, as the pricing was nominal & to get start with they are offering a free plan which let us record 100 sessions. Another problem which I often face when using a new tool is integration. Well, that was also easy as all I needed to do was add few lines of javascript code & that’s it. The JavaScript loads asynchronously in a non-blocking fashion, meaning that it’s loaded while your other page resources are loading. It doesn’t delay visual page rendering, nor does it delay the javascript document   or   event, so your users see absolutely no difference in performance. After adding the code, it’s a good idea to flush your cache. Now, once that is done you should be able to start seeing the session recording right away. In the above screen, you can see in total 55 sessions are recorded. I have created this video to show you how the session recording looks like (No sound in the video) You have a choice to record users session on particular pages & this is pretty useful when you are optimizing your sales funnel or an important landing page. To configure the page you wish to track, click on the dashboard & select ‘Targeting” option to configure. Depending upon the kind of website you are running, this tool can do wonders for you. So, go ahead & try Inspectlet. Do let me know how was your experience & feedback of this tool. If you know of similar tools which let us record users session, do share with us in the comment section below. Update: Similar tools suggested by readers: It Seems to be a good tool for checking the behaviour of our site visitors,  just now I put the provided code by inspectlet in my blog head let see further how it help me.   Thanks harsh for sharing the kind tool with us… Keep Sharing :)) Thank you a lot Harsh Sir for sharing such a great piece of information Thank you for this great article! now i can finally see what users are doing on my site… Wow, I really searching for this type of tool, how interesting that I can track “How an user interact with my site”. Thanks Harsh Hey Harsh, 
                         I am in the search of this tool from very long. I wanted to analyze the readers behavior on my blog. Thanks for showing me working of this amazing tool bro.  Thanks Sometimes I get less traffic but good user engagements due to HQ content. You have explained so well about this tool, will surely buy it. Thanks for sharing such a HQ content Great post!!!! I will definitely try it!! Thanks for sharing such wonderful post. Well, it’s really like looking over the shoulder. As I see in your video, it is recording the whole browser, the other tabs as well, won’t it raise any privacy issue of users? Its a really nice tips, thanks.  But which tools is the best.  Currently I’m using SumoMe on my blog. Inspectlet and SumoMe both are good ,have good features but it’s depend on you from which you’re satisfied. Harash Bro, Believe me, This is really helpful for me. At first I though this is something like Google Analytic but this is a tool which records complete video of visitors It is very useful as we are monitoring our websites screen Thanks Harsh For This Information. Now I will see what my visitor Did. It’s really amazing that we can record what our visitors do on our site. Thanks for sharing this awesome guide. :)",Harsh Agrawal

2016-05-05,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/indina-startups-service-tax-registration.html,Services outside India Require Service Tax Registration [Bloggers & Startups],"Note: This article is for individuals & citizens of India. Readers from other countries   for posts tailored for them. In the age of the internet, Startups are working in a more dynamic environment dealing with a lot of complex laws. Also, ever changing laws are making it more competitive for start-ups to be more proactive in the approach. Modern start-ups like  , freelancers earns their basic revenue source such as   without keeping worry about any taxation including Indian  . We need to understand that India is not a tax heaven and hence, start-ups should always have a legal strategy in place. So many companies earn a lot of money from google ads.  , as they provide various kinds services including web design, web development outside India. Even many freelancers also do the same. The primary source of income is outside India. But the one thing is very common in them is the lack of knowledge towards taxation.  Also, one needs to understand that  . Registration is a different thing and paying service tax is different. Before we can discuss more, let me share a practical case to you. The Practical Case of Raghvendra Raghvendra Chandra Kumar (name changed) after quitting his job, started its own business. He was dealing in pharmaceutical products and Services through his website. He sells all his products/services to his client base in USA, Europe, etc. In a span of months, his business kicked off and reached the new high of growth. In just a matter of 8 months, he was able to deliver services of worth $ 120,000 (around Rs.78,00,000). He and his business were doing excellent until he reached out to us. He reached to me for his tax returns. He submitted me all his documents and invoices related to his business.  After two days of analysis on the documents, I was pretty shocked to the blunder of mistakes that have put this person in big trouble. The following was my primary observations on the business of Mr.Ragvendra: The above case is still open, and we are working on it to provide the best possible solution. Further, take the above practical case very seriously, because these things happen and we often overlook these things in our day to day work and one day they might come back as a blunder and can disrupt the business. (Further, all the above respective section of Income-tax Act, 1961 can be referred from  ) Yes, it is true that if you are providing the export services, then you are liable to register for service tax. As per the Service tax rules, every person responsible for paying service tax has to get registered with the authorities. Bloggers, Freelancers & Similar business also come under the ambit. As an exporter, you are not eligible to pay service tax, but still you need to register. Rule 6A defines what export is regarding Service tax rules. To claim the benefit of export, you need to register first. There are cases where registration is not mandatory, but still we recommend exporters to register to claim various benefits under Service tax schemes. Let us draw a table to describe where you need registration: Hence, it is very clear, that if you are providing services to any person outside India, then whether it is mandatory or not, you should go for service tax registration. Service tax is not a bad thing when you are an exporter. After dealing with a lot of startups and their founders, we have observed certain myths that are going as a termite in the business community. We thought of clearing out today. Registration of service tax is not to say that you need to pay the service tax as well. Suppose, you get the service tax registration, and your total value of service provided is less than 10 lakh, then you are not liable to pay any service tax because you are under the exemption limit. Same in case you are exporting the services, you are not liable to pay any tax. This is a dangerous myth. You must register for service tax if you are providing export services for more than 10 lakh. Also, in case you provide services lesser than 10 lakh, then also it is recommended to register to claim various tax benefits like input credit refund, etc. This is true that service tax is complicated, but who told you to study the full act. You just need to understand the applicability on you services. You have to be like Arjun, who had just seen the bird’s eye and nothing else. With the promotion of digital India, the service tax is going through a tremendous change due to which service tax officers treats you like a client. The government does not interfere in your business until it found any substantive proof that you are defaulting at your taxes. This is not true. Earlier, every rate is added by 3% on account of education cess. But the new rate is already submerged the educational cess into its rate. The current rate of service tax is 14.5% (including all cess). However, while calculating the taxes, one must adhere to  Not all services rendered outside India means export. For any service to be export, it must fulfill the conditions mentioned in   1994. The underlying requirements are as follows: If any of the conditions is compromised, then service will not be treated as export. There is no point that we can finish this debate of service tax applicability on business. However, we have tried to explain the taxability of export business . However, don’t overlook this non-compliance, because it can become a strong problem if not solved correctly.

Vishal Hi Vishal Thanks for your query, I understand your case and would like to tell you something important with brief concepts: 
  1.  Income tax and service tax are both separate taxes. Income tax is levied on income earned in the country  irrespective of your source of income. Source of income can be anything like blogging, manufacturing, trading, online marketing etc. Service tax is applicable on the services provided by a person against the consideration. Where total receipts exceeds 9 lakh in a financial year, a person should apply for Service tax registration. 2. Once service tax registration is done, then we will need to analyse your service. In case you fall under export rule, then you will not liable to pay service tax on the services. Further, you will also be liable for other benefits under export rule. 3. Also, in your case total receipts will be considered for service tax calculation and net income will be considered for income tax purposes. Don’t forget to file the proper return. 4 It doesn’t matter from where you are running your business. Tax is a responsibility of every citizen and hence, if you are running a business, then you are liable for taxes. You can refer here for more details or you may ask me anytime. Thanks sir can you also post this article on Shoutmehindi? Really this is very informative article and it is not available anywhere on other blog..! I will share the unique article on the similar concept, How can i submit?

You should get the service tax registration, but service tax will not be payable, since, you will fall under export rule. However, income tax will still be payable.  3.

Hi Paras and Hello Harsh, 
Does service tax hold “freelance writing” as an export service since we are exporting our writing (a product you can say) to other countries?  What is the key difference between service tax and income tax? Should we have both if they are different? Thanks :) 
-Swadhin Hi, There is a fundamental difference between service tax and income Tax. Income tax is a direct tax and Service tax is a indirect tax. Income is applicable to you when you are earning any income. While, service tax is applicable to you, when you are providing services for a consideration. Government provides you a basic exemption limit if INR 10 lakh for Small service providers.  In your case, you are freelance writer and you charge consideration against your services. IF your total receipts exceeds 10 Lakh, then you should apply for Service tax registration. Hi Paras, 
That was really helpful. 
Thanks for the reply. :) I gotta appply for service tax ASAP. 
-Swadhin You can directly apply from  In case the service offered or the payment received is for Advertisement Space/Post/Adsense then Service Tax is not applicable, right? No, This is not correct. As per negetive list of Services, selling of space for advertisements in print media is only out of scope. Earlier, google adsense was also included, but it was amened by previous finance act.",paras.mehra18
2016-05-07,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/creative-writing-elements-better-blog.html,How To Use Creative Writing Elements For A Better Blog,"Mine is always the plot. I love how my favorite authors take something ordinary, turn it around, and then present me with this new idea. Other people enjoy the characters and their growth throughout their ordeal. Meanwhile, some folks are obsessed with the details of the setting. Whichever element you like, we could all agree that story-telling is – and always will be – timeless. In fact,   that through thousands of years, it has inspired cooperation, helped us survive, and have kept our species alive. There are numerous articles dedicated to   with your blog. But in this post, let me show you how the five common components of a story (the  and ) can take your blogging skills to a new level. In  , this can also be called the main ‘premise’. Good content is akin to a good story: it revolves around a central idea. The   is a great example. Its original author,  , wanted the plot to be that good triumphs over evil no matter what – and it showed in all the books and the movies. People loved it because it was consistent. In blogging, our most common plot is ‘ ’. Whether the post is about tips on cooking casserole or how to write a compelling article, you should leave people feeling like they gained something useful from your work. We’re all familiar with link-bait articles: writings that promise something wonderful but deliver another. This goes against one of the basic elements of writing.  The best way to know whether you’ve nailed this one down is to summarize your thought in just two or three sentences. It should answer the question: ‘ ’ If you can do that, then your plot is ready. In creative writing, this is easy to spot. It’s space in  , Hogwarts in  , and New England in  . It’s not only limited to places or location. A story’s setting can also be a specific time, date, or event.  Say you want to write about how to create a convincing article for prospective digital marketing clients. Your goal (or plot) would be to give away solid tips on how to be persuasive through text. Your setting is the dynamic industry of modern online marketing. Show it the best way you can through concrete examples or comparisons. In one of my guest posts entitled  , my setting was the video-sharing site, YouTube. I wanted people to see the world of un-boxing videos and how it affects consumers today. My plot was to help readers realize the difference between bringing great content and just promoting someone’s products. This is perhaps everyone’s favorite part. We all want to know who’s who in the grand scheme of things and why they are important.  . You have the most significant role in your blog posts because  . This is why having a unique voice is essential as it shows in your work. Readers can identify character types through dialogues alone. For instance: right now, my character is informal but shows a fine balance between being conversational and professional. I sound like this through all of my articles. Readers can’t say I’m much fun – but I get a lot of feedback that my works are educational, insightful, and positive for the most part. One blogger, I like in particular,  , has a totally different character. She seems headstrong, independent, and adventurous. In fact, she reminds me of the heroine   from the old Germanic epic,  . As you can see, we can play different characters based on how we choose to portray ourselves. The more you show your true self, the more your writings are going to break through all that digital noise. Although having a grand plot, amazing characters, and an unforgettable setting is crucial to a good story, they’re all useless without conflict. In the   series by   for example, the main conflict is that Lord Voldemort was trying to kill Harry Potter. In Little Women by  , the girls go through various hardships in life that test their values. Conflict is not just to keep a story exciting – it’s to help characters evolve. . Without it, the piece will feel flat, bland, and one-sided. In   post on Business2Community about blogging essentials, his conflict was about too much content and how it can bury one’s blog under all that chaos. The arguments presented in these articles make readers excited to see how it can be resolved. They hand onto the author’s every word. They  . The same is true in a good story. After all, weren’t we all at the edge of our seats when  s demise pushed Rose and Jack to fight for their lives? Unfortunately, even good stories must come to an end.   In  , Rose moves on but eventually meets Jack in the afterlife. In  , Harry finally defeats Voldemort. Conflicts that were presented must have an answer; otherwise, readers will feel cheated. Going back to our example of writing a convincing post for potential online marketing clients, at the end of your article, you should wrap it up with your key thought. Something like, you need to maintain a distinct yet genuine voice to be truly persuasive; or that nothing beats showcasing your experience and value to customers. Repeat your main point if you must for emphasis. Failing to conclude a blog post often results in confusion.   If you believe that you have enumerated all the important concepts, you can simply summarize them in your last paragraph. You could also close with a question. The latter often works to get engagement in the form of comments and/or social media shares, because your last sentence made them think. You won’t need these for every post in your blog. There are times when all you need are just a plot and an ending; other times, you’ll have to outline everything. However, knowing how each element in a story contributes to its readability will help us all as bloggers make our works more cohesive. The essential rule that both blogging and creative writing stick to is making EACH word count. ‘ ’. Similar to composing music, no note should be out of place. So take your time when creating your piece. Hii Algomez, thanks for sharing such an insight… though I would like to ask a few quest… 
1. we often talk about the reading speed, aiming some benchmarks. what should be the creative writing speed. because, in my case, I have to think deep before writing down my thoughts…to be honest it takes me a 2-3 days to complete a blog… could you plz share your views on this.. Hi ALGOMEZ,

2016-05-01,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/email-etiquette-mistakes.html,8 Email Etiquette Mistakes Even Smart People Make,"Email communication has played a vital role in the business world and it must be considered a soul of every business. Today we are working in a global village where a lot of business trading is being done over the internet through different mediums. It does not only make it easy and fast but also, help in a quick decision making.  As soon as they got the order confirmations, further executions get started within the company where marketing, planning, finance, operations and supply chain start communicating internally as well as with their respective external counterparts. It becomes utmost important that during every step nothing will get wrong or personal and smooth execution will take place with the help of proper management and communication so that customer’s needs can be fulfilled as per demand which is the ultimate goal of every business. I have been associated with business field for last eight years and have seen many pros and cons of this great tool of the communication, but despite the facts, there have been written many articles already at different platforms, I personally feel that only the basics have been well explained and still there are some mistakes people do frequently due to their ignorance or negligence and hence it becomes unethical at some later stages of the communication. Before I list down those common   for your reference and reviews, I myself checked all the already published mistakes and tried best to avoid any duplication so that you can learn something new through my own personal experience and observations. Below are some commonly discussed email communications mistakes which I concluded after reading different notes on the internet, I want you to go through these first before reaching my points. • Avoid using wrong, jarring or emotional tone over email 
• Do not reply to all, you just need to figure it out who is relevant to the subject matter. 
• Do not write too much or long emails, be specific to the subject. 
• Do not miss to attach any document if necessary. 
• Your subject is the door of your email so it must be clear and precise. 
• Always read two to three times before bringing your cursor on sending option. 
• Do not send unnecessary emails; sometimes matter can be resolved through face to face discussion or over the phone call. 
• Always try to send emails during business hours and hence send reminders or follow-up emails within the same time frame. Though above all are important and almost everyone who knows the importance of this tool, try to keep his communication aligned accordingly, but still I feel that below are some mistakes which must be avoided by every person who is associated with it. Though it has been mentioned above that it should be avoiding to “reply all” but at the same time, keep respect of your seniors, they are always here to help us in every matter but it is up to us to decide whether the subjected matter needs their support or not because they have some other more important tasks to do for the business and such unnecessary emails always distract them from their core responsibilities. Some people change the subject in the middle of communication, it is a crime because when you break the communication subject, it is the every possibility that someone in the communication chain could never get the matter properly and hence it may cause any unforeseen issue later on. Some people habitually write a short form of names like mentioned above, it is considered a rude/unethical or causal behavior, even if you have some frankness with the people on the other side, then will write the full or first/Last name while doing any sort of business communication. Always keep the respect of your seniors and write Mr. or Respected as well before their names. Some people use backgrounds with some designs or themes, it must be avoided while doing professional communication until or unless you are associated with any firm where this is the requirement for clients. Using full signature after single email increases the length of email unnecessarily, which doesn’t look nice so just mention the name with some regards etc. Especially if you are using tools like Wisestamp or default Gmail signature option, ensure you don’t repeat your signature again. Sometimes people don’t reply to the most recent email either due to their usual quick intentions to reply the emails or due to some carelessness, but in both the cases, they get embarrassed once they know about this mistake so in this case, we should always filter the emails subject wise. It gives us clear indication about the most recent email against any subject. We should respect the holidays/off days of our clients, other than Saturday and Sunday, every country has her own public/national holidays so rather chasing them or sending follow-up emails on that day, we should send them the message with respect to their occasions. It will definitely strengthen your relationship with your clients. Sometimes people at workplace send the email with no subject or forward a document as an attachment with no detail in the email body, in this case, if the recipient is not used to receive such kind of emails, he/she will definitely ignore your message and hence you can expect nothing productive in return. It’s very common to make the above mistakes & if you are making any of these, nothing to worry about. From now on, you should be careful & ensure that you don’t repeat it ever. You can also bookmark this page for quick reference in the future. In conclusion, I must say that with a little diligence and effort, we can make the excellent use of this tool and it will definitely in return strengthen our work management as well as enhance our productivity which is the ultimate need of every business for successful growth. Do let me know about common mistakes you made while sending emails that no one should ever make. If you have found this email tips useful, do share it with your friends or someone who often make such mistakes while sending you an email. ;) Here are hand-picked articles from ShoutMeLoud archive that you should not miss: I used to add Mr. / Ms. / Sir / Ma’am whenever I did cold emails. But one of my email marketing friends told me that it is okay to drop the Mr. / Ms. honorific since it sounds too formal, especially in Western countries. Calling them by their first name is alright as long as the “tone” of your email writing sounds respectful. Hi Lem Thanks for your comment. Well, our point #3 is mainly emphasising to avoid short form of names, as far as writting Mr/Mam is concerned, it is for your seniors, I agree that while communicating with western people, we can ignore it but in Asian/South Asian culture, it matters a lot, especially when you have to deal with women. I strongly believe that they should always be respected by all means. Thanks everyone for your valuable feedback. Hi Khalid, Very useful article and nice tips about using email on day to day basis. This is really very important when you have to influence the readers or reply to tons of emails. I also liked the topic of this post.. :) Thanks for this wonderful article and email tips. Amazing article khalid thanks for sharing.I really appreciate your work.Thanks for sharing. I swear I’ve forgotten to add email subject more times than I can count. Thanks for sharing this article, it was really nice. I think smartness is a personal matter of people. But these 8 points are really important. 
Thanks, HMS KHALID. Maintaining regular communication through email is essential to maintain personal connect with site users and subscribers. You have written informative content on writing emails. So far I have not given so much thought in to it. Amazing article on Email Etiquette Mistakes. Like you said even smart people also do these kind of mistakes. I learned  some new thing from your article. Thanks for sharing. Hello Sohaib, Very Well Written Article, Thanks For This Post Yes !  A perfectly written article ! Sometime these kinds of mistakes also happened by me during the writing of emails.    HMS Khalid. l love the way you have described all these major kinds of mistakes and how a sender could avoid it. Thanks for sharing this useful info. I would agree with most of the points mentioned above, although I would disagree on the concept of using respected in an email. I think calling someone with a name is professional as long as you are using Mr/Miss or Mrs. 
As per my point of view respected would be a term used in client and customer relationship not otherwise in day to day routine emails to our colleagues. Thanks Junaid for your comment, I do appreciate it. As far as mentioning respected in emails, it is just like a good gesture from your side towards your seniors and clients. Emails speak your personality and thoughts, not your intentions. Hope you understand my point. Regards 
HMS Khalid Very nice post and very useful. Thanks Khalid for sharing this post. Hi Sohaib, This is a really very informative and useful article. Actually, I am blogging as part time and working in an MNC and we have to write lots of emails every day. This article is really very useful for me. I will definitely follow these tips.

2016-05-04,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/facebook-audience-network-ads.html,How To Add Advertisements To Facebook Instant Articles,"In the  for your WordPress blog. In this article, you will learn about making money from Instant articles. This is an important step for everyone who has enabled Instant articles & want to make money from your blog as by default Instant articles doesn’t show any ads & you will not be earning any money otherwise. In this guide, I will talk about enabling Facebook audience network ads to Instant articles. Think of Audience network ads as “ “, but the difference here is: Here is what Facebook has to say about Audience network ads: Go to your Facebook page Instant articles settings & under tools, look for audience network. Check the box & click on get started. This should bring up a screen like this: Click on your dashboard. Here we will create the ad placement. Click on the placements tab & that should bring up a screen as shown below: Click on Create Ad placement & give it a meaningful name. It’s important to give a meaningful name as it would help us to track reporting by unique ad locations in Instant Articles. You have the option to select from 3 different ad types: Instream video ad option will be added in coming days. For now, select banner ad format & click on save. Now, you should be able to see the ad placement ID or you can click on get code to access Javascript code for implementing ads. Since we are using official Facebook instant articles plugin, we just need placement ID to get started with this. Login to your WordPress dashboard & go to instant articles settings. Look for ads section. Click on save & that’s it! With the above steps, we have configured ads on Instant articles. Now, it’s time to fill out the payment information so that we can get paid. On the Facebook audience network dashboard, click on Payout & you would see a screen like this: Click on register a new company & start filling out the form. Currently, Facebook pays the publishers in two ways: You can use either one of them. I prefer using direct bank deposit as by using PayPal, I would lose out a considerable amount of money due to currency conversion. If you are from India & using direct bank deposit, you can   to configure your payout information. (It’s same as ) Note: When I selected “Link an existing PayPal account” for payout, it showed me this warning “Please note you’ll need to complete additional verification for your bank account so you can start receiving payouts.”. At this point, I’m not sure what’s the additional verification for. In case if you select PayPal & follow the additional verification, let us know the steps in the comment section below. Complete the rest two steps & this would complete the process of creating a company. Now, the next step is to add Tax forms. Those who are in affiliate marketing or getting paid from ad network from different countries might be accustomed to filling out the tax forms. (  ) Anyways, right click on the form you are entitled to & save it on your desktop. Open the download .pf file  & fill out the form. Should not take more than 2 minutes. Once you have filled the form, upload “Required tax document” & click on save. Note: After clicking the save, you might need to select company’s name from drop down & click on save changes to associate updated tax forms with the company. This is how the final screen should be: Note: You can always change your information if required. But do know that, Facebook will hold your payout for 10 days if you update your payment information. Your earnings will be paid out after the holding period. You do have the option to disable ads from certain categories or disable specific app or domain ads. In the coming days, I will cover this in detail. You can   or   to get notified when I do that. Now, let me quickly explain the Performance tab. It would take time (Depending on the traffic) to see the performance tab. I’m taking an example from below screen to explain the various metrics mentioned in Performance dashboard. Fill rate depends on two major factors: Hi Harsh sir, I have implemented FB audiance network on y website, but I don’t have TIN number so what to do? Hello Harsh, Excellent post. Quick question: can both Adsense and “Facebook instant articles plugin” coexist? I am already using Adsense on my website. After configuring “Ad type: Facebook audience network” in the “Facebook instant articles plugin”, my Adsense Ads stopped displaying. If I set “Ad type: None”, my Adsense Ads will resume … I believe the two Ad types interfere with each other.  Any ideas or workaround? -steve When Facebook had announced that the “Instant Articles” feature was available to everyone, I thought this was a good way to share our content with my readers: the idea being that the “Lightning” Icon was something that I was very fascinated about. Then I started seeing more regularly on Facebook’s mobile app and also wanted to try it out. The reason I signed up for IA is to adopt a new feature that is in the market, faster loading and magazine style format helps the reader to read properly and communicate accordingly. But all of a sudden I saw around 30% drop in my traffic after activating IA. Facebook is now almost getting everyone to post articles on this new feature for free. The Instant Articles feature works in a manner similar to the RSS feed, where just the content is fetched through the feed and repackaged in a simpler design, alongwith the ads on Facebook. After activating my mobile theme or Wp Touch or any thing for that matter does not make any damn sense. I have a Search Box that allows our readers to find any content from the domain as well as my domain and when someone searches in it I get some amount out of it which is disabled in IA. This is the same for the side menu linking to categories, sections that are not accessible to the readers when they visit the content on “Instant Articles”. I definitely do not want them to just read a story and leave. Being a content marketer you also would definitely not want this to happen.I want them to share the content on WhatsApp or via email or any social media like they do in my mobile theme. All of this is restricted by Facebook. I tried Instant Articles and realized that it doesn’t work for me. In its current format, it only works for Facebook and only for Facebook. I am not sure what you think Harsh or the fellow bloggers think but this is what I think is true. Harsh, I must commend you for a work well done and for keeping us updated always. I must give this a trial right away! Thanks for awaysm article.

Gotta use Harsh’s discount so I don’t get in trouble with Godaddy.  Other followers,  These type of offers don’t come up all the time so act fast and you can just park the domain till you ready to work on that new project you have in mind.

2016-05-04,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/wordpress-backup-plugins.html,Best WordPress Backup Plugins For Automated Backup: 2016,"One of the best tip which you will get to keep your   is by keep taking  . There are many WordPress backup plugins available in the WordPress plugin directory, but very few of them allow complete backup. When we talk about full backup, it means taking backup of plugin, themes,   folder. Moreover, it’s always recommended to   to make sure; you have most recent version of backup of your blog. Most of the bloggers make the mistake by not backing up their blog and regret it later. If you are one of those who haven’t yet configured a backup system for your blog and relying on backup offered by your hosting company, you are making a big mistake. Understand that WordPress is software, and it runs on PHP any MySQL and all the files are stored on your web hosting company.  No matter what, when anything is related to computer and Webhosting, it can crash any day. A hacker might hack your server or Website, or someone can log in and delete your complete WordPress directory. In the end, you will be left with nothing, but feeling sorry for never taking your WordPress blog backup. All of their hard work would be gone in a jiffy. One important rule here, your backup files should be stored on a remote and reliable place. It should not be kept on the same server where your blog is hosted. Ironically, it is quite easy to  . I will discuss three methods here that let you do scheduled automatic backups of your complete WordPress website. This includes WordPress database, and all the related files, including theme files, plugins, and images. Necessary files to backup in WordPress: Though you can configure complete  of your installation, technically we need just one file and one complete folder as a backup. In the WP-content folder, you can exclude those themes which you are not using and primarily exclude WordPress DB backup directory if you are keeping the backup of too many old databases or using some other method to take WordPress database backup. Also, you should timely optimize your database file to lower down the backup size. I use VaultPress to take backup of ShoutMeLoud. I pay $9/month & it gives me complete peace of mind. VaultPress is a solution by Automattic (Parent company behind  WordPress). This solution is perfect for those who need to take backup of 1-2 blog, and if you need to take backup of multiple blogs, I would recommend look for other solution which doesn’t cost you so much as recurring monthly fees. Else, for a single blog, this is a perfect solution, and it let you restore you our blog from backup. To configure VaultPress, you can use Jetpack WordPress plugin. Before this, you need to buy anyone VaultPress plans. I have the basic plan & paid $5 when I purchased it. Recently they have increased the price to $9/month. In basic plan, VaultPress take the complete backup of your blog one time every day. With one click you can always restore your blog from the backup. What I like about them is the support they offer. Since people behind VaultPress are WordPress experts, your blog backup & security is in the safe hands.  (Recommended for one site)  ||  This is another most popular WordPress backup solution. This comes in two version: With the rating 4.9/5, Updraftplus is the most popular backup solution for WordPress. It offers all the features which you would need to backup your WordPress blog. It offers more than just backup, as using the cloning & migration feature, you can easily migrate one WordPress site from one host to another. What make this plugin stand out is the variety of options for backup. With UPdraftPremium, you will also be getting free 1GB of space for UPdraftPlus Vault, which is their cloud storage. For someone like you who have multiple WordPress blogs, UPdraftplus is the best choice. You just need to configure everything once & after that, you don’t have to worry about your blog backup.  (Recommended for backing up more than 2 WordPress site)  ||  ManageWP is a popular service to manage multiple WordPress site. I have been an avid user of ManageWP since it’s launch & use it to manage all the blogs in my network. What I like about ManageWP is, it makes it easier to optimize, update & track all your blog from one dashboard. ManageWP offers real-time protection as it offers incremental backup. That means, instead of taking complete backup every time which slows down our server, it takes backup of only those files which are changed & is uploaded to their cloud storage infrastructure. The best part of using ManageWP for managing or taking backup of your WordPress site is; you don’t have to worry about dealing with configuration. With one button toggle, you can enable or disable backup. You can take back using Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, One drive or ManageWP cloud infrastructure. Note: Every 24th in above screenshot means, take backup in every 24th hour (one day). From the costing & value for money, ManageWP is the best option for anyone with more than 5 WordPres sites. All the above three solutions are best WordPress backup plugins at this moment. Here I’m listing down more free & premium solutions which are recommended by our community members. Note: I’m listing down only those plugins which offer essential features such as taking backup of database & files. Let us schedule backup & support various services for the backup. Do remember: Many web hosting companies take daily backup of your blog. Especially, those who are using managed WordPress hosting like  , you don’t have to setup a third party backup system. Though I’m little paranoid when it comes to having complete control & this is why even my hosting offers free off-site backup, I take another backup using  for ShoutMeLoud & use   for all other sites. I hope this guide helped you to pick the right backup solution for your WordPress site. Let us know which one you picked/using & why? I would love to hear your opinion in the comment section below. And, do share this article on your favorite social networking sites. I’m also using vaultpress. Basic plan. Taking regular backup of my blog. One of the best backup plugin. 
It cost me $55/year Hi Harsh, Pl suggest a free reliable plugin that can be used for a number of sites. @Pranjal try  UpdraftPlus wordpress plugin bro Nice Article. 
your information through snapshot is good. 
but how to get the backup for images in wp? @William 
if you are using any of these plugins to take the backup (Which will also include your WordPress WP-content folder), all your images would be backed up there. i have used ManageWP Backup and it’s work really good, now a days we have some really good option to take backup of WordPress site, thanks for sharing other list Thank you very Much! before this I had problem with godaddy managed hosting. but i got my db back. in the third method is  it necessary to do both for complete wordpress backup 
i mean to say is there any diffrence between wp data base and wordpress files @Garry 
Yes, you need to take back up of Database and WP-content folder to make it a complete backup. Though one can easily set database backup daily (Depending upon how often he updates his blog), and wp-conctent folder 2-3 times in a week (Subjective to update frequency of the blog). HI, I used i Drive backup plugin as it uses Cron Job internally,It affect on my HG baby plan ,number of process increase very drastically and then HG disable my account. When I removed it ,I Come to normal mode.So I suggest you to check your  Process state from Cpanel before trying this. You can BackUp WordPress, it also supports Shared Hosting Environment  –  @Harry Sehgal:  Backup would backup just your database. This leaves out all your template files, plugins, and images. Is Using a DB-Backup Plugin is enough. I mean does that Database contains all things. I mean if I have to Change my Host Provider, then can I use this Backup to Upload it to my New Host Provider. this is going to be very helpful for newbies like me..you have explained everything in great detail..thnx a tonn… How much secure this is? since we are saving our database content on 3rd party plugin server for example of iDrive. Thanks for the great info, buddy. I think most blog owners only backup their databases and not the other plugins, themes and content files. I am also in the same league. Now I need to decide whether to go for idrive or manually download the content files to my hard drive. I am using DB-Manager now. I was using WP-DB_backup some time back but since I upgraded to WP3.0 it has stopped working and sending me weekly db backups to my email. So now with DB Manager I have regular backups to my gmail account in a separate folders as well as my hard drive. Want to do something similar for my content files. Nice list buddy. I’m using DB-Manager plugins to scheduled backup on my blog. :D Cheers for that, ive been meaning to set up a back up solution for a while now, this got me to do it thanks! I went for IDrive and it was so quick and easy wow….nice article……now backup made very easy with this….. thanks to the writer…. I use the WP DB backup plugin & do manual backups of the whole directory, store it in my HDD & External HDD too. I do it manually because I hv a relatively fast net speed..slow net users can go for host backups or as mentioned by ishan if ur blog is new then try iDrive Mine is WP-DB-Backup, i love it Buddy – WP-DB Backup would backup just your database. This leaves out all your template files, plugins, and images. I am also using WP DP Plugin. Hostgator also has some great feature for backing up wordpress blog in a few simple steps. I was a fan of WP-DB-Backup. But now I’m think to migrate to iDrive Backup. Thanks for the post. Great share :) IDrive suited all my requirement … thanks for the help :) i think only huge WP blogs/sites those needed third party backup",Harsh Agrawal

Fatima it’s very help full article thanks PALASHTD. Teaching has become a trending online business. Udemy looks a very good platform. Facebook is providing about 48% of a site traffic on average. As a result Facebook E commerce is gaining so much importance and soon there will be intense competition. very useful for those who think that it is impossible to earn money from home Hi  PALASH, I have just started a blog. 
I want to know more about Affiliate Marketing. 
Can you plz tell more about Affiliate Marketing. 
thank you! I will try online teaching to make money . Nice ways to make  money . HelloPalashtd, What an nice article very thnks for sharing this. I would not Agree completely with you Palash on this. I know that now Entrepreneurship has been a passion and there is a BOOM in people using Entrepreneurship as their day to day living stuff which is good but when you say “There are a lot of online business ideas, but these 5 ideas will be very easy to start an online business without much expense.” I would not agree. You see, for affiliate marketing you need a site which has good authority and readership like SML, to get there you need to invest a lot. E-Commerce, Online Courses nothing is cheap now a days because there is competition. And E-Book, that’s one of the biggies. Unless you spend enough time studying the market and start exploring what and all are there for your book to succeed you will not be able to get what you expect. It is going to be hell tough for anyone. Publishing a book is easy but getting people to read it and make something out of it is tough. I would have agreed if you said these ideas are the ones which you can use when you are getting started. Because of course, blogging and all these are business at the end of the day. And from the business point of view unless you invest something, you are not going to get anything out of it. But cheers! Hi palashtd, 
Apart from blogging you have mentioned great tips to start online business. Content writing is also one of the easiest way to earn money from online. Nowadays most of the bloggers offering content from other writers to their blog readers. Anyway thanks for share. Have a happy weekend.",palashtd

2016-04-27,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/truelancer-earn-cash-from-home.html,Have You tried Truelancer to Earn Extra Cash from Home? (Legitimate),"We are truly in a globalized world when one does not have to leave their house to work with people from all over the world. This cannot be truer than now. People with all skills in life will be able to trade their skills for remuneration. In today’s era, freelancing is for everyone. The best part is; it’s not limited to geolocation, age, education or any such factor. Anyone with any skills can get started with freelancing & with time you keep getting better. Freelancing is an excellent way to start off life in business. If you are too averse to risk, but still want to do something on your own, then freelancing is the way to go. Say you are a designer and want to travel the world while designing, then freelancing is a great opportunity. If you are a mobile developer and want to work on your project, but you need to make ends meet, you could freelance every once in a while to pay your bills. If you have  , and you are free over the weekend, you can immediately jump on a platform like this and make a good side income and put your weekends to use as well. From what I’ve noticed about platforms like  ,   and  are the sooner you enter, the better you can reap the rewards of the platform as there is lesser competition. When there is lesser competition, it is easier to get noticed when you pitch yourself and also, your zero rating when you start off isn’t taken that seriously. When you are in a saturated (Too much competition) environment and you start off, it’s very hard to stand out, and only the ones with the established rating keep getting projects and are trusted. When you are in a saturated (Too much competition) environment and you start off, it’s very hard to stand out, and only the ones with the established rating keep getting projects and are trusted. So, if you have been holding yourself to start making money via freelancing, today is the day when you can start your freelancing career. I will be giving an overview of Truelancer (A popular Indian freelancing site by  ) & how to get started. I will also share tips and strategies on how to stand out and will also show you how Truelancer is different! Let’s start with creating your account on Truelancer.   & register yourself at Truelancer.  I’m not going to spend too much time on the Sign up process because it’s pretty self-explanatory and an expected process as well. But I’ll get into the Profile page and talk about how to spruce up one’s profile because this is a very important component of getting projects on any Freelancing website. We are deep into the Social Media’s Influence on the world. It’s a crime these days, if you do not have a good quality picture. A good photo can boost your credibility manifold. Let’s cover the different options that Truelancer provide that aid people in making money. This is another Important aspect when setting-up a profile. You have to promote yourself the best you can, and you shouldn’t have generic statements like “I am passionate, and I love to code”. This does not matter. Think of your Self-Intro section as a Resume and imagine what you would put there. Here are some items you can consider for the Introduction section. Note: When someone is searching for freelancers on this platform, he/she will be able to see only first 2 line of your bio. So make sure your first two lines are most effective & seductive enough to grab attention. You can refer to above screenshot for inspirations. What if you do not have any credentials? If you do not have any work experience or any credentials, you should be in one phase and that is the building phase. Build your portfolio of work, experiment with some work, work with a friend etc. Write articles in the topic of your interest and publish them. Make sure the portfolio building work that you are doing is pushing the boundaries and gets people’s attention. That’s the only way to stand out. Truelancer is an amalgamation of many services combined. They do have the traditional bidding system of Individual projects as well as two other styles that are clones of other popular web services’, which we’ll cover below. This is common among all the Freelancing websites in the world. Where the freelancer gets to see a list of projects and they can bid on the ones where they have an expertise. One feature of the freelancing websites is the option to Send Proposals. This is where most freelancers lose to other seasoned freelancers. When you want a project, ; you need to  ; you need to show that you are  , you need to show that you are  . Most common mistakes made by 95% of freelancers when bidding for a project. When you learn from these mistakes, you’ll be able to beat 95% of freelancers out there. Most freelancers see the gist of the project and just bid directly. A lot of clients put in a code in their descriptions to filter out the ones who have read their descriptions fully from the ones who haven’t. Only if you understand the requirements of the client completely would you be able to do justice to the project? Many freelancers do not customize their texts according to the project. And they just use generic lines like “Hey, I’m perfect for the job, and I guarantee fast work”. For every project that you bid on, please take at least 5 to 7 minutes to craft a reply that focuses on the following One of the best parts about the proposal form for Truelancer is the   option which let’s you go to the next level by adding your file. You can spend 10 to 15 minutes on each bid and come up with small solutions for the client that will show value in your bid! When you are starting out; you immediately have to start doing a few things to give yourself a chance for the long-term in the platform. First of all, do not try to bid for the best projects that are available because To counter this, aim for the smaller projects that bigger freelancers will not bid on and where the competition is low. Try to get a few projects under your belt with decent ratings. Do not bid too low because that is not considered being of high quality. Remember the point I mentioned about how in saturated platforms it’s difficult to stand out? Well, Truelancer just countered that thought by adding a feature called   that is underlined in the Image above. Buy Services is literally the clone of  , where people offer services starting from $5. It’s a great gateway price, which a lot of people will not think twice about paying. Truelancer offers the same service, which gives a different dimension to the Freelancers as well as the customers. In your profile section, you can add the services you provide. This is a better form of expression for Freelancers because, people with fewer ratings in the bidding section of the website get their sections where they control their Imagery, their copy and the services they provide. I think this is what separates Truelancer from other websites, where people will give up when they do not get any projects. This is what makes Truelancer a truly meritocratic place. Contests is just like   where a person posts a project and many designers all over the world, create the designs and the client chooses the one she likes.  This is crowdsourcing & very effective for recruiter in many ways. I have already spoken . This is for those of you who trust yourselves and can back it up with fabulous designs. The good part about contests is, you do not have to have any credentials, ratings or anything of that sort your work speaks for itself. Another positive is, you’ll be able to gauge your work compared to others in the business and see if you are good or not and the areas you can improve in. Even if your work does not get selected,  , which you could showcase to other clients. Truelancer also has an Android app ( ) that would be useful for someone who is looking for freelancing work while having a full-time job.  Overall, Truelancer is a very good website with a good mix of options.

Nice Article. Just had a few doubts, how secure is this, what is the process to redeem the amount of money earned, and how legitimate is it? Thanks for sharing the article though, really good! I’ve heard about Truelance but dared to try it by myself after reading this review I’ll give it a shot, thanks for sharing this harsh I have not used truelancer for my requirement but seems legit from what you have shared. I prefer normal email contact with someone’s referral and then proceed with the plan etc etc. Even though this seems easy what i have always felt is if I am contacting the person directly then that is more beneficial for me from a monetary point of view. Dont you think? I am not registered as a freelancer, instead as a employer i benefit more from this. This is really great while compare to other freelancing sites. Hi Harsh, I joined Upwork in late February after coming across your blog. I kept my hourly rate at $25 despite many blogs suggesting a lower rate to begin with. I have done okay so far, earning around $500 in the last couple of months on Upwork. 
I tried Guru, Fiverr and Truelancer as well and was appalled by the things freelancers were ready to do for a meager payment. This especially includes freelancers from the subcontinent – a fact that has led many clients to believe that they can get huge amounts of work done at cheaper rates from here. It’s unbelievable that quality rarely matters these days, for people seem to be happy with sub-standard work just because it comes at a low cost. 
I am sure others like me – and you too, probably – have faced this issue, where providing top-notch articles no longer  guarantees good returns. If you ever come across a site that indeed values quality like it should be, would you be kind enough to post about it? I have tried many other networks like Freelancer, Upwork and PPH but this is totally a new one to me. I will join now :) I Knew about freelancer work but Truelancer is very new for me. Thanks your so much for making me understand. This is also good to earn some extra money. I apologize here if I am wrong( since have never done any work from this portal) but I keep on searching freelance websites most of the time. The quotes are so so low in this site that sometimes it feels like where do we stand. 
Like seriously…this is what happening!!! Sometimes I see the quote from client for Logo as 500/- etc 
I mean now seriously there needs a Revolution In Designing industry. Of course the fault lies within us( no one to blame) but the thing is we as a Designer should never lower down the market. Once we start giving service without 
respecting our hard-work which ultimately means we quote as low as possible just to grab the work, it will harm the industry more and more which is unstoppable. 
Interesting thing about our industry is people are very very much aware of Branding and knows how much important it is for them for the growth of their own service/Business/Product etc still we Designers stand no where and are not respected at all. 
Hence I will never support a site like truelancer. Once again I apologize but something needs to be changed and ought to be changed , really..!! I was only know about freelancer.com before reading this post. Thanks for sharing this additional information. YOU MISS A POINT ABOUT PAYMENT & PAYMENT SECURITY. @Buddha 
What about Payment security? Kindly elaborate! Like as other market place jobs everyone say hourly job is trusted but contact job is not more trusted getting payment after done job. Good review, But I would like to know that what payment method we can use to post a project or withdraw cash? Harsh, having been on the freelancing circuit for a long time (on Upwork, PPH mainly) , and with no disrespect to Dipesh, Truelancer is really at the bottom (when it comes to prices). Either that, or I am making a judgment too soon.  It’s good for our agency to find talent. We hired a writer there earlier. We almost cried with pity when we paid that poor, hardworking freelancer.  On the bidding front, we cringe at the rates clients put up as budgets. Like 50 INR for a blog post of 500 words? C’mon, I won’t read a single line for that kind of money.  Someone convince me otherwise.  Ash i read first time about Truelancer 
thanks for awesome article One of the best freelancig site, even better than freelancer.com",Harsh Agrawal
2016-04-28,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/iphone-camera-video-shooting-tips-techniques.html,How To Shoot Outstanding Videos Using an iPhone [Must Know],"You are wrong!!! This was a Screenshot that I took from   video. Imagine that. It’s not even a photo;  This is how powerful the iPhone’s camera is. It was announced recently that Apple’s iPhone was the largest selling camera in the world. And their advertisements speak for themselves. [Tweet “Apple’s iPhone was the largest selling camera in the world”] Apple is promoting its camera’s capabilities and why not with beautiful shots like that? So how good is the camera of the iPhone for shooting videos? It’s really good. And for this write-up, we’ll take you through the process of how to shoot good videos using the iPhone. If you are starting off as a  or want to ride the wave of being a  (Youtube, Vine,  ) sensation then shooting videos is the way to go for you. If you are someone who wants to make a short introductory video for your startup or you make short films. For skilled people who are on a tight budget and cannot really afford expensive equipment could use the iPhone to shoot videos. I’ll start off with the beginner’s tips and then take it a step further with advanced tips. I’ve mentioned the basics of shooting a video in terms of Lighting, Landscape and much more in my earlier post on  . In this, I will focus more on making videos from your iPhone. These tips can work on almost all the smartphone cameras so even if you have Samsung galaxy S7 edge or any other fancy smartphone, read on to learn the smartphone video shooting tips. This is the first step and the most simple of them all. Before you start any shooting work, really give your iPhone lens a good cleaning because your phone tends to be in many places that tend to gather dust. If you are one of those geek kinds who like to open your iPhone, here is a geeky video for cleaning your iPhone lens. Focus is key in great video shots and like all phones, the iPhone tries to re-focus all the time. This means that there is no steady focus and the camera might start focusing on some other object. The best way to focus on an object is to . When you are in the Video mode and long-press on the particular object you want to focus on, a box with a yellow outline appears. To shoot even a decent quality video, a tripod is a must. A tripod or a selfie stick gives a stability to your iPhone that your hands can never give. An Audio equipment can also be an addition, but make sure you invest in a simple tripod or monopod initially. Although the front camera is good enough for taking Youtube videos, if you want, you can use the back camera to take videos because it’s 1080p in the iPhone 5. So if you have to take videos where there is no movement, you can set up the camera,   and sit in front of the back camera and shoot the videos. Another option is to connect your iPhone to the tripod and also connect your iPhone through Another option is to connect your iPhone to the tripod and also   to a large television where with your peripheral vision you can always see if your video is coming our right or not. Another way to use the back camera is by sitting in front of a mirror, where you can see the screen of your phone although this may be a cumbersome process. You need to figure out a way which you find yourself comfortable with. Sometimes it’s a requirement to shoot videos outside. The sun can be too bright a light and there may not be an appropriate shade all the time to counter the glare from the sun. A simple way to counter the abundant sunlight is to create a simple lens hood. Tripod stands come with an iPhone holder that you can remove separately. Look at the image below for a reference on the tripod stand. Now to create a lens hood, all you have to do is to stick a piece of paper horizontally on top this. This will block the sunlight from hitting the lens directly and in turn glaring the entire picture. An iPhone is ultimately a smartphone. If you want to get professional with your videos, then you’ll need to upgrade. But the best part about using an iPhone is the ancillary products that are created that amplify the experience of an iPhone. From phone cases to lenses and every iPhone user should take advantage of this. When you are transitioning from an amateur to a slightly better-trained person, it would be overkill to go straight for the best product in the business. And also, if you are able to spend a little bit and get more bang out of your buck with your existing products then it’s advantageous for you. The additional equipment we would suggest is an   that would give wider angle and more zoom-in capabilities. The next one we’ll suggest is a mic that can be used to capture the best audio. For the Lens – The   is a popular one For the Mic –  I use   & would recommend the same for you.   is another good alternative. Although there are video editing apps for the iPhone where you can edit your entire video on your phone, you would probably want to edit on the computer. Editing on the phone is a quick-fix and is not meant for long hours of editing work. It probably takes double or triple the time if you want a quality output. The applications for the desktop are pretty robust and gives you enough options to edit a video very well. Earlier I used to use   for editing videos & now I’m transitioning myself to Final cut pro X. Mac users can download 30 days free trial of FCPX  . If the hardware can be amplified, then so can the software. Apple’s Camera app’s video features are pretty rudimentary for a professional videographer. But, like we mentioned earlier, the Apple ecosystem is filled with App developers who build quality apps that make the iPhone an unbeatable machine. One of these applications is the  . Movie Pro is a $5.99 Video recorder that amplifies the native recorder by 100x. Some of the best features, in my opinion, are the; Other iPhone Applications that add value to your Videos. 5.    – Not all portions in a video frame are important and some can even take away the importance of the main subject matter. This one is useful for removing unwanted portions of your video frame. I haven’t tested this one, but it seems useful for this collection of iPhone video editing apps. 6.  : Perfect for every blogger who needs to edit the video on the go. [Must have] Note: Also check out  . I would suggest always keep 2-3 video editing apps handy on your Smartphone, as it would be useful when you have to quickly upload a recording. Well, for now if you follow above given iPhone video shooting tips & use these recommended editing apps, your video would look a lot different & professional than what it is now. What you should understand here is, getting your iPhone ready for pro video shooting is not tough, all you need to use is the right set of tools & a clear mindset. In the upcoming days, I will be sharing more tips on video shooting & editing that a blogger can use in their day to day life for creating memorable videos. For now, do share this post with other iPhone users that you know of. Wow! Thanks for sharing this.

Hi, Harsh this post is of great help, very useful for video bloggers n shrt film makers one like me, but I have a confusing if you can give a solution, I am in hurt of a proper standard tripod mount (for smart-phone,like I ‘ve asus zenfone which also an awesome device for shooting HD videos).

Personally, I have never used iphone, I seem not to have interest in it due to difficulties in getting compatible application for it in the earlier year when my University roommate was using it. I like samsung and am a fan of all their products. Though am impressed with all the iphone features you stated here. Hi Harsh, Recently I bought IPhone 5s not yet test video recording for professional use, these are really some cool tips to follow to create better videos with IPhone. I started YouTube channel for my blog and preparing myself to make some videos with it, thanks for sharing your knowledge about how to shoot videos with iPhone as well some editing tips information, see you soon. Shotting a video can take extreme level of skills, but thanks to latest technology that helps us to shoot video in much easy way. Thank you for sharing amazing list of video apps. I will try and find out which will work best for me. An interesting and mind informative blog! you have make my problem solved by sharing that.  Now could be able to record high quality videos with my iphone. Thanks for posting this, I really like this article because there are many things the Android phone does that make my iPhone feel old. I really appreciate your work Harsh. Thank you for all the details. Thank you a lot Harsh Sir. Can you just write a post for which software is best for making youtube videos. Thanks in advance Harsh, 
Nice post, But you have not mentioned anything about which mic to use with iPhone for better quality of sound (probably wireless). Cheers 
Sandesh @Sandesh 
I have mentioned the mic in the post. The one I use is   & it’s pretty awesome & affordable. I don’t know of any wireless mic for iPhone. Though it’s possible with few converters but it’s not cheap I believe! Thank you for all the details, Harsh. To summarize here is what I experienced. * Shooting people is more accurate and amazing in an iPhone camera than others. 
* Instead of zooming the video comes perfectly amazing if you do not zoom. 
* iPhone camera works perfectly in natural light but the performance is little low in night 
* While shooting a video an external mic makes huge sense in an iPhone 
* Keeping the exposure in focus fetches great results. 
* Slo Mo and Time Lapse are two features I would die for in an iPhone 
* No Filter works great than with filter 
* All you need now is a different angle you see things than others. These are all my experience and my bit I wanted to add here. I experienced these in iPhone 6 Plus. May be it is a different experience for others. Thanks again Harsh for sharing this great article on video shooting. I am sure it will help others. Cheers! Prabhu, Which external mic do you use? And how to connect both HDMI cable and mic at the time? Cheers 
Sandesh I bought Sennheiser MKE 400 one before sometime and recently I started recording my videos in a DSLR than iPhone as got some comments to improve quality of the video. But that one worked well for me just plug n play it was and the same one works for me in the DSLR as well. To your second question I am not sure if we could connect HDMI and MIC at the same time for others but I tried with Apple TV and it works fine. Concept is you need an optical digital device that will take the digital output from the Apple TV’s optical port and you can use it. At times I had issues because of the configuration one had to be muted but if you configure everything properly then no need. Both will work simultaneously without any issue. @Prabhu 
I will not be biased for iPhone camera quality as recently I also got Samsung S7 Edge & I’m stunned with it’s camera quality & features. You are right about the low light issue & which is a major issue when we have to shoot in the evening or the night. Hopefully, we will see some improvement in coming days. Thanks for all the tips & adding value here :) @Harsh, I understand what you mean Harsh, but may be it is the reason I am biased. :P I was previously using Nokia Lumia 1020 that had 41MP and was not satisfied so then changed to this and I was amazed. I will have to try the other big ones again and see how it turns out for me. It is been a rumor that with the recent upgrade to 12 MP camera Apple has made some changes but I did not get the hands on them so could not comment. Thanks again for the helpful article and response. Cheers! Great article harsh, but would love if you would also write for Android user. And coming to camera’s for vlogging wouldn’t action camera’s like gopro(or anyother) be good for that?  What’s your thoughts? Amazing article Harsh thanks for sharing.I really appreciate your work.Thanks for sharing. @Ravi 
Thanks for your comment on this & on all other posts too.",Harsh Agrawal

For me, it was different & unexpected. I went for a 7 days spiritual retreat & was completely away from Internet, smartphone & everything. I will share the experience of the retreat on my personal blog, but for now, let’s quickly look at the March 2016 stats. I already skipped February 2016 transparency report & don’t want to make it 2 in a row. So pardon me for keeping this short but like always there is something to learn from here. For newcomers, you might like to start with: Few quick updates for March 2016: Popular posts from  : (Read them later) Finally a big shoutout to  for being our regular advertiser at ShoutMeLoud. Here is the traffic report for our desktop & mobile site: ShoutMeloud forum has become one great place for hanging out with bloggers. I’m learning so much from other blogger’s experience & at the same time, it’s good to help people directly.  Just look at the bounce rate which is pretty amazing. What I like about our forum software (Discourse) is, it’s mobile friendly & it’s fun to do something productive on mobile. Last month, I wasted quite a lot of time playing games on my phone. Eventually, had to delete all the games & now I’m back to productivity. To be honest, after Parse is out, I’m struggling with finding a suitable alternative for Push notifications. Last month I released   & testing this  . If everything goes fine, we will shift ShoutMeLoud apps push notifications to the same plugin. In case if you know of any great alternative for Parse which works with WordPress, do suggest me one. We are close to reaching 1.5 million page views/month & hopefully by the mid of year, we will reach there. I have also hired few regular freelancers & they are working behind the scenes to make ShoutDreams network more awesome. Total: $5685 (Approx 3.8 Lakh) Overall the revenue & traffic was average & I’m hoping to see both of them increasing after mid of 2016. Last month I released v2.1 of ShoutMeLoud affiliate marketing eBook & you can buy it from   or  That’s all from me, now it’s your turn to share March transparency report with us.

Keep up the good work. i am looking to earn the small amount buy i am stuck with the traffic as i am newbie ..but your earnings are awesome bro.. Hi Harsh, I am a HostGator affiliate. How much is your earning from HostGator affiliate? Will be an inspiration if you share the income from HostGator. Thank You. @Himadri 
It’s close to $2000/month. Great. Thanks Harsh. Hi Harsh, This is a direct question to you. SO don’t ignore it. Right now we are also earning taxable income from our blog. But I am very much confuse whether I should declare this amount in my income or should I keep my mouth shut. Few people also told me that since this is online income so it is already taxed so you need not to worry about income tax and all.  What should I do, right now I am not able to find any CA who has knowledge of this type of income in my locality. So I need your advice in this case. @Rakesh 
We are liable to pay taxes on all the income coming from any source. So, yah! you need to disclose the amount & pay taxes on it. You can   for filing your tax as they are specialized in working with Bloggers & Affiliate marketers. Great numbers.  I started blogging as of 23 April 2016. I’m looking forward to an exciting learning curve! So far I have signed up via Impact Radius for HostGator, Arvixe, MaxCDN and Bluehost affiliate Programs. Hopeful with time and effort I will start seeing few conversions. Kudos!! Man, you are a genius. Of course, it took time but finally you made it and this day is a dream for every S/W engineer who completed their engineering and yet dreaming about entrepreneurship. Maybe I am putting my efforts in the wrong area in the wrong time hence, I am not getting any output what so ever even if it has been around 2 years I started blogging. I am getting something now and that too in hundreds. I am not sure if I should take this up to the next level but these articles from you are pumping man. This makes some people like me believe that if somebody can then I also can and it takes time. Hopefully this grows to a phone number like income Harsh! Cheers! :) Hello sir i m a big fan of yours, i recently came to blooging inspired by you.genuinly you are a inspirarion to all the people who wants to build carrier in blogging.thanks for all wow millionare blogger

Harsh after comparing your many income reports (including this), i come to knew that google Adsense is only good for well settle blogs and for those who’re getting enough traffic to earn from it.

It’s Good to hear that you are making such amount of money from blogging and which is improving day by day.Do you have any posts for starters ?Particularly,on Affiliate marketing. @Osama 
You can start from here:”  Hello sir i am getting all most same traffic , all is pure from google and i am not getting AdSense earning only 1$ per day with cpc .04$ please sir guide me how can i increase my earning. Thanks in advance You should concentrate on foreign traffic and high paying keywords sml is the ocean of this kind of tricks just dive in it hi i just haven’t start earning but my achievement of march is i registered a domain on 23rd march and i got adsense aproved on 26th april with 30 posts in my blog . @Mahipal 
That’s a rocking start. Wish you luck for Upcoming months. Hello Harsh. 
My question is why AdSense Earnings on your blog is low than Affiliate earnings. @Ravi 
Coz Affiliate earning requires more effort & is more lucrative too. This is wonderful and I really like that you break the traffic for various assets in your portfolio – SML, SML Forum and app plus also that you are giving the expenses incurred also. This helps in understanding that there is a lot of hard work as well as systematic approach in making SML what it is today . Hi harsh… I didn’t see any Google ads in shoutmeloud… It looks like there is no Google ads, there is only a Google Custom Search above … lol Harsh took AdSense down from here years ago. He owns several other blogs in which use Google AdSense.  Read this:  Awseme report.. Is called as hard work. 
If you think make more money that’s is not possible 
First your to hard work You need to give time 
Remove your nasty feeling… start ur own something..  Congo. Bhai

2016-04-27,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/ad-networks-small-publishers.html,5 Best Ad Networks For New Bloggers That Approves Them,"Well, if your answer is Yes! Then today is a lucky day for you. Today, you will be learning about five advertising network that is friendly to new bloggers. Talking of popular ad network Adsense, there is no doubt of the quality of the ads, but the problem is getting AdSense approval. Even though 6-month-old domain requirement is a myth but still not everybody is lucky   AdSense approval. Unique content is not only the factor for AdSense approval. There are many other factors which Adsense gives preference. Small blogs cannot get Adsense approval, so I have found few good ad networks for new bloggers. At the same time, There are many ad networks in the industry. But all the ad networks are not good. They may cheat bloggers; they won’t pay for bloggers even they reached the minimum payout. So now we will see the article. This article is written for small publishers. If you are a small blogger, this post will be a gold mine for you. Suggested read: Revenue Hits is very different when compared to the below ad networks. Revenue Hits won’t pay you anything for clicks or impressions. They pay when a click is turned into action. For example, advertisers need some user information. They advertise using Revenue Hits. Publishers place the ad code on his blog. When a visitor clicked the ad and gave his name and email to the advertiser. Then you will get paid.  . The minimum payout of Revenue hits of $50. They pay via Paypal, Payoneer & bank transfer. I saw many publishers making more than $10- $100 per day. I love Revenue Hits. This is a good ad network for small publishers with no minimum traffic requirements Cons of Revenue Hits 1. Nothing other than Ad format. They don’t use CPC or CPM methods. They only pay for actions. Bidvertiser is one of the oldest ad networks. It was founded in 2002.  They offer a large range of ad formats. More ad formats mean more ads and more clicks and more money. The minimum payout of Bidvertiser is $10 via PayPal, $20 via cheque & $50 via bank wire. Bidvertiser pros: Bidvertiser cons: Back in the days, Chitika uses to be one of the top AdSense alternatives. With time & technology changes, many other networks have replaced Chitika. Though one thing which is still the same is; Chitika is popular among new bloggers. Thanks to their minimum Payout, easy to use interface & minimum traffic requirement. The minimum payout is $10 & they pay via PayPal. One thing which you should know about Chitika is, it works great only when you have search traffic. If a majority of your traffic is from social media site, you should use other suggested ad networks. Pros: Cons: Infolinks is another popular ad program which is also considered newbie bloggers friendly. Infolinks offer many ad types & is popularly known for their in-text ads. You can  . Pros: Cons: Popads is a premium pop ad network. This is a good ad network for small publishers with no minimum traffic requirements. They started in 2010 & promise to offer 100% fill rates. They allow all types of blogs including illegal, Porn and other sites. They don’t have minimum traffic requirement & approval is instant. Popads Pros: Cons: It’s good to have a collection of advertisement networks for entry-level bloggers. They might not be as popular as other premium ad networks such as AdSense,   or any other, but they ensure that new bloggers can taste the joy of online income. Here are few more monetization network that you should check out: Well, I would be happy to hear about other ad networks that you are using & it’s generating revenue for you. Do share what other ad network are you using in the comment section below. I heard that Google Adsense didn’t approve if we use other companies before. can you suggest me about this? For getting small amount of money I may loose Adsense permanently? @Ravi 
At times yes. Reason being, many other ad networks display adult or unwanted spammy looking ads. In such cases, AdSense doesn’t approve your application. 
Here is a tip for solving this issue: When you are applying for AdSense, remove all other ads. ;) I am not sure why but I do not trust anyone else but Google Adsense. Their pay per click is higher than anyone else in the market and it gives result as well. I have seen in 1K visits per day you can make somewhere around 7 to 10 dollars per day using Google Adsense, but in others like Infolinks and all that is not possible. It takes much more than 1K to get that amount in your pocket. And more over i have felt once you implement the others you will feel like your website has become slow and irresponsive. Is not that case with everyone or it is just me? Totally worst thing, I used bidvertiser for months and when i reached minimum payout they did’nt give me payment. yes this is good but i have a concern that due to pop ads we will loose our traffic , because visitor not liking that, 
pls let me know i am right or not? Hi Samba, 
I have tried out some of the ads network you listed, I was completely pissed off by Chitika, their ad is irrelevant most times and always greenish in colour so I just have to remove it from my blog. I have heard some good comments about Revenue Hits and would give it a try to see how it works for me. Thanks for the info. Hi Siva it’s a great Articles for new bloggers like me…But I have a question that can I use your mention ads networks with adsense? Revenue hits is not good for new blogger because they use CPA ads. Infolinks and bidvertiser are at top for me. I have heard of infolink too much and they have better cpm rates than others network. I got my Adsense approval within 1 week of my blog launch. A lifestyle blog talking about fashion food and travel. Still wondering if I am lucky or my content and work is good enough for Google to approve really fast. It’s Lubuzine.com Great List Siva. Though, I would like to recommend Advertise.com as well to the readers, since I have been using it for a couple of years now both as an advertiser and publisher as well and it has worked out quite well for both the roles and have been a stable source of income for me. I wouldn’t quite put Chitika in the list , the ads are all greenish are low quality. 
Many a times , irrelevant too. 
Chitika , for me , increased my blog’s bounce rate. Hi! 
I absolutely loved your blog. But I have one question. 
Which of the above revenue earning methods do you use? 
Please let me know! Thanks Siva for sharing useful information. Actually we have plan to start adsense account but long time waiting for google approval. After reading this article we have submit my website to Chitika ad program. Hope they will approved my website. Hello SAMBA SIVA, 
It’s very good to see you here on shoutmeloud. 
Nice Article. 
Inlcude Adsoptimal is also one of the best ad network. 
Regards, 
Mohan Kumar Dear Siva, this article could be of encouragement blogger newbies who want to make money from the internet. Thanks for the article, very helpful. Nice tips Samba siva,  keep it up. But one thing I know with Google when it comes to country line Nigeria and India they find it very difficult to approve adsense. Just use the Gmail open a new Gmail and apply using the address of someone in UK, USA of German they will accept you with 48hrs with same blog. I tried adsense three times and I was rejected till I applied with a Germany address and I was apprved with 48hrs. And I withdraw fund using Payoneer. hmmm… cool bro I don’t have anyone in UK or USA.. what should I do? I really need adsense oo… Any tips for the UK or USA address? Superb article from shout me loud. Can bloggers make money without Adsense?  because completely depend on Adsense is like putting all ages in one basket.",samba siva

Awesome bro. .. through info graphics a lengthy message can be conveyed in an interesting way. .. and this info graphic had a lot of sound information in it. .. thnx for such a wonderful post Yes, Surya. I agree. Infographics do make it easy to understand the content especially if you are a visual person. amazed infographic which should be referred by everybody who wants to design a neat website. I totally go up with cta, colors for the website, menu bar with hamburger are really effective if they are used in the right way It is very interesting & informative post for everyone who wants to start or already stared a website including me.Mostly I like your image or picture which is very helpful to understand your points instantly. I like specially the part of article was technical requirements & backend. Thank you! Thanks Akshay. Its feels great that you found the infographic interesting. Hey, Piyush! Thanks for this amazing post with a unique way to express. I was just wondering about the slider, is it really necessary for my home page? 
Why don’t i use the new single page view style like big it compaies? They are more attactive then sliders. 
What do you think? Hi Aishwarya, Slider and single image have pros and cons. Some people do not like sliders because it can slow a website but other hand having just one image may limit the website on how much you can communicate to your potential customers. I usually suggest that if you sell or promote just one product/service/concept then it might bet better to use one image but if you sell multiple products/services then sliders might be better for you. This is truly an amazing post. I like how the illustrations have been used to convey the message better. Personally, I am a huge fan of the online chat service. I think navigating becomes a lot easier. Also, the job gets done faster. Other than that, I think every site must be user-friendly and simple. If it’s an online shopping site, then the payment gateway has to be quick and hassle free. Absolutely agree with you. The most important feature every website must have is that it should be user-friendly and easy to navigate and find the information that a reader is looking for. I don’t understand why you say flash elements should be avoided in all kinds of sites. It cannot be generalized. It might be right only for content based sites or blogs. Sites like bet365 that are listed companies are using flash entirely to build their site. It is a site with millions of transactions happening every day. The site creators say that using flash makes the site more secure against hacking. Flash has more client sides concern but html 5 has more server side concerns. “Avoid using flash” is the common thing I see across the web. But I don’t know why? I think its important to note that we are talking about small businesses in this infographic. Having a site in flash is fine on desktops but the same site would not load on mobile devices like iphones. So, you would then have to make a separate mobile version of the website. This can add to the cost for small business owners. Instead its less costly, and less time consuming to do a mobile responsive website in html without flash. Security is a bigger concern for sites like bet365 because of how many online transactions happen everyday on it. But for a small business having an informational website its not a major concern because not much online transactions happen on their site. A must read for them who are running small businesses and wants to promote their products through their website. Great Infographics Glad that you found this helpful, Sateesh.",piyush
2016-04-24,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/paypal-alternatives.html,Top 6 Paypal Alternatives For Bloggers and FreeLancers,"I have been a Paypal user for almost five years, and I love it to the core. When I was starting online, I had no idea how to receive money from people outside my country, and Paypal made it so easy to receive money from foreign countries. In my homeland (India) due to PayPal and RBI dispute, I can no longer use PayPal same as others users from countries like U.S.A, U.K., Australia. For example, one Indian PayPal user cannot send or receive money from another Indian PayPal user. This is one big limitation of PayPal, and so I started digging down some of the best alternative sites to PayPal. There are many sites that are similar to PayPal with more or fewer features. I will list down some of the best money transfer sites like PayPal, which I have found which researching for an alternate mode to receive payments, and if you know of any other feel free to suggest via comments. Note: This article is updated on 25th April 2016 to feature new services. I’m making this list exclusive for Bloggers and Freelancers, and if you are a small business; I would love to know what tool you are using to send or receive payment from overseas. So, let’s start with our grand list of best PayPal alternatives: Payoneer is one of the oldest services for global payment, and now they are available in countries like India, Pakistan and many more. Payoneer will let you receive money from U.S. based & European countries. The best part about Payoneer is, the transaction fees are lower, and you will save a lot of money in between. Signing up for Payoneer is free, and once you have done a transaction of $100 using Payoneer, you will get a bonus of $25. Here are few more tutorials & guides for using Payoneer: Many of you might not be knowing this popular money transfer website which is created by people behind Skype & backed up by  . One of the reasons you might like Transferwise over PayPal is low transaction fees & currency conversion charges are standard here. That meant you won’t lose money in currency conversion. Watch the below video to understand how easy it is to send money using Transferwise: Transferwise supports various countries & currencies. When you signup for Transferwise using below link your first transaction up to £500 is completely free. Many of my online have resorted 2CO for all their online money needs. 2CO has a lot of positive reviews and is considered as a great alternative to Paypal. Here at  , 2Checkout is used to collect payment from all over the world. The only downside of 2Checkout is high transaction & transfer fees. If you use 2Checkout, I would suggest keep your Payment release level high so that you save on money transfer fees. Getting onboard with 2Checkout is easy & their supoprt is pretty awesome. Supported currencies for FOREX: Dollars, Argentina Peso, Australian Dollars, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollars, Danish Kroner, Euro,GBP-Sterlings,  Skrill is a popular   for PayPal & Payoneer, because of the Currency conversion rates (they are the best). I have tried it myself a couple of times and MB transfers works great. They also offer prepaid master card that works on millions of shop worldwide. They also have iPhone & Android app to make transactions from your mobile. Payza is another popular money transfer service that you might have heard of. A great alternative to PayPal & better than PayPal in many cases. Here are few highlights of Payza that I personally like: You can create a free account or business account depending upon your need. They  have taken great measures to ensure safety of our account & this is something which anyone who is paranoid about safety would love. Remitly is another popular service to send money to India & Philippines. This service is cater towards Indian &Philippines freelancers. They are running great promotional offer & one of them is no charge on transfer over $1000. When sending money via Credit or Debit card, the transfer will happen automatically at the flat rate of $3.99. You also have an option to send payment without any fees but that would take 3 days. I believe when you are not in hurry, free is good. Few more services: These are the  if you are an Indian. Frankly, compiling this list was a bit of a pain because all the above-mentioned services have something unique about it. I enjoy using  &   due to their credibility & great service. Please Guide me to set up purpose code for payoneer for affiliates markets and other money making on net I am from india.

I use both Payoneer and PayPal 
Thanks for sharing Which is the safest & convenient sites among all these for making business account & sending and receiving money within India ? Other than Paypal ? I stopped using PayPal since 2014, I use payoneer and it’s one of the best. I think payoneer comes after paypal. I heard of payneer before but paypal is still at the top by a big margins from others. Informative post.I faced the payment problem before because paypal was not yet there in my country.Currently i am using paypal and its amazing and fastest secure way of payments and receipts. Do payoneer support freelancer.com transactions, I never tried something other than Paypal. Hence, this blog post is refreshing to me and I think I should try Payoneer as you say the transaction charges are low. What about zoom? It’s another payment gateway from paypal. Fantastic description of alternatives. Very useful. Skrill seems to take the 1st Prize ! skrill is the worst payment processor ever, stay away from them. Sometimes they charge me more than what I have ever received. Go to hell skrill.. Honestly, I personally don’t consider any payment processor to use other than paypal as it is a recognized payment processor by RBI. Others are not on the list of RBI for foreign transaction I believe. In fact I have a benchmark that I will use a site only when I see paypal associated with it. Do they pay us through bank wire only or do they have NEFT facility available like paypal? But, its a good list you compiled. You said you use Transferwise & Payoneer. It would be awesome if you mention the names of the merchants from which you receive your payments through payment processors other than paypal. Thanks!! I use paypal and payoneer. 
Informative post as always. 
Keep it up. All information is right. But we cannot use PayPal. Because Bangladesh does not support PayPal service. It’s a big problem of Bangladeshi People. @Palash in that case you can use Payza or Payoneer. I believe both of them work flawlessly in Bangladesh. I am using paypal since last 7 year, their service is awesome and the good news is that they are coming to india at july last. 
I recently get a call from PayPal because of 7 year experience and they were asking for review paypal. They also return me some $$$ that i have lost in a dispute. 
So in my view you don’t need to go anywhere else if you are already using paypal. Thats a nice list there, Can you make a similar one but for Indian Payments like instamojo and payu? I would like to see other options also. I personally use Instamojo and paywithpaytm for my site but wondering what are the best alternatives. Nice list of PayPal alternative Harsh. I am using PayPal since 10 Years and never have had any problem with them. However they have some limitations for Indian users though it is my No.1 payment processor. BTW apart from PayPal I have used   and   both are good PayPal alternatives. Even I use   , the set up is quite hassle free and the functionality , even better.  I totally recommend it over PayPal @Punya 
Awesome. Glad my assumptions have been validated. Thank you’ Harsh for the alternatives but I want to know one thing from you and that is do I need any legal documents if I want to sell something in online through my own website ? @Shirsndu 
Mostly you need a PAN card & address proof (Passport, Driving license). This document is asked by payment processing companies. I use   for collecting payment at   & that was the only thing I had to submit. Hi Harsh, 
Thank you for providing this awesome list of Paypal Alternatives. As I have start getting advertisement offers for my blog so I applied for Paypal account to receive payment but my account is still not active.  They are asking me to link my debit/credit card but my debit card is not activated for overseas usage. 
These alternatives are great but I just want to know can I use one of these alternative to receive payment over Paypal? 
What about the companies who only pay you through Paypal? 
Thanks in advance @Kalpana 1) Get a debit card which supports international payment. The era we living in, don’t limit yourself because a bank doesn’t allow international transaction. I believe you are also from India, so you can get ICICI, HDFC card. I personally use ICICI bank card. 2) In most of the cases you won’t be able to receive payment from alternative sites. If someone (Client) is sending you payment directly, than you can definitely use any of the above mentioned alternative site.  3) Out of all the above, Payoneer is supported by many popular network such as Amazon affiliate program, Commision junction or any companies who pay via ACH. In general what I recommend is, take out 20-30 minutes & signup for atleast 3-4 of these services (PayPal & Payoneer is must) & you would thank me in future :) Thanks a lot Harsh for your valuable advice. I will definitely signup for 3-4 services :) I think payoneer comes after paypal. I heard of payneer before but paypal is still at the top by a big margins from others.   But with one major drawback :( Hi Harsh, literally first time seeing these great new services, Unless Paypal has something in the country but definitely still recommend paypal Hi,Very useful post.1 important question .If i get mastercard from payza can i use it for hosting purchase like ipage, hostgator?.Will these cards will be accepted by them?.Awaiting for reply,Thank you. @Kaviyarasu 
Yes, you can use that Master card for buying anything online. After reading this article I wanted to change my transaction over payZa .Will you recommend this. ? Harsh I’m a regular shouter; The left side social sharing button irritates many times. So do remove this floating bar or change its location please. @Arvind 
Payza is getting popular & they are operating in many countries; so yes, you can move to Payza. I will look into that Social sharing button issue..I believe it’s happening due to screen size. Will find a solution :) payoneer is the best solution for recieving online money payment   and i rexommended it rather than paypal @Hemant 
Thanks for your comment on all other posts too. Good to get your insights on the topics here at ShoutMeLoud. Thank you for the information, now I still use Paypal and FasaPay, for FasaPay I often use for forex deposits. I just joined payoneer for recive payment from globle and what I should I put purose code for I earn from blogging, sell on net, and other income from net , and I have hosting business. What code,do i put on payoneer. Hi Kamal, I live in India. My employer in US has send payment via paypal. But paypal says i can get my money only after 21 days. is there anyway i can get my money quickly. Also suggest if Xoom is better. But my employer says Xoom has cancelled the transaction saying it is “commerical.” Please advice and suggest alternative service that suits me. Thanks Hi, I agree Paypal is ruling the market at the moment because of its credibility. But the exchange rate is too low apart from the standard fee.  What should be the best option for freelancers to receive money from UK to India (GBP to INR) ??  Kindly reply. Thanks. The Payza personal account doesn’t let me receive money, forcing me to get a business account, and thus paying higher fees. 
Google Wallets and Amazon Web Pay is still not available in India. 
There is a new provider called Zilra which is in the pre-launch stage. They’ve promised me that they can provide a smooth transaction experience, but I’m still waiting. Xoom and   are totally new for Me. 
Can they are safe paypal alternatives for indian blogger? Because of Indian RBI rules about foreign currency they are not allowing some online payment processing system. Hi  Joel James is right Payza’s service is the worst service in the world they block customers account without any reason. my account was blocked before one month and i got an email that i need to provide the documents which i have already given to them at the time of opning an account for the reopening of my account i gave then all the documents but still it is on hold i mailed then regarding this and they replied after almost one month and when we go for live chat they always have only one statement that our team will get back to you as soon as possible and when we say that why its taking that much time then they say that we are getting high number of customer flow that’s why its taking time but my question is if you are getting this much customer flow then you should have sufficient staff to resolve that their answers are totally unprofesstional i was thinking to use Payza as an alternate payment option for my customers but they dont want any customer. So i would request everyone not to use Payza if you want to save your time and money. Hi, 
 My question about paypal. My paypal account name and my pan card name is same but, my bank account name not match. 
Can i still add my bank account? Help, Thanx guys! i provide freelancer services and now i am going to expand my work in usa ….so can u tell me the best payment method (except paypal) for usa to india transcation??? As you said no one is competing closer to Paypal, I also believe this. Others may have some new or excellent features but the largest community behind the Paypal is its biggest plus point. We hope RBI will understand one day and open all unusual restrictions on Paypal. There are some alternative ways to send money to indian users, but same day transaction is main problem with paypal in India. Hi, Are these options fine to RECEIVE money for Transactions in India from Indian resident buyers? I guess most of the listed sites, do not allow this, following similar guidelines to Paypal by the RBI… i.e: You cannot pay any Indian seller, if you are an Indian buyer, through these sites that you have mentioned here. Alternatives could be gateways like CC Avenue and others – But these are not as convenient as Paypal… Can anyone, suggest Paypal alternatives for Indian transactions as stated above? I mean as  convenient as Paypal but acceptable in India as per RBI rules? Thanks Please tell me which site best to transfer dollar in paypal account 
and what should be the purpose code in paypal account ,also tell me more about a 
verified paypal account. Hello the first alternative doesnt sound right? I mean a set up fee of 49$ and on top of that 5.5% fee and also 0.45$ per transaction doesn’t look right at all, they are simply stealing money. Just my view on the topic, might differ from you apart from that, I would also like to add one more service to this list, its a new player in e-wallet services and named Okpay, not very popular but the cheerful part is it also provides a source of income with its referral service(like you invite users to orkut). Warm regards, 
Anil Sharma Dear All,  I want to develop a site with products showing INR rates in shopping cart  with Paypal integration ..When i enquired with my friends i came to know that Paypal doesnt accepts INR .  1.My question is whether it accepts INR currency as i am targeting only domestic market in india . if so what is meant by currency convetion rates which its mentioned in Paypal website stating that “This exchange rate includes a 2.5% fee ” , Since i am accepting only INR currency why there is currency convertion rate is getting applied . So do i need to pay 3.4 % + 0.3 US dollars + 2.5 % 
Please advice …its most urgent … Thanks in advance .. God bless Paypal does not allow Rupees. This basically means that your customers needs to pay in the currency that Paypal accepts. Let us say you are selling an item and you are asking $20 per item. When an Indian customer tries to buy this product, the money from his account (Rupees) will first get converted to USD (Based on paypal set exchange rate.. they get a commission here) and then the money is converted to rupees again when they convert the USD to rupees (Based on their exchange rate). The seller and buyer are losers due to exchange rate conversions. This is on top of their fees etc. Nothing comes close to paypal in terms of acceptance and features. Some time back when Paypal had an issue, odesk had waived off the payoneer card fees. I checked out their charges then. They have withdrawal fees and I think it works out to be more expensive that Paypal even without the card fees at the outset. Regarding other services like Alert pay and Moneybooker, have heard of them but never felt the need to check them out. Alertpay is the one which I think is popular after PayPal. So consider that service. One more alternative is Liberty Reserve.. Yeah Typhoon, Liberty reserve is another great alternative, I love it because of its popularity and ease of access. I think moneybookers is doing great. Their charges are lower. Unfortunately moneybookers is not supported at USA, so I also had to use payoneers for USA clients. An alternative of paypal is now very essential. They are dominating the market as they have huge users. I use Alertpay it is much better then paypal and other. 
we can verify account via mobile phones add bank accounts and for standard member there is no receiving fees. :)

2016-04-23,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/great-leader-manners.html,12 Important Mannerisms To Be A Great Leader,"Leadership quality is the most prominent key for the men. Its motive is to lead the quality people, and talent to fascinate someone to the gifts, services and prospects you serve as a possessor, as a director. It is the great experiment of life. What’s vital in leadership is purifying your skills. All great leaders keep working on themselves until they become efficient. Here’s how: 
 It is a further step you must take to become an influential, proficient leader with a comprehensive variety of reach. Being rude is not the symbol of strength and this option will make not a good substitute. We always judge kindness for weakness. Kindness isn’t weak, although it is a sure type of strength. We must be generous enough to tell someone the reality. We must be kind enough to eliminate the illusions and clear the situation. Boldness is essential to winning the day. To construct your encouragement, you’ve got to speak in front of your group. You’ve got to be prepared to take the first step, confront the first problem, and determine the first sign of worry. You’ve got to grab the moment. You can’t get to the high life by being shy. Some people mistake timidity for humility. But self-effacement is a virtue, whereas nervousness is a disease. It’s a disorder. It can be cured, but it is a problem. Humbleness is a grip of the space between us and the stars, yet having the feeling that we’re part of the stars. It takes superiority to create your ambitions and your image in the community. It takes pride in a cause, in achievement. But the source to becoming a good leader is to be proud without being arrogant. In leadership, we learn that it’s normal to be amusing, but not senseless, pleasurable but not stupid. Have an agreement with truth and spare yourself from the misery of false impressions. Do not take life too much seriously, just accept as it is. 
 The workforce can recognise when you’re not being completely honest with them. There is hardly a reason not to be fully transparent with your staff, exclusively on a new, rising company. This will help everyone come collected as a team, dedicated to the issues that need solving for the long-term profit of the corporation. Lack of transparency can result in a lack of trust. Leaders should be cautious not to worth experience over potential. Some of our very talented employees have potential and fire in their bodies to deliver the first-class output to the firm but they have not been the most experienced. What they do have is somewhat that’s difficult to grow. You can’t teach that. Leaders tend to create ideas in their minds, but don’t exchange the thoughts. Then, when the discussion starts and employees are giving their opinions that you’ve already abolished through considerate internal planning, they get angry. So every leader should start writing ideas and plans out to make sure his process and conclusion that will be easy to understand. Listening to all team members is so urgent to creating a strong and trustworthy team. Every employee needs to be part of the procedure and technique. Work together and listening to your team is somewhat that is probably forgotten by leaders and it shouldn’t be. As a team leader, it’s your responsibility for any of your company’s failure. At the end of the task, you finally hold the responsibility anyway. So instead of blaming others, propose solutions to the team and make them know that things didn’t work like they should have. Life is distinct and technique of leadership is also unique. The policies that work healthy for one leader may not work at all for another. However, the major skills of leadership can be accepted to work well for just about everyone: in the profession, in the society, and at home and  . “Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.” Colin Powell Thanks TIm, great share especially the point no 9 has resolved my current issue, facing in my office, my one assistant has experience and one has potential, managment asked me to promote only one,now I got what should I do…. Omg when I read the quote, that’s not fair man haha ‘when there is danger, they will appreciate your leadership’, definitely need to learn more about leadership skills, give full support to people.

Thanks for sharing this helpful post with us. I have a query, Harsh. When a person (most probably bloggers) should start paying income tax in India.?

Sourabh Hi Sourabh Though Nayneesh can recommend great stuff here but you must read this book “Rich dad poor dad” by Robert Kiyosaki ….you will love this book. Hi Sourabh, As said by Sohaib you must read rich dad poor dad at least once. But apart from that do check out “The Hard Thing About Hard Things” & “Entrepreneurship”.

2016-04-19,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/blogging-faq-answered.html,What Actually is Blogging? FAQ Answered [For Newbies],"I am not blogging from 8-9 years like Harsh but in my few years of span I have been asked a lot of questions regarding blogging. I have answered many of them but still I think that there are many who still need help. A few days back I read a post on the same topic but here I am not going to repeat earlier answered questions  . Instead in this article, I am going to answer those questions which are often asked but not answered by the bloggers who know blogging because they think that those are easy questions and can be found on Google. But when I had those questions I didn’t know any blogger, who can actually help me and don’t make fun of me or even scam me. When we come to the world of the blogging or before we come to it. We all think that there are many scams and cons. So, I want to make one thing very clear is that, Yes there are scams.But not all are fraud and many will help you if you can make out the difference. Blogging is not only about writing posts or article. Blogging is about expressing your feelings towards something, exposing content to the people who need it. Not the people who know it. Blogging is not about opening a website, it is about running the site. For example:- Suppose you bought a car and keep it as it is, you don’t use it you don’t even maintain it. Then what is the use of buying the car? Now, you have installed WordPress and you don’t know what to do. So, you start watching videos about customizing the site as you think that “If my site looks well people will like it” That is true but partially cause unless you have some nice posts they have nothing to do on your website and also no one will show you what all is necessary cause the results are based on your searches but you yourself don’t know what to search for. Now, you will start thinking about the first post that you should write. But in the mess of creating the website and customizing it. you forgot the main reason that you started the blog. And search for the content, but now this search for content becomes a habit and your blogging interest will start to decay slowly. Because you are not writing what is yours you write about what others write on their blog. Now, before you start blogging, people say you can earn 100$ from a blog easily and it is not a big deal in it. But I want to mention something you don’t wanna hear maybe.  L. Now I am not saying that it is impossible or you can’t do that. You can do that but for that, you need to know a hell lot of things. AdSense should be bloggers first preference if you are just starting up.” ” as many of the guys say but did anyone mentioned that other than Adsense i.e   or ad serving companies, there are other companies offering different types of ads, such as Now, I can’t explain each and every type of AD as the post will become too long and boring to read. You can check about each of them by searching in the shout me loud blog. Now, If you want me to answer the above two questions or have a newbie question of yours,then you can comment down so that I know that whether you guys are interested or not. For now, do share this newbie guide to blogging with your friends who might like to start a blog. Thank you so much. I just looking for a complete faq guide about blogging and i found it.

this line super. This ideas will make newbies to become more efficient in the field. Thanks Vikash for you comment and also for the mention! Have a nice Journey in the field! DO read part 2 is you think its interesting (   ) Very nice article Amit, I agree with your points. Earning $100 per month is really big deal for new bloggers.

It would be nice to keep your junk at one place , rather than spreading it all over Thanks for the Article about Blogging. Excuse me if I sound bitter or rude- I really do not mean too. 
I think the majority of  people who use the internet know what blogging is, but when it comes to making money 97% of Affiliates fail. That means people need a deeper understanding and education on what it takes to earn enough to where it paid for their hosting yearly. 
I think some would call it a success, if their hosting was paid for and then set a new goal to do more. 
Adsense and almost all Network Ads are blocked and sometimes only an average of 33% of your ads are even seen by a person looking at your website. 
Great content means little with Google unless you spend most of your day ignoring content to tweak your hosting and wordpress install to be accepted and seen in Google. 
Bad and Malicious content can get ranked faster and higher than a non malicious blog now. 
This is the issue, What is a Blog and how to keep it alive… :) 
Marketing a Blog is nothing like it was 8 yrs ago or even 5. The days of putting an ad on it is over. The reader has to need what is being offered with a direct link… 
Ads are a waste of time unless you make the ads yourself, host the image and change the dimensions, so the blockers are confused. 
Just my noob .02 cents :) I daily answer such questions. I answer them every time because I don’t want that what issues I have encountered so far in the blogging, no one else has to pass through. I just want to give a simple advice to beginner blogger who even don’t know about WordPress. Begin reading shoutmeloud. I never saw such a blog that share complete knowledge about blogging.

2016-04-17,http://www.shoutmeloud.com/record-better-velfie-videos.html,Best Tips to Record better Velfie Videos? [Video Selfies],"Videos are the future, it’s a given because of the ease of taking one and it’s ability to be more expressive than text, audio or images. If you are new to the term Velfie, this is what it is. Velfie = Video+Selfie. The selfie took the world by storm and was introduced to the dictionary in the year 2014.Having said that, most young people have taken to the craze of properties like Dubsmash and Velfie. Velfie videos have gained in popularity because of their abilities to make the user look good and share it with their friends. People are appreciated for their quality of their Dubsmash and Velfie videos. A lot of users take special effort in making the Velfie look good. Although the camera quality has considerable Improved and made the life of video creators much easy, there are some tips not known to the general people and we thought we will list those tips down for the other users as well. The main factors of a Video are the Sound and Visual. So here are some tips that help you take better Velfie Videos.For today’s tips, we take a look at some of the best in the business in Velfie’s and they are the Youtube stars. A lot has been said about the Background of videos and some say blogs suggest having a plain background, although that is good advice, it does sometimes give a boring look to your video. We take a look at Youtube superstar   and see that his background is cluttered with a lot of things, but it’s blurred! This gives it a not so boring background but also focuses on Casey. The next case in point is of Superwoman’s  . She also has a cluttered background and it isn’t blurred, but the lighting in her videos are pointed at her and throw no light in the background which makes her stand out and make her glow! So there is no hard and fast rule when it comes to the background as long as you can make it work. Though. to save yourself from confusion, here is the simple role: Record video selfies with plain background or anything that doesn’t distract the audience from main object of the video, that is you! One of the first phrases in the Bible is ‘Let there be light’. This cannot be truer for a Velfie as light plays a major role in having good production value. What kind of light do you need? Again, a lot of blogs just suggest a lot of light, but that isn’t true in a lot of cases. What if you had to take a Velfie on your camping trip in the night? There cannot be any other light in that case. So for morning shoots, it’s best to have natural light as it’s just the perfect amount of light for the camera which adjusts it’s aperture according to the light that is sent in. Take a look at Lily Singh’s video with over 10 million views that uses Natural Light. In the dark, when using artificial light, a light with a yellow tinge really gives a look. White unnatural light looks a bit fake compared to that of a yellow. Take this example of yellow light used in a Dubsmash video. Light on the subject is also super key. When you are taking a video make sure light falls on you that will help with you being the focus on not everything else around you. A sharp light that is focused on your face will enhance your features on the camera and make you look sharper and people will be able to see your features better. If you have low light issue, do check out  , which is an innovative product for front camera recording. Most of the time while taking videos, a movement is involved. But cameras need to adjust to those movements and many a time they do not succeed in this endeavor. Take an example of panning.  . This is a small movement for us, but a giant movement for the camera which has to adjust to the rapid changing scene in seconds. Equipments are dime a dozen do these to give extra support to our camera work. A steady cam equipment like the one helps you give better grip by holding the larger handle and letting you take control of your phone. You can of course buy high-end gadgets to ensure your videos look steady but to start with even a decent smartphone tripod is enough. In coming days I will share some of the best equipments you can buy for video blogging. If you need to pan and take a steady shot. Make sure you hold the phone with both hands close to your body, and keep your arms steady. Also, your knees should not be locked and you should swivel with your hips. Here is a good example of that technique. Start at 3:43 for the technique A lot of movement related techniques come through practice and it can be learnt. This is a rookie mistake when taking Velfies. Although taking a video selfie in portrait mode is far easier. It is important to use the landscape mode because of the depth and reach and also watching videos on the phone are best through the landscape mode. Look at the two examples below. The first screen grab only takes the middle portion of the screen but the second one is distributed and gives a broader visual which is a better experience. Sound is a major component in a Video selfie. You can have a great video, but if the quality of the sound is bad, your video’s experience is lost. Imagine watching a Star Wars movie without any sound. The best tip for having good audio is, avoid any sort of distracting noise. The biggest culprit is the fan. The fan pushes win towards the phone and muffles your voice while talking. The best is to put the fan off. Most of us live in cities, so it’s difficult to avoid vehicle noises, and the sounds of other humans speaking and interacting. The best is to plan the timing of your video where the least noise is expected. Taking the video is a closed room is also a solution but make sure it does not echo. Another strategy for trying to cut as much as possible video is to try to cover the audio hole with your hand and cup it towards your audio source.  I use   (iPhone + Android) & it makes the sound pretty crisp. See the below video to see the audio quality in action. If you need a detailed review of this gadget, let me know & I would show you the difference of audio quality with & without Rode Smartlav+ Mic. For now, you should watch this video for 20 seconds, starting from 51 seconds to see the difference yourself: This is a problem that I’ve encountered personally. My Phone’s Android phone’s screen guard happened to cover the front camera, which blurred the Image and made it hazy. When you put on a screen guard, make sure there is a opening for the front camera. This was a bad experience because I had to remove my old screen guard. Zooming in is one of the fastest ways to reduce the production quality of your videos. Zooming technology pixelates your video considerably and makes it grainy. If videos are pixelated at this day and age, then nobody will see your content. With 720p being the standard, avoid pixelating your video with the zoom. One thing I’ve noticed with the camera is, it does not capture all the subtle expressions that you can notice in real life. This is true because our eyes have zooming in capabilities and nuances that cannot be got in a camera in the present day. So when you are taking a selfie video, make sure your expressions are exaggerated slightly, otherwise it comes out looking expressionless.  I’m still experimenting & learning to take good videos with Smartphone & DSLR. In coming days, I will keep sharing my learning & experiences to help you improve your videos too. Do make your first video selfie & share the link with us in comment section below. Hope these tips have been useful to you to take video selfies as much as we’ve had fun making this article. For now, if you want to share a tip or two, do let us know in the comment section below. This article is really super bro. Additionally can you please tell the best camera apps? Is it best to use the 3rd party camera apps or use the native camera app? Is it also good to add any kind of filters? Hi,  Harsh  Thanks for this amazing post on Velfies and very informative and useful for me, thanks once again sharing with us. Nice and informative post bro, I have one question, how can we blur the whole background keeping only a person normal. Do we have any tool for that or is it a camera setting? Thanks in advance for the answer, I have to search for a nice spot to record the videos like you :) Got fresh info about creating videos. More than technical stuff I think personal attitude also needs to change if I appear on the video. You can write some posts on creating white board animation videos. Videos should be high quality because bad quality videos will bounce your users to search better videos.Content is the most important part though Hey bro, 
                          Here is my video link. Your comments are welcome. Cheers

Nice post and right on time. I have been following you from last few months or say years :) and i started my own blogs but they are not doing well (not working at all) . Can you please share more ideas about topics and content and how to monetize them. There is no doubt that quality of audio and video needs to be good to attract more people and gain more social shares. Till now I was thinking that it is hard to create videos. but I think I should try now and find out how good I am with videos.. Thank you for sharing the details to make velfie video. Hello Harsh, 
So after selfies it’s time for velfies, I didn’t know about velfies but you have shared everything including how to record better video selfies. I will try these tips and lets see what I can create. Thank You so much for this informative article. Nice tips on velfie Yes you are right about not zoom in the video because it loose the quality. It is better have good higher quality camera. Videos should be high quality because bad quality videos will bounce your users to search better videos. Pretty much on point. Couldn’t agree more. But rules are meant to be broken and certainly Casey Neistat proved to make amazing video while defying all of the rules above. But not everyone is Casey. Content is the most important part though. But, for beginners couldn’t agree more. This list is exactly what a beginner will need to start out for making videos on YouTube. Very informative post. I understand every blogger should put a video in their post to get better ranking, especially if the blog is new. 
Thanks for sharing! This post will certainly help us to create our next videos more professional. Great article. It will be nice if you could share some video editing tools that can be used by amateurs like us! Very inspiration blog post. I think this blog post will increase to create selfies video. 
Thanks for this post.",Harsh Agrawal
