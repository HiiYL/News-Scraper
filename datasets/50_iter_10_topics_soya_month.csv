Rory Lee,This could be the best postpaid plan in town — RM80/month for unlimited everything,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/06/webe-unlimited-postpaid-plan/,"P1,packet one,Packet One networks,Telekom,TM,TM 4G LTE,Webe,Webe mobile operator","P1,P1,Players on the Field,TM",2016-04-06,"Many of you might not have heard of  , but after today’s set of events, they’re probably going to be on everyone’s lips. We have   in the past that Webe might become the next 4G LTE operator (under   and  ) and it looks like our suspicions might have just become reality. What’s more, it also seems that Webe might just have the best mobile 4G LTE plan yet. After some digging,   came across a staging site for the aforementioned Webe. This staging site not only reveals that Webe is going to begin operations as a 4G LTE operator, but also that they’re offering ridiculously good value plans. From the looks of things, Webe’s starter plan will offer consumers 20GB of data, 1,000 minutes of calls and 1,000 SMSes from only RM8 a month. Keep in mind that the RM8/month price tag is only available for existing P1 customers who choose to pick up a device plus the plan. If someone is an existing P1 customer that doesn’t want to pick up a plan, they would have to pay RM9. For non-P1 customers, you would have to pay RM10 for the plan instead. As peculiar as it sounds, Lowyat.net also discovered that if you wanted to enable tethering for your Webe data plan, you would have to add on an additional RM10. That brings the total up to RM20/month which is still a pretty smashing deal. But that’s not all. It also seems that Webe are looking to introduce an unlimited plan for RM80/month. And when they say unlimited, they truly mean unlimited as the page indicates that users who subscribe to this plan will get unlimited 4G Internet, unlimited calls and unlimited SMS. The plan also allows for shared lines (up to 3 lines) which could mean that up to four different lines sharing one unlimited quota. Comparatively, an existing RM80 plan like Celcom’s FIRST Gold plan only gives you 10GB of data (split between weekends and weekdays). However, as this is only a test page, we do urge you to take this with a grain of salt as its seems too good to be true. These numbers could only be placeholder figures and not reflect the final plan’s pricing. Either way, this is exciting stuff and we will find out the truth of them come the 13th of April when P1 finally unveils its  . What do you guys think of these plans?",7

Initially   for Android users via Open Whisper Systems, the new encryption now covers all forms of communications including WhatsApp calls, photos, videos and file transfers on both Android and iOS platforms.  If you’re running on the latest version of WhatsApp, encryption will be enabled automatically by default. Whether you’re chatting to an individual or in a group, you can be rest assured that no third party will be able to tap into your conversations. You should notice a subtle message indicating that your chat and voice calls are encrypted end to end.  This will only work if all parties have encryption enabled and you can check if your contact or group is secured by going into Group Info > Encryption. If a member doesn’t have encryption enabled, an open lock icon will appear and they would need to update WhatsApp to close the loop.  To verify if the encryption is valid with a specific individual, you can check the Security code by comparing the 60 digit code or by scanning the QR code. For group chats, you’ll get a lock icon if all members are compliant.  The folks at WhatsApp have a strong desire to protect personal privacy and they believe encryption is ultimately the key for the future of personal communication. Co-Founder Jan Koum also shared about life in the former USSR where people couldn’t speak freely under communist rule. Today WhatsApp assures that more than a billion of its users can talk freely and securely.",8

It’s got a 5.5-inch full-HD display on the front which packs a pixel density of 401ppi. Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. For photos, the device gets a 13-megapixel primary camera with PDAF and a front-facing 8-megapixel selfie shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000 mAh battery. While the internals are impressive, we’re a little on the fence about the looks of the smartphone. Sure, it’s got a nice full-metal unibody with rounded edges for better feel-in-hand. But, it just looks so much like an OPPO R series smartphone and I think we have more than enough of that design.

It’s difficult to justify purchasing this smartphone over any of the other 2016 flagships that have and are soon to be arriving on our shores. But, here’s the thing, you don’t have to do that because the Huawei Mate 8 has one big advantage over the competition. Don’t get me wrong, the Mate 8 will run pretty much as smoothly as any of the other flagships in the market right now. With the help of Huawei’s new silicone and Android 6.0 Marshmallow, you probably won’t even notice any of the minor stutters I did unless you’re coming from a   device. It’s even pretty good in the camera department. Nothing to shout about, but it is certainly capable of taking some great shots.

Rory Lee,The iPhone SE has the same display as the 5s according to iFixit’s teardown,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/01/the-iphone-se-has-the-same-display-as-the-5s-according-to-ifixits-teardown/,"apple,Apple iPhone,Apple iPhone SE,ifixit,iPhone,iPhone SE,iPhone SE teardown,iPhone SE teardown iFixit,smartphone teardown","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-04-01,"When a new phone comes out, the popular thing to do these days is to tear it down to find out exactly what’s inside these devices because clearly people want to know what they’ve spent their hard-earned money on. While Chipworks had their go at prying open the  , now it’s iFixit’s turn to have their way with  ‘s latest and what they reveal is actually rather interesting. It doesn’t take a genius to guess what smartphone the iPhone SE was based on, one look will tell you that it’s the spitting image of Apple’s older iPhone 5s. The question is, what’s new? Well, not the display apparently. In iFixit’s comprehensive teardown, one of the first things they noticed was that the iPhone SE had the exact same display as the older iPhone 5s. So similar, in fact, that they’re practically interchangeable. Yup, that means not only are the guides already available for those who want to DIY swap their broken iPhone SE displays for a new one, but you could theoretically use an old iPhone 5s’s panel too. The best part is that the display is plug and play between the two devices, so once you hook up the necessary connectors, the panel fires right up. Many have labeled the iPhone SE as an iPhone 5s stuffed full of iPhone 6s parts but that may not actually be entirely accurate. The 12-megapixel iSight camera, for example, may theoretically be the same as the one on the iPhone 6s, they’re not interchangeable. It is, however, quite different from the old iPhone 5s’s snapper (note the number of connectors) on the left, which is to be expected. You’d be happy to know that the iPhone SE also comes with a bigger 1,624 mAh battery, up from the iPhone 5s’s 1,560 mAh. Not a major upgrade, but coupled with improved battery optimisations, users should see an improvement in battery life over the iPhone 5s. Unfortunately, unlike the apparently interchangeable displays, the battery connectors on the iPhone SE differs from the 5s’s so no supercharging your old 5s. Another interesting thing that iFixit discovered was the waterproofing seals. Apple placed foamy silicone seals surrounding some but not all of the logic board connections. Curious. Wouldn’t Apple have wanted to maximise water protection throughout their device? I guess some corners had to be cut after all, but then again you shouldn’t be too disappointed as Apple   the iPhone SE as a waterproof device anyway. Be sure to check out iFixit’s   of the device if you want to learn more. What do you guys think of the iPhone SE’s internals? Is it worth the money?",8

Available for FIRST Gold customers in the Klang Valley only. The fixed fibre broadband scene is heating up as   joins the race with their Home Broadband service offering speeds of up to 10Mbps. According to Lowyat.net, the telco’s new plan would be called the Celcom Home Broadband and will offer speeds of 10Mbps for RM145/month (excl GST). If you’re a   subscriber, you will receive a 50% discount for the first six months of your Home Broadband subscription. That means you pay RM72.50/month (excl GST) for the first six months. Lowyat.net also claims that this plan is targetted towards Celcom subscribers, but made no mention on whether non-Celcom subscribers are eligible. For calls, the Celcom Home Broadband will charge users 8sen/min to all networks, while IDD calls will follow Celcom Postpaid’s IDD rates and will be charged in 30-second blocks. The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the plan: Lowyat.net’s information came from an anonymous source, so we thought we’d call Celcom up and see if we could verify it. According to the Celcom customer service representative, the telco did indeed “launch” their plan today which lends credence to Lowyat.net’s source. The customer service rep confirms all the plan details in the table above and that it is indeed available from today onwards, however, he did not have any information regarding the coverage area. That said, he did inform us that users who wished to sign up or find out if their area was covered could simply visit a Celcom Blue Cube for more information. We have a hunch that Celcom’s fibre service will be using  ‘s High-Speed Broadband infrastructure (like Maxis Fibre) due to an   between the parties. This means if your area is covered by UniFi, you will likely be able to get Celcom Home Broadband too. Although today was supposed to be the launch, there is still no information about this plan on the Celcom website. The Celcom customer service rep ensures that you will be able to get more information on their website soon. It is worth noting that this isn’t Celcom’s first stab at a fibre broadband as they did have a   back in 2012. Looking at the plan, we’re not terribly impressed by it. It’s fine if you’re a light user that only wants to spend the bare minimum on fibre Internet connectivity, but if you’re a moderate or heavy user, you’re better off topping up a little extra for about two or three times faster speeds on   or  . You could also add RM4 more and get  ‘s 100Mbps plan — if you can find yourself within their coverage area, but that’s only slightly less difficult than finding a unicorn. The way we see it, the most attractive thing about this plan is the fact that you can get 50% off for the first six months if you’re a Celcom FIRST Gold plan subscriber. Besides that, you’re probably better off with one of the new plans from the other fibre providers. Want more information on the new fibre plans from TIME, TM and Maxis? Check out our  . Want a laugh?

Now, it seems we do have some concrete evidence that the P9 would indeed sport the twin Leica lenses as was foretold. In previous leaks and iterations of the Huawei P9 — including those from serial leakster   — the smartphone was devoid of any branding, not even Huawei’s, which left many wondering about the validity of the Leica smartphone camera claims. In new pictures and renders by both   and  , the Huawei P9 is now proudly displaying it’s Leica branding. What’s a little disappointing to me though is that Leica didn’t go for the “red dot” branding, instead opting to just print their name on the back of the familiar P9. That said, the typeface used for the branding is consistent with those found on Leica’s own camera lenses so this lends some credibility to the images. From the pictures, the camera is bearing Leica’s Summarit badge with what looks like an aperture of f/2.2 and an equivalent focal length of 27mm. The lens array could also feature an aspherical element as denoted by the “ASPH” markings (though do correct me if I’m wrong). Besides the Leica glass, the Huawei P9 is rumoured to feature a dual camera setup on the back with each sensor featuring 12-megapixels. Said to be an evolution of the one on the  , the P9’s dual snappers should sport much of the features found on the 6 Plus including post-capture refocus and simulated aperture adjustments. This is exciting stuff. If I’m being honest, one of my biggest qualms with any of the Huawei devices I’ve used was the rather lackluster camera performance. Now with the German camera maker’s help, Huawei could very well have shored up one of their big weaknesses. Huawei’s P9 is set to be   on the 6th of April — and rumoured to come in   — so we’ll get confirmation of this and everything else then. For now, these are still just rumours so do take it with a grain of salt. What do you guys think of the P9? Would Leica glass be good enough to tempt you into picking one up?",6

That’s incredible value, something TM’s 100Mbps UniFi Pro plan (RM299/month) simply can’t match in terms of raw speed per dollar. What’s more, TIME offers speeds of up to 500Mbps compared to TM’s 100Mbps cap. Gaining this little edge, TIME simply couldn’t resist dropping a little celebratory burn on TM with a cheeky Facebook post: OHHH! The folks managing TIME’s social media must’ve been high-fiving each other for that. A solid 6/10 on the burn scale, a much cheekier jab compared to the one they  . But, their celebration is short lived as TM responded in timely fashion with a jab of their own: Ouch! Granted, I believe they could’ve been more subtle and do away with the capslocked words but I think TM came out ahead here. In the meantime, here’s some advice for TIME: I don’t know about you, but I think turning something fun into something political is a pretty lame move. It’s like someone shouting “ “. Takes all the fun out of it. Shortly after TIME’s reply, TM had this to say: So, who do you think came out ahead in Round 2? And the winner is…?",2

Rory Lee,Digi offers Malaysia’s first 4G LTE-A broadband with 100GB of quota,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/31/digi-offers-malaysias-first-4g-lte-a-broadband-with-100gb-of-quota/,"4G LTE,4G LTE-A,Broadband,DiGi,DiGi 4G LTE,digi broadband 145,Digi broadband 185,digi LTE-A,Digi LTE-A broadband,LTE-A,LTE-A Malaysia,LTE-Advanced","DiGi,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Players on the Field,Technologies",2016-03-31,"Capitalising on their “widest 4G  ” network coverage,   launched two 4G LTE-Advanced plans — the Broadband 145 and Broadband 185. These plans are designed to give customers high-speed Internet connectivity anywhere within Digi’s LTE-A coverage areas via the company’s new LTE-A capable MobiFi device. The Broadband 145 plan offers 50GB of Internet quota for RM145/month while the Broadband 185 will offer 100GB of Internet quota for RM185/month. Both plans will be available to customers starting 1st April 2016. If you’re a Digi Postpaid plan subscriber, you can get RM25 off the monthly bill which brings the total down to RM120 and RM160 for each plan respectively. Additionally, Digi Postpaid plan subscribers can also pick up the MobiFi mobile wireless router (which is a  ) for RM203 instead of the retail price of RM754. Digi also lets you pick up the MobiFi portable wireless router on contract. If you’re going with the Broadband 145 plan, you will have to pay a total of RM300 (RM145 for plan + RM155 for device upfront payment) while Broadband 185 subscribers only need to pay RM280 upfront (RM185 for plan + RM95 for device upfront payment). In addition to the upfront payments, you will also have to pay RM9 for the first 12 months. That means, if you get the Broadband 145 with a MobiFi device, you will be paying a total of RM263 (RM155 upfront + RM108 device) for the MobiFi while the Broadband 185’s MobiFi device will set you back a total of RM203 (RM95 upfront + RM108 device) This means, if you’re a Digi Postpaid customer going for the Broadband 145 plan, it’s actually cheaper to buy the MobiFi device outright because you will only need to pay RM203 for it. Of course, the Broadband 145 and 185 plans will work with pretty much any mobile wireless device that is LTE-A capable, so you don’t have to splurge on Digi’s MobiFi if you already have one lying around, or can pick one up for cheaper. Digi’s Mobifi does boast Cat 6 LTE speeds with support for 802.11ac WiFi, though. Keep in mind that the 50GB and 100GB of Internet quota are split between anytime quota and off-peak quota. For the Broadband 145 plan, 20GB will be allocated as anytime quota while 30GB is filed under off-peak quota (2am-8am). Meanwhile, the Broadband 185 sees an Internet quota split of 30GB of anytime quota and 70GB of off-peak quota. Once the quota is depleted, Broadband 185 users will have their speeds throttled to 512kbps but can still continue using the plan, unlike the Broadband 145 plan that simply cuts off once your quota has been exhausted. LTE-Advanced works via Carrier Aggregation using both 1800MHz and 2600 MHz bands to give you more consistent high speeds. As of today, Digi claims that their LTE-A network is the widest in the country, covering 31% of the population. To enjoy LTE-A speeds, you will need to have a 4G SIM, at least a Cat 6 device and be within their coverage area. If you meet these three criteria, any Digi customer can enjoy 4G LTE-A speeds regardless of whether you’re on a postpaid, prepaid or broadband plan. Digi also demonstrated their 4G LTE-A capabilities, reaching speeds of 100Mbps in the Taman Bukit Jalil area. If you’d like to see a map of Digi’s LTE and LTE-A coverage, head on over to their  .",9

But that’s not all, they’ve also released a budget device that is now the cheapest device in Malaysia with a fingerprint scanner. The highlight of DOOGEE’s launch has to be their Android flagship smartphone, the F7 Pro. On the front of the smartphone, you’ll find a 5.7-inch full-HD IGZO display that has slim bezels and is tucked under 2.5D glass for a more rounded finish. Encased in its metal is the world’s first deca-core processor — the MediaTek Helio X20 — mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. For photos, the F7 Pro gets a 21-megapixel Sony IMX230 sensor on the back with Phase Detection AF. Selfies are taken care of by a 13-megapixel front-facing snapper. Keeping the lights on is a generous 4,000 mAh battery that can be charged up via a USB Type-C port and the smartphone will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow. While this is DOOGEE’s flagship device, there was no mention of a price, but the company did say that the smartphone will go on sale sometime in Q2 of 2016. Having a phone with a big battery is like having big hands –some people like to tell everyone about it. If you’re this kind of person, then the DOOGEE T6 is the Android smartphone for you as it packs a massive 6,250 mAh battery. Everything else is a little underwhelming, however. On the front, it gets a 5.5-inch HD 720p display with a MediaTek MT6735 quad-core processor mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. For photos, it gets an 8-megapixel/2-megapixel camera combo. The smartphone will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop. The DOOGEE T6 is priced at RM599 and will come in Marble White and Titanium Grey. It will go on sale exclusively at   from today (31st March) onwards. Rounding up the smartphone launches is another budget friendly device — the Y200 — one of the cheapest smartphones with a fingerprint sensor in Malaysia. Coming in at RM699 it is a touch cheaper than the   and its fingerprint sensor is mounted on the front of the device, not the rear like both the Redmi Note 3 and the DOOGEE F7 Pro. In terms of specs, the Y200 gets a 5.5-inch HD 720p display and pretty much the same internals as the T6 above, except it has a 32GB of internal storage. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000 mAh battery while photos are taken care of by an 8MP/5MP camera combo. It will also come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Alongside its three smartphone reveals, DOOGEE also launched a pico projector called the Smart Cube P1 and a 3G smartwatch called the S1. The Smart Cube P1 is a funky little device that is a projector and a speaker unit rolled into a cube that can fit in the palm of your hand. The projector beam can shoot up to 3.3m to a width of 90 inches. As it has a built-in speaker, you can use it as a nifty portable media consumption device on-the-go. You won’t be getting super high-resolution projects, though, as it only projects at a resolution of 854×480 (WVGA). The Smart Cube P1 supports multiple devices with Air Play, DLNA, Miracast, Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity. The P1 offers a Texas Instrument DLP with 70 lumen/3W brightness, OSRAM LED and 30,000 hours of LED lifetime. Keeping everything running is a 4,800 mAh battery which can double as a powerbank with a 5V2A output. Priced at RM999, it isn’t a cheap device, but you do get a decent amount of features for it. The Smart Cube P1 will go on sale in Q3 of 2016. DOOGEE claims that their S1 smartwatch is a full-featured wearable and to a certain extent, it is. It’s compatible with Android and you can insert a 3G SIM card into the watch. Since it has a microphone and speaker, you can make and receive calls with the device. It’s also got a heart-rate monitor, a 5MP camera, a 1.54-inch IPS (240×240 pixel) screen and is IP67 water resistant.",6

However, at the end of last year, we reported that there would be a   entering the scene in 2016 and it seems this could be it. We received an email invitation from   regarding a “P1 secret” that was due to be unveiled on the 13th of April 2016. Now, what could it possibly be?  Well, from the looks of things, it certainly seems like they’re going to officially announce their mobile 4G service. Since  ‘s acquisition of P1 in 2014, TM has worked towards developing P1 into their mobile arm and mobility centre, initially eyeing a 2015 launch of their mobile services. That initial plan didn’t come to fruition but it looks like their revised schedule of a 2016 entry will. TM has said that their overall LTE network rollout, the core of which is being managed by P1, was proceeding as planned so being able to meet their revised target of a 2016 launch may not come as such a surprise. This isn’t TM’s first foray into LTE technology as they launched their very own 4G broadband-only service TMgo back in 2015 which runs on 850MHz. TMgo was designed to replace TM’s older Wireless Streamyx on CDMA. What does TM’s entry into the 4G operator industry mean for us as consumers? Well, many good things we hope. More competition is always welcomed because it keeps the other telcos on their toes. A firm monopoly on any industry hurts us, the consumers, the most because it means that we’re at the mercy of whoever holds all the cards in that particular industry. Competition, on the other hand, means that these companies have to keep their plans competitive and try to undercut or trump the competition to attract consumers. A good example of this can be seen in the recent . With TM’s entry, things will surely get more interesting for the current four-way horse race as TM will be bringing in all their expertise and experience that they’ve accrued over the years to shake up the scene. How effective will they be as a telco? I guess we’ll have to wait to find out.",4
Alexander Wong,TM introduces its new 100Mbps UniFi Pro plan,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/31/tm-introduces-its-new-100mbps-unifi-pro-plan/,"100Mbps,Fibre Broadband,Telekom Malaysia,TM,TM 100Mbps,TM Unifi,TM Unifi Pro,TM Unifi Pro Plan","Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2016-03-31,"TIME made their move. Maxis followed soon after. Now, it’s TM’s turn to round up the trifecta of new plans with their new UniFi Pro plan that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. As an early bird promo, TM is offering RM30/month off and you can start enjoying 100Mbps from as low as RM299/month with voice calls and IPTV bundled in. On the surface, it seems like a negligible difference compared to Maxis’ 100Mbps Home Fibre (RM330/month for MaxisONE postpaid customers) but if you take all the extras that come with your UniFi Pro plan into consideration, it offers much better value for your money. The base UniFi Pro plan is supposed to offer Internet speeds of up to 100Mbps plus a base HyppTV package (Aneka, Varnam or Ruby) for RM299/month (Normal: RM329). If you want the HyppTV Jumbo pack, you will have to top up an additional RM30, bringing the total to RM329 per month (Normal: RM359).  Besides that, the UniFi Pro plan looks to offer a free Voice Pack (worth RM20) which gives you 600 minutes of calls nationwide per month. If you exceed 600 minutes, you will be charged 10sen/min for calls to other fixed lines and mobile numbers but calls to TM fixed lines remain free. What’s more, you will also be able to stream HyppTV Everywhere on 2 devices, plus receive 500MB/day for TM WiFi. In addition to that, you will also have access to other UniFi perks like a free 12-month iflix subscription (worth RM96) and 3 months of Viu access. For Business users, the 100Mbps plan is offered at RM379/month (Normal: RM399) and it also comes with voice calls worth RM70. Any excess usage for fixed line numbers are still free but calls to mobile numbers are charged at 8 sen/minute.  To be fair, this UniFi Pro plan and Maxis’ MaxisONE Home 100Mbps plan, once again, doesn’t really compete with each other. The MaxisONE Home 100Mbps plan is only available in Maxis’ own areas of coverage (that is about 75,000 ports). These ports don’t overlap with UniFi’s own 1.89 million ports so the end result for the consumer is whether you have one or the other. Another difference is speed where TM offers 100Mbps for download and 50Mbps for upload. As usual, all subscription are tied with a 24-month contract.  If we were to take those factors out of the equation, the UniFi Pro plan is far better in terms of value-for-money as you’re getting high-speed Internet connectivity as well as a bunch of other goodies like IPTV and free streaming subscriptions. Another point against Maxis’ favour is that you have to be a MaxisONE Plan 158 and above subscriber to be eligible for the 100Mbps MaxisONE Home fibre Internet plan. If you were to factor that in with your monthly RM330, you’re paying RM488/month excluding GST.",2

For better grip, the body uses polycarbonate with a perforated texture. There are 2x USB outputs that push a maximum of 5.1V/3.6A combined. Replenishing this 20,000mAh brick is done quickly as it supports quick charge via 5V/2A, 9V/1.2A and 12V/1.5A. They reckon that you can charge up 11,000mAh in just 3 hours.

The Mi Band Pulse uses a Mi Fit app and it syncs via Bluetooth. Apart from being an activity tracker, it also works for notifications and it can be a subtle vibrating alarm on your wrist. For RM79, this is quite a steal for those who want a basic activity tracker. The standard Mi Band without the heart rate monitoring is still available at RM69, but you can snap it up during the   next week.  Want a better deal? You can try your luck with its limited flash sales where you can pick up a Mi In-Ear headphone, Redmi Note 2, Mi Band Pulse or the 20,000 Power Bank for only RM1. Xiaomi Malaysia is also throwing another new accessory with the Mi USB Car Charger. It is going for RM35 and it comes with two USB ports that can support up to 5V/3.6A on a single port or 5V/2.4A when both ports are in use.

Rory Lee,Samsung’s Galaxy J5 and J7 receive the upgrades they deserve,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/29/samsungs-galaxy-j5-and-j7-receive-the-upgrades-they-deserve/,"revealed,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy J,Samsung Galaxy J5,Samsung Galaxy J5 2016,Samsung Galaxy J7,Samsung Galaxy J7 2016","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-29,"has finally revealed their new   (2016) and   (2016) smartphones, fixing many of the issues we originally had with the devices. The duo got a bump in specs as well as a few nice new features. The Galaxy J5 was a rather underwhelming device from the get-go with a measly 1.5GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. With the Galaxy J5 (2016), Samsung has bumped the specs up by quite a bit. Now, it sports a larger 5.2-inch HD Super AMOLED panel on the front of the device with a 1.2GHz octa-core processor mated to 2GB OF RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Now with twice the storage, users start with 10.6GB of available storage compared to the old device’s 4.3GB of available storage. In the camera department, its got a 13MP f/1.9 primary camera mounted on the back plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie shooter with front-facing flash for those crucial low-light selfies. Keeping the lights on is a larger 3,100 mAh battery. Perched higher up the ladder is the bigger and more powerful Galaxy J7 (2016). Along with a larger 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel, the J7 (2016) also sports beefier internals with a 1.6GHz octa-core processor on the inside mated to 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. While the bump up in screen resolution to full-HD from the HD panel on the previous model is nice, the best part of this new model is the increased RAM — double that of the old J7’s 1.5GB. For photos, the Galaxy J7 (2016) sports the same optics as on the Galaxy J5 (2016) which should result in a similar photo-taking experience. Since it’s a bigger device, it also gets a bigger battery — rated at 3,300 mAh — which is also a bump up from the previous J7. The new Galaxy J duo also has support for microSD expansion (up to 128GB) and dual-SIM capabilities via a dedicated microSD card slot and dual-SIM slot. That means you don’t have to choose between 2 SIMs or 1 SIM and one microSD card. Besides that, these devices now have support for NFC which should mean pairing and mobile payments are now that much easier. They’ve also got a metal frame that should lend a more premium feel in your hand.   As a whole, the upgrades these devices received are definitely necessary as it helps them keep up with the other low-end good-value smartphones in the market. However, with this bump in specifications, it is likely that the duo will also be marketed at a higher price. These devices will soon see an official release in China, but there is currently no word on when the Galaxy J duo will see an international release or when they will arrive in Malaysia. With the upgraded specs on the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016), these entry-level Samsung devices actually have better internals than the South Korean company’s mid-range Galaxy A3 (2016) and Galaxy A5 (2016) smartphones. However, the Galaxy A series devices have a more premium build and finish (plus a fingerprint scanner on the A5) which does feel great in the hand. What do you think of these new Galaxy J devices?",6

Whether you’re travelling in an unfamiliar part of town, don’t want to worry about parking, or are just too tired to drive, Uber becomes your personal chauffeur. If you’ve been a little creative with your use of Uber, I’m sure you’ve probably discovered that you can have an Uber driver send stuff like a parcel or a birthday cake instead. Of course, this may come with complications as the Uber service isn’t exactly meant for stuff like this, but as there aren’t many services like that, many have had no choice but to use Uber. Well, that’s not the case anymore. Meet NeonRunner. Funky name aside, NeonRunner offers same-day delivery services for “almost anything that can fit in their waterproof 18″ x 18″ x 16″ insulated carrier box that is below 12kg”. That’s a pretty wide range of stuff, but you probably won’t be able to use them for furniture delivery. NeonRunner offers two separate services — the first being a buying service where they buy stuff and send it to you while the second is a delivery service where they pick up whatever package or parcel you have and sends it to your desired location. Within the delivery service, you also have the option to get NeonRunner to complete specific tasks for you like banking in a cheque or paying your bills. Requesting a delivery, purchase or task is fairly simple. Simply create/log in to your NeonRunner account and choose either BUY or DELIVER. Then, enter the location details, item descriptions (you can add a photo too) and contact information before hitting the “Request a runner button”. To the right of the order page you will see a floating window that gives you a total estimate fee to get the task, purchase or delivery done. In the fee breakdown, they charge an RM0.25/km Distance Fee plus a RM0.50/min Time Fee for both services. However, for the BUY service, NeonRunner charges you an RM5 + 3.5% of the purchased item Service Fee while the DELIVER option gets a flat RM3 Service Fee. This service is reminiscent of something like GoGet or MatDespatch, but the biggest difference is the method of payment. With GoGet, you will need to have cash ready when the delivery arrives while MatDespatch operates on a prepaid credit system. NeonRunner, on the other hand, is cashless (much like Uber). Simply input your card information and billing address and you’re good to go. Easy and hassle free, two things I believe are a necessity for people who require these services. Though, it is worth noting that the operation only runs from 10am to 10pm daily, so no midnight deliveries for you. NeonRunner also only operates within the Greater Kuala Lumper and Klang Valley area.",8

Now, Xiaomi has upped the ante with the Redmi 3 Pro, bumping up the RAM to 3GB while doubling the expandable internal storage to 32GB. It’s also got a fingerprint scanner mounted on the back of the device — similar to the Redmi Note 3 — but that also means that it loses its diamond-etch pattern. Besides that, the phone keeps all of its other specs including a 13-megapixel PDAF camera with an f/2.0 aperture lens and a 5MP front facing snapper.

They have a large catalogue products ranging from personal mobility scooters to air purifiers. Now, they’re adding a new product to their roster — a rice cooker. Together with the launch of Xiaomi’s new sub-brand, the Mi Ecosystem, the Chinese company has unveiled the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker. Now   how you name a rice cooker. Like its name suggests, the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker is a WiFi-enabled rice cooker that is designed specifically to cook your rice in the best way possible. According to Xiaomi, their rice cooker follows the three concepts applied by expensive Japanese rice cookers to cook rice perfectly: Pressure control, heating method and the cooker’s lining material. The Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker employs a magnetic relief valve to precisely control the pressure in the rice cooker while using an electromagnetic heating technology for higher thermal efficiency and to ensure even cooking of the rice. It also uses a grey cast iron that has undergone a 69-step process to maintain an even heating and ensure strong thermal performance during use. The cast iron pot is coated with PFA powder to ensure that your rice doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot. Perhaps the most amazing feature of the Xiaomi rice cooker is the fact that you can scan a pack of rice with the Mi Home app to identify the type of rice, brand and origin. Then, based on that, the rice cooker can adjust its heating methodology to best suit that brand of rice so that the end result is a perfectly cooked pot of rice. Users can also customise the cooking and have their own preset preferences to cook the rice. It currently supports over 200 brands of rice but this support will be expanded in the future. As a cherry on top of the proverbial cake, the Mi Home app also comes with recipes that you can cook using the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker like brown rice, crispy rice and even cakes.",1

Just take a look at the   compared to the   series of smartphones — they’re nearly identical. However, the keyword here is “nearly”, as there are some noticeable physical features that separate the two smartphones. If we’re looking at the recent slew of photos shared by OPPO Malaysia CEO William Fang of the supposed  , the same distinction can’t be made because it looks   like the newly announced  . There’s no denying it, it’s identical from the rounded camera hump all the way to the front mounted fingerprint sensor. What’s peculiar here is that when the F1 Plus was   in Mumbai early this year, there was no mention of a fingerprint scanner at all. You would think that a fingerprint scanner on what should likely be a mid-range device to be a big deal, but there was no mention of it in the slides. It could then simply be a home button, but that seems unlikely. With smartphones that share a similar design, it isn’t too uncommon for companies to sometimes get them mixed up, so it is possible that William simply made a mistake. But, with each subsequent post, it seems more and more likely that this isn’t a mix-up and could indeed be the F1 Plus. If it isn’t a mix-up, what could it be then? Our guess is that the F1 Plus could be a rebranding of the R9. They line up in terms of specs with a 5.5-inch full HD display and 4GB of RAM, but we can’t say for certain as no further specifications have been revealed. Earlier, we reported that OPPO Malaysia was   the R9 to Malaysia a month after the device’s   on the 17th of March. However, with OPPO Malaysia’s latest teaser posted on their Facebook page, it seems more likely that the next device that they’re launching is the F1 Plus.

Rory Lee,HTC 10 to have a Snapdragon 652 variant,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/htc-10-to-have-a-snapdragon-652-variant/,"Android,HTC,HTC 10,HTC 10 leak,HTC 10 rumour,HTC 10 Snapdragon 652,HTC 10 Snapdragon 820,smartphone","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-03-28,"HTC’s 10 has been a hot topic of discussion lately. As information about the device trickles out, rumours regarding the device also start to heat up and one of the more interesting ones is that there may be two processor variants of the HTC 10 — a Snapdragon 820 variant and one that’s powered by a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor. That’s a pretty shocking jump in processing power no matter how you spin it. Although manufacturers have been known to release lower-end versions of their flagship devices, these devices often featuring either lower-clocked processors or slightly less RAM. HTC, on the other hand, seems to have gone down an interesting path with its choice of smartphone variants opting for a completely different SoC. This is pretty similar to the rumoured LG G5 “Lite” which is also a Snapdragon 652-powered G5. The low-spec HTC 10 is said to pack 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage to go along with the new Snapdragon chip. That’s quite a limited amount of space for a device bearing the flagship name — especially in 2016. On the other hand, the Snapdragon 820-powered devices are said to be packing either 3GB of RAM plus 32GB of storage or 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. HTC’s 10 does seem to pack a punch though as recent AnTuTu benchmarks reveal a   of 156.091 which completely beats everything else in the market right now. Considering this incredible performance, HTC must have worked some magic on their device’s optimisation because a similarly spec-ed Xiaomi Mi 5 is only capable of scoring 142,000 points. With this optimisation, it begs the question of how well the Snapdragon 652 variant would fair. We certainly wouldn’t expect another record-breaking score, but it should be pretty interesting to see. What is a little troubling to see is the rumoured price that the HTC 10 is said to retail at. According to  , the Snapdragon 652 variant will be priced at CNY3,799 (around RM2,343) while the higher Snapdragon 820 variants will be priced at CNY4,999 (around RM3,083) and CNY5,888 (around RM3,631). Other specifications rumoured for the HTC 10 are a 5.1-inch Quad HD   display, a   camera, a large 3,000 mAh battery and a new kind of   audio experience. How many variants HTC will really launch and what will be powering each device still remains unconfirmed so take it with a grain of salt. The good news is that the wait won’t be much longer as all will be   on 12th April 2016.",6
Rory Lee,5 things that you may not know were designed by Malaysians,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/5-things-that-you-may-not-know-were-designed-by-malaysians/,"intel,Intel Compute Stick,Intel IoT gateway,Intel Malaysia,Intel Malaysia Design Centre,Intel NUC board,Internet of Things,Malaysia,Malaysia Design centre,Malaysians,USB 1.0 microcontroller","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-03-28,"“Buatan Malaysia” often gets a bad rap even in our own country. But, the truth is, there are many Malaysians out there making some seriously awesome stuff. In tech, we’re making big strides too especially when it comes to major breakthroughs with one of the largest chipmakers in the world — Intel. Here are five awesome technological advancements Malaysians have made with the chipmaker that you probably didn’t know about. Intel has put a big emphasis on Asia to help drive its growth in recent years. They established their first facility outside of the United States   in 1972. However, as the years went by, Intel nearly shut the facility down in 1991 as the micro-controller business wasn’t profitable back then. That obviously would have put the engineers that worked there in a tough spot so rather than give up, the engineers proposed that Intel keeps the business running by adding value with design work. Since then, the relatively small team of 30 engineers has now grown to over 2,000 engineers all working under what has become the Malaysia Design Centre (MDC). This meant that Malaysia was no longer just a hub for the production of hardware, but also a contributor to the research and development of new products and technological innovations. Over the years, the MDC, working under Intel, has conceived many innovative breakthroughs in technological development but we’re here to tell you about the five biggest ones that have made a pretty significant impact on the world we live in right now. [ ] I’m sure you’ve seen this little guy making its rounds. If you haven’t, the Intel Compute Stick basically offers the full desktop experience of a computer, in something that looks like an oversized pen drive. It’s small and easy to carry around, plus the ease of being able to just plug it into any HDMI-enabled TV or display and turn it into a full-fledged PC makes it pretty nifty. Perfect for school and college use. [ ] As we develop towards the miniaturisation of the PC, Mini PCs become the next stepping stone to that of the full sized tower desktops. Stuff like the Remix Mini   are often enough for most people and their daily tasks. At the forefront of Mini PC development is Intel with its NUC (Next Unit of Computing) line of computers. These are basically computer kits that come with a custom Intel motherboard and an Intel CPU plus slots in which you can install RAM and a hard drive yourself. Super compact, totally upgradable, and designed by Malaysians. [ ] Intel’s Atom processors can be found in many netbooks, 2-in-1s and even smartphones. As a product line, the Atom processor is often associated with relatively inexpensive or portable netbooks and smart devices, but did you know that the first purpose built Low Cost Intel Architecture based System on a Chip design (codenamed Pineview Intel Atom) came out of the MDC team? Pineview processors cover the N4xx, D4xx, N5xx, and D5xx processors, all of which came with integrated graphics while boasting improved performance and a 20% drop in power consumption compared to previous generations. This particular design propelled the growth of lightweight, compact and affordable netbook market, netting seven world-class manufacturing records before it was even launched in 2009. With modern computers, simply plugging and playing your pen drives, mice and keyboards among other things into the desktop’s USB ports is practically a norm. It is this convenience and seamless peripheral connectivity that the Malaysian designed USB 1.0 micro-controller has made possible. No hassle, no fuss, just plug and play. The Internet of Things is a fascinating notion that is becoming more and more complete as each day passes. Smart TVs, smart fridges, smart air purifiers, all contribute to the connectivity of objects with each other. But what about legacy objects that were conceived and created before the IoT was a thing? Well, the MDC designed Intel IoT Gateway is one of these solutions that helps companies connect these legacy devices to the Internet. The device and sensor management application is an end-to-end IoT solution that has been successfully applied to smart agriculture systems and across a range of industries including hospitality, asset tracking and industrial automation. These are truly amazing things that this home-grown team of engineers have accomplished since their inception. So, as the MDC celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, let’s all take our hats off to these awesome technologies and the Malaysians behind their design.",4
Rory Lee,Compared: Fibre broadband services in Malaysia — TM vs TIME vs Maxis,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/compared-fibre-broadband-services-in-malaysia-tm-vs-time-vs-maxis/,"best fibre broadband malaysia,fibre broadband comparison,Fibre broadband comparison Malaysia,Malaysia,Maxis,Maxis fibre comparison,Maxis MaxisONE Home fibre,TIME,Time Fibre,TIME fibre comparison,TM,TM Unifi,TM UniFi comparison","Industry in General,Maxis,Players on the Field,Time,TM,UniFi",2016-03-28,"We’ve updated the comparison to include TM’s new  . After the initial  , it seems the battle has spilt over into the realm of fixed broadband services as the big-three fibre broadband service providers in Malaysia clash. The question is, which one is the best for you? Don’t worry because, as usual, we’ve got you covered. 
 We saw strong offerings from the three major players in the fibre broadband industry, but as with most plans, there are pros and cons to each plan. TM kicked things off by upping their UniFi game to the current   which offers 30Mbps download speeds for RM179. If you desire more speed, you can opt for the upgrade to 50Mbps for RM50 extra. TM also have a new UniFi Pro plan that offers speeds up to 100Mbps. Much like the original VIP UniFi plans, you will also get a free HyppTV subscription though only for the base channels. If you’re a big TV or movie buff, TM’s UniFi also offers a 1-year free subscription to local streaming service iflix worth RM96. With iflix, you get access to a moderately large catalogue of old and some relatively new shows that you can binge, including exclusives like Mr Robot. Opting for the UniFi Pro plan gives you additional benefits on top of those that you get with the UniFi Advance plans. Firstly, the UniFi Pro plan comes with a free Voice Call voice bundle (worth RM20) that gives you 600 mins of calls, beyond which you will be charged 10sen/min to mobile and other fixed lines (calls to TM fixed lines remain free). You also get a free 3-month access pass to Viu — a streaming site that offers Korean dramas, varriety shows and other asian programs. There is a caveat, however. With UniFi Advance and Pro, your download and upload speeds are not symmetrical, meaning for the base RM179 plan, you will be getting 30Mbps download speeds but only 10Mbps upload speeds. The same goes for the 50Mbps which have its upload speed limited to 20Mbps and the 100Mbps Pro plan which has it’s upload speeds limited to 50Mbps. Do keep in mind that these prices for the UniFi Advance and Pro plans are still under a promo price (original prices: RM199 (30Mbps), RM249 (50Mbps), RM329 (100Mbps) so the original prices are a tad higher. While TM has extended the promotional period for the UniFi Advance plans in the past, it remains unclear if they will do so for the “early bird promo” price for the UniFi Pro plan. , on the other hand, released their   of broadband services with symmetrical speeds of up to 500Mbps for RM299. If you don’t want to pay the premium for 500Mbps, they also have lower tier plans rated at 100Mbps and 300Mbps that costs RM149 and RM189 respectively. With TIME, you don’t get many luxuries in terms of add-ons, just raw Internet speed. In this aspect, TIME is unmatched by the other local fibre broadband operators, but, they have their hands tied when it comes to coverage as TIME’s services only extend to 250,000 ports nationwide. Most of TIME’s ports can be found in apartments and condos so if you’re living on a landed property, odds are, you won’t be able to subscribe to TIME.  are notorious for not participating in price wars, instead, opting to improve customer service and reliability. With that in mind, Maxis launched their latest   broadband plans which focus on customer service and installation experience. What they’ve come up with is the Maxperts which, in their own words. are a “SWAT-like team of Internet experts” who specialise in optimising your Internet connection. We can see how this is useful for those who are less than tech-savvy, but if you are anything like us, the services these Maxperts provide become much less valuable as you could probably do the optimising yourself. In true Maxis fashion, their fibre plans are the most expensive in this comparison. For the base 20Mbps plan, Maxis are charging RM170/month while the 30Mbps plan is going for RM220/month. You will also have to be subscribed to a MaxisONE Plan (excluding the MaxisONE Plan Lite) before you are eligible to subscribe to the MaxisONE Home. To make matters worse, the prices mentioned above are after a special promo discount for MaxisONE Plan 128 and above customers. That means, if you’re a MaxisONE Plan 98 subscriber, you will still have to pay the full price of RM198 for 20Mbps, RM270 for 30Mbps and RM398 for 100Mbps. Speaking of the 100Mbps plan, this plan is only available within Maxis’ own area of coverage (which reaches 75,000 ports) and does not extend to the ports they share with TM. Besides that, you will have to be a MaxisONE Plan 158, 188, MaxisONE Business and MaxisONE Business Extra to be eligible for the RM330/month price. In all honesty, these three companies aren’t exactly direct competitors because (especially in the case of TIME) you either have one or the other. Besides Maxis and TM, these services rarely overlap. That said, it is worth taking a look at who can provide the most well-rounded package out there. If it was up to me and I could choose between these three services, I would pick TIME. I’m a heavy Internet user so all I care about is Internet speed and stability — I don’t need all the extra goodies like IPTV bundles and calls or streaming subscriptions. But, I’m willing to bet that not many share my usage habits. So, if I were to consider the average household — including family members, guests, children, etc. — TM’s UniFi Advance and Pro plans provide the most well-rounded fibre experience. They’ve got iflix (which my mum loves to watch old movies on), clear free-to-air TV channels (which my dad loves), and a fast enough download speed + low latency for my gaming needs. A decent compromise that will probably tick the most boxes for the average family. Which plan would you pick?",2

Meanwhile, its predecessor, the   with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage is still retaining the same price tag of RM649. For Malaysia, we are getting the Redmi Note 3 international variant that was   in India earlier this month. Unlike the   model that was announced for China, the devices that we are getting are powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 650 Hexa-core processor and it gets a better camera at 16MP, plus the option to expand storage with microSD on its hybrid dual-SIM tray slot. It also supports 4G LTE, 802.11ac WiFi and it also supports VoLTE (Voice over LTE). The screen is a 5.5″ Full HD display that supports Reading Mode and Sunlight Display. For the first time on a Xiaomi device, the Redmi Note 3 also features a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner which unlocks in a single tap. For selfies, it gets a 5MP front shooter with its own auto beautification modes. Powering the Redmi Note 3 is a 4,050mAh capacity battery which Xiaomi claims to last up to 10 hours of video playback or 7 hours of gaming. It charges using micro USB and it also retains an infrared blaster that works as a universal remote. Out of the box, it runs on MIUI 7 OS with Android Lollipop running underneath.

At 12 noon on 29th March,   is set to officially launch their highly anticipated smartphone — the  . However, thanks to a reliable source, Zinggadget got hold of the official price for the new handset, and perhaps to nobody’s surprise, the device is priced below RM1,000. The media were given a briefing last Thursday (24th March) regarding the device, as well as given some time with the smartphone, but the details for the pricing as well as which variant of the smartphone Xiaomi were bringing into Malaysia were not revealed. Instead, we were told to hang on to our hats and wait for the official launch to find out. But, in what looks like a dinner of some sort for the potential resellers of the Redmi Note 3, a slide containing the price and a fact sheet for the Malaysian Redmi Note 3 model were leaked. Based on the images posted by  , Xiaomi is bringing in the version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable (up to 32GB via microSD) storage. What’s more, the device looks to be priced at RM849, placing it right in the crosshairs of the honor 5X. Other specifications include a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display on the front, with a Snapdragon 650 hexa-core processor running on the inside. For optics, the smartphone gets 16-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with PDAF plus a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. Encasing the respectable internals is a full-metal unibody — the first for a Xiaomi device. It’s also sporting Xiaomi’s first ever rear-mounted fingerprint sensor placed right below the camera, as well as a large 4,050 mAh battery. It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box and yes, this time there might actually be a retail box. In case you didn’t pick up on it earlier, the images look to have come from a retailer’s dinner hosted by Xiaomi which means that they might actually be using physical retail stores to sell their smartphone too — not just online. Besides that, if you look at the bottom right of the spec-sheet image, you’ll see Thorus Technology listed as an authorised reseller. This is pretty rare for the Chinese company but we believe it could be because the Online market has reached its peak and Xiaomi has hit their saturation point for online sales. Even in China, Xiaomi is working with big retail brands to sell their devices on the shelf so it might not be surprising if they decided to do so here as well. What do you guys think of this move by Xiaomi? Would you pick up the Redmi Note 3 from a physical store or stick to the online store? And of course, what do you think about the RM849 asking price for the handset? Let us know in the comments below. Thanks   for the tip!",6

Alexander Wong,Maxis is the leading mobile network in Malaysia according to OpenSignal’s report,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/25/maxis-is-the-leading-mobile-network-in-malaysia-according-to-opensignal/,"4G LTE,4G LTE Malaysia,Celcom,Celcom 4G,DiGi,DiGi 4G,Malaysia 4G LTE,Maxis,Maxis 4G,Maxis 4G coverage,Open Signal,OpenSignal,U Mobile,U Mobile 4G","Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-03-25,"Postpaid plans in Malaysia are   with competitive telcos dishing out more data for your money. Apart from cost, another crucial factor to consider is network quality. What’s the point of getting loads of data on the cheap if you can’t use it when you needed it the most? 4G LTE was introduced in Malaysia back in 2013 and currently we have 4 major LTE telcos – Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. To find out which network is best, OpenSignal has just published a State of Mobile Networks report specifically for Malaysia. The findings were derived from a data sample size of close to 40 million that were contributed by 21,109 OpenSignal app users in Malaysia between 1 December 2015 to 29 February 2016.  According to OpenSignal, Maxis gets their top pick for having the best 4G coverage and best speed in Malaysia. From their report over a 3 month period, Maxis users are connected to 4G LTE 70% of the time. Since Maxis customers are having 4G more frequently, this also brings up the overall network speed to first place with an average of 5.20Mbps. For 4G specifically, Maxis delivers an average speed of 13Mbps. Out of the 4 telcos, Celcom is ranked the worst due to lower network speeds and higher latency on both 3G and 4G. They noted that Celcom’s performance was better around the Klang Valley area. When compared to the global average, Malaysia’s 4G LTE speed is quite close to the standard average of 13.5Mbps.   To measure 4G coverage, OpenSignal uses the time coverage methodology which calculates the proportion of time a user is connected on 4G. This gives a better measurement especially when you could be getting just 3G indoors while being in a 4G covered area.  As seen on the chart above, Maxis leads at first place at 69.98% followed by Digi at 57.60%. Celcom takes third place at 52.94%, while U Mobile is last at 44.23%. U Mobile obviously takes a beating here as it relies on Maxis for 2G/3G coverage where their network is not available.  When looking at speed, U Mobile is the fastest in both 3G and 4G specifically. However, it takes 2nd place overall as most of it users are connected to 3G most of the time. Despite that, it is worth noting that U Mobile is faster overall than Digi and Celcom which has more 4G LTE sites in comparison.  Celcom, unfortunately, ranks the slowest among the four in any given scenario.  Maxis and U Mobile are the top picks for 3G with a latency of less than 105ms. Meanwhile for 4G, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile have a 3-way draw with less than 56ms. The lower the latency indicates a more responsive network and unfortunately, Celcom trails behind for both 3G and 4G segments.  To conclude, OpenSignal’s latest report ranks Maxis as the better network for overall 4G LTE availability, speeds and latency. This is contrary to what   their website earlier on.  For this year, we can expect our telcos to push for more 4G coverage aggressively particularly Maxis and Digi. Both telcos will be refarming their 2G 1800MHz spectrum for 4G use. On top of that, both are also pushing for more LTE-A sites which provide even faster speeds with carrier aggregation.  If OpenSignal’s report is an accurate indicator, Celcom has a lot of room to improve. With its value-for-money FIRST postpaid plans, the blue telco has the pulling power to draw other subscribers to their fold. To expand and to upgrade a 4G network is a costly affair. There are concerns whether affordable plans with loads of data can sustain telcos in the long run. If you haven’t seen it yet, you can check out our   post.

It still a bit less hassle than taking the bus to the airports but if you’ve got a lot of luggage it might be a bit of a problem.

How else do they get away with selling everything they do as a reinvention of technology? It’s as uncanny as it is amazing and while you either hate Apple or love them, you can’t help but admire how well they get people to eat out of their hands. Take their latest device, the  , for instance. When Cupertino revealed it, I was blown away because it was the single most brilliant but dumb thing they’ve done. Apple’s March 2016 Keynote special event was by no means a large event, in fact, it was almost intimate as far as mobile launches go. Many, including us, weren’t expecting too much from them because they don’t usually make big announcements this early in the year. However, we were still holding out hope for some other kind of mobile accessory like a reinvented pair of VR goggles or a completely innovative 360-camera. Instead, what we got was a hint that Apple may be losing grip on their “world-changing” ways. All that the most valuable brand in the world had to show for their March Keynote was a  , an even   trapped in a body of a three-year-old smartphone and some  . Has one of the largest tech companies in the world nothing else to show at an internationally broadcasted event but a “new” iPad and iPhone? It honestly looked a little like Apple were shaken by how good their competitors have gotten and simply told   to throw something together out of spare parts. They could have done something as simple as tweak the design of the iPhone SE and it would have made all the difference. Instead, the only way you can tell the iPhone SE apart from the three-year-old 5s is that it weighs 1g more and comes in rose gold. It seems that Apple is resorting to rehashing an old device just to keep up with the competition. Of course, you could argue: Why fix something that isn’t broken? But that’s not what Apple does. Apple prides themselves with breaking the mould and not only improving existing tech but also “reinventing” it. With the iPhone SE, Apple had instead shown that even they can’t keep innovating. I say this because none of that matters. The main point of the iPhone SE is that now more people can buy iPhones. With the iPhone SE, not only are loyal customers who have previously hung on to old 4-inch iPhones going to have a viable upgrade, it’s also cheap. Well, cheap by Apple’s standards. But if you want an iPhone, Apple’s standards are the only standards you need to live by. So, instead of looking at a rehashed smartphone, people see an affordable and small iPhone with flagship-level performance. It doesn’t matter that it looks exactly like the iPhone 5s, or that it’s probably made using the same stuff. Nor does it matter that Apple had the audacity to put a rudimentary 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera on a 2016 smartphone that costs nearly RM2,000. What matters is that Apple found a need for a small, powerful yet affordable iPhone and are now owning that need.",7

It is a brand new model and it doesn’t even have a number on it. In the past, the cheapest iPhone you can buy is basically a rehash of an outdated model with a smaller storage option. We’ve seen this since the  /  days. That’s no longer the case with the iPhone SE. It is Apple’s most affordable new iPhone and it’s just as powerful as their current flagship. Smartphones these days are getting bigger and we’ve seen how Apple has succumbed to this trend when they introduced a larger 4.7” iPhone 6 and a phablet-sized 5.5″ Plus model. Of course not everybody wants a bigger phone. In 2015, Apple is still   over 30 million iPhones with a 4” screen which included the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. Well, it isn’t a huge chunk considering that’s only 13% of its total 231.5 million iPhones sold, but nevertheless it is still quite a significant number. Remember the ad above? It is still relevant today and there are people who are   to their old iPhone 5/5S because of the size. Try tapping the “back” button on the larger iPhones and you’ll get what I mean. The iPhone SE looks exactly like an iPhone 5S and you can even have it in Rose Gold. Underneath that familiar 4” 1136×640 Retina display, the iPhone SE is just as good as the current iPhone 6s. In fact, they are calling it the most powerful 4-incher yet. It gets the same top notch iPhone 6s performance with a 64-bit A9 chip and it also packs the same 12MP iSight camera with dual-tone LED flash, Live Photos and it also shoot videos in 4K. Over at the front, it settles for the same old 1.2MP camera as the iPhone 6/5S but it supports Retina Flash for brighter selfies. Connectivity wise, the iPhone SE will work with a wider range of LTE networks and it also comes with NFC support for Apple Pay. Our fluctuating exchange rates have made Apple products ridiculously expensive in Malaysia. You would have to fork out more than RM3,000 for the latest iPhone and that’s for the pathetic 16GB model. The iPhone SE is probably the best alternative for Apple to reach out to the mid-range segment. It packs flagship hardware at Apple’s “entry-level” price range. Make no mistake, Apple isn’t doing a Xiaomi but it is pretty much like how Sony does their Xperia Z compact line. In fact, there are rumours suggesting that Samsung will counter the SE with a compact Galaxy S7. The iPhone SE is very likely to be priced from under RM2,000 when it gets to Malaysia. This enables those on a budget to enjoy the very latest hardware from Apple. In Singapore, the iPhone SE 16GB is   at S$658 (RM1,954), which is lower than the iPhone 5S 16GB at S$728 (RM2,162). It is also the same in  , with the iPhone SE 16GB priced at A$679 (RM2,083) versus the iPhone 5S 16GB at A$749 (RM2,298). Before the iPhone 5S was removed from the Malaysian online store, the 16GB model is going for RM2,199 while the 32GB version is priced at RM2,499. The above table is our iPhone SE price estimate which shouldn’t stray too far from our southern neighbour. Let’s hope our RM doesn’t slide further against the US Dollar. Pre-orders are starting this week in first wave countries and the iPhone SE should reach Malaysia latest by end of May 2016. If you’ve been eyeing for an iPhone 6 16GB, forget that and get the iPhone SE 64GB instead. Yes, it is a smaller phone but you get better specs, better camera and most importantly 4X the storage. Trust us, you definitely need more than 16GB on an iPhone.",1

Now, sticking to initial launch plans, these two wearables have finally hit our shelves. What sets the Blaze apart from the highest end  ? Well, for starters, it looks a whole lot better if you ask me. It has a much sleeker and classier look to it compared to the chunky Surge, which means that it’ll go well with almost every occasion. It’s also got a colour LED touch screen — a first for the wearable maker. It also pushes notifications like call, text and calendar alerts to your wrist from your smartphone. You can also control music playback and is also sweat and water resistant though no IP rating is given. What’s more, it’ll feature Fitbit’s SmartTrack which automatically recognises and records exercises for you. You can also pop out the head and swap it with another strap if elastomer is not your thing. However, it does lack one big feature from the Surge that fitness enthusiasts will undoubtedly miss — built-in GPS. Fitbit says it has “connected GPS” but that’s just a fancy term for saying “you need your smartphone to track distance and route”. Boo. Still, that has allowed Fitbit to keep the battery life on this device to 5 days but is admittedly shorter than the 7-day Surge battery life. Nevertheless, Fitbit is also placing it at a lower price point in their food chain, with the Blaze   RM950 (incl GST) — comes in Black and Plum colours — meaning that the Fitbit Surge still sits on top as the apex predator. As far as bands go, here’s the full catalogue on Harvey Norman: The Alta is two down from the Blaze in terms of its position in the Fitbit family, slotting in right between the   and the  . As a result, it has much less functionality but gets many of the core features right. It’ll track your activity all day, remind you to move and automatically records your activities via SmartTrack. It’ll also track your sleep and double as a clock plus push notifications like call, text and calendar alerts (something the Charge HR doesn’t do). However, it does lack an altimeter and a heart-rate sensor, but there’s really only so much you can cram into such a small form-factor. It looks pretty sleek and stylish which means that this little wristband-like smart wearable should fit in any occasion. If you’re interested, the Fitbit Alta is   now at RM630 (incl GST) and comes in three colours — Blue, Black and Plum. Neither tickle your fancy? Take a gander at our  .",1

HP’s Pavilion x2 is one that fits into that hybrid laptop category and I quite like it despite some of its obvious drawbacks. There’s no denying that it’s a handsome device. Closed or open, it will look good on any dream desk as it looks very modern and fairly premium despite its plastic construction. That said, you should be extra careful with the white version because that picks up quite a bit of dirt over time. You can tell that thought was put into the construction of the device when you look at the hinge. When the device is open, the screen rolls out and elevates the keyboard, giving you better ergonomics than a flat keyboard. Plus, the magnets holding the tablet to the keyboard are quite strong, letting you lift the device without worry of either part coming off. Since we’re on the topic of the keyboard, it does give a nice typing experience. For something so small and compact, the keys are well spaced and give great travel when typing.

Its got a lot of the stuff that makes the iPad Pro tick under the hood and Apple is marketing it as the ultimate PC replacement. Apple is quite confident that the iPad Pro could be the “PC replacement device” that people are looking for, especially since there are 600 million PCs that are over 5 years old. They’re pretty sure that these users will just jump straight to the iPad Pro 9.7. Specs wise, the iPad Pro sports quite a bit of the same specs as its bigger counterpart; featuring the same A9X processor and four speakers. However, it does have an upgraded 12MP rear camera that can shoot 4K video alongside a 5MP front snapper with Retina Flash. The display has also gotten a significant bump up, as Apple claims that the new iPad Pro is 40% less reflective than the  ‘s screen and apparently that its got the lowest reflectivity while being the brightest tablet on the market.

Rory Lee,The Apple iPhone SE is the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/22/the-apple-iphone-se-is-the-most-powerful-4-inch-phone-ever/,"4-inch iPhone,apple,Apple iPhone SE,Apple Keynote March 2016,iOS,iPhone SE,smartphone","Apple,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-03-22,"has welcomed a new iPhone to their smartphone family — the   — and it’s a 4-inch device designed for people who simply love smaller iPhones. It’s packing a whole lot of horsepower that makes it the “most powerful 4-inch phone ever”. At the heart of the iPhone SE (pronounced “essay” apparently) sits Apple’s powerful A9 chip and M9 motion coprocessor. This means that the device has the same amount of performance as their iPhone 6s flagship device. This 4-inch smartphone also features Apple’s Retina display, boasting a pixel density of 326 ppi. That’s a mighty little device if we’ve ever seen one. What’s more, the iPhone SE will pack the excellent 12-megapixel iSight camera with Focus Pixels and a True Tone flash. To ensure the best camera experience, the iPhone SE also sports the A9’s new image signal processor which should ensure excellent photos. On the front though, things aren’t so pretty as the FaceTime HD camera is only capable of taking 1.2-megapixel images. One of the biggest complaints we’ve heard from our readers (and apparently every other iPhone 5s customer) was its terrible battery life. Well the iPhone SE is supposed to bring an improvement to battery performance, despite all that extra horsepower, which should keep you running for longer. It also has support for, faster LTE (50% faster than iPhone 5s), VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and faster 802.11ac WiFi connectivity. It’s also got Touch ID to ensure your device is secure, plus help you unlock and access your smartphone with just a tap of your finger. What is missing is Apple’s 3D Touch, which seems to have been abandoned for the iPhone SE. In terms of looks, the device does look almost exactly like the old iPhone 5s which perhaps speaks to Apple’s efforts and desire in their recycling devices. If you’re interested, the iPhone SE will go on sale on 31st March (with preorders beginning 24th March) with prices starting at USD399 (around RM1,611) for the 16GB model and USD499 (around RM2,015) for the 64GB model. In Singapore, the smartphone will go for SGD658 (around RM1,955) for the 16GB model and SGD828 for the 64GB model (around RM2,460).",1

It’s something you can do on most navigation applications and it allows you to have quick access to your favourite destinations. In a recent update,   added a little feature that’ll add some pizzazz to your navigation experience. Google Maps now lets you put stickers on your Work and Home saved locations. These stickers range from igloos to barn houses so if you’re bored of what your current house looks like, at least, you can now change what you see on your navigation app. This is a cute personalisation gesture that I will surely mess around with at least for awhile, but pretty stickers aren’t the only thing Google added to their navigation app. Maps now also lets you add labels to your favourite destinations like the gym, school or underground bowling alley that you frequent. Again, this gives you a degree of personalisation and customisation on the experience you want to have when navigating with the app, rather than actually functionality. This is because you can simply save a location by tapping the “Save” button with the golden star and it will turn up in “Your places” when you pull out the hamburger menu. I suppose the biggest benefit is if you give a place with a complicated name a simple nickname or code via the label. All you have to do then is type label or nickname into the app’s search bar (for example, AMPM Cafe is labelled Mmm Yummy in my Maps) and the location will appear at the top of the search results. Pretty nifty quality of life changes, but nothing too radical from what we can tell. Well, except the fact that you can change your house into a flippin’ dragon whenever you want to and that’s pretty awesome if you ask me.",0
Rory Lee,HTC’s power of 10 is looking better by the minute,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/21/htc-10-leak-lcd-display-3000-mah-battery/,"Evan Blass,evleaks,HTC,HTC 10,htc flagship,HTC flagship 2016,power of 10,rumour mill,smartphone","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-03-21,"There’s been a lot of hype building up to the eventual reveal of the  . The Taiwanese company is in a tough spot and it looks like a lot of whether they will sink or swim is riding on their upcoming flagship device. We’ve seen some spec leaks and rumours in the past and now thanks to everyone’s favourite leakster we have even more information on the 10’s display — it’s LCD. In the past, rumours have pointed towards the HTC 10 featuring a 5.1-inch quad-HD panel mounted on the front and according to  , that panel will be Super LCD 5 instead of an AMOLED panel like the one on the One A9. Super LCD 5 is a variant of the LCD display that has no air gap between the outer glass and the actual display component. This is done to reduce glare and increase visibility. It is also supposed to be more frugal with power consumption. Speaking of power consumption, @evleaks has also revealed that the HTC 10 would have a large (for HTC’s standards) 3,000 mAh battery juicing up the device. Battery capacities upwards of 3,000 mAh is a rare sight on HTC devices, so this is definitely a welcomed addition if it proves true. On the inside, the 10 supposed to pack a powerful Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It’s also said to feature a front-facing fingerprint scanner and home button combo along with 2 capacitive buttons. Unfortunately, it looks like HTC have done away with one of their flagships biggest features — the BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers. A bummer, but at least it’s said to get a USB Type-C port with support for quick-charging. The HTC 10 has a lot to prove if it’s going to save HTC from the downward spiral that it’s caught in. Previous smartphone flagships have promised much but faltered in the delivery, especially when it came to optics. HTC are making similar promises with the 10, previously boasting “ ” cameras on both the front and back of the device. This time, the stakes are a little different though as the HTC 10 would actually have to make good on that promise if HTC wants to keep from sinking. That’s a tall order especially considering how stacked the smartphone camera market is right now. Could it possibly be better than the phenomenal  / ‘s 12-megapixel Dual Pixel shooter? I guess we’ll have to wait to find out. What do you guys think of the HTC 10?",6
Alexander Wong,Compared: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge telco plans in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/21/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-celcom-digi-maxis-u-mobile-comparison/,"Celcom,DiGi,Galaxy S7 edge celcom,Galaxy S7 edge maxis,Galaxy S7 edge U mobile,Maxis,price comparison,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Celcom,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge comparison,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge digi,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge maxis,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge telco comparison,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge u mobile,samsung malaysia,Telco Comparison,U Mobile","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-21,"The   is the best flagship smartphone you can buy at the moment with a retail price of RM3,099. If you’re planning to get one on contract, it is also available from the big 4 telcos ( ,  ,   and  ) in Malaysia. So which offers the better deal? And should you also consider getting one with the Maxis Zerolution or Celcom NewPhone program?  We’ve crunched the numbers, so read on for our Galaxy S7 edge price plan comparison. 
 Across the board, all telcos are offering 24-month contracts for the Galaxy S7 edge. The only exception is Celcom, with a shorter 12-month option for its higher FIRST Gold plan. With the ongoing postpaid price war, Celcom is the most competitive of the lot. Celcom’s FIRST Blue postpaid comes with 4GB of data at RM45/month, while the FIRST Gold plan packs 10GB for only RM80/month. For Digi, they are offering the Galaxy S7 edge with their new Postpaid plans that come in either More Internet or More Voice and SMS. The new plan offers RM20 off for those who sign up with their Postpaid 98, 148 and 238 (More Talk and SMS) plans before 30th June 2016. However, this offer isn’t applicable with the Galaxy S7 edge bundle. Fortunately, they are still giving extra 2GB data quota for its More Internet option.  During registration, Digi also requires you to pay 1-month advance subscription on top of the device upfront payment. Alternatively, you can sign up for a 0% EPP via credit card to pay no cash upfront during registration.  Maxis is still the most expensive option for postpaid contract. The entry level MaxisONE Plan 98 offers unlimited calls and SMS but it comes with just 1GB of data. It simply pales in comparison to Digi and Celcom that offers 10X more data for less. On the highest MaxisONE Plan 188, they are giving 1GB extra data for the first 6 months.  U Mobile did stir up the competition with its Hero Postpaid plan. Unfortunately, you can only get the Galaxy S7 edge with their Ultimate Device Plan. The plan isn’t as value-for-money compared to Hero Postpaid but you do get a decent device subsidy as the S7 edge is being offered from as low as RM1,799. The upfront payment can be waived if you pay for the device via credit card and opt in for their auto debit billing service. Instead of getting the Galaxy S7 on Ultimate Device Plan 135, we think it is more worth it to buy the Galaxy S7 edge outright and sign on with their P70 Hero Plan. This comes out to RM4,779 (before GST) for a 24-month subscription (RM1,680) and the device (RM3,099). Are you the type that loves to switch phones every year? You might want to consider Maxis’ Zerolution or Celcom’s NewPhone. Both lets you own the device with monthly instalments and the option to swap to a newer phone every 12 months.  
 
 For the phone swap to work, you are required to return your existing device in pristine condition. So to avoid any possible penalties, the device protection program not only gives you a better peace of mind, but also ensures a seamless upgrade when the time comes.  For Maxis, Zerolution lets you pick up a device with no upfront payment plus you have the freedom to opt out from the Zerolution upgrade. For example, if you do plan to keep the device, you can choose not to pay RM30/month for the Zerolution upgrade fee. On the downside, Zerolution is only available on its MaxisONE Plans which is quite costly.  On Celcom’s NewPhone program, you have the flexibility to go with any Celcom postpaid plan of your choice including its affordable FIRST Blue postpaid plan. Unlike Maxis, you’re required to pay an upfront payment according to the plan (e.g. FIRST Blue – RM150, FIRST Gold – RM80). A downside to NewPhone is that they lump the monthly instalment and the “upgrade” fee together. So if you plan to keep your phone, there’s no option to opt out from the upgrade and you have to pay the same monthly instalment across 24 months. Another advantage for Celcom NewPhone is that you can switch phones earlier but there’s an Express NewPhone fee that can go as high as RM1,000.  For the comparison above, we compare based on the assumption that you would make an upgrade after 12 months. Note that for the second year, it all depends on whether you will keep the same phone or switch to a newer device. If you do change to another smartphone, the instalment amount would be different.  Before signing up, we recommend picking a plan that would fulfil your needs. You can study your current bill and data usage to get a better idea of how much you really need each month.  Other factors to consider is the network coverage and quality in your area. Not all networks are built the same and the experience may vary depending on location. If you’re happy with your current provider, it might be a better idea to stick with them.  As usual, if you spot any errors in the tables above, please do let us know in the comments below.",7

Aptly named the 6P, it seems that 2015 was the year of the six-branded smartphone, as the Nexus 6P, together with the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, carved a “holy-trinity” out of the smartphone crop. With these three priced at the top of the food chain as no-nonsense, no-compromise, best-phablets-money-can-buy devices, consumers everywhere were torn. The line separating these three devices were so thin that no matter which device you chose, you would end up with a great phablet nonetheless. But, c’mon, we have to crown a winner. There is only one sport at the top of that podium, and today we fill it. These devices are monsters when it comes to performance. They’re absolutely savage, devouring applications, multitasking, gaming, media consumption and everything else you can throw at it. They are the ultimate devices after all. But, like we said, there can only be one winner so we delve into the depths of multitasking and intense usage to try and find a winner. For a full list of specifications, please refer to our last page where we have a detailed table letting you know all the nitty gritty details of each device. First up is the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. It has Samsung’s Exynos 7420 processor, powering it through daily activities. Multitasking was smooth and it had no problems munching up the slew of applications and games we threw at it. Next, we fired up the iPhone 6s Plus and gave it the beans too. Switching between apps was ridiculously quick and snappy. It did help that iOS’s animations made everything so much more fluid (like what Windows Phone does) and as if it was instantaneous. Some might call it cheating, we call it proper optimisation. Finally came the Nexus 6P. Two words: Stock Android. Fantastic multitasking experience, launching every application we could find and flipping through the multitasking card window as we wondered what application to flip between was lots of fun. It handled the switches like a champ. Android’s multitasking animation easily takes the cake. For gaming, well, is there a word to describe something that is buttery-er than buttery? In conclusion, when it comes to performance and multitasking, the iPhone 6s Plus snags the win by a hair over the Nexus 6P. The gap between the two and the Galaxy S6 edge+ though is a little further than expected. Somehow the home button on the Samsung device had a little delay when exiting applications.",3

The microSD card is an important feature but Samsung decided to go with a hybrid SIM tray which meant users had to choose between two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card. What if we told you that you could have two SIMs   a microSD card slot? No Replied figured out a way to “hack” the hybrid SIM tray in the  , allowing them to use two nano SIMs and one microSD card at the same time. You must be thinking, how on earth do you “hack” hardware? Well, apparently you hack it literally because what No Replied did was chop up the secondary SIM and superglue it to the back of the microSD card. Brilliant right? The steps No Replied too seemed simple enough with the trickiest part, we reckon, to be the removal of the chip from the nano SIM. It involves heat, prying and some luck to safely get your chip out of its plastic body. Once that’s done though, the rest looks pretty simple and the result actually looks pretty slick and elegant.

Or, to keep things simple, you can rent a portable wireless router from Travel Recommends with one of their packages and enjoy unlimited internet connectivity abroad. Travel Recommends has multiple packages covering several countries in Asia, Europe and even the States. From as low as RM15 a day, you can rent a wireless router unit from them for the duration of your trip. Compared to a roaming packing like the   plan, this “Internet rental” is considerably cheaper and covers many more countries. With the MaxisONE World, you would have to pay RM38/day for 500MB of high-speed internet and it will tap into your local quota once you’ve finished the 500MB. If you’ve finished both local and the allocated 500MB quota, your speeds will be throttled. But, the upside is you get unlimited calls and SMS. However, you would have to be a MaxisONE postpaid plan subscriber to take advantage of that plan. With Travel Recommend’s plan, you get unlimited Internet connectivity when travelling. Yep, we checked with Travel Recommends and they told us that it is “truly unlimited”. They didn’t mention what kind of speeds you’ll be getting, though. Simply visit their   at least 5 days before departure, fill in the required fields and choose whether you want to collect/return the unit yourself at KLIA or have a courier deliver it to you within Malaysia. After that, simply make the payment plus an RM200 deposit via bank transfer and you’re good to go. If you’re planning to travel to more than one country during your trip, Travel Recommends also provides package deals that supports coverage in China, Hong Kong, and Macau, as well as an Asia (Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) package. Here is a full list of the countries they support and the rates they charge per day:

Rory Lee,OPPO R9 and R9 Plus — the real selfie expert,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/18/oppo-r9-and-r9-plus-the-real-selfie-expert/,"Android,Malaysia,Oppo,OPPO R9,OPPO R9 Malaysia,OPPO R9 official,OPPO R9 Plus,OPPO R9 Plus Malaysia,OPPO R9 Plus official,oppo smartphone,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-03-18,"By now I’m sure many of you have heard this incredibly catchy (and sometimes annoying)   from OPPO. As often as it gets stuck in your head, it does highlight one important thing — we’re taking more selfies today than we ever have in the past. If you’re a smartphone maker, you’d definitely want to cash in on this — many are — and while OPPO’s recent attempt at a “selfie expert” fell  , their new duo looks much more promising. Kicking things off, the newly announced   and   have front facing cameras that are designed to give you 16 megapixels of selfie goodness. In sheer megapixel count alone, they’re double nearly every other smartphone selfie camera out there. But we all know megapixels aren’t everything and thankfully the R9 duo also packs a fast f/2.0 lens to allow as much light as possible to hit that sensor. They’ve also got OPPO’s improved beautification plus selfie panorama modes which should go down well with selfie enthusiasts. Beyond that, the R9 is a pretty standard midrange device. It’s got all the usual suspects in a mid-level OPPO device with a 5.5-inch full HD AMOLED panel sitting on top of a 2GHz MediaTek Helio P10 processor mated to 4GB of RAM. Keeping everything running is a 2,850 mAh battery. Since it’s a camera-centric device, it does pack more internal storage as users can get 64GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). But it becomes pretty obvious which camera you’re supposed to be using when the “primary” rear-facing shooter is only a 13MP sensor with PDAF and an f/2.2 5-element lens. With the name being the biggest hint, the R9 Plus has a larger 6-inch full HD AMOLED panel on the front. Despite the larger screen, the device does have slightly wider bezels (1.76mm versus the R9’s 1.66mm) but it still has a better screen-to-body ratio of 79.3% (versus the R9’s 77.7%). Inside, OPPO has also upped the specifications to a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB (128GB version to follow) of expandable internal storage. The primary camera unit does make a little more sense here as the R9 Plus packs a 16MP Sony IMX298 sensor with PDAF and an f/2.0 lens. It has a larger 4,120 mAh battery which should give it pretty decent battery life. Design wise, the devices have a pretty sexy look with the near bezel-less screen and thin profile accentuated by nice round edges for better grip. OPPO have also abandoned the rear-facing fingerprint scanner, choosing instead to mount it on the front of the device below the display. While that does make it easier to unlock when it’s on the table, I’m still more of a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor kind of guy. The most unfortunate thing is that the Chinese company’s super-fast Super VOOC flash charge doesn’t make an appearance on the R9 duo. You’ll just have to “settle” for regular VOOC (70% charge in 30 mins), I guess. They do come in two colours though — gold and rose gold. Another bummer is that both smartphones come with colorOS 3.0 that is still built on top of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop (Android N previews are out, OPPO, c’mon) but we certainly hope it gets updated when it leaves China. Unfortunately, there is no information on global availability, but it will hit shelves in China on 12 April with the regular R9 being priced at CNY2,799 (around RM1,755) while the bigger R9 Plus will cost CNY3,299 (around RM2,068). According to OPPO Malaysia, it will be   on our shores sometime next month.",6

The telco is knocking RM200 off the top of the smartphone’s RM3,099 price tag if you are among the first 1,000 customers to sign up for this offer at any Maxis Centre or Maxis Exclusive Partner. But there’s a catch. This promotion is only applicable to those subscribing to the MaxisONE Plan 158 and above. You can still purchase the device on the MaxisONE Plan 98 and 128 but you won’t be eligible for this offer. What’s more, you will only be informed if you’re one of the 1,000 eligible customers for the rebate after 14 working days (that’s nearly three weeks) from the date of purchase. That means, if you’re not one of the first thousand, you will simply have to pay the full price like everyone else. Finally, the rebate isn’t knocked off immediately, its rebated into your bill over four months (RM50x4) and will begin during the second month after you receive the confirmation that you’re eligible. If you are interested in picking up the phone with Maxis, it can be yours for RM114/month (excluding GST) over a two-year period. If you want to upgrade to a new device, you will need to top up an upgrade fee of RM30/month. Since you need to keep the device in good order when you return it, Maxis are also offering an RM23/month device protection program which you can opt into — bringing it to a total of RM167/month excluding your postpaid plan.",7

Just like the previous promo, the Huddle XS MiFi device worth RM480 is bundled free with a 12-month contract. There’s no upfront fee for the device but you’re required to fork out RM100 for registration fee plus RM88 as a one-month advance payment.

Although it was downsized from 16MP to 12MP, the new Galaxy gets a brighter f/1.7 lens, larger pixels and faster focus thanks to its new Dual-Pixel sensor.  DxOMark, the camera benchmark authority has just named the Galaxy S7 edge as the new smartphone champion with an overall score of 88. This knocks out the Xperia Z5, which they previously crowned as the   on a smartphone. In the photo category, it shares the same spot alongside the Galaxy S6 edge and the Xperia Z5 at 88 points. According to DxOMark, the Galaxy S7 edge offers excellent exposure with good dynamic range for both indoor and outdoor shots. Autofocus is one of the S7 biggest traits with fast response and accuracy in bright and low light situations. White balance is said to be accurate without flash but it is noticeably warmer when paired with a tungsten light source.  The video category is where the S7 edge overtakes the Xperia Z5 at 88 points. Video recordings offer good exposure, strong colours and great details. Stabilisation was handled well for minor handheld or walking motion. Of course, video stabilisation on the S7 edge is still no match for Sony’s SteadyShot with Intelligent active mode.

It’s been a long wait, but no doubt Windows fans will rejoice. Software updates are great, but looking at the downward spiral that Windows Phone is heading into, one really has to wonder if it’s too little too late. Following the announcement of the rollout, Microsoft released a list of supported devices, and while there are more than initially expected, it’s still a fairly limited affair — for instance, my   isn’t on the list. Here are a   of devices that can be upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile 10586.164: According to their blog post, Microsoft stated that only these devices were chosen because Windows 10 delivers “significant new innovations” that if applied to older devices might “impact customer experience”. They then continued to say that with this crop of devices, they are confident that they can continue to deliver a good customer experience. Well, good customer experience or not, that remains to be seen, but from what we could tell based on our  , it’s a tough promise to make. Updates are usually fun and if you find your device on that list, you can download the   app from the Windows Store to check if Windows 10 Mobile is available for your device (if you haven’t already received it OTA). Keep in mind that even if your device is on the list, you may not get this update today as there are other variances to account for. Stuff like your region, mobile operator or service provider among other things may factor into a delay on the update. Windows Phone as a platform has faced many problems. Poised to be an OS that should have shaken up the Android-iOS hegemony, it simply tripped over itself before it could even stand with the big boys. Recent news seems to make matters even worse for Microsoft’s operating system as one of the key selling points of the platform, their maps and navigation service HERE Maps, is   for the Windows platform. That’s like if Google Maps left the Android platform. What’s more HERE aren’t the only people stopping support for Windows Phone, even WhatsApp are   their supported devices by killing off support for Windows Phone 7.1. Things aren’t looking that good and we can’t honestly say that  .",4
Alexander Wong,Uber starts accepting cash payments in Johor Bahru,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/19/uber-cash-payments-johor-bahru-malaysia/,"Cash Payment,Johor Bahru,Uber,Uber Cash payment,Uber JB,Uber Malaysia,Uber Malaysia cash payment",Mobile Apps,2016-03-19,", the popular ride-sharing service on demand is testing out cash payments in Johor Bahru. Before this, Uber was running as a cashless service with your rides charged automatically thru credit or debit card. Is this a good move? The beauty of Uber is the ease of getting on and off a ride. There’s no need to worry about small change so you can get from point A to B hassle free.  Prior to this, Uber has started   at selected markets where card payments have limited reach. According to them, there are many potential customers that couldn’t experience Uber as they lack any form of electronic payment. To make clean and safe rides more accessible, they are experimenting cash as an option. This is similar to  , which initially accepts only cash and eventually they have started accept card payments.  Johor Bahru is picked as the first city to roll out cash payments for Uber rides in Malaysia. If this is successful, they could introduce this to other cities in the country. Personally, I feel that automated card payments are the way to go. Not only it provides a seamless experience, but it is also more time efficient as the drivers would not need to make longer stops to look for change.  Furthermore, you won’t want to get into the same taxi experience where the driver runs out of change for your freshly ATM-withdrawn RM100 note. For drivers, this could also pose a risk for carrying more cash at hand and possibly being caught by SPAD or taxi drivers. In terms of electronic payment accessibility, most ATM cards issued by local banks are already debit cards carrying either Mastercard or VISA. The new payment feature is rolling out in stages and customers in JB should be getting the cash option gradually in the coming weeks. To pay by cash, make sure CASH is selected before you request for a ride. When the trip ends, just pay for the amount that’s displayed in the app. Is accepting cash a good move or would you prefer Uber to stay as a cashless system?

Rory Lee,Battle of the edges — S6 edge vs S7 edge vs S6 edge+,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/17/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-vs-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-vs-galaxy-s7-edge-malaysia-comparison/,,,2016-03-17,"Dual-edge displays are a magnificent thing to behold. They look utterly unique and gives everyday smartphone tasks a little pizzaz. It’s hard to put into words what the experience is like, it’s really something you should see for yourself. Sure, you could head to a   store to play with one of the demo units, but from my experience, you fully appreciate the experience only once you start using it as your daily driver. If you’re keen, the only thing left to ask is: Which edge do you get? To date, Samsung has churned out four edge devices — the single edge  , the  , the   and the  . While the Note Edge did get the ball rolling, it didn’t have a dual-edge display and its edge functionality is slightly different from the dual-edge displays we know of today. It’s more of a one-of-a-kind smartphone. If we’re looking at dual-edge smartphones. the choice would then fall to the remaining three — the S6 edge, S6 edge+ and S7 edge — all of which are enticing choices. Logic would dictate that the latest S7 edge is the easy choice, being the latest and most powerful of the trio, but, people might take issue with the 5.5-inch panel on the S7 edge. They might, for instance, prefer the larger 5.7-inch S6 edge+ or even the smaller 5.1-inch S6 edge. But what are the trade-offs? On paper, the S7 edge definitely wins out here as it sports Samsung’s newest top-of-the-line octa-core chip in the Exynos 8890. Paired with 4GB of RAM and Android 6.0 Marshmallow and this device will zip through and remain snappy regardless of what you’re doing with the device. However, it’s not to say the other two are sluggish — Samsung’s 2015 flagships still pack a punch. Throughout our usage of both the S6 edge and S6 edge+, we didn’t encounter any problems with lag or stuttering going through daily tasks. It’s still a powerful device by today’s standards and will likely keep going strong for quite some time. Likely the biggest difference you’d notice is the heat under stress. The S6 edge and S6 edge+ gets noticeably hotter than the S7 edge though not to the extent where it gets uncomfortable. Here’s where the S7 edge nudges ahead of the other two devices too. It’s simply got a better camera, despite the drop in megapixels, as that 12MP Dual Pixel camera is one of the best smartphone snappers in the market right now.",6

Mounted nearly flush to the back of the smartphone’s glass back is Samsung’s brand new 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera with the same fast f/1.7 aperture lens that is easily one of the best smartphone cameras right now. With the new Dual Pixel technology and the fast lens, the Galaxy S7 edge promises up to 95% brighter photos as well as an uber fast focusing speed.

One of the world’s most valuable companies, the pioneer of the smartphone as we know and love today, as well as a company who dares to try some truly interesting things with their devices (removing the CD drive on computers, and potentially the   on the next iPhone). Now, I’ve been called many things in the past, “Apple basher” being one of them, and much of that is because I don’t agree with many of the things the Cupertino company does. But, there has always been one thing I like that Apple gets so right — their ads. Debuting their latest piece showcasing the “Hey Siri” hands-free functionality on the iPhone 6s, Apple enlisted the help of Sesame Street’s favourite cookie-loving monster. It probably isn’t the best representation of Siri’s accuracy considering how it often struggles with strong accents (no offence Cookie, but you’ve got a pretty strong accent too), but it does leave you with a warm feeling and a smile on your face. I don’t know about you, but it’s ads that evoke this feeling that I remember best. Now I’m not one to buy something because I saw what it could do in an ad, but I know there are many who do that. Ads are really powerful and more and more companies are realising that the best ads aren’t really ads at all — they represent something special or human. Apple does this by adding a touch of humour and wit. It’s subtle and smart, and that makes all the difference. It humanises the ad. Nobody gets it right the first time, not even Apple. Just look at their old ads for the older iPhones. What they mostly did was boast about the features and it wasn’t until the iPhone 6/6 Plus commercial about Health that I started to see them get it right. They’ve almost perfected this aspect of ad-making and it’s truly awesome to see. It’s almost magical how Apple can take some of the most mundane and gimmicky smartphone features, build an ad around them, and make the audience feel like they   have it on their smartphone right now. I can tell you that the next iPhone will have killer specifications and some kick-ass features, but in all honesty, the thing I’m looking forward to the most are its ads. Not the launch one because that will probably be pompous if the   is going to be a trend, but the ones that come after. The ones like this 3D Touch ad that I absolutely love.",7

If you opt for the P70 Hero Postpaid (RM135-RM70=RM65 savings each month), that comes up to RM1,560 saved across 24 months, and you’ll get unlimited calls and more data. So probably it is more worthwhile to get the S7 edge outright (RM3,099) as the amount you save from monthly subscription can “subsidise” the device down to RM1,539, which is cheaper than RM1,799 on Ultimate Device 135 plan. Furthermore, U Mobile is offering   for the next 3.5 months on Hero Postpaid which is hard to beat.",7

Although you gain freedom in usage without having to worry about running out of credits, there is a chance that when your bill arrives at the end of the month, you will be paying more than you’d expect. In the past, one of the biggest worries when switching to a postpaid plan was bill shock — the possibility of paying for something you thought you’d never use. Some horror stories have users rack up thousands of ringgit because of accidental data usage and roaming on the wrong network. To combat that,   implemented a Pay-Per-Use format where it charged users who were using data on their smartphone without a data plan. This format charged users RM10 for every block of 50MB data that they would use up to a cap of RM50/month which works out to 250MB/month. After 250MB, users could continue surfing without any extra charge but at a throttled speed. However, on 14 January 2016, they quietly revised their Pay-Per-Use conditions to increase it to 10 blocks, meaning charges now cap at RM100/month — double the previous threshold. Maxis says that this is to improve user browsing experience, and that’s true to a certain extent since users get to use up to 500MB of unrestricted speeds, but that also means users would have to pay more per month if their usage exceeds 250MB. If you’d like to find out more about this, you can head on over to their  , or view your Pay-Per-Use stats via the MyMaxis App ( / ). That said, it is a little silly to use your smartphone data these days without subscribing to an actual data plan. That means this Pay-Per-Use plan acts more like a safety net for those without a plan who accidentally turn on their data than someone who actually wants to surf. Since this is the case, I’d think that a lower cap would benefit users more since they would ultimately be paying less. What do you guys think?",7

While the other internals like the RAM and storage remains the same, these two chips are quite different. The question then became: is one faster than the other? Well, according to this speed test video, the Exynos 8890 (White) unit is just a touch faster than the Snapdragon 820 (Gold) variant. It launches apps and returns to the home screen just a little bit faster than the SD820 unit, but not so much that it might be terribly noticeable in real world usage. For benchmarks, the Exynos 8890 unit also performs slightly better in the overall score. However, the breakdown does reveal that it falls behind quite significantly in terms of 3D GPU performance. This falls somewhat in line with a test ran earlier by   where they pitted both devices against each other in a series of benchmarks. In PhoneArena’s test, the Snapdragon variant scored a higher average in both the overall AnTuTu benchmark as well as in the GPU-specific tests. However, the Exynos chip edged it out when it came to browsing benchmarks. It is worth noting that they ran the test on a Galaxy S7, not an S7 edge, but the end result should be fairly representative of the larger edge model as well. You can view their findings in the table below: From their tests, they concluded that the performance difference is nearly negligible as they are very comparable systems. Comparable in performance, perhaps, but what about things like battery life? Our   (Galaxy S7 edge) on moderate usage pulled out a measly 3 hours and 40 minutes of screen-on time, giving us about 17 and a half hours of time on battery. It’s a pretty big difference if you compare it to   (Snapdragon 820) which gave him close to 6 hours of screen-on time with a day and a half on battery with moderate usage. Of course, that could be down to a number of reasons as well as what he deems moderate usage, but it beggars belief that he could pull out nearly double the SOT on similar usage.

There is currently no information on the internal storage but judging by the processor and RAM alone, the device is looking like a worthy challenger. The only drawback, it seems, would be the 1280×720 pixel display said to adorn the front of the smartphone. But, since it’s less than 5 inches, the pixel density should still be relatively high. What’s more, the S7 mini is said to sport a 12-megapixel primary camera packed into a smartphone package that is only 9.9mm thin. Based on the megapixel count, it looks like it could be the same Dual Pixel sensor found on the regular   and   that we  . It’s not entirely surprising if Samsung does come up with a mini variant as they’ve done so in the past. One of the biggest problems with old the Galaxy S mini variants was that they always came with watered down specs. That’s kind of a bummer especially since they bore the Galaxy S flagship badge. The one company that really gets the “compact” or “mini” flagship variants right has been Sony, who packed the same flagship components into a smaller form factor. If these rumours prove true, that could mean Samsung are finally picking up on this trend. But, this also means it becomes a direct competitor for Sony’s   too. But, we don’t think that’s too fair of a comparison if we’re going off these rumoured specs as the S7 mini simply blows the Xperia Z5 Compact out of the water. The real battle royale would be with the iPhone and with the S7 mini’s price likely to be lower, this could prove to be an interesting fight. This is of course if these rumours prove true, which we can’t know for certain right now, so do take what we say here with a grain of salt.",6

If you think about it, it is like having a bunch of guys boasting about their own manhood. Everyone claims to have the longest but nobody can actually verify it.  According to OpenSignal’s latest data updated on 11 March 2016, Digi currently has the widest coverage in Malaysia. So looks like it’s a win for team yellow as it claims to currently cover   with 4G LTE.  But is this really true? When you view the  , you should see a map which plots the coverage areas of the telcos around you. To get a nationwide sample, you can key in Malaysia from the search bar.  
 If you enable all 2G, 3G and 4G, Digi is ranked #1, followed by U Mobile, Maxis and Celcom. If you look at speed alone, U Mobile does seem to offer the fastest speeds here which goes in line with its “ ” title from Speedtest.net. 
 You probably thought Celcom would have the widest 2G network in the country but it isn’t, according to OpenSignal. When we toggle the map to 2G only, U Mobile suddenly ranks #1 while Maxis takes last position at #4. The funny thing is that U Mobile doesn’t even own a 2G network. For areas that are out of U Mobile’s coverage, it relies on Maxis 2G and 3G networks as part of their RAN sharing agreement.  
 For 4G only, Digi is ranked first, followed by Celcom then U Mobile and Maxis. U Mobile which doesn’t even cover East Malaysia is ranked higher than Maxis for coverage. Very odd indeed.  So what does this tell us? Looking at the above, it seems that OpenSignal may not be entirely accurate for Malaysia at the time being. It collects mobile quality data from their OpenSignal app that’s available for   and  . Even OpenSignal themselves urge you to install the app in order to improve the maps. Think about how many Malaysians have installed the app? Most of you would have use Speedtest.net instead. When OpenSignal published its   report, it was derived from a sample size of 325,221 users. Out of those numbers, we won’t know how many of them are from Malaysia.  Having crowd source data is good but the report is only going to be as good as the sample size itself. So if you want to contribute to better stats on network quality, perhaps it is time to give OpenSignal a try. This could work if OpenSignal becomes as popular as crowdsourcing GPS app Waze in Malaysia.

While the actual launch date is still up in the air, here’s a clearer leak of the HTC 10.  As seen on the earlier renders, the front gets a  -like design that has a fingerprint scanner underneath the screen. Interestingly there are capacitive buttons for Back and Recent app accompanying the home button, which we think is a good move. The current HTC smartphones including the HTC One A9 and One M9+ use purely on-screen buttons along with its fingerprint scanner. Of course, some would definitely point out that this is starting to look a lot like a Samsung Galaxy smartphone.  Surrounding the device is a metal frame that’s visible from the front, which is somewhat similar to the Nexus 6P. The back of the device is where the HTC 10 stands out. It gets a curve back with a polished chamfered edge. If we take a look at the camera module, it seems to protrude a bit, while next to it appears to be a dual-tone LED flash and possibly a laser AutoFocus light. According to @evleaks, the HTC 10 will come in 4 colour options – namely carbon gray, glacier silver (with either black or white coloured front) and topaz gold.  There’s still no mention of an official launch but it could be after the Galaxy S7 fever starts to fizzle out. Huawei will be   its P9 flagship next month on 6 April.",6

Rory Lee,Sony’s Concept N headphones are the Google Glass for your ears,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/14/sonys-concept-n-headphones-are-the-google-glass-for-your-ears/,"Concept N,open ear earphones,Sony,Sony Concept N,Sony Concept N earphones,Sony earphones,Sony headphones,Sony Xperia Ear,SXSW,Xperia Ear","Mobile Accessories,Sony",2016-03-14,"Sony’s   at the   in Barcelona represented a shift in focus when it came to the development of mobile devices, bringing out several concepts that go beyond simply augmenting a smartphone. At SXSW (South by Southwest) they pulled back the covers of yet another futuristic device that falls in line with the experience Sony are promoting with their hands-free   device — the Concept N headphones. Concept N is the child of Sony’s R&D arm Future Lab initiative — an arm tasked with showing off early prototypes of products and gathering feedback. On the surface, the N doesn’t look all too different or radical when compared to existing headphones from other manufacturers, but it does have a trick or two up its sleeve. The first thing you’ll notice is that they’re not connected to your ear and are designed to be worn around your neck. So how do you listen to music then? The N has a set of cleverly placed speakers designed to play music to your ears in a limited range around your head so you can also listen to your surroundings and have a proper conversation. We suspect that this wouldn’t be too great for sound quality if you’re mixing in a noisy background, but the folks at The Verge and Engadget seem pretty impressed with it. If you want a more quiet experience, though, Sony has a pair of “open-ear earphones” that go along with the N, letting you clip them on your ear for what we suspect would be a more private listening experience. Since these V-shaped earphones are open-ear though, you can still listen to your surroundings while your favourite track is on. The drivers are mounted at one end of the V, feeding audio to the other end of the V that goes in your ear, resulting in a slick minimalist design. That’s not all, Sony’s Concept N has a bunch of, although very limited, augmented-reality-esque features too — though not in the generic visual AR sense. Instead, the N responds to voice commands and can tell you useful stuff like the weather, local news updates and local restaurant information all with a simple trigger phrase “Listen up Arc!” before your command. What’s most impressive is that you can tell it to take a photo too. Once the command is inputted (or shouted, depending on how loud your surroundings are), the otherwise hidden camera mounted on the right edge of the neckband opens up and takes a photo before disappearing again. It eliminates one of the Google Glass’ biggest flaws when it comes to a wearable camera — people don’t feel like you’re always taking a photo/video of them. It’s an interesting device in the way it functions and brings aural AR into our lives giving me a very distinct   vibe. Sony has always been one of the great pioneers of audio technology and it’s great to see them pull out something seriously cool. What do you think of the Concept N? Let us know in the comments below.",2

Rory Lee,Unboxing the “perfect” smartphone — the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-malaysia-unboxing/,"2016 flagship,Android,first impressions,Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Malaysia,smartphone,Unboxing","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-11,"‘s greatest flagship device ever — the   — was a long-awaited affair. When we first saw it at MWC 2016, we couldn’t wait to get our hands on the device. Well, after a long (it wasn’t that long, but it felt long) wait, it finally came…and I pounced on it. The unboxing experience was reasonable. Samsung was never one to have elaborate unboxing experiences for their flagships, often defaulting to a generic small box you could fit in a clutch. This one was a little different, though. In terms of dimensions, the box is pretty much the same size as last year’s flagship boxes but this time instead of pulling the lid off, you unwrapped the lip of the box and watch as it rolls out to reveal the phone tucked neatly in its tray. Underneath is business as usual where you have a box with the SIM tool and the relevant paperwork separating the phone tray and the accessories that come with it. Speaking of the accessories, the Galaxy S7 doesn’t come with a whole lot of kit compared to something like the Huawei Mate 8. It’s got a pair of in-ear headphones set in a tinted box, a charging cable, a power brick and a USB OTG adapter. The power brick is Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging brick that supports two voltages with different amps — either 9V, 1.67A or 5V, 2.0A. Setting up the device was the usual affair but the included USB OTG adapter does let you access a nifty Samsung feature: Smart Switch. Or at least it should, but for some reason, the Galaxy S7 edge didn’t recognise the HTC One A9 I was copying information over from. Instead, it repeatedly reminded me that the connected smartphone needed to be “Android 4.3 and above” which is weird because the One A9 is already on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. If you’re unfamiliar with Smart Switch, it’s basically an application that lets you copy your files — apps, contacts, data, etc — over from your existing device to your new Galaxy smartphone, or in this case, the Galaxy S7 edge. Despite the fact that we couldn’t transfer the files via cable, Smart Switch supports wireless transfer as well. Odd. Simply install the app on your old device (for a list of compatible platforms head on over  ) and choose the stuff you want to transfer, then hit send. It will take awhile depending on how much information you want to transfer. Though it did take only about 10 minutes to copy files over wirelessly, we reckon a wired transfer should be faster. My first impressions of the device? It feels awesome for a glass-backed device. The rounded back really helps with grip and somehow Samsung has made the glass and metal seam even more flush than before. The camera feels excellent and focuses almost as quickly as my eye can, plus the overall performance of the device is just really, really snappy. Is it the perfect smartphone? I guess you’ll have to wait for our full review to find out. If you’d like to see more unboxing and device photos, be sure to check out our   on Facebook.",9

With the current generation of touch-enabled and wireless devices, many teenagers wouldn’t know how it’s like to go online back in the days.

Our current smartphones today have better specs than that. Unlike the current PCs with Windows 8 or Windows 10, starting up a computer back then can really take a long time. Before there was fibre or ADSL, most people rely on the good old dial-up modem.

With the onset of taxes, removal of subsidies and instability of workforce management, stretching your dollar is just not the same anymore, especially when you desire the little pleasures in life like a new car or a well deserved holiday.  And sure, there is a variety of second or part-time jobs out there to help you attain them easily, but let’s face it! Having a second or part-time job requires a certain type of dedication and commitment that perhaps not many are in the position to do so for various reasons such as inflexibility of the current or part-time jobs.   But this is where Grab plays a role.  Not just poised to providing a safer and alternative option of transport, GrabCar, which is available on the Grab App (formerly known as MyTeksi), offers a flexible and viable option for those who want to earn some serious money without minimal time commitment, something which other ride-sharing app platforms just cannot provide. So how does it work, you may ask…Pretty easy actually.  
 With the updated Grab incentive, the focus is not on the hours behind the wheel, but on how many jobs are completed. For example, on normal weekdays (Mon – Thurs) you only need to accept one job while on the way to work and two after. With the minimum fare of RM7 per job, you will already hit tier 4 target and receive a bonus incentive which rounds each job to RM16, making your daily earnings RM48.  Next, on weekends (Fri – Sun), you accept five to six jobs a day with the same minimum fare of RM7 and with each job rounded up to RM16, your daily earning is between RM90 to RM96.  
 Yes, we are aware you have limited spare time but with just 14 hours a week (that’s as low as 2 hours a day!) you can take home a minimum of RM1,792 guaranteed gross income per month.* But what can you possibly do with RM1,792?

Alexander Wong,The Samsung Galaxy S7 is harder to repair than the S6,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/10/the-samsung-galaxy-s7-is-harder-to-repair-than-the-s6/,"Android,ifixit,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge repair,Samsung Galaxy S7 repair,Samsung Galaxy S7 teardown,smartphone,teardown","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-10,"The   improves in almost every area compared to the  . It gets a bigger battery, support microSD expansion, better camera and dust/water resistance as well. To find out what makes it tick on the inside, ifixit has teardown a unit for your viewing pleasure.  While physically it looks similar to the previous version, the new Galaxy S7 is actually harder to repair with a repairability score of just 3/10. As comparison, the Galaxy S6   4/10, while the S6 edge   just 3/10.  The Galaxy S7 like its former model use glass for front and back. There are no screws so you’ll need to remove the back panel that’s secured with glue. The internals are easily replaceable with its modular components including the battery, cameras and the headphone jack. With Galaxy S7 having IP68 water resistance, it has rubber linings to keep water out from its internals.   For longer gameplay without overheating, they have also taken a closer look at the S7’s liquid cooling. The thin copper strip is less than a milimetre thick and weighs less than half a gram. In another video, cutting this copper strip reveals   inside, but it does dissipate heat to its outer frame.  Overall, ifixit found the S7 to be a tougher device to fix. Despite its modular components, the display needs to be removed if you need to replace the microUSB port. Since it uses glass for both sides, it is more prone to cracks if you were to drop the device. Another challenge is that it’s almost impossible to replace the front glass without destroying the actual display.  While the device looks good, we suggest that you invest in a case or take up a device protection program that covers damages and theft. Since we are getting only the   in Malaysia, we can only assume that it could be harder to repair than this.",4

With regards to the name, it is surprising that HTC had dropped the “One” monicker that’s usually associated with its flagship line up.

In terms of audio, it doesn’t seem to have a pair of front facing speakers, opting for a traditional down firing speaker grill like the current One A9. There is however, a   under settings but this is likely to be an audio enhancement rather than an actual stereo speaker.  As confirmed by the image above, it uses USB Type-C that’s reversible. Under the hood, the HTC 10 is said to be running on a Snapdragon 820 processor with probably 4GB of RAM. Preliminary   have shown 109K on Antutu which is lower than the similar-spec   142K score.
